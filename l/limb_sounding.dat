40|$|This work {{deals with}} an {{innovative}} implementation of tomographic techniques {{for the three}} dimensional reconstruction of water vapour in atmosphere. Observables for this technique are Slant Wet Delay measurements collected from small networks of GPS receivers. This work uses simulated data. Slant Wet Delays were computed considering climatological atmospheric models plus Gaussian noise. A final reconstruction of a 4 x 4 x 10 voxels grid characterizing a tropospheric volume with about 1 km vertical and 6 km horizontal resolution has been considered. A maximum fractional error on wet refractivity varying from - 2 % to 6 % has been computed. The same technique has also been applied to GPS observables simulated using radio soundings data.

40|$|Trace {{gases in}} the upper {{atmosphere}} can be measured by comparing spectral noise content of <b>limb</b> <b>soundings</b> with the spectral noise content of cold space. An offset Cassegrain antenna system and tiltable input mirror alternately {{look out at the}} limb and up at cold space at an elevation angle of about 22. The mirror can also be tilted to look at a black body calibration target. Reflection from the mirror is directed into a radiometer whose head functions as a diplexer to combine the input radiation and a local ocillator (klystron) beam. The radiometer head is comprised of a Fabry-Perot resonator consisting of two Fabry-Perot cavities spaced a number of half wavelengths apart. Incoming radiation received on one side is reflected and rotated 90 deg in polarization by the resonator so that it will be reflected by an input grid into a mixer, while the klystron beam received on the other side is also reflected and rotated 90 deg, but not without passing some energy to be reflected by the input grid into the mixer...|$|R
40|$|Global {{gravity wave}} (GW) {{distributions}} are retrieved from infrared emission <b>limb</b> <b>soundings</b> {{taken by the}} CRISTA instrument in August 1997 and by the SABER instrument in August 2003. The investigated altitudes cover the whole middle atmosphere from the tropopause to the mesopause. The data agree semi-quantitatively in their salient features and only small deviations due to the different meteorological conditions {{in the two years}} are observed. Of particular interest is the decrease of GW activity {{at the top of the}} southern polar vortex and an accompanying shift of GW activity towards the subtropics in the mesosphere. We emulate this feature by two conceptionally different models, the Warner and McIntyre spectral parameterization scheme and the GROGRAT GW ray tracer. Both models indicate that saturation limits and GW breaking are the governing processes in creating this structure. Also, both models can well reproduce the global distributions except for two important points: (1) convectively generated GWs in the northern subtropics are largely underestimated; (2) northern hemisphere high latitude activity is grossly overestimated. These points indicate that GW distribution in general circulation models are not fully realistic. Refined measurements are required to constrain more realistic GW source distributions.

40|$|Abstract. Airborne {{observations}} {{of greenhouse gases}} are a very useful reference for validation of satellite-based column-averaged dry air mole fraction data. However, since the aircraft data are available only up to about 9 – 13  km altitude, these profiles do not fully represent {{the depth of the}} atmosphere observed by satellites and therefore need to be extended synthetically into the stratosphere. In the near future, {{observations of}} CO 2 and CH 4 made from passenger aircraft are expected to be available through the In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) project. In this study, we analyse three different data sources that are available for the stratospheric extension of aircraft profiles by comparing the error introduced by each of them into the total column and provide recommendations regarding the best approach. First, we analyse CH 4 fields from two different models of atmospheric composition – the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System for Composition (C-IFS) and the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3 -D chemical transport model. Secondly, we consider scenarios that simulate the effect of using CH 4 climatologies such as those based on balloons or satellite <b>limb</b> <b>soundings.</b> Thirdly, we assess the impact of using a priori profiles used in the satellite retrievals for the stratospheric part of the total column. We find that the models considered in this study have a better estimation of the stratospheric CH 4 as compared to the climatology-based data and the satellite a priori profiles. Both the C-IFS and TOMCAT models have a bias of about − 9  ppb at the locations where tropospheric vertical profiles will be measured by IAGOS. The C-IFS model, however, has a lower random error (6. 5  ppb) than TOMCAT (12. 8  ppb). These values are well within the minimum desired accuracy and precision of satellite total column XCH 4 retrievals (10 and 34  ppb, respectively). In comparison, the a priori profile from the University of Leicester Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Proxy XCH 4 retrieval and climatology-based data introduce larger random errors in the total column, being limited in spatial coverage and temporal variability. Furthermore, we find that the bias in the models varies with latitude and season. Therefore, applying appropriate bias correction to the model fields before using them for profile extension is expected to further decrease the error contributed by the stratospheric part of the profile to the total column...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a climatology of the mesospheric sodium layer built from {{the processing of}} 7 years of GOMOS data. With respect to preliminary results already published for the year 2003, a more careful analysis {{was applied to the}} averaging of occultations inside the climatological bins (10 ° in latitude- 1 month). Also, the slant path absorption lines of the Na doublet around 589 nm shows evidence of partial saturation that was responsible for an underestimation of the Na concentration in our previous results. The sodium climatology has been validated with respect to the Fort Collins lidar measurements and, to a lesser extent, to the OSIRIS 2003 - 2004 data. Despite the important natural sodium variability, we have shown that the Na vertical column has a marked semi-annual oscillation at low latitudes that merges into an annual oscillation in the polar regions, a spatial distribution pattern that was unreported so far. The sodium layer seems to be clearly influenced by the mesospheric global circulation and the altitude of the layer shows clear signs of subsidence during polar winter. The climatology has been parameterized by time-latitude robust fits to allow for easy use. Taking into account the non-linearity of the transmittance due to partial saturation, an experimental approach is proposed to derive mesospheric temperatures from <b>limb</b> remote <b>sounding</b> measurements...|$|R

The experiment is housed in a Hitchhiker (HH/GAS) canister with canister extension ring and equipped with a Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly (HMDA). Instrumentation includes an Ultraviolet (UV) spectrograph with a CCD array detector, CCD array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics and baffling. Once on orbit a crew member will active SOLSE which will perform limb and Earth viewing observations. Limb observations focuses on the region 20 km to 50 km altitude above the horizon for the Earth's surface. Earth viewing observations will enable SOLSE to correlate the data with other nadir viewing, ozone instruments.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the potential to retrieve atmospheric constituent distributions and instrumental pointing from <b>limb</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements in millimeter and sub-millimeter spectral ranges. The retrieval process is performed with the optimal estimation method (OEM) which incorporates the a priori knowledge independent of the measurement. Emphasis is put on the retrieval of the atmospheric temperature profile and instrument pointing correction. The standard approach for microwave <b>limb</b> <b>sounding</b> instruments is to derive information on the atmospheric temperature and pointing correction from oxygen emission lines. Nevertheless, other emissions, e. g.,ozone emissions, can also deliver accurate temperature and instrumental pointing information. To demonstrate that, a rigorous error analysis, including both statistical and model parameters error, is carried out. The MASTER instrument, studied by the European Space Agency, {{is used as a}} realistic example for a state-of-the-art <b>limb</b> <b>sounding</b> instrument.

40|$|The TELIS (TErahertz and {{submillimeter}} LImb Sounder) {{instrument is}} a new stratospheric balloon-borne cryogenic heterodyne spectrometer developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{in cooperation with the}} Netherlands Institute for Space (SRON), and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the United Kingdom. It allows <b>limb</b> <b>sounding</b> of the Earth's atmosphere within the far infrared (FIR) and microwave spectral range. The ambitious spectral coverage of the TELIS instrument is accomplished by use of three frequency channels: 500 GHz, 480 - 650 GHz, 1. 8 THz for RAL, SRON and DLR, respectively. TELIS utilizes state-of-the-art superconducting heterodyne technology and is capable of providing broad spectral coverage, high spectral resolution and extensive flight duration. These features enable us to monitor the diurnal variation of key stratospheric constituents associated with ozone depletion and climate change. The instrument was mounted on a balloon gondola together with the MIPAS-B (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding - Balloon) instrument, developed by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. The combination of TELIS and MIPAS-B covers a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum that is used for atmospheric research and offers great synergies for cross-validating of measured vertical distributions of trace gas species. In addition, TELIS acts as a technology demonstrator to future spaceborne FIR/microwave <b>limb</b> <b>sounding</b> instruments planned by the European Space Agency (ESA). The development of FIR/microwave <b>limb</b> <b>sounding</b> techniques contributes to an increased demand in high resolution radiative transfer modelling and efficient inversion strategy for better understanding of atmospheric environment.

On a 4 th comparison date, there was substantial overlap away from the vortex edge, although for some species the aircraft data show considerable variability near the coincidence point. On the 5 th comparison date, the ER- 2 had no overlap in altitude with the lowest HALOE observations; however, a short linear interpolation over about 1 km altitude results in smooth composite profiles. Generally speaking the agreement between HALOE and the ER- 2 at overlap altitudes is about 12 percent in the case of water vapor, which shows low horizontal and vertical variability.

40|$|Microwave <b>limb</b> <b>sounding</b> in the {{presence}} of ice clouds was studied by detailed simulations, where clouds and other atmospheric variables varied in three dimensions and the full polarisation state was considered. Scattering particles were assumed to be horizontally aligned oblate spheroids with a size distribution parameterized in terms of temperature and ice water content. A general finding was that particle absorption is significant for <b>limb</b> <b>sounding,</b> which is in contrast to the down-looking case, where it is usually insignificant. Another general finding was that single scattering can be assumed for cloud optical paths below about 0. 1, which is thus an important threshold with respect to the complexity and accuracy of retrieval algorithms. The representation of particle sizes during the retrieval is also discussed. Concerning polarisation, specific findings were as follows: Firstly, no significant degree of circular polarisation was found for the considered particle type. Secondly, for the +/- 45 degrees polarisation components, differences of up to 4 K in brightness temperature were found, but differences were much smaller when single scattering conditions applied. Thirdly, the vertically polarised component has the smallest cloud extinction.
