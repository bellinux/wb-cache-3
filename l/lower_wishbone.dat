25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Mk1, and its Indy sister design the Mk2, closely {{followed}} the 38, with a riveted aluminium monocoque central section, carrying an unstressed engine mounted behind the driver. The lines of the chassis were remarkably clean and elegant, and the car sported a distinctively beaked radiator opening at the front. Suspension components were mounted directly on to this monocoque, and consisted of a comparatively conservative <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> and single top link for each wheel which {{also served as a}} rocker for the inboard-mounted spring/damper package. The Mk1 was designed around the forthcoming Aubrey Woods-designed Weslake V12 engine while the Mk2, essentially the same chassis design, was designed to accept the quad-cam Ford V8 that had powered the previous year's Indy 500 winner (Jim Clark, in the Terry-designed Lotus 38).|$|E
500|$|As the Lotus 72 {{was not as}} {{effective}} as the team hoped, it was returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in Monaco. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer Herbie Blash called [...] "the race of his life". From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw bales, allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the Belgian Grand Prix, a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them. He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone,</b> forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.|$|E

500|$|Against {{the trend}} {{set by the}} Lotus 21 in 1961, the BT19's suspension, which {{controls}} the relative motion of the chassis and the wheels, is outboard all round. That is, the bulky springs and dampers are mounted {{in the space between}} the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic drag. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s, which indicated that a more complicated inboard design, with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork, would provide only a 2% improvement in drag. He judged the extra time needed to set up an inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh this small improvement. At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel double wishbones. The front uprights, the solid components upon which the wheels and brakes are mounted, were modified from the Alford & Alder units used on the British Triumph Herald saloon. The rear suspension is formed by a single top link, a reversed <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> and two radius rods locating cast magnesium alloy uprights. Wheels were initially 13inches (330mm) in diameter, but soon upgraded to [...] at the rear, and later still 15in at the front as well. These increases enabled the use of larger, more powerful brakes. Steel disc brakes are used on all four wheels and were of [...] diameter for the smaller wheels and [...] for the larger ones. The car ran on treaded Goodyear tyres throughout its racing career.|$|E
50|$|Most {{control arms}} form the lower link of a suspension. A few designs {{use them as}} the upper link, usually with a <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone.</b> The {{additional}} radius rod is then attached to the upper arm.|$|E

50|$|The front {{suspension}} utilises {{a fairly}} conventional set-up that comprises MacPherson struts, offset coil springs, <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> and an anti-roll bar.|$|R
5000|$|The front {{suspension}} comprised double wishbones and {{coil springs}} {{attached to a}} front axle crossmember. An anti-roll bar linked the two <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones.</b> [...] A similar arrangement was later used on the Vauxhall Viva.|$|R
5000|$|The IFS 100-series {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for front suspension failures in operating conditions where the front suspension was prone to hitting the bump stops. Several companies produce strengthened <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> to prevent cracks from developing.|$|R
50|$|The Chapman strut also {{appeared}} on the Lotus Sixteen of 1958. In 1959 this design was revised to use a <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone.</b> This in turn required {{a return to a}} sliding joint in the drive shaft.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 on X300 models, the {{attachment}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> to the hub carrier {{was changed to}} use a bolt with eccentric head, enabling the rear toe-in adjustment that was not possible before without bending the arms.|$|E
50|$|The fixed-length {{driveshaft}} as {{the upper}} suspension link remained, but the <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> became a fabricated steel box section {{with a much}} wider base. Putting {{the front and rear}} pivots of the wishbones so far apart meant that the radius arms could be (and were) eliminated.|$|E
25|$|The Medallion {{featured}} four-wheel {{independent suspension}} with MacPherson struts {{in the front}} with negative offset for stability and inclined <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> for anti-dive effect, while the rear suspension is controlled by a V-section cross-member with four transverse torsion bars and inclined shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|In {{place of}} the usual rear solid axle, there is {{independent}} suspension from <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones,</b> the original trailing arms, an upper strut and an anti-roll bar. At the front a radius rod on each side {{was added to the}} standard double wishbones.|$|R

50|$|At the , Ferrari {{introduced}} the blown diffuser, a concept first {{introduced by the}} Red Bull Racing team. Ferrari repositioned the exhaust between the rear upper and lower wishbones, beefed up the bodywork and rear upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> assemblies to handle the temperatures and repositioned the rear brake ducts.|$|E
5000|$|Norman’s last bike {{conversion}} was a [...] Triumph Trident 900 in 1994, {{commissioned by}} Formula 1 entrepreneur Keith Duckworth. This {{proved to be}} an ideal application, as the cylinder heads of the triple offered an ideal mounting point for the <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone.</b> The conversion worked well but never went further than that one prototype.|$|E
50|$|The chassis was a spaceframe, {{clothed in}} {{fibreglass}} bodywork. It had front double wishbone suspension, but the rear had a <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> with the driveshaft being fixed length and therefore {{used as a}} top link. Originally fitted with Alfin drum brakes at all four corners, it was soon upgraded to discs in front and inboard drums at the rear. Equipped as standard with the Cosworth Mk.IV engine and with either a Renault Dauphine gearbox or Hewland-modified VW box.|$|E
50|$|The Europa's four-wheel {{independent}} suspension was also typical Chapman thinking. The front used lightweight pressed steel upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> with a clever coil-over spring-damper arrangement, all {{connected to the}} wheels using off-the-shelf front uprights, ball joints and trunnions.The steering gear was solid-mounted rack and pinion using Truimph Herald components.|$|R
50|$|The 2006 {{specification}} GP2 Car {{has been}} designed by Dallara Automobili. The 2006 GP2 car features a biplane rear wing, with the triplane rear wing used in 2005 only to be used at the Monaco race. The front upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> have been reinforced, as have {{the front and rear}} suspension uprights.|$|R
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} use of 4.40 x 10 tires all around and an {{increase}} in front track from [...] to , the front suspension and steering were the same as that on the KR200. The rear suspension was fully independent, with universal joints at both ends of each halfshaft, located by <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> and coil springs with concentrically mounted shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|The tie-rod end, front top {{and bottom}} {{wishbone}} outside joints and the rear <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> inside joint were Heim joints. The rest of the suspension joints were rubber joint, with joint-mounting pipes welded onto the ends of suspension arms. While most of the suspension arms were in common with Lotus 22, {{the angle of the}} rear radius arms on the plan view was different from the narrower-frame Lotus 22, so they were not interchangeable with the 22.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was by {{double wishbone}} arms with outboard coil/damper unit. Unlike Chapman's former designs where {{the ends of}} anti-roll bar acted as a leg of the upper wishbone, the 18 had a separate front anti-roll bar. The rear suspension was by upper and lower radius arms with reversed <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone,</b> where the fixed-length halfshaft acted as the upper link. The coil/damper unit was also mounted outboard in the rear, and the 18 sometimes ran with and without the rear anti-roll bar.|$|E
5000|$|Fibreglass, Kevlar, {{and other}} {{composites}} make the body shell, fitted to a backbone chassis. The suspension is true Formula 1 and IndyCar technology with independent upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> with pushrod {{front and rear}} end suspension. The Guarà {{is known for its}} highly agile handling which makes it a bit too [...] "nervous" [...] for the average driver. The Guarà has no luggage space at all, the area under the front being taken up by the racing-style suspension. The large, distinct rims are by Marchesini.|$|E
50|$|As the Essex {{engine was}} shorter, it was mounted further {{back in the}} {{bulkhead}} to help improve weight distribution. The <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> were re-positioned, the tower structures and cross members were reinforced and an anti-roll bar was fitted. Other modifications included replacing the wire wheels with wider steel wheels as standard, and the fitting of a higher-ratio rear axle (3.58:1 instead of 3.875:1).|$|R
50|$|Although {{based on}} the {{two-seater}} vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear track dimensions. Suspension systems are fully-independent all-round, comprising unequal-length upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones,</b> coil-over damper units and anti-roll bars {{at each end of}} the vehicle. Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of ride-stiffness adjustment.|$|R
50|$|The {{successful}} mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 {{no longer}} had the high bodywork behind the driver's seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a wishbone rear suspension with wide-based tube <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> carrying coilover shocks. The upper wishbones though were, once again {{in the style of the}} Chapman strut, using the driveshafts themselves and a front radius rod. This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the driveshafts as an upper control arm.|$|R
50|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E
50|$|The only F1 chassis Shannon Racing Cars made had steel {{monocoque}} frame, {{upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone</b> front suspension with outboard brake and anti-roll bar. It {{was a very}} compact design with upper I arm and lower reversed A arm with upper and lower radius arms mated with outboard spring/damper unit, outboard brake and anti-roll bar in the rear. The rear arm of the front upper A arm was much thicker than the front tube, acting as a canti-lever to operate the inboard spring/damper unit mounted vertically. The monocoque extended {{to the rear of}} the engine, with the gearbox sticking out further aft. Another monocoque tub was made in aluminium, but was never used.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was {{a typical}} double wishbone arms with outboard coil/damper unit using the Triumph upright made by Alford & Alder, Triumph Herald rack and pinion steering, and outboard Girling non-ventilated disc brake. The rear had the top link with lower reversed wishbone, top and bottom radius arms with the top arm {{at the height of}} the halfshaft, combined with the outboard disc brakes and coil/damper unit. Unlike the arrangement for Lotus 20 suspension, the halfshafts had Metalastic rubber 'doughnuts' on the inside, carrying no cornering (side) forces. The side forces are carried by the <b>lower</b> <b>wishbone,</b> together with the top 'I' arm link, which connects the tail end of the upper side tube in the frame with the extended top end of cast alloy upright.|$|E
2500|$|The rear de Dion {{transaxle}} {{found on}} the Alfetta and derivatives- GTV, 90 and 75- provided these cars with excellent weight distribution. The advantages to handling were noticed in [...] such as Vicar. The transaxle design, in combination with a Watt's parallelogram linkage, inboard rear brakes and a well-located de Dion rear suspension, resulted in excellent traction and handling. The front suspension design was also unusual in that it incorporated independent longitudinal torsion bar springs acting directly onto the <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> and with separate dampers.|$|R
50|$|Triumph {{realised}} {{that they}} needed to find an answer to the handling problem, if only to maintain their reputation in the USA. Their response came with the 1969 model year, with the introduction of the GT6 Mk II, known in the States as the GT6+. The rear suspension was significantly re-engineered using reversed <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> and Rotoflex driveshaft couplings, taming the handling and turning the Triumph into an MGB beater. The Vitesse was also modified, but the Spitfire had to wait until 1970 for any improvements to be made.|$|R
5000|$|The 177, the {{designation}} of which {{was derived from the}} fact that its design was commenced in 1977, was a bulky car finished in the handsome dark red colour adopted by Autodelta. The 177 featured a riveted aluminium chassis, with front suspension by upper rocking arms, <b>lower</b> <b>wishbones</b> and inboard-mounted coil spring/damper units. The rear suspension featured parallel lower links, single top links, twin radius rods and outboard coil spring/damper units.Bruno Giacomelli had won the 1978 European Formula Two Championship in a March and was hired to drive the new Alfa Romeo 177; he used this car at Belgian and French Grands Prix.|$|R
