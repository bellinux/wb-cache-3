5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and <b>listless.</b> A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|From the {{apartment}} {{he shares with}} his hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, drooping look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all over the}} world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers. Although he feels increasingly <b>listless,</b> Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant.|$|E

25|$|The Xhosas have {{a strong}} oral {{tradition}} with many stories of ancestral heroes; according to tradition, the leader from whose name the Xhosa people take their name was the first King of the nation. One of Xhosa's descendents named Phalo gave birth to two sons, Gcaleka kaPhalo, the heir, and Rarabe ka Phalo, a son from the Right Hand house. Rarabe was a great warrior and {{a man of great}} ability who was much loved by his father. Gcaleka was a meek and <b>listless</b> man who did not possess all the qualities befitting of a future king. Matters were also complicated by Gcaleka's initiation as a diviner, which was a forbidden practice for members of the royal family.|$|E
25|$|The autumn passed, and winter, too, and as {{the first}} green began to show in the hickory and oak along the Housatonic, Lillinonah bedecked herself with the wild flowers of the forest as she waited in happy {{anticipation}} for her lover's return. But summer came and went, the reds and yellows of autumn showed bright on the trees, and still the young Englishman had not {{come back to the}} land of the Pootatucks. Lillinonah no longer sang a joyous song. There were no more flowers in her hair. Wan and <b>listless,</b> she wandered through the woods, her eyes red-rimmed from weeping, searching and hoping against hope that she had not been forgotten.|$|E
25|$|<b>Listless</b> {{and often}} ill, Carolingian Emperor Charles the Fat {{provoked}} an uprising, led by his nephew Arnulf of Carinthia, {{which resulted in}} the division of the empire in 887 into the kingdoms of France, Germany, and (northern) Italy. Taking advantage of the weakness of the German government, the Magyars had established themselves in the Alföld, or Hungarian grasslands, and began raiding across Germany, Italy, and even France. The German nobles elected Henry the Fowler, duke of Saxony, as their king at a Reichstag, or national assembly, in Fritzlar in 919. Henry's power was only marginally greater than that of the other leaders of the stem duchies, which were the feudal expression of the former German tribes.|$|E
25|$|Primary screwworms are primary, obligate parasites in the larval stage, and as {{a result}} are capable, unlike {{secondary}} screwworms, of initialising the penetration of the skin barrier to create an entry wound. Despite this, they are most commonly seen as colonisers of previously existing wounds, and frequently are hatched from eggs laid at the perimeter of a wound. Once the infestation commences, a dark brown or reddish-brown discharge begins leaking from the wound, sometimes accompanied by an unpleasant smell as the flesh begins to decay. This is often the first sign in both livestock and human victims that something is amiss, and often initiates consultation with a professional. As the infestation increases, the victim begins to experience escalating tissue irritation, {{and in the case of}} domesticated animals, may be observed to become withdrawn, <b>listless,</b> and anorexic.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite the}} good start, 2 {{consecutive}} defeats against Australia at Trent Bridge in Nottingham and the West Indies at The Oval in London followed, {{and with other}} results going Australia's and the West Indies' way, India were once again staring at another early exit from the World Cup. Trevor Chappell scored 110 to ensure that Australia scored a mammoth 320/9, with India dishing out a <b>listless</b> bowling performance. Only Kapil bowled well, taking a 5-wicket haul (5/43). Australian medium-pacer Ken MacLeay took 6/39 as India were bowled all out for just 150, losing by 162 runs, {{with none of the}} Indian batsmen contributing. Against the West Indies, India, chasing 283 to win, never really got going despite Amarnath's patient knock (80 from 139 balls). A combined effort from the West Indian pace attack saw India crash to 216 all out, losing by 66 runs. To add to India's woes, Vengsarkar was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} tournament after a Malcolm Marshall bouncer injured his jaw. To reach the semifinals now, India had to beat Zimbabwe and Australia by huge margins, a daunting prospect. Should India lose even one of the matches, they would be knocked out of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became <b>listless</b> and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without at least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E

Duke made a disparaging comment {{in his memoirs}} about how Hines appeared on the Brandenburg riverfront, saying Hines was [...] "apparently the most <b>listless</b> inoffensive youth that was ever imposed upon"; despite being Morgan's second-in-command, Colonel Duke was usually not told of all the espionage Hines was carrying out, causing some to believe that Hines and Duke did not like each other, which was not the case.|$|E
500|$|In Jacobson's film, Martians kidnap Santa Claus in a plan {{to bring}} fun to their <b>listless,</b> TV-obsessed children. Once on Mars, Santa mass-produces toys using a {{computerized}} machine, foils a sourpuss saboteur, and generates fun for all. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians has been novelized, adapted to musical stagings, and has taken its place as a holiday cult classic. Child actress Pia Zadora played one of the Martian children and years later commented, [...] "It was very well done, considering it was shot twenty years ago - gimme a break - and really is very entertaining. It's become a Christmas classic, really." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music {{commented that}} Barely Real was [...] "on first hearing, slightly soporific and <b>listless,</b> but it rewards repeated listening with its depth and emotional texture." [...] Ned Raggett (AllMusic) gave the album {{a rating of}} {{four and a half}} stars out of five, explaining that [...] "Those put off by earlier Codeine CDs won't want to continue; those taken by the band's way of doing things will happily embrace it."

500|$|On March 1, {{a second}} relief party arrived at Truckee Lake. [...] These rescuers were mostly {{experienced}} mountaineers who accompanied {{the return of}} Reed and McCutchen. [...] Reed was reunited with his daughter Patty and his weakened son Tommy. An inspection of the Breen cabin found its occupants relatively well, but the Murphy cabin, according to author George Stewart, [...] "passed the limits of description and almost of imagination". Levinah Murphy was caring for her eight-year-old son Simon and the two young children of William Eddy and Foster. She had deteriorated mentally and was nearly blind. The children were <b>listless</b> and had not been cleaned in days. Lewis Keseberg had moved into the cabin and could barely move due to an injured leg.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Anniyan {{addresses}} a packed audience in Nehru Stadium was filmed {{with the space}} empty. The crowd was created through visual effects using crowd multiplication methods. The VFX for the sequence was done {{under the supervision of}} visual effects consultant Zameer Hussain of Land Marvel Animation Studios, Chennai. The scene, in which hundreds of buffaloes chase down a delinquent car owner into an abandoned sand quarry and trample him to death, was accomplished through CGI using just one buffalo. The CG work was supplied by Jayakumar and V. Srinivas Mohan of the Chennai-based firm, Indian Artists Computer Graphics. Srinivas and his team had earlier worked with Shankar in Boys. Speaking of the sequence, Srinivas quipped, [...] "The animals are lethargic and <b>listless</b> in their movements. Nothing can make them agile." ...|$|E
500|$|Issue #6 {{received}} an average score of 5.8/10 based on 17 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Schedeen {{gave it a}} 6.3 saying, [...] "Civil War II has had trouble building momentum from the beginning, and this issue does nothing to address that problem. There are some strong emotional moments here, and plenty of stunning artwork from Marquez and Ponsor, but the sluggish pace and generally <b>listless</b> nature of the conflict continue to frustrate." [...] Pepose gave it a 3 and said, [...] "We have two issues left on this series, and judging by the cliffhanger, it might mean something - but at this point, Civil War II has largely been about circling a conflict rather than diving into it head-on, leaving this event book about as unsatisfying as it gets." ...|$|E
500|$|On 17 December, the {{day before}} Quest was due to leave Rio, Shackleton fell ill. He may have {{suffered}} a heart attack; Macklin was called, but Shackleton refused to be examined and declared himself [...] "better" [...] the next morning. On the ensuing voyage to South Georgia he was, from the accounts of his shipmates, unusually subdued and <b>listless.</b> He also began drinking champagne each morning, [...] "to deaden the pain", contrary to his normal rule of not allowing liquor at sea. A severe storm ruined the expedition's proposed Christmas celebrations, and a new problem with the engine's steam furnace slowed progress and caused Shackleton further stress. By 1 January 1922, the weather had abated: [...] "Rest and calm after the storm – the year has begun kindly for us", wrote Shackleton in his diary.|$|E
500|$|The couple's daughter, Kenshi (Kataiko), {{was born}} in 999. Two years later Nobutaka died during a cholera epidemic. As a married woman Murasaki would have had {{servants}} to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances (monogatari) such as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and The Tales of Ise. Scholars believe she may have started writing The Tale of Genji before her husband's death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, perhaps {{in a state of}} grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: [...] "I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in <b>listless</b> fashion... doing little more than registering the passage of time... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable".|$|E

[...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post graded her cameo a [...] "C," [...] commenting [...] "at least she didn't {{have to try}} to be funny" [...] as in her How I Met Your Mother guest-spot. Flandez was {{disappointed}} that Spears did not appear for longer, yet he concluded that given the acting demonstrated in her 2002 film Crossroads, it was better that the pop star did not. Conversely, Jenna Mullins of E! Online appreciated the fact that Spears did not appear as a background character, writing that she is [...] "best when she is playing herself", Stack felt her appearances were well-handled, [...] "with a nice level of restraint," [...] and Canning felt they were kept to a [...] "perfect minimum." ...|$|E
500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{said that}} the song is the most {{embarrassing}} moment of the album {{and as a result}} makes the album come to an intermediate halt thus ruining the [...] "bad-girl party atmosphere". Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle said that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] is a bouncy standout with some vocal personality. He also added that [...] " [...] would have made a killer Spice Girls single." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club called the track scaled-back and criticized Gaga's vocal abilities in the song. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song <b>listless.</b> Catherine P. Lewis from The Washington Post called the song a chirpy ballad. Christina Martin from The Meridian Star felt that the song, along with [...] "Summerboy" [...] from The Fame, is breezy and upbeat in nature. Matt Busekroos from Quinnipiac Chronicle {{said that the}} song seemed like a filler to him.|$|E
500|$|Ben Child of The Guardian said, [...] "Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's {{impressive}} collective charisma, Thor: The Dark World is {{far from}} a franchise killer." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, [...] "This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said, [...] "Thor: The Dark World delivers the goods—action, otherworldly grandiosity, romance, humor—above and beyond its predecessor". Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com said, [...] "There's just enough tension and humor in Thor: The Dark World to make the film's otherwise <b>listless</b> proceedings worth watching, but only just." [...] Echoing other critics' sentiments, Frank Lovece of Film Journal International wrote, [...] "Is it wrong that the best relationship in Thor: The Dark World is between the titular Norse-god superhero and his adoptive brother Loki? To take nothing away from Oscar-winner Natalie Portman, ... it's the complicated love-hate between Thor and the trickster god Loki that you can't turn your eyes from." ...|$|E
500|$|Johansson transitioned from teen {{to adult}} roles with two films in 2003: the romantic comedy-drama Lost in Translation and the drama Girl with a Pearl Earring. In the former, {{directed}} by Sofia Coppola, she plays Charlotte, a <b>listless</b> and lonely young wife, opposite Bill Murray. Coppola had first noticed Johansson in Manny & Lo, and compared {{her to a}} young Lauren Bacall; Coppola wrote the film's story based {{on the relationship between}} Humphrey Bogart and Bacall in The Big Sleep (1946). Johansson immediately accepted the part and found the experience of working with a female director different because of Coppola's ability to empathize with her. Made on a budget of $4million, the film earned $119million at the box office and received positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert was pleased with the film and described the lead performances as [...] "wonderful", and Entertainment Weekly wrote of Johansson's [...] "embracing, restful serenity". The New York Times praised Johansson, then 18, for playing an older character.|$|E
500|$|Gasaway {{disagreed}} {{that the}} Whigs deceived the voters, [...] "The 'fable' of 1840 {{tells us that}} the Whigs triumphed over baffled and <b>listless</b> Democrats by convincing voters that Harrison lived in a log cabin and that he was a great war hero when, so the legend goes, neither claim was true. [...] Whigs did not say that Harrison lived in a log cabin and in fact went into great detail describing his actual house. The 'log cabin' was much more symbol than claim." [...] Gasaway suggested that the 1840 campaign gained a poor reputation because Harrison and the Whig Party soon vanished from the scene, and many of those who had supported both in 1840 saw the election as a squandered opportunity: [...] "Add to this the fact that the poor man died only thirty days into an administration launched by what was perhaps the most exciting election campaign in the nation's history up to that time and we are confronted... with an undeniable and almost irresistible touch of opera bouffé." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, François Truffaut {{is reported to}} have said, [...] "I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1958, [...] "Any picture as loose in structure or as <b>listless</b> in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with the editors in Hollywood", even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. The Harvard Crimson argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature [...] "contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through." [...] Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by Nargis Dutt, parliamentarian and former actress, for [...] "exporting poverty". Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy [...] "as a eulogy of third-world culture, others criticized it for what they took to be its romanticization of such a culture".|$|E
500|$|Likewise, in the New York Daily News, David Bianculli {{states that}} the episode is [...] "a true tour de force, and another inventive triumph for this vastly underrated series" [...] Brian Courtis in Australia's Sunday Age agrees, and writes that [...] "Hush" [...] is [...] "(c)lever, well-written and brightly {{directed}} ... Buffy at its best." [...] Robert Hanks from The Independent in the UK writes that [...] "Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights" [...] with [...] "Hush". Noel Murray in The A.V. Club calls it an [...] "episode unlike any other, with a lusher score {{and some of the}} most genuinely disturbing imagery I've yet seen on Buffy." [...] The episode was included among 13 of the scariest films or television shows by Salon.com, and justified by Stephanie Zacharek, who states it [...] "scans just like one of those <b>listless</b> dreams in which you try to scream, and can't. Everybody's had 'em—and yet the way the eerie quiet of 'Hush' sucks you in, you feel as if the experience is privately, and unequivocally, your own." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)" [...] {{garnered}} mixed {{responses from}} music critics. Sal Cinqeumani for Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)" [...] is a [...] "promising" [...] song. James Reed for the Boston Globe was complimentary {{of the song}} because {{he felt that the}} first half of the track list better represented Carey, writing [...] "halfway in, 'Memoirs' starts to sag under its own weight, and the sweetness that initially was so irresistible starts to get a little too sticky." [...] Jon Caramanica for The New York Times was critical of the song, noting that her collaborators of choice on the album have delivered [...] "largely <b>listless</b> arrangements", writing that Carey is [...] "mumbling" [...] on [...] "Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)". He likened her singing style on the song to other tracks on the album [...] "Ribbon" [...] and [...] "Insepareable", writing that [...] "talk-singing" [...] is usually [...] "the preserve of far worse singers." [...] When the [...] "Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)" [...] remix featuring R. Kelly surfaced online, Becky Bain for Idolator wrote that the [...] "stream-of-consciousness, the various voices for multiple players, the cheating plotline" [...] is a reworking of his series of songs entitled Trapped in the Closet (2005).|$|E
500|$|... "Eh, Eh" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} in a beatbox version at the Cherrytree Studios and was released on Gaga's first EP, The Cherrytree Sessions. [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] was majorly performed at Gaga's The Fame Ball Tour in the second segment. Gaga {{was dressed in a}} white body plate leotard with black lightning shaped stripes and wore a hat made of toppled dominoes. It was accompanied by open toe shoe-boots and fishnet stockings on her leg. As the performance of previous song [...] "Money Honey" [...] ended Gaga appeared on the stage beside Space Cowboy on a Vespa whence the music for [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] starts. The backdrops change to reveal lightning shapes in contrast to the sunny nature of the song. Gaga sang the song in its actual form backed by vocals from DJ Space Cowboy who spun the music from a corner of the stage. As the song reached the chorus Gaga asked the crowd to join her while singing and wave their arms. The New York Times called the live performance as <b>listless.</b> However, The Hollywood Reporter said of the performance that, [...] "In an age of too much information, one of the most refreshing things about Gaga is her mystery. She often hid behind shades, and her mostly incomprehensible, coy and semi-robotic stage patter did little to tell us who's that Lady." ...|$|E
500|$|Cake's fifth album, Pressure Chief, was {{recorded}} in June2004 in a converted house in Sacramento; the album was again released on Columbia Records. Before its official release date on October5, the band played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and KBCO's World Class Rockfest. The album was also preceded by its first single, [...] "No Phone", which hit number13 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song covered the ubiquitous and privacy-invading use of cell phones, and was described by Jeremy Mahadevan of the New Straits Times as [...] "a traditionally minimalist Cake anthem, with a killer melody and, unique to this album, fairly extensive use of synths". A second single, [...] "Wheels", was also released but failed to chart. Pressure Chief itself hit number17 on the Billboard top200, spending 7 weeks in the charts, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although it was acknowledged as a continuation of their old work, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers, Sam Spies of the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that [...] "the experiments in style that made Cake fun to listen to have all but disappeared from 'Pressure Chief'...What's left is mostly uninspired, so-called alternative rock", and Graeme Hammond of the Sunday Herald Sun wrote that [...] "the melodies are <b>listless,</b> the album bereft of anything with the verve of Short Skirt/Long Jacket or Comfort Eagle".|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{may fall}} victim to poisons, {{infectious}} diseases, and physical injuries. As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators. However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally <b>listless.</b> Throughout history, {{much of the money}} and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use. However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions. [...] In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530. [...] In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional Chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems. Despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals. The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.|$|E

He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and [...] "a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television", but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as [...] "the only compelling scene in the whole episode". On a list ranking all the Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] 80 out of 110 episodes, explaining [...] "A good flashback (to Sun and her pre-island lover) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can't make up for a <b>listless</b> on-island plot." [...] On a similar list, IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes, writing [...] "it felt appropriate for Losts third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack, Sawyer and Kate, since their abduction by the Others {{was a big part}} of Season 2's conclusion. But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three, with almost no plot momentum, was frustrating and rather uninteresting. Meanwhile, we do pick up with Sayid, Sun and Jin, but it's really only for yet another 'Sun and Jin have had a lot of big issues in their marriage' flashback – a topic we were well familiar with at this point." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{before leaving}} Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason {{informed}} Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, {{he would have}} intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed {{under the care of}} Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The <b>listless</b> Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: [...] "I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, I was aware that I did not know just where I was going or what I ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} Hollywood's output of movie musicals {{had begun to}} wane, and he worked on only two during that decade. He made his movie acting debut in It's Always Fair Weather (1955), {{directed}} by Gene Kelly and Donen, in which Kelly, Kidd and Dan Dailey played three ex-GIs meeting {{ten years after the}} war, only to discover they had little in common. The film featured an exuberant number in which the three dance with garbage can lids fastened to their feet. The downbeat film was a critical success but was not heavily promoted by the studio, and failed at the box office. The film was originally designed to be a sequel to the 1949 film On the Town, but Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin were unavailable, and the film lacked chemistry between the three actors. The production was marked by constant strife between Donen and Kelly, with much of it stemming from Donen striving unsuccessfully to include a ten-minute dance solo by Kidd, [...] "Jack and the Space Giants". Kelly rejected that, which Kidd took as a personal insult, and Donen went further, ending his collaboration with Kelly {{for the rest of their}} lives. The [...] "Jack" [...] number appears as a bonus feature on a DVD of the film, and one commentator suggests that Kelly's judgment was not wrong, as the number was <b>listless</b> and did not advance the plot.|$|E

AllMusic editor Andy Kellman stated [...] "no matter its commendable fearlessness, the album is a <b>listless,</b> bleary trudge along West's permafrost". Charles Aaron from Spin criticized the songs' musical structures, calling the album [...] "a long processional that starts and restarts and never reaches the ceremony". Slant Magazines Wilson McBee panned West's singing, while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times singled it out as the [...] "weakness for which this album will ultimately be remembered, some solid songs notwithstanding." [...] Caramanica wrote that, [...] "at best, it is a rough sketch for a great album, with ideas he would have typically rendered with complexity, here distilled to a few words, a few synthesizer notes, a lean drumbeat. At worst, it’s clumsy and underfed, a reminder that all of that ornamentation served a purpose". Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis stated, [...] "If West had interspersed the more mechanical tracks with some that were the exact opposite—say, simple piano interludes provided by his old collaborators John Legend or Jon Brion—he {{might have made a}} masterpiece.

500|$|Conversely, Edge staff {{complained that}} {{characters}} other than Nilin were weaker overall. The {{design of the}} Pressens combos {{was thought to be}} flawed, as the rate at which one unlocks them was too slow to use them until the final hours of the game. Though Bramwell found engagement in the first few hours, he said that the later parts of the story suffered from too many science fiction elements. The absence of external motivation for the main character was also disparaged. Reeves was dissatisfied with the characters, whose world he said was more interesting than they were, and the story was berated for being [...] "uninspired". VanOrd observed that the game was held back by an unfulfilling story and sub-par level design. The dialogue and metaphors were criticised for dimming the story's potential. Taljonick also disliked the dialogue, with overwhelming jargon noted as one of its chief offences. The exploration was deemed restrictive, the level design claustrophobic, and the combat system [...] "stiff". Krupa was unimpressed with the action, which he felt lacked variation and was not well executed. His delight in the setting led to disappointment with the limited exploration of it. The lack of Memory Remixes received reproval as well. Kietzmann declared Remember Me as [...] "a <b>listless</b> and mediocre action game" [...] whose appearance held more value than its performance, and objected to the combat for being [...] "stilted" [...] and void of excitement. PlayStation Official Magazine – UK staff became quickly disenchanted with the game as it delved into [...] "generic fighting".|$|E
500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007 that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organisers at the last minute. The performance began with Spears lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble". [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The performance was universally panned by critics. Jeff Leeds of The New York Times said that [...] "no one was prepared for Sunday night's fiasco, in which a <b>listless</b> Ms. Spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip-synch her new single". Vinay Menon of the Toronto Star commented Spears [...] "looked hopelessly dazed. She was wearing the expression of somebody who had been deposited at the Palms Casino Resort by a tornado, one that promptly twisted away, taking her clothing and sense of purpose. [...] lumbering, in slow motion, as if somebody had poured cement into her streetwalker boots". David Willis of BBC stated her performance would [...] "go down in the history books as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards".|$|E

The day after the performance, American blogger Chris Crocker posted a video in YouTube titled [...] "Leave Britney alone!", in which he cried and defended Spears's performance, explaining {{that he did not want}} her to spiral out of control like Anna Nicole Smith, who had died in February 2007. Within the first 24 hours of its posting, the video accumulated over 2 million views. [...] "Leave Britney alone!" [...] turned Crocker into an internet celebrity, and was featured on television shows such as The View and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It was also parodied by dozens of other YouTube users, most famously by actor Seth Green. An editor for YouTube said [...] "the melodramatic two-minute clip made Crocker an instant YouTube star" [...] and named it one of the top videos of 2007. Wired named it the top video of 2007.|$|E
