It also includes a jumpstart chapter for developers coming from other technologies. If you already have a firm grasp of Silverlight development and are keen to advance your specialist knowledge of Line of Business (<b>LOB)</b> <b>application</b> development, then Expert Line of Business Application Development for Silverlight 5 : Quick Start Guide is for you.

These editions come in two DVDs: One for installing the IA-32 variant {{and the other for}} x64. Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems supports IA-64 processors. Microsoft has optimized the IA-64 version for high-workload scenarios like database servers and Line of Business (<b>LOB)</b> <b>applications.</b> As such, it is not optimized for use as a file server or media server.

40|$|The line {{of balance}} (LOB) method is not widely used in the {{construction}} industry even though it has distinct advantages in repetitive construction projects. Attempts were made in the past to develop LOB systems but no system has met with universal acceptance because of a multitude of problems. As a response, a tool named ALISS was developed that solves most of the problems associated with <b>LOB</b> <b>applications.</b> ALISS is an acronym for Advanced Linear Scheduling System and makes use of a model that utilises the tools of information technology to the fullest extent. This is accomplished by creating a system that has a standalone and a web-based version. ALISS is programmed using Visual Basic and Visual Basic Script languages. It utilises MS Access and SQL server as a data repository. The resulting Advanced Linear Scheduling System not only accommodates all LOB requirements but also provides the latest technological developments as an embedded tool. Linear scheduling, repetitive construction, {{line of balance}},...|$|R

CCF does not include an Agent Desktop application, rather samples including source code are provided {{as part of the}} framework.|$|R
40|$|In 2009, {{the number}} of detentions under the Act 1976 : 511 on the {{disposal}} of drunk people, etc. (LOB) was estimated to about 62 000, of which approximately 87 percent spent time in police custody for sobering up. Efforts to handle drunken individuals {{do not belong to}} the core of the police responsibilities, which is why some people re­gard it as "a crappy job. " The LOB gives the police the power to ar­rest individuals who are so intoxicated that he or she cannot take care of him or herself, constitutes a danger to him or herself, or is a danger to another person. It is clear is that the conditions of the LOB are blurred. Thus, the National Police Board by regulation have been given the task of drawing up detailed rules for how the LOB is to be applied in prac­tice. The regulations, however, give no detailed guidance on how the constituent elements should be interpreted. The purposes of the pro­ject have been to use a theoretical approach to review the legal regu­lations and a systematically analyze empirical data in order to study both how the LOB came to be applied, and also whether the applica­tion is incompliance with the law and the basic requirements of the individual's legal rights. The essential issue in this work is whether the constitution provides the legal certainty that the legislature sought to safeguard. The legislature's intentions at the LOB's origins and the drunken­ness decriminalization cannot be overlooked. Issues such as the health care aspect, limitative purposes and care of the individual should prevail. It has been shown that the legislature's intentions do not always produce the desired results out among legal practitioners, but that they create an autonomous understanding of how the ele­ments of arrest should be interpreted. In other words, an under­standing of how texts should be interpreted mainly arises in the con­tact between colleagues. Arrests of drunken individuals should be examined by a foreman, who is a police officer, as well as the intervention of the policeman. The strong brotherhood and collegiality that is prevailing in the police force is likely to affect the detainees’ access to objective review of the decision. Furthermore, there is no effective monitoring and sanction system to recognize and deal with errors in the <b>application</b> of the <b>LOB.</b> In Sweden, unlike Denmark, there is no explicit right to chal­lenge the legality of a drunken arrest before the courts. To introduce such a law was discussed at the advent of the LOB, but was never introduced. In addition to detention, such arrest may also have legal conse­quences for individuals such as examination of the right for a driver’s license and a two years waiting period for applying for a weapons’ permit. In cases where law enforcement is not done properly, the individuals who are not cared for correctly also suffer from these con­sequences. In order to be affected by this, the individual must be identified. The police currently have no explicit legal basis for identi­fying these individuals, which is why about one tenth remain unidenti­fied and thus escapes the consequences. A conclusion that <b>LOB</b> and its <b>application</b> are associated with a lack of legal certainty is presented in the paper. The police are an arm of the legislature and put to work in a text-driven organization, such as street-level bureaucrats in direct contact with citizens, which is why they are often torn between different interests. The difficulties in veri­fying the practical application of the law makes the police forced to interpret and apply the LOB in a manner that may not be consistent with the legislature's intentions. The shortcomings that exist in mon­itoring and sanctioning the system are some of the reasons that this can take place. ...|$|R
