5000|$|If a lease {{exists at}} the sole {{discretion}} of the landlord, {{the law of the}} jurisdiction may imply that the tenant is granted, by operation of law, a reciprocal right to terminate the <b>lease</b> <b>at</b> <b>will.</b> However, a lease that explicitly exists at the will of the tenant (e.g. [...] "for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land") generally does not imply that the landlord may terminate the lease; rather, such language may be interpreted as granting the tenant a life estate or even a fee simple.|$|E

5000|$|However, by {{the start}} of the 18th century, the {{political}} influence of popularly supported [...] "assemblies," [...] notably the Albany Assembly, had begun to effectively break the legal power of the manor lords, and place it quite firmly in the hands of those who held the vote under the [...] "Lawes of England." [...] This was interpreted in the Province as persons who were freehold land owners and leasehold tenants with a lifetime lease, provided that in either case the land was valued at least £40. Politically, this may not have resulted in much change considering that manor lords won representation of their manors in every election from 1691 to 1776. In fact, only two elections were even contested, and then simply by rival factions within the same manorial families. In the law, however, there was a quite radical change as tenants were converted from mostly [...] "at will" [...] leaseholders, whose <b>lease</b> was <b>at</b> the <b>will</b> of the manor lords, to mostly lifetime leaseholders and freeholders.|$|R

5000|$|A tenancy <b>at</b> <b>will</b> is a tenancy which {{either the}} {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate {{at any time}} by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period. It may last for many years, {{but it could be}} ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes. If there is no formal <b>lease,</b> the tenancy <b>at</b> <b>will</b> is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, a tenancy <b>at</b> <b>will</b> without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to [...] "at will" [...] tenancy subject to 30-days notice. Alternatively, a tenancy <b>at</b> <b>will</b> (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy <b>at</b> <b>will</b> is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.|$|R
