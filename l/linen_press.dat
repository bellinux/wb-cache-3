And as she spoke she walked to the <b>linen</b> <b>press</b> where Catherine's {{mistress}} kept all her finest sheets and underclothes, tore everything in pieces, and flung them on the floor. Poor Catherine wrung her hands and wept, for she thought to herself, 'When my lady comes back and sees all this ruin she will think it is my fault,' and starting up, she fled through the open door. Then Destiny took all the pieces and made them whole again, and put them back in the press, and when everything was tidy she too left the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right, mother! And if my Master {{has given}} me ten talents, my duty is to trade with them, and make them ten talents more. Not in the dust of {{household}} drawers shall the coin be interred. I will not deposit it in a broken-spouted teapot, and shut {{it up in a}} china closet among tea-things. I will not commit it to your work-table to be smothered in piles of woollen hose. I will not prison it in the <b>linen</b> <b>press</b> to find shrouds among the sheets. And least of all, mother" [...] (she got up from the floor)--"least of all will I hide it in a tureen of cold potatoes, to be ranged with bread, butter, pastry, and ham on the shelves of the larder." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{led them}} {{from room to}} room, their {{surprise}} and delight continually increasing; all were furnished richly in the Flemish style with cabinets, tables, settees, and armoires. There were hangings to the windows and rugs on the floors; everything was ready for habitation, the <b>linen</b> <b>presses</b> were full of table-cloths and napkins and sheets. The beds were ready for sleeping in, with their great bags of soft feathers, their thick blankets and silken coverlets. These {{more than anything else}} excited the dame's admiration. Never had she seen beds approaching these in softness and daintiness.|$|R
50|$|A <b>linen</b> handkerchief, <b>pressed</b> {{and folded}} {{to display the}} corners, was a {{standard}} decoration of a well-dressed man's suit {{during most of the}} first part of the 20th century.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{they reached}} the house, some of the sailors were sent off with the {{remaining}} trunks and bundles, while the others carried upstairs those they had brought, and quickly emptied into them the remaining contents of the drawers and <b>linen</b> <b>press.</b> So quickly and steadily did the work go on, that no less than six trips were made to the Good Venture in the next three hours, {{and at the end of}} that time almost everything portable had been carried away, including several pieces of valuable furniture, and a large number of objects brought home by Captain Dave from his various voyages. The last journey, indeed, was devoted to saving some of the most valuable contents of the store. Captain Dave, delighted at having saved so much, would not have thought of taking more, but Captain Watson would not hear of this.|$|E
50|$|In modern houses, a <b>linen</b> <b>press</b> {{is often}} a {{built-in}} cabinet near bedroom or bathroom, for easy access to fresh bed sheets and towels.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} a <b>linen</b> <b>press,</b> made for Elizabeth MacArthur (in 1824), still exists, {{and is on}} display at Milton House museum. The item may have been made without nails. The bookkeepers entry of payment still exists.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Zane {{hastened to}} the side of the fainting lad. She washed away the blood from the wound over his temple. She saw that a bullet had glanced on the bone and that the wound was not deep or dangerous. She unlaced the hunting shirt at the neck and pulled the flaps apart. There on the right breast, on a line with the apex of the lung, was a horrible gaping wound. A murderous British slug had passed through the lad. From the hole at every heart-beat poured the dark, crimson life-tide. Mrs. Zane turned her white face away for a second; then she folded a small piece of <b>linen,</b> <b>pressed</b> it tightly over the wound, and wrapped a towel round the lad's breast.|$|R
60|$|Between them, Burton and Jonas Prim fitted Bridge {{out as he}} had {{not been}} dressed in years, and with the feel of fresh <b>linen</b> and <b>pressed</b> clothing, even if ill fitting, a {{sensation}} of comfort and ease pervaded him which the man would not have thought possible from such a source an hour before.|$|R
25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera on linen, as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of <b>linen</b> <b>pressed</b> onto the mummy's face were used to provide an even surface, so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead are striking. The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression that this woman, who belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or chiton, thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a middle-aged woman.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} appears little changed and has {{bedrooms}} opening {{out from a}} central hallway with a <b>linen</b> <b>press</b> at the end. The rooms are lined with horizontal beaded boards and have 4 panel doors and clear glass transom lights to the hall with French lights leading on to the verandah.|$|E

60|$|When he {{had washed}} the wound he fetched some table <b>linen</b> from a <b>press</b> and ripped it into strips with his dagger; he {{threaded}} {{out one of}} these and made a preliminary crisscross of the threads across the lips of the wound--for the blade had gone right through {{the muscles of the}} breast, grazing the ribs; these threads would help the formation of a clot. Then with the infinite skill and cunning acquired {{in the course of his}} rovings he proceeded to the bandaging.|$|R

Excluding agriculture, the most important employment sectors were public administration, education and health (31% of non-agricultural employment), production and construction (29%), and distribution, accommodation and food (26%). Significant employers include Dorset County Council, Pork Farms, Guys Marsh Prison, Royal Mail, Somerfield, Tesco, Port Regis School, Wessex Electricals, Stalbridge <b>Linen</b> Services, Blackmore <b>Press</b> and Dorset Chilled Foods.

50|$|By October 1887 {{however, the}} Townsville Herald noted that FDG Stanley, {{architect}} for three buildings being erected in Townsville including the Bank of NSW, inspected these with his local representative Mr WM Eyre who was supervising their construction. Three months later on 24 December 1887, the same newspaper congratulated the architect Mr Smedley of Sydney for his {{design of the}} newly completed Bank of New South Wales building. This suggests Smedley was Mansfield's successor as the bank's design architect in Sydney, and Eyre was the local supervising architect with Stanley his senior partner.The new premises included the banking chamber, manager and accountant's offices, strong rooms and ablution facilities. The manager's residence included nine private rooms, kitchen, bathroom <b>linen</b> <b>press</b> and pantry. Included in the complex were stables, a coach house and a messenger's room.|$|E
5000|$|The two-storeyed brick {{building}} {{was one of}} Cooktown's more substantial buildings. The ground floor contained the banking chamber, manager's room and strong room. A private entrance {{at the side of}} the building led to the manager's residence, which comprised entrance hall and dining room on the ground floor, and drawing room, 3 bedrooms, bathroom and <b>linen</b> <b>press</b> on the upper level. The bedrooms opened onto the side balcony. The single-storeyed kitchen wing beyond the dining room contained kitchen, servant's room and store., with high ceilings and plenty of windows to ensure adequate ventilation in a tropical climate. The whole was constructed of brick, initially supplied from Mrs Savage's brickyard at the [...] "Two-mile" [...] just outside Cooktown. Difficulties in their manufacture and heavy rain during February delayed work on the bank building, and it was finally completed in mid-1891.|$|E
25|$|Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have {{attempted}} to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, {{which could have been}} done by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of <b>linen.</b> They then <b>pressed</b> the <b>linen</b> against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes. However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.|$|R
