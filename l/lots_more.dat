500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Shawn Sackenheim of Allgame {{also found the}} main downfall of the game to be {{that it is too}} short and too easy. However, he found the new Time Attack mode and the expanded storyline to be interesting new features that extend playability. Sackenheim stated that despite the minor add-ons and overhauled textures, Jumping Flash! 2 was essentially a technical update of the 1995 original. Other criticisms include that the game is too short despite Game Revolution citing that the game offered a total of 32 levels if including the [...] "repetitive" [...] epilogue. Game Revolution also said that Jumping Flash! 2 was a [...] "very worthy sequel with better graphics, higher jumps, and <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> levels", and that upon release the game [...] "really [...] beyond the competition".|$|E

[...] Two more compilations of Lat's editorial cartoons (With a Little Bit of Lat and <b>Lots</b> <b>More</b> Lat) were published {{and the number of}} people who recognised him continued to grow. [...] In 1984, partly from a desire to step away from the limelight, Lat resigned from the New Straits Times to become a freelancer, but continued to draw Scenes of Malaysia Life for the newspaper. [...] He set up his own company, Kampung Boy Sendirian Berhad (Village Boy private limited), to oversee the merchandising of his cartoon characters and publishing of his books. [...] In 2009, Kampung Boy partnered Sanrio and Hit Entertainment in a project to open an indoor theme park which would later be called as Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park in Nusajaya, Johor in August 2012. One of the park's attractions will be the sight of performers dressed up as Kampung Boy characters beside those in Hello Kitty and Bob the Builder costumes and also reported in August 2012 will be a Lat-inspired diner called Lat's Place. It will be designed in a Malaysian village setting, coupled with animations for patrons to interact with.|$|E

Craig Harris of IGN gave the games an [...] "Outstanding" [...] 9.0/10 rating and praised {{the creators of}} the games for creating a game that [...] "works extremely well for the handheld market. It doesn't have quite the same variety as Ruby/Sapphire, but it's still incredibly satisfying." [...] Harris was less positive about the games' graphics, which he thought were [...] "limited" [...] and [...] "basic". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who gave the games 8.4 out of 10, commented that [...] "though Pokémon could probably use a few new twists after all these years, FireRed and LeafGreen are great role-playing games on their own merits, filled with <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> content and more challenges than last year's Ruby and Sapphire, and offering up plenty of addictive gameplay {{that can be a}} lot of fun for players of all ages." [...] Unlike Harris, Kasavin praised the games' graphics for their [...] "colorful good looks and the endearing character designs that the series is known for." [...] Game Informer rated the games a [...] "Very Good" [...] 8/10 for being [...] "a lot of fun", yet they saw the graphics as [...] "utterly unremarkable" [...] when compared to other handheld games.|$|E

In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, Western Australia had six land {{divisions}} which cover the whole state, divided into 80 land districts. The land districts were further subdivided into locations and lots. Western Australia also had 26 counties, all located in the south-west corner of the state, around Perth. The counties were designated in 1829, the year of the foundation of the Swan River Colony, with Governor Stirling instructing that counties were to be approximately 40 miles square (1,600 square miles). The counties appear on some nineteenth century maps of Australia along with counties in other states, however it was the land districts which were used for cadastral purposes, and were the equivalent of the counties used in the eastern states. Around {{the end of the twentieth}} century, legal documents usually wrote them in the order: land district, location, number. For example: [...] "Swan Location 2301". These are further divided into <b>lots.</b> <b>More</b> recently, Western Australia uses only the lot and deposited plan numbers, such as [...] "Lot 853 on Deposited Plan 222626".|$|E

A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E

2500|$|For {{their first}} album, the Stooges had {{intended}} to record five songs: [...] "I Wanna Be Your Dog", [...] "No Fun", [...] "1969", [...] "Ann" [...] and [...] "We Will Fall". The five songs were staples—and essentially the basis—of the Stooges' live set at the time. A typical Stooges song of the period would involve two minutes of composed song followed by several minutes of improvisation. Having assumed that the five songs as normally performed would cover requirements for the album, the Stooges were told by their record label Elektra that they needed more material. According to Iggy Pop, [...] "We handed [...] in and they refused it. They said, 'There aren't enough songs!' So we lied and said, 'That's OK, we've got <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> songs.'" [...] "Asthma Attack", which had first been mentioned by Iggy Pop in a Trouser Press autodiscography interview, was also recorded during the sessions, but not discovered (or at least not used on the 2005 double-CD reissue) until the 2010 Rhino Handmade box was compiled; {{it is not clear}} whether [...] "Asthma Attack" [...] was recorded along with the first five songs or not.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for the Common Council, the {{disadvantages}} of the plots in the Common Lands worked against their sale, {{and there was}} no run on the market to buy them. Still, sales continued at a steady, if not spectacular, pace. By 1794, with the city growing ever more populated and the inhabited area constantly moving north towards the Common Lands, the Council decided to try again, hiring Goerck once more to re-survey and map the area. He was instructed to make the <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> uniform and rectangular and to lay out roads to the west and east of the middle road, as well as to lay out east-west streets of [...] each. Later, the Commissioners would use Goerck's East and West Roads for their Fourth and Sixth Avenues, again without acknowledging their debt. Goerck's cross streets would become the numbered east-west streets of the later plan. [...] Goerck took two years to survey the 212 lots which encompassed the entire Common Lands. Again, impeded by tools and topography, Goerck's work was somewhat less than precise. In 1808, John Hunn, the city's street commissioner would comment that [...] "The Surveys made by Mr. Goerck upon the Commons were effected through thickets and swamps, and over rocks and hills where it was almost impossible to produce accuracy of mensuration."
