5|$|During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk as {{he comes}} {{backstage}} during the interim between his part in Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to <b>look,</b> <b>it</b> is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E

25|$|The {{network address}} {{was placed in}} an unused field in the Fido message database, which {{formerly}} always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would <b>look</b> <b>it</b> up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period.|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2000, Diana Kornet, 29, slipped as she {{was looking}} over the {{northeast}} side of Mount Hood. She fell about 2500ft to her death.

25|$|A Scanner Darkly is a 2006 American {{animated}} science-fiction thriller film {{directed by}} Richard Linklater, {{based on the}} novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick. The film tells the story of identity and deception in a near-future dystopia constantly under intrusive high-tech police surveillance {{in the midst of a}} drug addiction epidemic. The film was shot digitally and then animated using interpolated rotoscope, an animation technique in which animators trace over the original footage frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films, giving the finished result a distinctive animated <b>look.</b> <b>It</b> was distributed by Warner Independent Pictures.|$|E
25|$|The Eldridge Hotel {{was first}} built in 1855 as the Free State Hotel by Colonel Shalor Eldridge. The hotel was {{destroyed}} during the sack of Lawrence. Col. Eldridge rebuilt the Free State and added an extra story, vowing {{to do so}} every time. The Free State was destroyed again during Quantrill's Raid but Eldridge rebuilt again and renamed the hotel The Eldridge. In 1925, due to deterioration, the Eldridge was demolished and rebuilt but was closed and converted into apartments in 1970. In 1985, work began to renovate the Eldridge back into a hotel and in 2004 the building was sold and completely renovated back to its 1925 <b>look.</b> <b>It</b> is rumored the ghost of Colonel Shalor Eldridge haunts the Eldridge and was featured on the Biography Channel's series My Ghost Story.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} marketed with several taglines, including: [...] "We've always {{believed}} we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll wish we were", [...] "Earth. Take a good <b>look.</b> <b>It</b> {{could be your}} last", and [...] "Don't make plans for August". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third {{of which was a}} spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as [...] "truly brilliant".|$|E

[...] He wrote, [...] "It's just so unique the way they use {{state of the art}} 3D computer animation to create a retrofitted <b>look.</b> <b>It</b> takes them months to animate each episode and the hard work really pays off in the unique visuals of the show." [...] Writing for TV Fanatic, Eric Hochberger stated that [...] "if this week combined with the mini-series was any indication, we're in for a damn strong season of Archer." ...|$|E

Denser {{than that of}} other forms, the foliage is covered in fine grey hair. On stalks around [...] above the foliage, the flower heads measure up to [...] in diameter, although larger ones up to 10cm are occasionally seen. They have around 300 bracts per flower head, compared with 80 for 'Dargan Hill Monarch' and 200 in 'Cockatoo', giving them a [...] "doubled" [...] <b>look.</b> <b>It</b> is reported as producing fewer flower heads than 'Princess of Wales'.|$|E

And if I catch you and my son again in any public {{restaurant}} I will thrash you" [...] to which Wilde responded: [...] "I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight". His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E
500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. Parker said he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined <b>look</b> <b>it</b> has retained throughout the years. Parker said, [...] "I think that this was where we finally felt like we got it right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. Parker said the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|E
500|$|The Port of Liverpool Building {{is one of}} the Three Graces {{that line}} the Pier Head and the {{architectural}} features were designed to be reflective of Liverpool's importance to the maintenance of the British Empire. However, the building that exists today is actually {{a modified version of the}} originally chosen design. Initially, the plan had called for the main entrance of the building to be located on the south-west corner, but boundary changes to land on which it was to be built meant that the design was significantly revised to give it the symmetrical <b>look</b> <b>it</b> has today. Notably, the initial design did not include the large dome that sits so prominently above the building today. Inspired by an unused design for Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, which had been developed several years earlier, the architects added the dome to the design in order to give the building a more imposing look. This decision, however, was not without controversy, as many board members believed that it should not be down to the Port Authority to [...] "beautify the town". Nonetheless, it was added to the design, becoming the focal point of the building itself.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} season's use of 1940s terminology, Fazekas stated that terms like [...] "broad" [...] and [...] "dame" [...] were preferably avoided, while {{research}} {{was done to}} ensure terms {{that were used in}} the series were actually in use during that time, with Fazekas giving the example, [...] "you know what didn't exist in 1946? Smart ass. I looked up the etymology on that, didn't exist in 1946. Turns out it was a term that came around in the 60s. But for instance, I wrote a line that said, [...] "Oh I think someone's yanking your chain." [...] And I had to <b>look</b> <b>it</b> up, did that exist in 1946? And actually it did; it's a mining term that exists from a long time ago. That's our research that we do." [...] Research was also done on radio shows of the time to ensure realism when creating the fictional Captain America Adventure Program, with details discovered and replicated on the series including the use of lobsters and ham to create sound effects for the radio show. The Griffith Hotel, the all-women boarding house where Carter lives, is based on the real-life Barbizon Hotel for Women. Butters felt that while working in the time period, it became an issue to not sound [...] "too period". Additionally, it was difficult to write British people from the time in order to avoid stereotypes such as the [...] "typical British butler". However, D'Arcy, who is British, felt the writing staff wrote the British characters better than anyone else he had worked with, despite there not being any British writers on the staff.|$|E
