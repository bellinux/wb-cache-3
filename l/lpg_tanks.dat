40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (LPG) is considered clean, safe and cheap, offering {{a viable alternative}} to conventional fuels. Nowadays, the use of LPG as a fuel source in motor vehicles is steadily increasing. The <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> in motor vehicles can be of toroidal shape. The toroidal <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> are generally of non-circular cross-section, and may be supported at points, lines or patches on the surface. Among the mechanical properties of interest for toroidal <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> are the static behavior under internal pressure, the vibration characteristics, the buckling and collapse loads, and the properties under impact loading arising from accident conditions. In the current work, a shell-theory finite element analysis is carried out of toroidal <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks,</b> with non-circular cross-section. The analysis serves to determine the natural frequencies, the buckling and collapse pressures, and the deformation of impacted tanks. The differential quadrature method is used as an alternate means in the vibration analysis. A variety of support conditions are considered, including lines of support at the inner and outer equators of the tank. For validation, comparison is made with previously published results for stress, vibration and buckling of circular and elliptical toroidal shells, and impact deformation of spherical and cylindrical shells. Finally, a parametric study is carried out to determine the influence on the natural frequency, buckling and collapse pressures, and the deformation of the impacted tanks, of shell size, shell thickness, material properties, and support conditions...|$|E

40|$|<b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> are {{essential}} storage device in refineries and were frequently subjected to SCC on inner surface during service {{and must be}} inspected from inside regularly. MT or PT are two conventional methods used for the inspection but is very costly and toilsome because of the requirement of scaffolding and the extreme hot working condition inside the tank. Practical experience had shown that epoxy layer may be applied on the inner surface of the <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> to alleviate SCC however extra work of epoxy layer removal was required before MT or PT. In this study, an automated inspection method based on multi-channel electromagnetic technique was developed in lieu of conventional MT or PT.

Experimental results and field trials had shown that this innovational design may detect real cracks down to 10 mmL× 1 mmD in dimension and to assure the full coverage of inspection area.

40|$|The term {{domino effect}} denotes {{a chain of}} accidents, or situations, in which a fire/explosion load {{generated}} by an accident in one unit in an industry causes secondary and higher order accidents in other units. Such chains of accidents have a greater propensity to cause damage than stand-alone accidents. Most of the past risk assessment studies deal with accident in a single industry, more so {{in one of the}} units of an industry. But, often, accident in one unit causes a secondary accident in a nearby unit, which in turn may trigger a tertiary accident, and so on. The probability of occurrence and adverse impacts of such ‘domino ’ or ‘cascading ’ effects are increasing due to increasing congestion in industrial complexes and increasing density of human population around such complexes. Accidents with domino effect are seldom studied. LPG storage areas could produce the worst possible consequences {{in the event of an}} unforeseen incident. This work illustrates the application of models to evaluate the impacts of events with fire and explosion in <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> on other similar units in the park and the possibility of occurrence of a domino effect. The criteria for occurrence of accidents with domino effect adopted in this work were 37. 5 kW/m 2 in case of fire radiation and an overpressure of 0. 7 atm in explosion cases in a receptor body. The spacing between <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> was evaluated. The results show that such spacing is minimal and does not represent, as it should, a parameter indicating a safe distance able to prevent the propagation of an accident with domino effect...|$|E
40|$|LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) {{is gaining}} in {{popularity}} {{as an alternative}} choice of vehicle fuel since it is less costly and more environmentally friendly when compared with conventional fuels as gasoline and diesel. However, there are risks of LPG leakage from an LPG tank {{which leads to a}} VCE (Vapor Cloud Explosion) inside an enclosed car park. Pressure waves generated by the explosion may reflect on walls or in corners, leading to high overpressures. For this reason, vehicles equipped with <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> are restricted from entering underground or enclosed car parks in Belgium and across Europe. This paper addresses this problem by using a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) package to simulate the vapor cloud explosion inside an enclosed car park. The simulation was performed by using FLACS, which is a specialized commercial CFD package targeting at gas dispersion and explosion. The simulation was performed based on the geometry of a partially closed car park with the size of 30 × 30 × 2. 4 m. Main structures like columns and ceiling beams as well as vehicles were modeled. The simulations of VCE determine the maximum overpressures as well as the development of the flame inside and outside the car park domain. Parameters studied in this paper are: the presence of vehicles and the vent openings of the car park. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide some fundamental study in understand the consequence of an LPG vapor cloud explosion by looking into these parameters and their effects. The work presented in this paper is part of the project of a QRA (quantitative risk assessment) for enclosed car parks with vehicles equipped with <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks.</b> The results obtained in this early stage of the project were based on a 'worst-case' scenario by using a stoichiometric vapor cloud which is hardly probable under realistic circumstances. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (LPG) {{is used as}} a fuel and intermediate product for petrochemical manufacturing. For storage and transportation, usual <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> will be sealed and pressurized to eliminate the potential evaporative emissions and spillage. However, if there is a leakage, the probability on developing corrosion at the tank’s floor either internally or externally, will cause potential hazardous condition. Corrosion is the destructive attack on a substance, usually metal due to the interaction of chemical or electrochemical reaction with the environment Even though the failure or leakage of storage tanks may not disturb the normal operations but it may have serious impact on economic and environment. Tank floor failures due to corrosion process are dangerous because the leakage would penetrate into the ground for years before it been detected. It has been estimated to a loss of USD 5. 5 billion per year due to the corrosion on the storages (NACE, 1984). External corrosion can be categorized as pitting corrosion, bimetallic corrosion and corrosion caused by water trap. It is very difficult to detect on when and where the corrosion has been set off as the ultrasonic measurements on plates which are irregularly corroded underneath may not give accurate results, and the inspected area is generally too large to be covered by a single probe...|$|E
40|$|Two {{large-scale}} diesel {{pool fire}} engulfment tests {{were carried out}} on <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> protected with intumescing materials to test the effectiveness of thermal coatings {{in the prevention of}} hot BLEVE accidental scenarios in the road and rail transport of LPG. A specific test protocol was defined to enhance reproducibility of experimental tests. The geometrical characteristics of the test tanks were selected in order to obtain shell stresses similar to those present in full-size road tankers complying to ADR standards. In order to better understand the stress distribution on the vessel and to identify underlying complicating phenomena, a finite element model was also developed to better analyze the experimental data. A non-homogeneous and time-dependent effectiveness of the fire protection given by the intumescing coating was evidenced both by finite element simulations and by the analysis of the coating after the tests. The results of the fire tests pointed out that the coating assured an effective protection of the tanks, consistently increasing the expected time to failure. The data obtained suggest that the introduction of fire protection coatings may be a viable route to improve the safety of the LPG distribution chain. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} is to develop a robust, efficient, self-contained localization module for use in a robotic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tank inspection system. Inspecting large <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> for defects is difficult, expensive and energy intensive. Replacing the human inspectors with a robotic inspection system will make the inspection process faster, less expensive, more reliable and safer. The sensing platform designed in this work can collect data about the environment and track the robotic inspection platform, recording the defect locations. It consists of a two axis gimbaled sensing platform with a single point distance sensor placed in the manhole of the tank. A collection of algorithms were developed to use in conjunction with the sensing platform to collect and process the 3 D data into a map of the environment. The algorithm's main feature is a robust and efficient method of segmenting and fitting data to a right capped cylinder that is faster and more robust to noise than current methods. The improved performance comes from a unique combination of object shape knowledge, the Gauss image and 3 D histogram techniques which achieve accurate segmentation without iteration. The hardware and software were demonstrated to function robustly in a noisy environment. The unique ability of the system to work in an LPG tank allows it to be integrated into a robotic inspection system that can remove the majority of the cost and risk associated with LPG tank inspection. by Cynthia Dawn Walker Panas.

40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (LPG) and {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG) are currently the leading fuel contenders for converting vehicles from gasoline and diesel to alternative fuels. Two factors that inhibit conversion are additional vehicle costs and reduced range compared to gasoline. In overcoming these barriers, {{a key element of}} the alternative fuel system becomes the storage tank for these pressurized fuels. Using cylindrical pressure vessels is the conventional approach, but they do not package well in the available vehicle volume. Thiokol Corporation has developed and is now producing a conformable (non-cylindrical) aluminum storage system for LPG vans. This system increases fuel storage in a given rectangular envelope. The goal of this project was to develop the technology for a lower cost conformable tank made of injection-molded plastic. Much {{of the cost of the}} aluminum conformable tank is in the fabrication because several weld seams are required. The injection-molding process has the potential to greatly reduce the fabrication costs. The requirements of a pressurized fuel tank on a vehicle necessitate the proper combination of material properties. Material selection and tank design must be optimized for maximum internal volume and minimum material use to be competitive with other technologies. The material and the design must also facilitate the injection-molding process. Prototype tanks must be fabricated to reveal molding problems, prove solutions, and measure results. In production, efficient fabrication will be key to making these tanks cost competitive. The work accomplished during this project has demonstrated that conformable <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> can be molded with thermoplastics. However, to achieve a competitive tank, improvements are needed in the effective material strength.

40|$|AbstractIn Italy, since 2005, {{techniques}} {{based on}} Acoustic Emission {{have been introduced}} for testing of underground <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 13 m 3, according to the European standard EN 12818 : 2004. The testing procedure for these tanks plans to install one or more pairs of sensors inside the “dome” suited for the access to the valves and fittings of the tank, directly on the accessible metal shell. This methodology is not applicable for the underground LPG buried tanks, where {{it is necessary to}} install a larger number of AE sensors, in order to cover at 100 % the whole tank shell, even at very deep positions. Already in 2004, the European standard EN 12820 (Appendix C - Informative) give the possibility to use Acoustic Emission testing of LPG underground or buried tanks with a capacity exceeding 13 m 3, but no technique was specified for the application. In 2008, TÜV AUSTRIA ITALIA – BLU SOLUTIONS srl - Italian company of TÜV AUSTRIA Group - has developed a technique to get access at tank shell, where tank capacity is greater than 13 m 3 and its’ diameter greater than 3, 5 m. This methodology was fully in comply with the provisions of the European Standard EN 12819 : 2010, becoming an innovative solution widely appreciated and is used in Italy since this time. Currently, large companies and petrochemical plants, at the occurrence of the tank's requalification, have engaged TÜV AUSTRIA ITALIA – BLU SOLUTIONS to install such permanent predispositions, which allow access to the tank shell - test object – with diameters from 4 to 8 m. Through this access, you can install the AE sensors needed to cover at 100 % the tank surface and then to perform AE test. In an economic crisis period, this technique is proving a valid and practically applicable answer, in order to reduce inspection costs and downtime by offering a technically advanced solution (AT), increasing the safety of the involved operators, protecting natural resources and the environment...|$|E
40|$|Industrialized {{society is}} linked to the {{transport}} of hazardous materials by road and rail, among other. During transportation, accidents may occur and propagate among the tankers leading to severe fires, explosion or toxic dispersions. This may increase the level of individual and social risk associated to those activities, since the transport network often crosses densely populated area. The escalation of a primary event, in this case the fire, is typically denoted as domino effect, and the triggered secondary events typically are amplified. In the framework of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, severe fire and explosion hazards are associated to the possible catastrophic rupture of tankers, which may be induced by domino effect of accidental fires. Heat resistant coatings may protected tankers against the fire, reducing the heat load that reaches the tank shell wall and the lading. Indeed, the rupture {{is the result of the}} double effect of thermal weakening of the tank material and the increasing pressure due to LPG evaporation. However, this protection systems are not ideal and undergo defects due to both material degradation and accidental damage. Therefore, protection may be ineffective. The present work is aimed at characterizing the performance of defective coatings. The first part of the work is devoted to the characterization of past accidents occurred in the framework of road and rail transportation of hazardous materials. The ARIA and MHIDAS databases are adopted as data sources, identifying 245 road and 220 rail accidents involving hazardous materials. The analysis highlighted the importance of protecting tank from heat load to avoid the rupture and related severe scenario. For these reasons, in North America the installation of a heat resistant coating is used to protect dangerous good tankers from accidental fire exposure. In Europe, ADR and RID regulations govern transnational transport of hazardous materials by road and by rail, respectively, and still not include any section about thermal protection systems of tankers. Possible concerns related to the installation of these systems is due presence of defects that may be formed accidentally in the fireproofing layer. It is therefore important to establish what level of defect is acceptable in order to avoid the failure of tankers, in the prospective of a wider implementation of tankers fire protections in the European framework. Since large scale bonfire tests are expensive and difficult to be carried out in order to verify the thermal protections adopted, modelling the behaviour of pressurized insulated tankers when exposed to the fire is a possible solution to test the adequateness of defective protections. In order to describe the thermal behaviour of real scale <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> exposed to fire, a lumped model (namely, ‘RADMOD’) and a Finite Elements Model (FEM) are developed. The models are validated against available experimental data and allow predicting the thermal behaviour of tankers with defective coating when exposed to fire, with the aim to assess the thermal protection performance. The phenomena taking place through the vessel in presence of defects are investigated and characterized, in order to reproduce the experimental data on thermal behaviour of defective thermal protection systems exposed to fire. The FEM model allows to determine the wall temperature profile and the stress distribution over the vessel, determining, in the end, a critical defect size that lead to the tank failure, with respect different fire conditions. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the FEM model in order to identify the parameters that mostly affect the heat exchanges of the system. This analysis highlights the main relevance of the flame temperature against other parameters, such as convective heat transfer coefficients and emissivity of flame and steel. The complex analysis performed by FEM model, requires high computational times, which may be prohibitive when a wide number of runs is required. The RADMOD code is a simplified lumped model, which allows to assess the behaviour, among other, of the pressure and the fluid temperature with lower, and thus acceptable, computational time. Another plus of the RADMOD model is that it can be run for a wide range of materials, substances, geometries and fire scenario, estimating a conservative but credible time to failure of the tank. The novel mathematical code for defective thermal protection system is added to the previous version of the RADMOD model, which was implemented for unprotected or completely coated tanks, thus all the phenomena related to the defect enclosure are characterised. In addition, other phenomena, already present in the RADMOD model, are revised to enhance the potentiality of the code. The comparison of results with available experimental data on medium-scale shows that the model proposed in this thesis work can reasonably predict the thermal response. The application of the modelling tool to different geometries is performed considering real-scale defects. Thus, several case-studies were defined in order to reproduce medium- and large-scale tanks varying a few parameters, such as defect size and liquid filling level, for testing the reproducibility of the new model. The results from the case studies highlight the potentiality and the flexibility of the RADMOD code in modelling the thermal response. The ultimate goal would be to apply the data collected from RADMOD code about temperature and pressure of lading, as boundary condition in the FEM model for an improved modelling of thermal behaviour of real-scale <b>LPG</b> <b>tanks</b> in fire scenarios even if there is a defective thermal protection system...|$|E
