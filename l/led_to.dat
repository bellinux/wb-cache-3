5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} to Edward <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.|$|E
5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 <b>led</b> <b>to</b> rapid {{depopulation}} in {{many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also <b>led</b> <b>to</b> expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E
5|$|After the storyline {{feud with}} Big Show ended, Lashley entered a short program with Rob Van Dam, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Van Dam earning a title match on the January 2, 2007 episode of ECW.

Test's interference <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a storyline with the champion, leading to a title match at the Royal Rumble, which Lashley won.|$|E

5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> concern by local officials.

One fork ran into a large workshop and the other <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a short platform, which was initially used for passengers.
