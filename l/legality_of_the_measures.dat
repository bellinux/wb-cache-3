5000|$|In late November 1973, Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe {{recommended}} {{adoption of}} a 55 mph statewide limit.

40|$|After {{regulating}} Greenhouse Gas {{emissions from}} air transport, the European Union is now contemplating taking action on emissions from the shipping sector. In {{order to do}} so, the European Commission carried out a public consultation process between January and April 2012. This article analyses the legal problems that would arise, in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> Public International Law, should the European Union decide to follow <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> aviation and include shipping under the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). To do so, the focus will be placed on six different normative bodies of international law: (1) the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol;(2) the MARPOL Convention; (3) the United Nations Convention on <b>the</b> Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea; (4) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the General Agreement on Trade <b>of</b> Services; (5) <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> sovereignty over maritime areas; and (6) the bilateral agreements ratified by the EU containing clauses on maritime transport. <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six normative bodies will be as follows: international commitments under each international norm, possibility of enforcement before tribunals and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU <b>measure</b> in relation to that norm...|$|R

40|$|In 2011, then-Public Safety Minister Vic Toews issued “ministerial directions” to Canada’s key {{security}} and intelligence agencies on “information sharing with foreign entities”. These directions permit information sharing in exigent circumstances, even “when doing so may {{give rise to}} a substantial risk of mistreatment of an individual”. The directions prompted a brief chorus of condemnation. They have since sunk into relative obscurity, remaining part of the Canada’s national security policy framework. And yet, in trying to walk the fine line between principle and realism in the administration of Canada’s approach to torture, they continue to raise pressing moral and legal questions. This Article aims to reignite discussion of these policies and their controversial content, relying in large measure on documents obtained by this author directly or through journalistic researchers under access to information law. It examines dilemmas raised when information is shared between human rights-observing and abusing states and then focuses on the legal parameters and policy context in which both “in-bound” and “out-bound” information-sharing takes place. It then analyzes the 2011 instruments and considers their legality under both international and domestic law. The Article concludes that <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> is doubtful in international law – at least in so far as “out-bound” information sharing is concerned – and domestic criminal culpability and constitutional validity are very close questions...|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on three {{instances}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> armed force in international relations. The three instances that are explored are the intervention by NATO in Kosovo, the armed attack by mainly the USA and the UK against Afghanistan and the war against Iraq in 2003. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this investigation is to examine <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coercive <b>measures</b> in order to ascertain the effects that these actions had in relation to article 2 (4) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN Charter. The proposed justifications for the attacks differ and these are carefully scrutinized against the jus ad bellum as to determine <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacks. <b>The</b> notion <b>of</b> humanitarian intervention {{was used as a}} ground for justification by various international scholars to explain <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force in Kosovo, but this concept is not recognized in terms <b>of</b> international law. <b>The</b> attack on Afghanistan was based on article 51 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN Charter. The attacks were directed at Afghanistan as this state harboured the terrorists responsible for the attacks on the USA. <b>The</b> mere harbouring <b>of</b> terrorists does not give rise to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> armed force on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> article 51 and as such <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> coercive <b>measures</b> against Afghanistan was illegal. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> force in Iraq was mainly based on <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> pre-emptive force which is alien to international law. The USA and its coalition partners also acted in contravention with the jus ad bellum in this regard. The author poses certain proposals in relation to the jus ad bellum and stresses <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> article 2 (4) which must ensure that international relations are not once more regulated by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> armed force...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the major legal issues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas {{pipeline}} embargo. It is not an abstract treatise on extraterritoriality under international law, but a legal expertise on <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique <b>measures</b> imposed in 1982. It also tries {{to point out the}} legal trends as indicated by the recent publications. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis examines to what extent some European firms were affected by the American embargo. The second part examines whether the President had the authority under the Export Administration Act of 1979 to impose the far-reaching extraterritorial restrictions. It concludes that the President enacted some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controls without authorization by the Act. The next part {{deals with the}} issue whether the export restrictions, although not authorized by the Act, can be upheld by <b>the</b> inherent powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President. It concludes that the restrictions could not have been imposed legally based on <b>the</b> inherent powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President. The fourth part then deals with the question whether the export restrictions violated the Constitution. It states that the Constitution did not limit <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Congress or <b>the</b> President in this particular case. The final part shows <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> international law involved in the gas pipeline embargo. It focuses on <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> extraterritorial jurisdiction <b>of</b> states. <b>The</b> examination points out that the extraterritorial controls cannot be based on generally accepted bases of jurisdiction and violated <b>the</b> sovereign rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected European states.

40|$|The {{status and}} {{position}} of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“FRY”) in the United Nations (“UN”) is a controversial issue which has elicited many comments and articles and has cast a long shadow on the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> taken by the General Assembly (“GA”) and the Security Council (“SC”) vis-a-vis Yugoslavia. In 1992, the SC and the GA both decided that the FRY, composed of Serbia and Montenegro, could {{not participate in the}} work of the GA and its bodies. The GA further extended the prohibition against Yugoslavian participation to the Economic and Social Council and its bodies. Throughout each of these resolutions, the SC and the GA stated that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“SFRY”) has ceased to exist and that the FRY cannot automatically continue the membership of the former SFRY in the UN. At the root of the unresolved status of the FRY in the UN is the question whether a succession or secession has taken place in the former SFRY. Essentially, the status question had been created by the unilateral acts of secession by the four former Yugoslav republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia) and the intrusion of the geo-strategic interests of foreign factors that encouraged, made possible and rewarded these secessions by premature recognition of the new nations. Continuous political pressure against the FRY is designed to bring about legal discontinuity of Yugoslavia as a founding member of the Organization of the UN. The FRY continues to be precluded from participating in the meetings of states that are parties to those treaties. Unfortunately, the U. S. administration is not alone in erecting a new Berlin Wall on the FRY. The denial of the FRY’s right to be a continuous member of the UN and other international organizations runs counter to the contrary pronouncements issued by three out of the four former Yugoslav republics in the bilateral agreements and a joint declaration on the normalization of relations with the FRY. The isolation of the FRY from the UN work and other international organizations is only one of the absurdities and frivolous abuses of international law that have been the hallmark of the involvement of the international community in the Yugoslav crisis ever since its beginning. Part I discusses the Security Council (SC) and General Assembly (GA) decisions that the FRY, composed of Serbia and Montenegro, could not participate {{in the work of the}} GA and its bodies, and the GA’s further extension of the prohibition against Yugoslavian’s participation in the Economic and Social Council and its bodies. Part II addresses the root of the unresolved status of the FRY in the UN, namely the question of whether a succession or secession had taken place in the former SFRY. Part III asks whether the SFRY ceased to exist after unilateral acts of secession by the four former Yugoslav republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia), and the intrusion of the geo-strategic interests of foreign factors that encouraged, made possible, and rewarded these secessions by premature recognition of the new nations. Part IV analyzes the legal and political influences on the role of the FRY. Part V discusses the subsequent incorrect treatment of the FRY. Finally, Part VI addresses the U. S. resistance to the FRY’s resumed role...|$|E
40|$|Paragraph 2. 6 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Commission’s White Paper on Sport, {{entitled}} ‘Strengthening <b>the</b> prevention <b>of</b> {{and fight}} against racism and violence’, seeks to promote multi-party discussions on <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> disorder and anti-social behaviour at European sports events. This paragraph’s proposals include taking action to: (19) Promote, {{in accordance with}} national and EU rules applicable, <b>the</b> exchange <b>of</b> operational information and practical know-how and experience on <b>the</b> prevention <b>of</b> violent and racist incidents between law enforcement services and with sport organisations. (20) Analyse possibilities for new legal instruments and other EU-wide standards to prevent public disorder at sport events. (21) Promote a multidisciplinary approach to preventing anti-social behaviour, with a special focus given to socio-educational actions such as fan-coaching (long-term work with supporters to develop a positive and non-violent attitude). (22) Strengthen regular and structured cooperation among law enforcement services, sport organisations and other stakeholders. By phrasing the proposals so widely, the Commission has left open to itself many possible means by which its primary aim can be achieved. The perceived need for such cooperation and <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> specific legal instruments being introduced to control spectator disorder, particularly at football matches, stems from <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> very high profile incidents of violence and racism that continue to affect European sport. The United Kingdom has over 20 years of legislative experience in this field and provides a useful case study for how best to develop strategies to combat violence, disorder and racism amongst spectators. Against <b>the</b> backdrop <b>of</b> an ever-growing debate about <b>the</b> competence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Community to legislate in areas relating to criminal law, this paper will analyse <b>the</b> legislative <b>measures</b> that have been introduced by various UK governments since the Heysel Disaster in 1985 to combat a very specific form of spectator disorder; ‘football hooliganism’. It will focus on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Football Banning Order as a mechanism for controlling <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> both convicted and suspected football hooligans and will review <b>the</b> English experience <b>of</b> controlling and regulating spectator disorder at football matches by critically analysing <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> currently in place. The aim {{is to show that}} the UK’s response has had little quantifiable effect on football-related disorder when it occurs overseas, and is <b>of</b> questionable <b>legality</b> in <b>the</b> European context. These conclusions are based on ongoing ethnographic research, court observations and both qualitative and quantitative data from the Home Office, and will challenge the received wisdom that Football Banning Orders are a panacea that ‘cures the English disease’. It will be proposed that before implementing EU-wide legal instruments of this kind a number of ‘least restrictive alternatives’ must be considered...|$|R
