5|$|Around {{this central}} motif are {{arranged}} elements of eight other stories, {{all of them}} represented {{at least in part}} by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.|$|E
5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, a <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Earth, {{and in the same}} orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E

25|$|The Kouroukan Fouga {{divided the}} Mali Empire into ruling clans (lineages) that were {{represented}} {{at a great}} assembly called the Gbara.

25|$|The {{first half}} of both Season 3 and Season 4 are {{diplomatic}} in nature; Season 3, in particular, has many stories that take place away from the battlefield. How different races and planets {{are affected by the}} galaxy-wide war are shown, as well as how the Republic Senate can make a bigger difference than even the Jedi Council at times. The {{first half of}} Season 3 is used mainly to make the Clone Wars series more cohesive as these first episodes created better chronology, setting themselves in and among the previous two seasons' episodes. The second half of both seasons, Anakin steps a <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the dark side. Meanwhile, the Sith experience turmoil among themselves.|$|E

25|$|Managers – Many {{nurses who}} have worked in {{clinical}} settings {{for a long time}} choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS and independent care sector management. This used {{to be seen as a}} natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions; however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option. Nonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organisations and independent healthcare organisations, some even as board members or directors. Others choose to stay a <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> their clinical roots by becoming regional managers, service managers, clinical nurse managers or Modern Matrons.|$|E
25|$|Greg Hill still {{refused to}} race ABA races because he {{allegedly}} hated the ABA's direct transfer {{system in which}} the winner of the first moto would then sit out and not race the second and third cycle of motos until the Main, or if the race is big enough, the semis, quarter semis, etc. He and many other racers preferred the NBL's Olympic or cumulative {{system in which the}} qualifying rounds would be run three times and the average place in each round would be added and the four lowest numbers would advance to the main. This system put a premium on consistency while the Transfer System was a <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> luck, both good and bad for a racer. The ABA used a similar system during its controversial 1982 and 1983 Grand Nationals to choose its number one title to minimize anyone lucking into or out of the title. Also, points are awarded in the motos in the Cumulative System as well as the main so the racer doesn't walk away with nothing if he doesn't advance. Hill's objections seem odd considering he would race in the future sanctioning body the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) which used the transfer system. The USBA did offer larger, more consistent pro purses than the ABA generally.|$|E

2500|$|Bayernburg (German for [...] "Bavarian Castle"; [...] ) is {{the name}} of three {{separate}} wooden castles of the Teutonic Order in different locations along the Neman River in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the Lithuanian Crusade. Their exact locations are not known and historians provide conflicting versions. The first fortress was built in 1337 by guest crusaders, including Henry XIV, Duke of Bavaria, in whose honor it was named after Bavaria. Emperor Louis IV declared it the capital of the to-be-conquered Lithuania. The newly built castle withstood a 22-day siege by Grand Duke Gediminas, but was abandoned by the Order in 1344. The Teutons burned down the first Bayernburg and built a brand new fortress a <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Prussia. The second Bayernburg withstood a six-day Lithuanian attack in 1381 but was burned down in July 1384 by Vytautas when he betrayed the Order {{at the conclusion of the}} Lithuanian Civil War (1381–84). The third Bayernburg was built in spring 1387 where Georgenburg stood but the new name did not gain acceptance and the fortress continued to be known as Georgenburg. This fortress was captured and burned down by Vytautas in April 1403 during the first Samogitian uprising.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main attack}} was towards {{that part of}} the line held by the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments which was forced back until they were facing due west, with their backs to the tangled maze of, for cavalry and guns, impassable rocky hills. The 4th Light Horse Regiment {{supported}} by ‘A’ Battery HAC on the right or northern flank, had held their position until the attackers closed to within [...] when they began their slow withdrawal into the hills. The Nottinghamshire Battery RHA was positioned near the centre of the brigade but each time an attack broke and melted away before the light horse fire from rifles and the guns, the German and Ottoman dead lay a <b>little</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the guns of these two batteries. Each time a short retirement was made, the heavy pressure of the attackers pushed the guns further into the hills and each time there were fewer men and horses to move the guns. They were forced into a position from which there was no escape fighting till all their ammunition was exhausted and the German and Ottoman attackers were within [...] on three sides. Then the teams of horses were killed by machine gun fire and the nine 13–pounder guns were abandoned while the remaining men and horses scrambled up the hills to the east and succeeded in reaching the Wadi el Retem just {{to the north of the}} Umm esh Shert track. While the dismounted light horse could retire east into the hills if necessary, the three batteries of artillery now had no apparent way out to the east or south.|$|E
