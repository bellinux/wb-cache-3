5|$|Alumni of the University of North Dakota {{have become}} notable {{in a variety}} of {{different}} fields including politics and government, business, science, literature, arts and entertainment, and athletics. Eight Governors of North Dakota were educated at UND, including Fred G. Aandahl, Louis B. Hanna, Lynn Frazier, William Langer, John Moses, Ragnvald A. Nestos, Allen I. Olson, and Ed Schafer, who was also the US Secretary of Agriculture from 2008–2009.

Former House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Armey is a UND graduate. Ronald Davies, a UND graduate and former federal judge, became a part of history when he ordered the integration of Little Rock Central High School during the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|When the Korean War {{broke out}} on 25June 1950, No.77 (Fighter) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was based at Iwakuni, Japan. For the {{previous}} four years, equipped mainly with North American P-51 Mustangs, it had served with the British Commonwealth Air Group, the air component of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), initially as part of No.81 Wing RAAF. No.81 Wing was disbanded in November 1948, leaving No.77 Squadron as Australia's sole air unit in Japan. It was now the largest squadron in the RAAF, comprising 299 officers and men, forty Mustangs, three CAC Wirraways, two Douglas C-47 Dakotas and two Austers. The squadron was preparing to return to Australia when it was placed on standby for action over Korea; it began flying missions {{as part of the}} United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force a week later. No.77 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Lou Spence, was killed in action on 9September 1950, and Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, Chief of Staff at BCOF, temporarily took charge at Iwakuni, pending the formation of an overarching organisation for support and administration at the base. Squadron <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Cresswell arrived on 17September to assume command of No.77 Squadron.|$|E

In July 2005, the Republican Caucus removed her from her leadership position. Bachmann said that disagreements with Day over her anti-tax stance were the reason for her ouster.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1992 general {{election}} Fianna Fáil formed {{a coalition government}} with the Labour Party. This lasted until 1994 when Labour withdrew from government due to unhappiness with Reynolds's proposed candidate for President of the High Court. Ahern briefly succeeded Labour <b>leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Spring as acting Tánaiste. However, the government fell and Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader.|$|E
25|$|From 1995 to 1999, Boehner {{served as}} House Republican Conference Chairman, making him fourth-ranking House Republican behind Gingrich, Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.

6000|$|Some were wounded; one and {{all were}} furious at their ill-success and long exposure; and though they were now too cold and hungry to do more, they grumbled and cast sullen looks upon their <b>leaders.</b> <b>Dick</b> emptied his purse among them, leaving himself nothing; thanked them for the courage they had displayed, though he could have found it more readily in his heart to rate them for poltroonery; and having thus {{somewhat}} softened the effect of his prolonged misfortune, despatched them to find their way, either severally or in pairs, to Shoreby and the [...] "Goat and Bagpipes." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{failure of}} the Labour Party, {{contrary}} to all expectations, to increase its seat total. Later in the year, Ruairi Quinn stepped down {{as leader of the}} Labour Party. He was replaced by Pat Rabbitte, who was one of four Democratic Left TDs who joined in a merger with Labour in 1999. The most high-profile loss for the party was the defeat of former <b>leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Spring in Kerry.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party in Ireland {{was formed}} in 1990 by members who had been {{expelled}} by the Irish Labour Party's <b>leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Spring.

25|$|When the {{campaign}} began, Lenihan {{was seen as}} a near certainty to win the presidency. The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as {{the campaign}} proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey and the rising popularity of the Labour Party <b>leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Spring. Notwithstanding, Fianna Fáil knew they could count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.|$|E

25|$|The film had a {{very low}} {{marketing}} budget and was not marketed in conventional methods. Prior to the film's release on the politically symbolic date of Tax Day, the project was promoted throughout the Tea Party movement and affiliated organizations such as FreedomWorks. The National Journal reported that FreedomWorks, the Tea Party-allied group headed by former House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Armey, (R-Texas), {{had been trying to}} get the movie opened in more theaters. FreedomWorks also helped unveil the Atlas Shrugged movie trailer at the February 2011 Conservative Political Action Conference. Additionally, it was reported that Tea Party groups across the country were plugging the movie trailer on their websites and Facebook pages. Release of the movie was also covered and promoted by Fox News TV personalities John Stossel and Sean Hannity.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{remained}} in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point {{many of the issues}} she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised although heavily restricted, women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, she decided not to seek re-election to the senate in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her about running for president in that year's election. She thought she was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party <b>leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Spring was proposing. However, as she read the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.|$|E
25|$|Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and {{continued}} through the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55, all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent. The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs {{who died in a}} plane crash, and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In 1998, with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation, both Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert.|$|E

25|$|The 1984 United States House of Representatives {{elections}} was {{an election}} for the United States House of Representatives in 1984 which {{coincided with the}} re-election of President Ronald Reagan in a landslide. This victory also yielded gains for Reagan's Republican Party in the House, where they picked up a net of sixteen seats from the Democratic Party. The Democrats nonetheless retained a commanding majority in the House and gained seats in the Senate. Notable freshmen congressmen include future House Majority <b>Leaders</b> <b>Dick</b> Armey and Tom DeLay, future Senator Bob Smith, future Governor of Connecticut John G. Rowland, and future Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette.|$|R
500|$|Frank {{has been}} outspoken on many civil rights issues, {{including}} lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. In 1987, he publicly {{came out as}} gay. In 1990, Frank was instrumental in crafting the 1990 Immigration Act, which restated the reasons for which a person could be denied entry into the country. [...] The act did not include [...] "sexual preference exclusion", reforming earlier immigration law which allowed persons to be excluded for a sexual deviance [...] "afflict". He said in a 1996 interview: [...] "I'm used to being in the minority. I'm a left-handed gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority." [...] In 1995, then-Republican House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Armey famously referred to Frank as [...] "Barney Fag" [...] in a press interview. Armey apologized {{and said it was}} [...] "a slip of the tongue". Frank did not accept Armey's explanation, saying [...] "I turned to my own expert, my mother, who reports that in 59 years of marriage, no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag." [...] In 1998, Frank founded the National Stonewall Democrats, the national LGBT Democratic organization.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, several House Republicans {{attempted}} to replace him as Speaker, claiming Gingrich's public image was a liability. The attempted [...] "coup" [...] began July 9 with a meeting of Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told {{his chief of staff}} to warn Gingrich. On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker. This would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Democrat Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as {{the only member of the}} leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.|$|E
500|$|As the Japanese {{advanced}} in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three fighter units—Nos.75, 76 and 77 Squadrons—equipped with Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks recently delivered from the United States. No.77 Squadron was formed at RAAF Station Pearce, Western Australia, on 16March, with a complement of three officers and 100 men. Temporarily commanded by Squadron Leader D. F. Forsyth, the unit was initially {{responsible for the}} defence of Perth. Squadron <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Cresswell assumed command on 20April. The squadron transferred to Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory, in August, the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the area. Until this time, air defence over Darwin had been provided by the P-40s flown by the USAAF's 49th Fighter Group. No.77 Squadron moved to another of Darwin's satellite airfields, Livingstone, in September. Among its pilots was John Gorton, future Prime Minister of Australia. No.77 Squadron saw action defending Darwin from Japanese air raids and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5a.m. on 23November 1942, when Cresswell destroyed a Mitsubishi [...] "Betty" [...] bomber. It was the first [...] "kill" [...] for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia. As of 24December, the unit's strength was twenty-four Kittyhawks.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} ballot at the {{convention}} no candidate won the 50 per cent required to be elected <b>leader.</b> <b>Dicks</b> was thus eliminated after finishing third and immediately threw this support behind Efford, hoping to defeat Grimes who had finished first on the ballot. Dicks' support was not enough and on the second ballot Grimes was elected leader; defeating Efford by 14 votes. The three-month race had included nasty and personal attacks between the candidates, and when Grimes was announced as the leader he received boos from Efford's supporters. Grimes {{was sworn in as}} Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on February 13, 2001. While Efford had called for the party to unite behind Grimes at the leadership convention, Dicks left politics immediately while Efford turned down a cabinet post and resigned in May of that year to enter federal politics.|$|R
500|$|The {{strike on}} the Atlantic Conveyor had now {{rendered}} British forces {{with only one}} serviceable heavy lift helicopter, {{and there were no}} spares, service manuals, lubricants or tools for it. Even so, it was able to carry some 1,500 troops, 95 casualties, 650 POWs and 550 tons of cargo. The first Distinguished Flying Cross was awarded for actions in the Falklands War. ZA718 was on a night mission when pilot Squadron <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Langworthy and his co-pilot Flight Lieutenant Andy Lawless, descended after losing visibility in a thick snow shower, hitting the sea at around 100knots (175km/h) due to a faulty altimeter. The impact threw up spray that flooded the engine intakes but Langworthy and his co-pilot managed to get the helicopter back in the air. The fuselage was damaged, an antenna had been lost and the co-pilot's door had been removed. While the co-pilot door was missing, the crew of Bravo November were unable to navigate or communicate with other forces. Bravo November returned to San Carlos for damage inspection. The impact had caused [...] "little more than dents to the fuselage and damage to the radio systems." [...] Sqn Ldr Langworthy was awarded a DFC for his bravery at the controls of ZA718 during the campaign.|$|E
500|$|No.491 Squadron {{was formed}} in tandem with No.91 Wing on 20October 1950. Headquartered at Iwakuni, it was {{responsible}} for all maintenance of the wing's aircraft except day-to-day servicing. A section was attached to No.77 Squadron in Korea to assist ground staff with daily maintenance. Personnel from Iwakuni were regularly rotated through this section, and augmented by additional No.491 Squadron staff as needed for repair or salvage work. On one occasion, members of No.491 Squadron had to strip components from a Douglas C-47 Dakota of No.30 Communications Unit that had been destroyed when a UN Mustang smashed into its cockpit while landing at Suwon, Korea; {{according to one of}} the Australian ground crew, [...] "There was a fair amount of urgency attached to the job as we could see Mustangs doing strafing runs not too far away." [...] Normal practice was to fly aircraft to Iwakuni for major repairs or scrapping. The regular hours worked by technicians at Iwakuni contrasted with shifts of up to sixteen hours near the front line in Korea. Korea was one of the coldest climates in which RAAF ground crews had ever worked; the commanding officer of No.77 Squadron from September 1950 to August 1951, Squadron <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> Cresswell, recalled seeing maintenance staff with tools frozen to their hands.|$|E
