Nonlinear, finite-element structural analyses, cyclic constitutive behavior models, and an advanced creep-fatigue life prediction method called strainrange partitioning were assessed for their applicability {{to the solution}} of durability problems in hot-section components of gas turbine engines. Three different component or subcomponent geometries are examined: a stress concentration in a turbine disk; a louver lip of a half-scale combustor linear; and a squealer tip of a first-stage high-pressure turbine blade.

The moving cylindrical bars generating the wakes in the experiment were represented by means of appropriate unsteady turbulent inflow conditions. In the simulations, two cases, with and without incoming wakes, were conducted at a Reynolds number of 90, 000 based on chord length and outlet velocity. The results were validated with ex-perimental data. Due to constructive limitations of the experi-mental setup, the incoming boundary layer is very thin, so that some features of the secondary flow are absent or small.

Turbulence is modeled through a low-Reynolds k-ε model, for which a novel artificial viscosity scheme is implemented, ensuring a smooth ε-distribution close to solid walls. The method is used in order to numerically investigate the flow field in three different cascades, namely a highly loaded transonic <b>linear</b> <b>turbine</b> guide vane cascade in six different flow conditions, a transonic steam turbine cascade in two different flow conditions and a low supersonic compressor cascade.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a {{wind power plant}} of megawatt wind turbines operating in derated mode. When operating in this mode, the wind power plant controller is free to distribute power set-points to the individual turbines, {{as long as the}} total power demand is met. In this work, we design a controller that exploits this freedom to reduce the fatigue on the turbines in the wind power plant. We show that the controller can be designed in a decentralized manner, such that each wind turbine is equipped with a local low-complexity controller relying only on few measurements and little communication. As a basis for the controller design, a <b>linear</b> wind <b>turbine</b> model is constructed and verified in an operational wind power plant of megawatt turbines.

40|$|An {{algebraic}} turbulence {{model is}} proposed {{for use with}} three-dimensional Navier-Stokes analyses. It incorporates features of both the Baldwin-Lomax and Cebeci-Smith models. The Baldwin-Lomax model uses the maximum of a function f(v) to determine length and velocity scales. An analysis of the Baldwin-Lomax model shows that f(v) can have a spurious maximum close to the wall, causing numerical problems and non-physical results. The proposed model uses integral relations to determine delta(*) u(sub e) and delta used in the Cebeci-Smith mode. It eliminates a constant in the Baldwin-Lomax model and determines the two remaining constants by comparison to the Cebeci-Smith formulation. Pressure gradient effects, a new wake model, and the implementation of these features in a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code are also described. Results are shown for a flat plate boundary layer, an annular turbine cascade, and endwall heat transfer in a <b>linear</b> <b>turbine</b> cascade. The heat transfer results agree well with experimental data which shows large variations in endwall Stanton number contours with Reynolds number...|$|E
40|$|In {{turbomachinery}} {{the wake}} flow {{together with the}} inherent unsteadiness caused by interaction between stator and rotor has {{a significant impact on}} efficiency and performance. The prediction of the wake flow depends largely on the turbulence modeling. Therefore in this study the evolution of a viscous wake downstream of a <b>linear</b> <b>turbine</b> cascade is experimentally and computationally investigated. In a transonic cascade test stand Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) measurements of velocity and turbulent kinetic energy are done in several axial planes downstream of the blade trailing edge. Two different turbulence models are then incorporated into a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver to calculate the turbulent wake flow and the results are compared with the experimental data to test the quality of the turbulence models.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{numerical simulation}} {{of the flow}} through turbomachinery depends on the correct prediction of boundary-layer transition phenomena. Especially heat transfer and skin friction investigations demand a reliable simulation of the transition process. Therefore, in this work a one-equation transport model for the turbulence weighting factor, which describes the intermittent laminar-turbulent flow, is implemented into a Navier-Stokes solver to simulate transition. The model was originally developed by Steelant and Dick [1] for the use in a conditionally averaged Navier-Stokes solver, and is now adapted for a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver. In comparison to one-dimensional transition models, this new approach models the transition process not only in flow direction but also across the boundary-layer. The method is validated on transitional skin friction experiments on a flat plate (T 3 A test cases) and on heat transfer measurements in a <b>linear</b> <b>turbine</b> cascade done at the VKI. The results show good agreement with the experimental data and prove the usefulness of this new model for transition prediction...|$|E

The computation comprises a periodic single blade that represents the 2 -D Midspan section VSPT blade that was tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility. A commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) software package, Pointwise and CFD++, {{was used for the}} grid generation and RANS and URANS computations. The CFD code, which offers flexibility in terms of turbulence and transition modeling options, was assessed in terms of blade loading, loss, and turning against test data from the transonic tunnel.

The increased size and power requirements of modern turbines have presented new challenges to the more expensive components, particularly the gearboxes.

A simplified magnetic continuously variable transmission (CVT) was included in the wind turbine model. A multi-input linear quadratic regulator (MI LQR) controller was developed and simulated. Simulations of the multi-input controller demonstrated large improvements in speed regulation and torque variation reduction when compared to industry standard proportional-integral blade pitch controllers.

40|$|An {{increase}} in the specific work and cycle efficiency of gas turbines can be achieved through higher turbine entry temperatures. Maintaining adequate life at these high temperatures requires the development of materials and efficient cooling methods. One cooling method that has gained increasing importance is endwall film-cooling, where coolant air is discharged through discrete holes in {{the inner and outer}} endwalls (platforms) of a turbine blade passage. After leaving the holes, the coolant forms a protective layer between the hot mainstream gas and the surface that is to be protected. The ejected coolant interacts with the external flow near the endwall and generates aerodynamic and thermodynamic losses in the process. This reduces turbine stage efficiency and together with the consumption of cooling air is detrimental to the overall cycle efficiency. The keystone of this research project is an experimental investigation using a large-scale low-speed <b>linear</b> <b>turbine</b> cascade. The distribution of adiabatic film-cooling effectiveness on the endwall of this cascade has been measured using a new technique that has been developed as part of this project.
