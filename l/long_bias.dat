40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the antenna design parameter dependency on the impedance and radiation {{characteristics of a}} terahertz coplanar stripline dipole antenna. The antenna response is numerically investigated by applying a semi-infinite substrate and by generating a constant voltage source to drive a signal on the antenna. In this way, we can analyze the antenna characteristics without the photoconductive material response and the substrate lens geometrical effects. Further, we explain the mechanism underlying the preferable uses of several millimeter length DC bias striplines in a typical THz coplanar stripline dipole antenna design. The antenna, consisting of a center dipole connected to <b>long</b> <b>bias</b> striplines, has a traveling wave characteristic supporting an attenuated current, rather than a resonant characteristic supporting a standing wave of current. The traveling wave behavior produces stable antenna input impedances and minimal changes in the antenna radiation patterns.

For a price-taker, the Tradesports "Vegas-line" point spread had a 2. 2 % total takeout including exchange fees, about half of the 4. 55 % takeout of traditional legal bookmakers. Contracts with a price around 50, creating even money returns to bets on both teams, and higher volume contracts, had lower transaction costs. Participants were found to prefer the Las Vegas line point spread contract followed by the straight-up contract.

Fourteen F 1 Red Angus x Nellore averaging 12 months and 287 kg were used. The animals were fed with elephant grass silage, corn silage or signal grass hay and supplemented or not with 20 % of concentrate.

Both empirical and physics-based methods provide good predictions of observations at short vibration periods in an average sense.

However, correctly resolving {{the nature of the}} primitive vertebrate dentition is challenged by a dearth of evidence on dental development in primitive osteichthyans. Jaw elements from the Silurian–Devonian stem-osteichthyans Lophosteus and Andreolepis have been described to bear a dentition arranged in longitudinal rows and vertical files, reminiscent of a pattern of successional development. We tested this inference, using synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to reveal the pattern of skeletal development preserved in the sclerochronology of the mineralized tissues. The tooth-like tubercles represent focal elaborations of dentine within otherwise continuous sheets of the dermal skeleton, present in at least three stacked generations. Thus, the tubercles are not discrete modular teeth and their arrangement into rows and files is a feature of the dermal ornamentation that does not reflect a polarity of development or linear succession.

40|$|According to the {{instructional}} failure hypothesis, the contextual similarity of the intertrial interval (ITI) and the delay interval (DI) {{is responsible for}} the choose-short bias that occurs when memory for filled intervals is tested. This hypothesis may also explain the choose-long bias for empty intervals, if birds confuse an extended DI with a long empty interval. In the present study, pigeons were trained in a within-subjects design to discriminate durations of a filled interval (2 -s and 8 -s of light), and durations of an empty interval (2 -s and 8 -s bound by two 1 -s light markers). In order to disambiguate the ITI, sample presentation phase, and the DI, the colour displayed on the video monitor was different during the various phases of a trial. In Experiment 1, the ITI was magenta, the sample presentation phase was dark, and the DI was grey. Although accuracy was greater for short than for long samples, the retention functions were parallel. Thus, {{there was no evidence of}} a biased-forgetting effect. In Experiment 2, additional tests indicated that the interval from the offset of the ITI to the onset of the DI, as well as the filled and empty intervals themselves affected choice responding in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, the colour displayed on the video monitor was manipulated such that the illumination was magenta during the ITI, and dark during the sample presentation and comparison phases in order to prevent pigeons timing from the ITI offset to the DI onset, and to create confusion for one interval-type, but not the other. A choose-long bias was obtained for empty intervals, and no-bias was obtained for filled intervals. In Experiment 4, the colour displayed on the video monitor was manipulated such that the illumination was dark during the ITI and sample presentation phase, and grey during the comparison phase in order to prevent pigeons from timing from ITI offset to DI onset, and to eliminate the possibility of confusion for both filled and empty intervals. The results of this experiment revealed no biases for either filled or empty intervals. In Experiment 5, the colour displayed on the video monitor was dark for all of the phases of the trial in order to create confusion, and thus produce the choose-short and <b>long</b> <b>biases.</b> The results of this experiment revealed no bias for filled intervals, and a choose-long bias for empty intervals.
