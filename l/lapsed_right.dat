The priority was the concept of special and not contractual nature of corporate relations. The result of developed dispute was large-scale changes in the legislation of the Russian Federation on legal entities.

The <b>lapse</b> of the <b>right</b> of participation is associated primarily with the disappearance of one of the parties of the membership relationship. It is either a liquidation of the corporation, the output of member of the corporation, or conclusion of disposing civil transactions.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to decrease the emergence of specific intellectual property risks within the production process as well as increasing risk management performance of IP by preventing them. In order to achieve this, previous studies regarding the main specific intellectual property risks from industrial companies were analyzed together with their managerial methods as well as the possibility of reducing their emergence. As a result of the research conducted were identified five types of intellectual property risks that have a high potential of emergence in the production process, namely: the risk of production of goods in violation of IP rights; the know-how, production knowledge and trade secret disclosure risk; the technological risk of unprotected utility models; the technological risk of unprotected integrated circuits topographies and finally the risk of product counterfeit. In order to achieve the {{main purpose of}} our investigation, we have proposed new formulas for estimating the specific intellectual property risks identified in the production process. Their purpose was to minimalize the risk’s negative effects on industrial companies and to increase the managerial performance from the intellectual property domain through a new type of management appropriately named: intellectual property management.

These questions include whether the Convention and the case law of the Strasbourg Court, the monitoring mechanisms of the Council of Europe, EU law and the case law of the European Court of Justice enhance the protection of vulnerable groups and expand the protection of their rights, or, alternatively, whether they are mainly used to fill in relatively minor gaps or occasional <b>lapses</b> in national <b>rights</b> guarantees.
