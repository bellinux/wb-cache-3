5|$|Edward I's {{frequent}} military campaigns put a great financial {{strain on}} the nation. There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war, including customs duties, money lending and lay subsidies. In 1275, EdwardI negotiated {{an agreement with the}} domestic merchant community that secured a permanent duty on wool. In 1303, a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants, in return for certain rights and privileges. The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi, a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy. This was in return for their service as money <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> the crown, which helped finance the Welsh Wars. When the war with France broke out, the French king confiscated the Riccardi's assets, and the bank went bankrupt. After this, the Frescobaldi of Florence took over the role as money <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> the English crown.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s {{corruption}} in Texas {{at the state}} and county level was in decline, while pressure against vice across the state and across the nation was on the rise. Even San Antonio's famed Sporting District, once one of the nation's largest red-light districts, was shut down in 1941. As state investigations of the Maceos' activities became more serious, Sam and Rose began plans to move their empire to Nevada. The Maceos became major investors in the Desert Inn, which was the largest and most elaborate casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip when it opened in 1950. Moe Dalitz (who opened the Desert Inn) and Sam Maceo had long been allies and business partners. The Las Vegas project's financing was largely facilitated by the Maceos and Moodys through ANICO (which loaned millions to known mob figures). Soon ANICO was one of the largest <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> Las Vegas casinos. Sam and Rose Maceo transferred controlling interest of most of their Galveston empire to a new group dominated by the Fertitta family, with investments coming from business interests around the island. The Fertitta group never wielded the influence that the Maceos had (though a generation later Tilman and Frank Fertitta came to be major entertainment magnates themselves). Sam Maceo died in 1951 and Rose in 1954.|$|E

Rumors of low cash reserves dragged Bear's stock price down while <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> Bear began to withdraw their cash. The Federal Reserve funneled an emergency loan to Bear through JP Morgan Chase. (As an investment bank, Bear could not borrow from the Fed but JP Morgan Chase, a commercial bank, could).|$|E
25|$|According to a 2000 United States Department of the Treasury {{study of}} lending trends in 305 U.S. cities between 1993 and 1998, $467 billion in {{mortgage}} credit flowed from CRA-covered <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> low- and medium-income borrowers and areas. In that period, {{the total number}} of loans to poorer Americans by CRA-eligible institutions rose by 39% while loans to wealthier individuals by CRA-covered institutions rose by 17%.

In total, they requested and additional $122billion, which would bring the overall projected production cost to $188 billion. The uranium enriched power plants only requested a total of $4billion, which was later accepted by both the NRC and DOE.

25|$|On June 1, 2008, Philadelphia Media Holdings missed its {{interest}} payment on US$85 million in junior loans. Philadelphia Media Holdings missed the payment because it didn't maintain debt-to-cash flow ratio its senior lenders required so they blocked the payment. The company began negotiations with its <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> restructure its debt and in October 2008 Philadelphia Media Holdings deferred paying {{its interest}} payment despite having {{the money to}} do so. Charged $13.4 million in penalty interest and fees, Philadelphia Media Holdings continued negotiations with lenders until February 20, 2009, when the talks collapsed. Late the next day Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the papers, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Philadelphia Media Holdings hoped to restructure its US$390 million in debt it incurred when buying the newspapers.|$|E

25|$|International Harvester never {{recovered}} from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. Rising interest rates, demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> refinance $4.15 billion of its debt {{in a bid to}} avoid bankruptcy. On January 20, 1982, the UAW rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW opened negotiations in March 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 19791980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, {{established}} in August 2006 {{for the purpose}} of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets. Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans. In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.|$|E
25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees â for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E

25|$|After a seven-month process, the Rangers' {{bankruptcy}} was finalized by an August 5 auction for {{ownership of}} the team by two parties, Rangers Baseball Express led by Ryan and Greenberg, and a partnership of Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Crane. The auction was delayed by several hours due to objections raised by Greenberg and Ryan's group questioning the qualification of the Cuban-Crane bid, which was due no later than 8:00 pm on August 3. The auction, which was due to begin at 9:00 am on August 4, did not have its first opening bid determined until 2:50 pm. After {{no more than three}} bids by each party, Cuban withdrew from the bidding, and Greenberg and Ryan were declared the winners shortly after midnight. Due to the auction process, the purchase was for only the MLB club and the lease for the ballpark. Almost none of the original side deals with HSG and Hicks, which were rejected by several of the <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> the Texas Rangers, were included.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{question}} may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some {{advocates of the}} free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's The Good Society. It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and <b>lenders</b> <b>to</b> this corporation {{to decide whether or not}} they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.|$|E
