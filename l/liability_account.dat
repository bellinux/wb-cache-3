25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (<b>liability)</b> <b>account</b> in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} {{individuals}} see debits and credits {{in the above}} manner, is that the bank statement presented by the bank to the customer is the bank's view of the account. The bank views money in a chequing account as money the bank owes to the customer, i.e. a liability, and in the rules of accounting, an increase to a <b>liability</b> <b>account</b> is a credit. Likewise, when a bank lends money to a customer and places the money into the customer's chequing account, the bank has increased its obligation to pay that money, which is a liability, and this increase is a credit and appears in the credit column of a bank statement.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "X" [...] in {{the debit}} column denotes the {{increasing}} {{effect of a}} transaction on the asset account balance (total debits less total credits), because a debit to an asset account is an increase.

2500|$|From the bank's {{point of}} view, when a debit card {{is used to}} pay a merchant, the payment causes a {{decrease}} in the amount of money the bank owes to the cardholder. From the bank's point of view, your debit card account is the bank's liability. [...] A decrease to the bank's <b>liability</b> <b>account</b> is a debit. From the bank's point of view, when a credit card is used to pay a merchant, the payment causes an increase in the amount of money the bank is owed by the cardholder. From the bank's point of view, your credit card account is the bank's asset. An increase to the bank's asset account is a debit. Hence, using a debit card or credit card causes a debit to the cardholder's account in either situation when viewed from the bank's perspective.|$|E

50|$|The {{indirect}} method uses net-income {{as a starting}} point, makes adjustments for all transactions for non-cash items, then adjusts from all cash-based transactions.

50|$|In double-entry bookkeeping, {{expenses}} are recorded as a debit to an expense account (an income statement account) and {{a credit to}} either an asset account or a <b>liability</b> <b>account,</b> which are balance sheet accounts.

50|$|Revenues {{and gross}} profit are {{recognized}} each period {{based on the}} construction progress, in other words, the percentage of completion.

As stated before, total expense to be recognized refers to an estimate, because the price of the stock is likely to change before the SARs are redeemed for cash. Again, the journal entry to recognize a positive compensation expense related to SARs consists of a debit to compensation expense and a credit to liability under SAR plan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{debate around}} [...] "Other postemployment benefits" [...] is a {{relatively}} new one since states and municipalities have only been required to report their OPEB liabilities since 2008. However, in that short time it has become clear that OPEBs represent a large financial burden and may even pose a larger problem than pension benefits themselves. In 2010, the total unfunded liability for state OPEBs was assessed to be $590 billion. In 2013 alone, OPEBs cost states $48 billion, which represented 4% of state-generated revenue.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: There is {{substantial}} {{evidence of a}} link between parental substance use disorders and antisocial behavior and childhood disruptive disorders in offspring, but {{it is unclear whether}} this transmission is specific to particular disorders or if a general <b>liability</b> <b>accounts</b> for familial resemblance. The authors examined whether the association between parental externalizing disorders and childhood disruptive disorders in preadolescent offspring {{is a result of the}} transmission of general or disorder-specific liabilities and estimated the genetic and environmental contributions to variation in these general and specific liability indicators. METHOD: Participants were 1, 069 families consisting of 11 -year-old twins and their biological mother and father. Structural equation modeling was used to simultaneously estimate the general and specific transmission effects of four parental externalizing disorders (conduct disorder, adult antisocial behavior, alcohol dependence, and drug dependence) on childhood disruptive disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder). RESULTS: Parent-child resemblance was accounted for by the transmission of a general liability to externalizing disorders, and this general liability was highly heritable. Specific effects were also detected, but for sibling rather than parental transmission. Specific genetic and nonshared environmental effects were detected for each childhood disruptive disorder, but only conduct disorder exhibited a significant shared environmental effect. CONCLUSIONS: A highly heritable general <b>liability</b> <b>accounts</b> for the parent-child transmission of externalizing psychopathology from parents to their preadolescent offspring. This general liability should be a focus of research for both etiology and intervention...|$|R
