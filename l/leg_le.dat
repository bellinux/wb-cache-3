[La] {{is commonly used}} to define the metabolic stress of an exercise and depends on the lactate production, transportation, metabolism, and elimination. This investigation compared multiple set training of different volumes to show the influence of exercise volume on [La]. Ten male subjects performed 3 sets of resistance exercises within 4 separate sessions: Arm Curl with 1 or 2 arms (AC 1 or AC 2), and Leg Extension with 1 or 2 <b>legs</b> (<b>LE</b> 1 or LE 2). Each set was performed at a standard velocity and at a previously determined 10 RM load. Blood lactate samples were taken immediately before and after each set (pre 1, post 1, pre 2, post 2, pre 3, post 3). Maximum [La] was significantly higher after LE 2 (6. 8 ± 1. 6 mmol·L- 1) and significantly lower after AC 1 (2. 8 ± 0. 7 mmol·L- 1) {{in comparison with the}} other exercise protocols. There was no difference between AC 2 (4. 3 ± 1. 1 mmol·L- 1) and LE 1 (4. 4 ± 1. 1 mmol·L- 1). Surprisingly, [La] decreased during the 3 rd set (for AC exercise), and during both the 2 nd and 3 rd sets (for LE exercise) and increased only during the recovery phases. In contrast to our expectations, blood [La] decreased during the 2 nd and 3 rd exercise sets and further increased only during recovery phases. However, from the increases observed following the first set, we know that lactate was produced and transported to the blood during our exercise protocol. We speculate that lactate is taken up and metabolized by distal muscle fibres or organs. In addition, as the decreases occurred within a short period of time, blood volume shifts and/or the muscle-to-blood gradient may account for the rapid decreases in [La]...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of two resistance exercise (RE) protocols with different rest intervals between sets on oxidative stress and exercise-induced muscle damage. For this purpose, twenty untrained males voluntarily participated in the research and were randomly assigned to one of two resistance exercise groups: a) a shorter inter-set rest interval of 90 second (RI- 90; n= 10); or b) a longer rest interval of 180 second (RI- 180; n= 10). Resistance exercise in both groups consisted of chest press (CP), “lat” pull down (LP), <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE),</b> <b>leg</b> curl (LC), and back squat (BS) exercises; these were done at a load of six repetitions maximum (6 RM). Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein preexercise, immediately post-exercise, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-exercise, and analyzed for malondiadehyde (MDA) concentration and creatine kinase (CK) activity. The results indicated that both RI- 90 and RI- 180 caused significant changes in the MDA response (p=. 003 and p=. 036 in RI- 90 and RI- 180, respectively); MDA significantly increased six hours post-resistance exercise in both groups. Creatine kinase activity significantly increased at the 24 -hour point post-exercise in both groups and continued for 48 hours postexercise (p=. 000 for RI- 90 and RI- 180).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the workout volume (sets × repetitions per set) completed during two lower body resistance exercise sessions that incorporated 1 -minute vs. 3 -minute rest intervals between the sets and exercises. For this reason, thirteen trained men completed two experimental sessions that consisted of 4 lower body exercises – leg press (LP), <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE),</b> <b>leg</b> curl (LC) and parallel squat (PS), performed for three sets with 80 % 1 RM load. The two experimental sessions differed only in the length of the rest interval between the sets and exercises; one session with a 1 -minute and the other session with a 3 -minute rest interval. The results demonstrated that for each exercise a significantly greater workout volume was completed when resting interval lasted 3 minutes between the sets and exercises (LP: 48. 42 ± 3. 38 vs. 58. 17 ± 3. 01; LE: 47. 04 ± 2. 52 vs. 57. 81 ± 2. 04; LC: 38. 01 ± 2. 79 vs. 53. 61 ± 2. 64 and PS: 33. 03 ± 2. 25 vs. 51. 87 ± 2. 01 for 1 -minute vs. 3 -minute rest interval, respectively).

Thus {{the purpose of}} this study was to investigate the acute cardiovascular responses of cardiac patients to a strength training protocol. Fourteen cardiac patients (13 male, 1 female; mean age 57. 2 ± 7. 0 years) performed three sets at each of four Nautilus machines, including <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE),</b> <b>leg</b> adduction (LA), arm cross (AC), and bicep curl (BC). Fifteen, twelve, and eight repetitions were performed at 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % of one repetition maximum (1 RM) respectively. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the electrocardiogram were recorded during the last three to four repetitions of each set. No angina, ST segment depression, or significant arrhythmias occurred during nautilus exercise (NE), save one subject who had runs of bigeminy and trigeminy between sets. The mean peak NE responses were less than the mean responses achieved at 85 % of maximal oxygen uptake, except for DBP which exceeded 85 % by 1 - 13 mmHg during all sets of LE and during LA at 60 % and 80 %. Clinical exercise testing guidelines were exceeded once by one subject. During lower body exercise, peak responses were significantly greater during LE than LA and were significantly greater at 60 % and 80 % than at 40 %. During upper body exercise, HR response was significantly greater during BC than AC at all three intensities, and rate pressure product (RPP) was significantly higher at 60 % and 80 % than at 40 %.

Nine male subjects underwent three experimental conditions: ballistic stretching (BS); passive static stretching (PSS); and a specific warm-up (SW). The RTS was composed of three sets of 12 RM for the following exercises: leg press 45 (LP), <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE),</b> <b>leg</b> curl (LC), and plantar flexors (PF). Performance of six sessions was assessed 48 hours apart. The first visit consisted of a familiarization session including stretching methods and exercises used in the RTS.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the hypotensive {{responses}} of reciprocal supersets (SS) versus traditional training (TRAD) methods. Thirteen men with at least five years of recreational experience in resistance training (RT) volunteered for the study. When completing the TRAD protocol, participants performed the following exercises separately in sequence: chest press (CP), low row (LR), <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE),</b> <b>leg</b> curl (LC), pull down (PD), and shoulder press (SP). The SS method required participants to complete the same exercises as in the TRAD protocol, but exercises were coupled such that muscles sequentially served both as an agonist for lift one and then antagonist for lift two and vice versa. Exercise order used was CP and LR, LE and LC, and PD and SP with 10 repetition maximum loads. Blood pressure (BP) was measured before and for every 10 minutes for one hour after training. There was significantly more total work (TW) done in the TRAD condition compared to SS. Post exercise hypotension was evident only after the TRAD session at minutes 30 and 40 for systolic BP. Significant differences between the TRAD and SS methods were found at 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and 40 minutes for systolic BP. There was no significant two-way interaction for group × time for diastolic BP. There was a significant two-way interaction for group × time for mean arterial pressure. Significant reductions for mean arterial pressure (MAP) occurred only in the TRAD method after 30 to 40 minutes compared to the baseline values. Therefore, a TRAD RT method was sufficient to cause a hypotensive effect after the training session whereas the SS method did not reveal significant decreases in BP after the session. However, these findings are important to elucidate concerns regarding the post-exercise hypotension after RT and showed that TW might be the key to promote these changes because the volume of training was shown to be an important training variable to manipulate and might be associated with BP hypotension after RT...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The spatial {{distribution}} of biological legacies left by natural disturbances is {{an important source of}} variabil-ity in forest development. We investigated one type of biological legacy: remnant old-growth trees persisting in mature Douglas-fir forests. We hypothesized that persistence varies with topographic heterogeneity influencing fire behavior. Our two study areas are located in the southern Washington Cascade Range, USA. They have an unfragmented, mature forest cover that regenerated following wildfire. We mapped all remnant old-growth trees (live and dead) within 4. 2 – 6. 4 km long belt transects. Digital elevation models were used to generate convergent and divergent landform classes. Frequency analysis was used to test for landform associations. Live remnant western hemlock and western redcedar were strongly associated with convergent landforms and aspects that had greater availability of soil moisture. Live rem-nant Douglas-fir were most abundant, but were not correlated with convergence or divergence, although certain land-forms had higher concentrations. Remnant snags were abundant across convergent and divergent landforms. We conclude that species with low fire resistance survive most frequently on landforms that have a dampening effect on fire intensity. Topographic variability may indirectly influence ecological functions associated with biological legacies by affecting the {{spatial distribution}}s of remnant old-growth trees.

Intervention: At {{the end of a}} preliminary one-month in-hospital rehabilitation programme (baseline), 52 patients were randomly assigned either to a structured educational programme (intervention group) of daily incremental physical activity at home (walking and skeletal muscle resistance training, with booklets and written instructions) or to a programme of general advice (control group) regarding exercise and long-term fitness. Main measures: Both groups were evaluated at baseline and every three months for: (1) time, metabolic equivalents (METs), and heart rate reserve (HRR) during a standardized 2 -km walking test (2 kmWT); (2) anthropometric measures (body weight, BMI, abdominal and neck circumference); (3) the Polar Fitness Test index (PFTI), and (4) time to exhaustion while sustaining consecutive isoload extensions in the dominant <b>leg</b> (isoload <b>LE).</b> Time during 2 kmWT was the study primary outcome.

40|$|Background: Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} muscular endurance resistance training (MERT) is conducive in improving the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA). However, the metabolic response and time course for adaption is still unclear. Objective: The aims {{of the current study}} were to evaluate and track the metabolic response to an individual session of MERT as well as to assess performance adaptations of supplementing an aerobic exercise training program with four weeks of MERT. Methods: Seventeen aerobically active men were randomly assigned to either the experimental (EX) or control group (CON), 9 EX and 8 CON. Baseline measures included a graded exercise test (GXT) and 1 -repetition maximum (1 RM) testing for leg press (LP), leg curl (LC), and <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE).</b> CON continued their regular aerobic activity while the EX supplemented their regular aerobic exercise with 4 weeks of MERT. Results: No significant group differences were observed for all pre-training variables. Following four weeks of training no significant differences in cardiorespiratory or metabolic variables were observed for either group. However, significant improvements in LC and LE 1 -RM were observed in EX compared to CON. Substantial accumulations in blood lactate were observed following each MERT session. Conclusion: Four weeks of MERT did not improve cardiorespiratory or metabolic variables, but did significantly improve LC and LE. MERT was also observed to induce a blood lactate response similar to that of HIIT. These findings suggest greater than four weeks is need to see metabolic adaptations conducive for improved aerobic performance using MERT...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to establish the relationship between the aerobic, anaerobic dry land performances to the swimming performance in professional swimmers. 60 healthy National level swimmers aged 16 to 35 (mean= 20. 3 ± 3. 10) years were recruited for the study. Swimming performance was measured for the endurance and speed (i. e. 50 x 6 m & 25 x 2 m) after a standard warm up and, the aerobic capacity was measured using VO 2 Max Treadmill Machine. 6 Repetitive Maximum (6 RM) was used as the baseline method for the measurement of strength. Upper limb and lower limb strength was evaluated by bench press (BP) and <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE)</b> using the free weight barbell respectively. Results indicated that there was a strong association between the performance of professional swimmers and that of aerobic dry land performance, where the VO 2 max was found to be positively correlated to the swimming performance(r 300 =. 343 and r 50 =. 426). However the results also indicated that anaerobic dry land performance does not contribute significantly to swimming performance (r 300 (LE) = 0. 149, r 50 (BP) = 0. 018 and r 300 (BP) = 0. 081, r 50 (LE) = 0. 105).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effect of orders of {{resistance}} exercise, on the number of repetitions performed, rating of perceived exertion and muscle damage biomarkers. Method: One week after the 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) test, 11 healthy untrained male participants completed two resistance exercise protocols including 4 sets of 4 exercises at 70 % 1 RM, with 2  min rest intervals between sets, exercises performed until failure and different orders: order A including: hack squat (HS), leg press (LP), <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE),</b> and <b>leg</b> curl (LC), while order B was opposed to order A (LC, LE, LP, HS). Results: Increase of CK activity and lactate concentration was the same for order A and order B (P >  0. 05). The total mean number of repetitions for HS and LC indicated a significant decrease (P <  0. 05) when they were performed later in each exercise orders; however, no significant difference in the average of total number of exercise repetition was observed for neither resistance exercise orders (order A =  8. 59  ±  1. 61, order B =  8. 78  ±  1. 96). Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was not significantly different between the exercise orders; however, the RPE increases for HS and LC when they were the last exercise orders. Conclusion: It can be concluded that both of the resistance exercise orders were equally effective in muscle damage parameters (CK, lactate), RPE and the average of the total number of exercise repetitions, although when the exercise session progressed, the number of repetitions performed to volitional failure decreased in last exercise in one single order, and the exercise order can influence performance...|$|R

Little {{is known about}} the {{sensation of}} Be and Le and their correlates in hypobaric hypoxia although increased sensation mediated by the carotid may be expected (Ward & Whipp, J Physiol 1989). Fourteen healthy subjects (age 41 [14], mean[SD] yr, height 176 [3]cm, weight 75 [9]kg) did an incremental (30 watt/ 3 min) cyclergometer test until volitional exertion (Wmax), while heart rate (Hr), ventilation (Ve), respiratory rate (Rr), saturation (Sat), and esophageal pressure (Pes) were monitored. At each power output the subjects indicated their Be and Le on a modified Borg scale (1 - 10). Experiments were done at sea level and after acclimatization to 4560 m. At altitude Wmax was 15 [8]% lower; Hr was higher, Ve was higher, Rr was higher and Sat was lower at all power outputs. Both exponential Le and Be vs. power relationships were shifted upward in hypoxia, but for Be more so than for Le. The slope of the linear relationship between dPes and Be was steeper in hypoxia. The increased respiratory muscle effort (increased dPes) only partially correlated to the increased Be, the remainder being explained by the progressive drop in Sat from 86 [4] at rest to 74 [7]. It follows that in conditions of natural hypobaric hypoxia the ‘dyspneogenic‘ effect from the stimulation of the carotid bodies amplifies breathing effort sensation beyond that related to the respiratory muscle effort only. Whether such a mechanism also plays a role in the increase in Le remains an open question...|$|R
40|$|Sous la {{direction}} de E. Lorans et X. RodierThis {{contribution is}} a methodology-oriented discussion over how analysts of heritage architecture {{can handle the}} parameter time. The paper first argues {{that we are not}} equally equipped (in terms of concepts, in terms of computer formalisms) to handle space & time, in particular when dealing with historical data sets where lacks and doubts are key. Focus is then put on time, and we observe that relevant contributions to the problem of time-oriented data, and to the uncertainty issue, have lately emerged in the visual analytics scientific community. We then propose a categorisation of the notion of uncertainty, and finally introduce and exemplify generic characteristics of the parameter time in order to reinforce the analyst's capacity to perform cumulative, comparison-rich, reasoning tasks. Dans cette contribution nous nous interrogerons sur une entrée par le paramètre temps, donc sur comment caractériser et visualiser un moment, une période, un cycle, un ordre en tant que tels, autrement dit sur comment raisonner sur le paramètre temps. Nous le faisons en prenant appui sur <b>les</b> <b>legs</b> et apports de la communauté infovis (information visualisation) en la matière...|$|R
50|$|On the 3rd of April 2008, Muhannad Abu Diah {{went out}} to bring some things for his family where his car broke down and stopped it {{on the side of}} the road. He thought that the place is safe but whiile he was fixing his car, a {{collision}} happened when a speeding car hit him along with his car in a horrific traffic accident. The accident results his brain injury and caused his blindness. And doctors negligence led to the amputation of his right leg, the doctor in charge neglected his <b>leg</b> for a <b>ling</b> time and did not treat it as it should be treated which led to gangrene and had to amputate his leg. He then was in a coma for 20 days. A title was published in a newspaper about the accident stated (A horrible accident narrate the end of the Saudi inventor Muhannad Abu Diah). After that Muhannad said: that this title was hard on him more than the accident because of its negativity. The news of the accidents in online newspapers, however, he was back after the accident to his activities stronger and more focused.|$|R

One repetition maximum (1 RM) was determined on two separate visits on three tasks: leg press (LP), <b>leg</b> extension (<b>LE),</b> and bicep curl (BC). Subjects then completed repetitions to failure on each of the three tasks during two visits, a minimum of 48 hours apart, at either 60 % 1 RM or 80 % 1 RM. High reliability for all 1 RM assessments was observed. Greater muscular strength was observed in younger compared to older men and women on all tasks (P< 0. 05). At both 60 % and 80 % 1 RM, considerable interindividual variability was observed {{in the number of}} repetitions completed. However, the average number of repetitions completed by younger and older men and women at 60 % and 80 % 1 RM {{in each of the three}} tasks was similar, with the only significant difference occurring between younger and older men at 80 % 1 RM on the leg press (P= 0. 0258). We did not observe any abnormal blood pressure responses to either the 1 RM testing or maximal repetition testing sessions. Considerable interindividual variability was observed in the number of repetitions completed by younger and older men and women at relative intensities typical of resistance training programs. Practitioners should give consideration to individual variability when attempting to maximize the benefits of resistance training.
