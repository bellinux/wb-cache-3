25|$|By 1964, the Democratic {{lock on the}} South {{remained}} strong, but cracks {{began to}} appear. One long-term cause was that the region was becoming more {{like the rest of}} the nation and could not <b>long</b> <b>stand</b> apart in terms of racial segregation. Modernization brought factories, businesses and larger cities as well as millions of migrants from the North, as far more people graduated from high school and college. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco basis of the traditional South faded away as former farmers moved to town or commuted to factory jobs. Segregation, requiring separate dining and lodging arrangements for employees, was a serious obstacle to business development.|$|E
25|$|When Kline joined Mackay, Australia were 207-9 and {{appeared}} doomed, {{for there was}} still one hour and fifty minutes playing time remaining. Only two minutes later, Sobers, fielding only four yards from the bat, appealed confidently for a catch from Mackay off Worrell, but Egar ruled {{that it was not}} out. In one of the great rearguard actions, the pair proceeded to play out the remaining time. Mackay was a capable batsman but Kline was a bowler and less used to being asked to make a <b>long</b> <b>stand</b> at the crease. In his thirteen Tests Kline never exceeded the 15 not out that he made on this occasion. Mackay's 62 not out occupied 223 balls, and Kline's score was made from 109. Their unbroken last wicket stand added 66, though the runs were almost an irrelevance.|$|E

Their coats are short and range in color from reddish brown, to grey, to nearly black, with the notable {{exceptions}} of the Malayan tapir, {{which has a}} white, saddle-shaped marking on its back, and the mountain tapir, which has longer, woolly fur. All tapirs have oval, white-tipped ears, rounded, protruding rumps with stubby tails, and splayed, hooved toes, with four toes on the front feet and three on the hind feet, which help them to walk on muddy and soft ground. Baby tapirs of all types have striped-and-spotted coats for camouflage. Females have {{a single pair of}} mammary glands, and males have long penises relative to their body size.|$|E

2500|$|Partially {{based on}} the {{calculations}} of Darwin, an important criticism was given by Henri Poincaré in 1908. He concluded that the attraction is proportional to , where S is earth's molecular surface area, v is the velocity of the particles, and ρ is {{the density of the}} medium. Following Laplace, he argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for S is at the most a ten-millionth of the Earth's surface. Now, drag (i.e. the resistance of the medium) is proportional to Sρv and therefore the ratio of drag to attraction is inversely proportional to Sv. To reduce drag, Poincaré calculated a lower limit for v = 24 · 1017 times the speed of light. So there are lower limits for Sv and v, and an upper limit for S and with those values one can calculate the produced heat, which is proportional to Sρv3. The calculation shows that earth's temperature would rise by 1026 degrees per second. Poincaré noticed, [...] "that the earth could not <b>long</b> <b>stand</b> such a regime." [...] Poincaré also analyzed some wave models (Tommasina and Lorentz), remarking that they suffered the same problems as the particle models. To reduce drag, superluminal wave velocities were necessary, and they would still be subject to the heating problem. After describing a similar re-radiation model like Thomson, he concluded: [...] "Such are the complicated hypotheses to which we are led when we seek to make Le Sage's theory tenable".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1953 season, England entered the summer facing a Test series against Australia, who had held the Ashes since 1934, captained by Lindsay Hassett. Critics {{considered}} that England had a good chance of regaining the Ashes following their form in 1952, but Australia remained confident, particularly after winning six of their first eight games by an innings (including a victory over Yorkshire). Once the Tests began, Hutton began well with scores of 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test. He had gone into the match with a cloud over his fitness following a shoulder injury, but top-scored in both innings. However, England's dismissal for just 144 in their first innings made Hutton doubtful about England's prospects for the series; only 14 wickets for Alec Bedser kept England in the match before rain came. Before the second Test, Hutton scored two fifties against the Australians for Yorkshire, but his fitness again came into question before the Test, this time with fibrositis. His movement was restricted while fielding, and he dropped three catches in Australia's first innings, injuring his thumb in the process. Despite these problems, Hutton scored 145 when he batted in England's first innings, reaching 2,000 Test runs against Australia in the process. He added 168 with Tom Graveney, batting with great freedom. Hutton shared another century stand with Compton, surviving a difficult spell with the new ball. Wisden said that the [...] "sight of England batsmen giving free rein to their strokes brought undisguised delight to many who had bemoaned the lack of aggression in so much Test cricket. The spectacle was glorious to behold." [...] The second innings was a different story, with Hutton dismissed early chasing a winnings total of 343, and it took a <b>long</b> <b>stand</b> between Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey to allow England to escape with a draw after a batting collapse.|$|E

60|$|Nearly two {{thousand}} years ago there was a brave captain whose name was Julius Caesar. The soldiers he led to battle were very strong, and conquered the people wherever they went. They had no gun or gunpowder then; but they had swords and spears, and, to prevent themselves from being hurt, they had helmets or brazen caps on their heads, with long tufts of horse-hair upon them, by way of ornament, and breast-plates of brass on their breasts, and on their arms they carried a sort of screen, made of strong leather. One of them carried a little brass figure of an eagle on a long pole, with a scarlet flag flying below, and wherever the eagle was seen, they all followed, and fought so bravely that nothing could <b>long</b> <b>stand</b> against them.|$|E

60|$|So {{they stayed}} there, hearkening to the groans and prayers of the terrified {{multitude}} about them, Dick holding the bridle of the horse, which shook {{from head to}} foot, but never stirred. For some minutes they remained thus, till suddenly the sky began to lighten, but with no natural light.

Lighter and lighter and redder and redder it grew, the <b>long</b> <b>stand</b> and the pavilions became visible, and after them the dense, deep ring of spectators.
