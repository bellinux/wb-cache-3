25|$|Night blindness—the {{inability}} to see well in dim light—is {{associated with a}} deficiency of vitamin A. At first, the most <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> (containing more retinal) protein rhodopsin is influenced. Less pigmented retinal iodopsins (three forms/colors in humans), responsible for color vision and sensing relatively high light intensities (day vision), are less impaired at {{early stages of the}} vitamin A deficiency. All these protein-pigment complexes are located in the light-sensing cells in eye's retina.|$|E
25|$|Net-casting spiders of genus Deinopis {{have their}} {{posterior}} median eyes enlarged into large forward-facing compound lenses. These eyes {{have a wide}} field of view {{and are able to}} gather available light more efficiently than the eyes of cats and owls. This is {{despite the fact that they}} lack a tapetum lucidum; instead, each night a large area of <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> membrane is manufactured within the eyes, and since arachnid eyes do not have irises, it is rapidly destroyed again at dawn.|$|E
25|$|The galaxy Maffei 1 was {{discovered}} on a hyper-sensitized I-N photographic plate exposed on 29 September 1967 with the Schmidt telescope at Asiago Observatory. Maffei found Maffei 1, together with its companion spiral galaxy Maffei 2, while searching for diffuse nebulae and T Tauri stars. The object had an apparent size up to 50″ {{in the near}} infrared but was not visible on the corresponding blue <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> plate. Its spectrum lacked any emission or absorption lines. Later it was shown to be radio-quiet as well. In 1970 Hyron Spinrad suggested that Maffei 1 is a nearby heavily obscured giant elliptical galaxy. Maffei 1 would be among the ten brightest galaxies in the northern sky if not situated behind the Milky Way.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the photorefractive {{sensitivity}} defined for single-centre holographic recording {{is modified to}} adapt two-centre holographic recording. Based on the time analytic solution of Kukhtarev equations for doubly doped crystals, the analytical expression of photorefractive sensitivity is given. For comparison with single-centre holographic recording and summing the electron competition effects between the deeper and shallower traps, an effective electron transport length is proposed, which varies with the intensity ratios of recording <b>light</b> to <b>sensitive</b> <b>light.</b> According to analyses in this paper, the lower photorefractive sensitivity in two-centre holographic recording is mainly due to the lower concentration of unionized dopants in the shallower centre and the lower effective electron transport length...|$|R

25|$|The {{compound}} {{eye and the}} ocelli supply insect vision. The compound eye {{consists of}} individual light receptive units called ommatidia. Some ants may have only one or two, however dragonflies may have over 10,000. The more ommatidia the greater the visual acuity. These units have a clear lens system and <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> retina cells. By day, the image flying insects receive {{is made up of}} a mosaic of specks of differing light intensity from all the different ommatidia. At night or dusk, visual acuity is sacrificed for light sensitivity. The ocelli are unable to form focused images but are sensitive mainly, to differences in light intensity. Colour vision occurs in all orders of insects. Generally insects see better at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red end. In some orders sensitivity ranges can include ultraviolet.|$|E
25|$|The genus Deinopis is {{the best}} known in this family. Spiders in this genus are also called ogre-faced spiders, due to the {{imagined}} similarity between their appearance {{and that of the}} mythological creature, the ogre. They are distributed nearly worldwide in the tropics, from Australia to Africa and the Americas. In Florida, Deinopis often hangs upside-down from a silk line under palmetto fronds during the day. It emerges at night to practice its unusual prey capture method on invertebrate prey. Its eyes are able to gather available light more efficiently than the eyes of cats and owls, and are able to do this despite the lack of a tapetum lucidum; instead, each night a large area of <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> membrane is manufactured within the eyes, and since arachnid eyes do not have irises, it is rapidly destroyed again at dawn.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{have two}} kinds of eyes: the lateral and median ocelli. The lateral ocelli evolved from {{compound}} eyes and may have a tapetum, which enhances the ability to collect light. With the exception of scorpions, which can have up to five pairs of lateral ocelli, there are never more than three pairs present. The median ocelli develop from a transverse fold of the ectoderm. The ancestors of modern arachnids probably had both types, but modern ones often lack one type or the other. The cornea of the eye also acts as a lens, and is continuous with the cuticle of the body. Beneath this is a transparent vitreous body, and then the retina and, if present, the tapetum. In most arachnids, the retina probably {{does not have enough}} <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> cells to allow the eyes to form a proper image.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{function}} of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. [...] Melatonin has various functions in the central nervous system, {{the most important of}} which is to help modulate sleep patterns. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. <b>Light</b> <b>sensitive</b> nerve cells in the retina detect light and send this signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), synchronizing the SCN to the day-night cycle. Nerve fibers then relay the daylight information from the SCN to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), then to the spinal cord and via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia (SCG), and from there into the pineal gland.|$|E
