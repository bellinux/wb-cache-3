30|$|The primary {{question}} of interest {{here is how}} well the different filters considered eliminate the isolated spikes in this signal while preserving the low-level details, especially the sinusoidal component. The presence of the <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> in approximately {{the first half of}} the signal raises a subtle practical issue, however: is a “good” filter one that simply removes the impulsive spikes from the data sequence, or should it also address the <b>low-level</b> <b>noise?</b> Given that median filters and their extensions are much better suited to the removal of impulsive noise than the smoothing of <b>low-level</b> <b>noise,</b> the first formulation seems the more reasonable here, but the question is raised to emphasize that filter performance criteria are generally problem-specific.|$|R
30|$|For the {{complete}} noise removal problem (the lower two plots), {{the dependence of}} filter performance on the threshold parameter is very different. In particular, performance degrades uniformly with increasing t for both the RMSE and MAE measures. Since {{the complete}} noise removal objective requires removal of both the impulsive <b>noise</b> and the <b>low-level</b> <b>noise,</b> {{these results suggest that}} as t increases, the Hampel filter allows more of the <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> to pass through the filter unmodified, offsetting the performance advantage of lower distortion of the sinusoidal signal components. In particular, since the filter removes all of the impulsive noise spikes for t between 0 and 6.5, it follows that the poorer performance seen for the complete noise removal problem over the impulsive noise removal optimal performance range (t= 3.5 to t= 6.0) relative to the median filter limit t= 0 is caused by the filter’s allowing more <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> into the output signal. These results emphasize the point made earlier that these filters are not well-suited to <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> removal problems.|$|R

As illustrated in Fig.  7, our technique provided high accuracy for both simple (Countryroad) and complicated (Bird) texture images, particularly for <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> estimations. This great capability of excellent accuracy in <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> estimation can also be observed from Tables  1 and 2, which were experimented on the images shown in Fig.  4.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} new method for image-adaptive quantization in lossy compression schemes. It {{is a fact}} that most natural images contain some <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> caused by the recording process. This noise represents an irrelevant part of the digital image and can be removed without perceptible changes in the image. For that reason it is possible to quantize those images stronger, which contain more noise and vice versa. A new and simple approach to noise detection and quantification is proposed. Based on this, the dependencies between <b>low-level</b> <b>noise,</b> quantization strength, and image quality are investigated using a wavelet-based encoder/decoder system, which mimics the algorithm of JPEG 2000. As result, {{it was found that the}} quantization parameter can be derived approximately as a linear function of the noise level. Thus, a partial solution for adaptive quantization in automatic compression and archiving systems is given. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Fractional- {{phase-locked loops}} (PLLs) {{typically}} use noise-shaping coarse quantizers {{to control their}} instantaneous output frequency. The resulting quantization noise and its run-ning sum inevitably get distorted by non-ideal analog components within the PLL, which induces undesirable spurious tones in the PLL’s output signal. A recently proposed quantizer, called a suc-cessive requantizer, {{has been shown to}} mitigate this problem. Its quantization <b>noise</b> and the <b>running</b> sum of its quantization noise can be subjected to up to fifth-order and third-order nonlinear distortion, respectively, without inducing spurious tones. This paper extends the previously published successive requantizer results to enable the design of successive requantizers whose quantization <b>noise</b> <b>running</b> sum sequences attain such immunity to nonlinearity-induced spurious tones up to arbitrarily high orders of distortion. The extended results are used to design example successive requantizers whose quantization noise and quantization <b>noise</b> <b>running</b> sum sequences have optimally reduced susceptibility to nonlinearity-induced spurious tones.

Distortion product otoacoustic {{emissions}} (DPOAEs) were measured in the absence and presence of contralateral noise at five levels [...] below, equal to, and above the middle-ear muscle (MEM) reflex threshold. The resultant changes in DPOAE level and phase were dependent on stimulus frequency and <b>noise</b> level. Both <b>low-level</b> <b>noise,</b> believed to elicit the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex, and high-level noise, thought to activate both MOC and MEM reflexes, significantly decreased the DPOAE level. However, the shift from sole MOC effect to mixed MOC and MEM effects was not as dramatic as we thought. While <b>low-level</b> <b>noise</b> resulted in a minimum DPOAE phase change, high-level noise caused a substantial phase lead for 1 and 2 kHz. With increasing frequency, phase lag became more notable. The present study suggests the following: (1) DPOAE contralateral suppression by low-level sound most likely does not involve {{the effect of the}} MEM reflex and signal crossover; and (2) combined analysis of DPOAE level and phase changes warrants further investigations to overcome the difficulty in separating the effects of MOC efferents and MEM contraction.

40|$|Intensive Language Action Therapy (ILAT) is a {{short-term}} aphasia therapy that emphasises massed-practise of language, where communication is framed through language action games that approximate everyday interactions. Despite increasing interest in ILAT, a comprehensive description of its methods {{has thus far}} been missing. Furthermore due to inconsistent results, further exploration of cortical reorganisation of language functions following ILAT is warranted. The underlying principles and practical features of ILAT methods and of language-action games are fully described, including the structure and materials for two specific games. 14 English speaking patients with chronic aphasia underwent two weeks of ILAT utilising the methods outlined. Pre and post measures of language performance were collected through standardised clinical assessments, along with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans from a subset of 8 patients. Accuracy and response times for speech output and comprehension during language-action games were also recorded to measure success during the therapy interval. Data analysis showed significant improvements in clinical assessments of naming and comprehension, but not in auditory or syntactic processing tasks. Significant increases were also seen in patients’ self-ratings of quality of communication following therapy. Video and voice recordings during therapy sessions demonstrated significantly faster response times in production and comprehension of language, alongside {{an increase in the}} complexity of patients’ spoken output. Cortical activation was recorded whilst patients heard <b>low-level</b> <b>noise,</b> sentences containing ambiguous words and low-ambiguity sentences.

Furthermore the group of patients recruited the right hemisphere significantly more than the left hemisphere following ILAT when processing complex sentences containing ambiguous words. iii Clinical assessments and measures of everyday communication showed undergoing two weeks of ILAT significantly improved speech output and comprehension in patients with chronic aphasia. Gains made in communicative performance during therapy highlight the importance of recording therapy sessions for additional assessment of therapy efficacy.
