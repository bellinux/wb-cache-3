50|$|The Model K and Model W buses looked quite similar, but all {{similarities}} ended there.

The model W had a pancake underfloor Hall-Scott 190 engine, while the K was powered by an International Red Diamond RD450 {{in the rear of}} the bus. The shorter model K was capable of hauling 25-33 passengers, while its bigger brethren could haul anywhere between 31 and 41 passengers depending on configuration. The Model N, as announced, would have seated 36 to 44 passengers in an underfloor engine configuration, but in 1947 it was downsized to a 32 to 36 passenger bus when the original design found no takers. After 1947, Kenworth began assigning numerals to the model designations to signify evolutionary variants in the design.|$|E

Result of test showed that with no head media, there was no water flow through the system, whenever pressure head applied lower than the pressure head level.
