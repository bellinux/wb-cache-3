25|$|An <b>LCD</b> <b>{{projector}}</b> {{is a type}} {{of video}} projector for displaying video, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the slide projector or overhead projector. To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. The <b>LCD</b> <b>projector</b> was invented in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff.|$|E

50|$|The first {{experiments}} with a direct-driven, transmissive matrix-addressed LCDs by Peter J. Wild using a converted slide projector working at Brown Boveri Research, Switzerland, in 1971 were demonstrated at the SID Conference 1972 in San Francisco. As passive LCDs (without transistors at the intersections) were {{not capable of}} displaying images with sufficient resolution for video pictures, {{a combination of a}} fixed image together with an LCD matrix for the variable elements was proposed as an <b>LC</b> <b>projector</b> for certain control room applications, with a corresponding patent filed in Switzerland on Dec. 3, 1971.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFuji Photo Film Co Ltd and Fuji Xerox Co Ltd have co-developed a {{high-speed}} optical transmission Lumistar system, capable of transmission {{at more than}} 1 Gbps without deterioration in output signal quality due to the graded-index distribution of refractive-index within the fibre. Combining optical transceiver module with VCSEL, high-speed transmitter and receiver developed by Fuji Xerox Co Ltd with the optical lens module developed by Fuji Photo Optical Co Ltd, the system realises some 100, 000 h of network build. The system links large flat panel displays such as plasma TV, large-size <b>LC</b> TVt, and <b>projectors</b> with tuners. Conventional electric wires deteriorate the quality of an electric signal along their distance, {{making it difficult to}} establish a link of 10 m or longer. Lumistar enables an optical link of 30 m and is suitable for application fields such as event sites, amusement facilities, commercial establishments, security facilities, hotels, and service areas.
