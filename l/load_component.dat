Therefore the sum of all the power consumed by loads equals the sum of all the power produced by sources.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{approach}} for {{the prediction of}} growth of delaminations in lami-nated composites made of plies of fiber-reinforced polymers is proposed. It allows to handle arbitrary combinations of force, displacement, temperature, and moisture loads. Quasi-static load cases can be treated as well as load cases where some <b>load</b> <b>components</b> are constant and some <b>load</b> <b>components</b> are cyclic. The proposed approach {{is based on the}} Griffith criterion, which is evaluated by means of some finite element procedure. It provides a complete picture of a delamination problem in a given structure and offers systematic understanding of the influence of size and position of a delamination on the growth, on the growth stability, and on the struc-tural response. Two examples, a curved laminate and a T-joint, are investigated in detail to underline the capabilities of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Load {{modeling}} {{plays an}} important role in power system operation and control. With increasingly complex grid and emergence of various new <b>load</b> <b>components,</b> <b>load</b> modeling becomes an intractable task. In this paper, our research work will focus on load modeling at distribution level. In order to capture specific load characteristics of various <b>load</b> <b>components,</b> a complete <b>load</b> model at distribution level with equivalent capacitor, large motor and small motor is applied. Disturbance data is processed in advance through MATLAB programs according to the requirements of measurement-based approach. In case study, the measurements and simulated model outputs are demonstrated. For comparison purpose, three load models are used to access model accuracy, which are respectively complete load model at distribution level, composite load model at transmission level and dynamic load model in PowerFactory at distribution level. By contrast, the complete load model proved to have better performance in transient conditions. By splitting the induction motor into two parts, some issues are introduced at the same time. Future work will focus on the generalization capability of this compete load model. Department of Electrical EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the above}} analysis, the base <b>load</b> <b>component</b> of the {{residential}} loads {{on a regular}} day during the n th year in the 2 nd sub-dataset (shown in Fig.  2 b) can be represented by the average base loads {{in the same year}} shown in Fig.  6 a or b. Then, the corresponding CSL component can be easily calculated by subtracting the base <b>load</b> <b>component</b> from the residential loads. Once all the CSL components of the residential loads in the 2 nd sub-dataset are obtained, one can generate the per-unit CSL profiles by normalizing the 48 load values of each component to their maximum load value. These per-unit load profiles are then collected to form the per-unit CSL pool.|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} capacity of support structures is checked with extreme loads. This is straightforward when the limit state equations {{depend on a}} single <b>load</b> <b>component,</b> {{and it has become}} common to report maxima for each <b>load</b> <b>component.</b> However, if more than one <b>load</b> <b>component</b> is influential, e. g., both axial force and bending moments, it is not straightforward how to define an extreme load. The combination of univariate maxima can be too conservative, and many different combinations of load components can result in the worst value of the limit state equations. The use of contemporaneous load vectors is typically non-conservative. Therefore, in practice, limit state checks are done for each possible load vector, from each time step of a simulation. This is not feasible when performing reliability assessments and structural optimization, where additional, time-consuming computations are involved for each load vector. We therefore propose to use Pareto-optimal loads, which are a small set of loads that together represent all possible worst case scenarios. Simulations with two reference wind turbines show that this approach can be very useful for jacket structures, whereas the design of monopiles is often governed by the bending moment only. Even in this case, the approach might be useful when approaching the structural limits during optimization...|$|E

In this model each axle load consists of a constant load together with a sinusoidally varying dynamic component with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the bridge.

Maximum bending moments in a simple girder are determined by the span, the static axle loads, the relative magnitude of the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>component,</b> and a bridge factor defined as the number of dynamic load maxima applied by an axle during its passage over the bridge. It is shown that for many bridges, the first natural frequency is simply related to the span and that the bridge factor is about 6.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new aggregate model for {{voltage and frequency}} dependent <b>load</b> <b>components</b> in power system studies. The model is built using a modular approach that allows the easy integration of dissimilar load data specification formats, such as exponential forms and polynomial representations. As opposed to conventional load models in which the exponents of the exponential or polynomial representations are constant, the proposed model dynamically ad-justs these exponents. The composite <b>load</b> <b>components</b> are represented by network equivalents connected to the transmission system maintaining the topological structure of the original power network. The proposed aggregate load model includes {{more information on the}} nature of the load devices than conventional models and is thus valid for a wider range of voltage and frequency variations.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare {{sinusoidal}} versus constant lower body negative pressure (LBNP) with reference to very mild whole-body heating. Sinusoidal LBNP has a periodic <b>load</b> <b>component</b> (PLC) and a constant <b>load</b> <b>component</b> (CLC) of orthostatic stress, whereas constant LBNP has only a CLC. We tested two sinusoidal patterns (30 -s and 180 -s periods with 25 mmHg amplitude) of LBNP and a constant LBNP with − 25 mmHg in 12 adult male subjects. Results Although the CLC of all three LBNP conditions were configured with − 25 mmHg, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) results showed a significantly large decrease from baseline in the 30 -s period condition (P 0), total peripheral resistance (TPR), the natural logarithmic of the HF component (lnHF), and LF/HF (ln(LF/HF))) of heart rate variability (HRV) showed relatively small variations from baseline in the 30 -s period condition (P Conclusion These results revealed that the effect of the CLC of LBNP on cardiovascular adjustability was attenuated by the addition of the PLC to LBNP. Based on the results of suppressed HRV response from baseline in the 30 -s period condition, we suggest that the attenuation may be caused by the suppression of the vagal responsiveness to LBNP. </p...|$|E
