500|$|Following {{the death}} of the {{commander}} of the V Bomber Command, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, in an air raid over Rabaul in January 1943, the commander of the Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General George Kenney asked Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of Army Air Forces to send Ramey to Australia as a replacement. The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force. [...] "I had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> him," [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "and believed he would do a real job for me. Arnold replied the next day that I could have him." [...] Ramey assumed command of V Bomber Command in January 1943. After the arguments over bombing tactics with Walker, Kenney was pleased that Ramey liked the skip bombing tactics the Fifth Air Force was developing. These tactics were put in practice with devastating effect at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943.|$|E
500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E

2500|$|Titans {{starting}} {{running back}} Chris Johnson - {{who had the}} vast majority of the carries in 2009, rushing for over 2000 yards - will reportedly get fewer carries in 2010. This will likely mean in increase in number of carries for Ringer. Backup Running back LenDale White is an impending free agent, and his future with the team also affects Ringer's future. During the 2010 NFL Draft, White was traded to the Seattle Seahawks. Despite the team signing Stafon Johnson and LeGarrette Blount as undrafted free agents, Head coach Jeff Fisher has confirmed that Ringer will be the new #2 running back, stating [...] "We have a terrific running back , and a very talented backup in Javon." [...] When Chris Johnson held out of training camp, Ringer took the first-string role. When discussing the #2 running back role, offensive coordinator, Mike Heimerdinger said, [...] " [...] been really good in training camp. I have a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Javon, with everything he has shown. He has the ability to make some runs... There's no reason why he can't be that guy." [...] During the first pre-season game of the 2010 season, Ringer led the team in rushing yards (60 yards, seven carries). Fullback Ahmad Hall said of Ringer [...] "Everybody knew he was a great back last year... He really, really immersed himself in the playbook, and picked everything up. If anything happened to C.J. he could definitely fill in and execute well. He is a smart guy, and he applies himself. The guy is a good running back." ...|$|E

[...] Cummings suffered a broken toe on his right foot and bruised shoulder and Milanovich returned to his starting role after his suspension. Cummings saw no action in Maryland's fifth game, a 31 - 3 loss to Georgia Tech, which knocked the team out of the Top 25 rankings. At Wake Forest, Cummings came off the bench in relief of Milanovich, who had struggled reading the blitz, and played the last 39 minutes. He completed 20 passes on 30 attempts for 222 yards. He led three drives that culminated in a field goal, touchdown, and a final series which used eight minutes of the game clock in the 9 - 6 victory. After the game, head coach Mark Duffner praised Cummings' play, but stopped shy of naming him the starter. Cummings started against Clemson and , but the offense struggled and Milanovich started the last three games, while Cummings nursed a sore shoulder. Duffner said of Cummings, [...] "One of our kids said he's a linebacker playing quarterback. On a scramble, when he can slide to get down, he'll try to run over a kid for extra yards. We've still got to get some of that out of him, but you've got to love that toughness." [...] Because he felt his arm needed the rest, Cummings did not play college or amateur baseball in 1996 {{for the first time since}} he was ten years old.|$|R
