5|$|Altgens {{and former}} Texas Governor John Connally met by chance in Houston {{a short time}} later. Connally told Altgens that he also had been called to testify and {{received}} airfare, but he decided to cash the check and spend the money. Connally pressed Altgens to spend his as well. Altgens later <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were not required to}} attend.|$|E
5|$|At the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who {{provides}} {{a room where}} Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd finds them in their room, and informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees, including the Fishes. Having <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have a bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Marichka and Theo fight him off and escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is then killed by a tank shell, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting; staring at the screaming baby, they allow the group to leave. Marichka leads Theo, Kee, and the baby to a boat in a sewer, and Theo rows away whilst Marichka stays behind.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{recording}} sessions {{got off the}} ground, Priestess encountered another problem – {{this time with the}} law. The band were working in a house in a neighborhood, and the close proximity to other houses meant that they had to keep the amount of noise generated to a minimum. They had been assured that the house had not previously been served with noise violations of any kind, but after they had finished recording drums and many of the guitar parts, they <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had the volume set too high when working on the bass guitar tracks; law enforcement came to the door and forced them to take their work elsewhere because they were shaking neighboring houses with the noise they were generating. The band did so with no objection, quickly moving their equipment to another studio, although they recalled the incident rather humorously later. Schiffman was able to arrange for the group to use another facility as early as the following day, and the band moved production to that new location the night of the incident. The sessions were completed in November 2008.|$|E

5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can see her. As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were in error.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Street Fighter II in 1991 is {{considered}} a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far. This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck. The graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other. The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines {{to keep up with}} demand. Street Fighter II was also responsible for popularizing the combo mechanic, which came about when skilled players <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could combine several attacks that left no time for the opponent to recover if they timed them correctly.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its formation, forecasters {{determined}} that Fern might loop around in the Gulf of Mexico and it was more threatening to land than Hurricane Edith which was also projected to hit the Gulf Coast. On September 9, as Fern was becoming organized, forecasters issued a hurricane watch along the Texas coast, anticipating that Fern might strengthen into a hurricane. In addition, small boats were warned to stay in port and residents were advised to be aware of storm conditions brought by Fern. The next day, the hurricane watches were changed to warnings, forcing residents living on the Texas coast to board up and evacuate. In preparation for the storm's impact, Civil Defense workers and the American Red Cross were put on alert. In Galveston, eight emergency shelters were planned to open but five were closed when officials <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not needed as most residents chose to ride out the storm in their homes. When Fern moved inland, the National Weather Service issued 21 tornado warnings and numerous flood warnings. In North Beach, city buses were used to transport evacuees inland and local officials were concerned {{about what to do with}} the relief trailers used to house survivors of Hurricane Celia a year earlier.|$|E

5|$|The International Bowl had {{contracts}} with the Big East and Mid-American Conferences {{that allowed them to}} select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select Big 12 member Nebraska and the Sun Bowl <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would not be allowed to}} select Notre Dame, Pittsburgh received the Sun Bowl invitation. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third selection, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, in consultation with the Big East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December7,2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.|$|E
25|$|For COMINCO, {{their company}} being subject to {{emission}} standards meant potentially limiting {{the output of}} their smelter.

25|$|Despite Shore's {{confession}} to {{the murders of}} four people and the rape of another, prosecutor Kelly Siegler decided to charge Shore for only Carmen Del Estrada's murder, because it contained the most forensic evidence. The jury found Shore guilty of capital murder, and, in the sentencing phase of the trial, <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had convicted a serial killer. During the sentencing phase, Shore's only surviving victim testified. Less than one hour later, the jury sentenced Shore to death, which Shore himself had asked for.|$|E
25|$|After the 1939–1940 Winter War, Antikainen and the Finnish {{communist}} Adolf Taimi {{were released}} and deported to Soviet Union.

After awkwardly questioning the party officials, he finally <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were killed in the Great Purge. This led into a nervous breakdown and Antikainen took leave of absence. In the summer of 1940, he was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union as the representant of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{it proved}} {{that there were}} limits to the Burmese {{military}} power. The Burmese <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not fight two simultaneous wars, especially {{if one of them}} was against the world's largest military. Hsinbyushin's reckless decision to fight a two-front war nearly cost the kingdom its independence. Moreover, their losses, while smaller than Qing losses, were heavy in proportion to her much smaller size of population, hampering their military capability elsewhere. Konbaung's military power would plateau in the following decades. It made no progress against Siam. Its later conquests came only against smaller kingdoms to the west—Arakan, Manipur and Assam.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} Morse telegraphs, the receiver's armature made a clicking noise {{as it moved}} {{in and out of}} position to mark the paper tape. The telegraph operators soon <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could translate the clicks directly into dots and dashes, and write these down by hand, thus making the paper tape unnecessary. When Morse code was adapted to radio communication, the dots and dashes were sent as short and long tone pulses. It was later found that people become more proficient at receiving Morse code when it is taught as a language that is heard, instead of one read from a page.|$|E
25|$|The {{theme of}} stars re-emerged when Jason and Sam went star gazing after their wedding {{reception}} on September 28, 2011. Later, after Franco's {{attack on the}} couple during their honeymoon, Jason held Sam as they gazed at the stars because they made her feel safe. Jason and Sam star-gazed several times throughout the year. Stars emerged again on February 8, 2012, after Sam and Jason <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were going to be}} parents. Jason took Sam back to the honeymoon cabin he had built for them and they stargazed. They also promised each other that they would teach their child all about the constellations.|$|E
25|$|Unwilling {{to waste}} his troops in {{an assault on}} the forts at New Madrid, Pope sent a brigade under Colonel (later Brigadier General) Joseph B. Plummer to occupy the town of Point Pleasant, on the right bank of the river almost {{directly}} opposite Island No. 10. The movement was contested by the Confederate gunboats, but Plummer's troops soon <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had only to withdraw out of range when the gunboats appeared, and return as soon as they left. The brigade occupied Point Pleasant on March 6, and the boats shelled their positions for the next three days. In this period, the Confederate Army remained within their fortifications, offering no support to Flag Officer Hollins.|$|E
