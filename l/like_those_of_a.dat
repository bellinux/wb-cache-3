5|$|Most mammals are viviparous, {{giving birth}} to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The {{monotremes}} have a sex determination system {{different from that of}} most other mammals. In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chicken than those of a therian mammal.|$|E
5|$|Then (on {{the ninth}} page) {{he arrives at}} the first species in the volume, the Greek {{tortoise}}, Testudo graeca. It is summed up in a paragraph, Cuvier noting {{that it is the}} commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow marbling, and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching a foot in length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, and lays 4 or 5 eggs <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.|$|E
25|$|The Balrog in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{version is}} about 10 feet tall, {{and has the}} mixed features of a boar and a lion, complete with mane. It has large wings <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bat, walks upright, and is capable of flight.|$|E
60|$|Eldred was {{the first}} to {{comprehend}} what it meant. His eyes glittered <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> awakened rat.|$|R
60|$|Gregory's big bull's eyes blinked {{suddenly}} <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> angry lion, and {{one could}} almost fancy that his red mane rose.|$|R

25|$|Research {{published}} in 2012 {{using data from}} MARSIS, a radar on board the Mars Express orbiter, supports the hypothesis of a former large northern ocean. The instrument revealed a dielectric constant of the surface {{similar to those of}} low-density sedimentary deposits, massive deposits of ground-ice, or a combination of the two. The measurements were not <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lava-rich surface.|$|E
25|$|One legend says that, {{during the}} Edo period, on it stood a pine tree which shook {{even when there}} was no wind, {{producing}} an extremely pleasant sound as if a celestial creature was playing an instrument. According to another, the founder of the shrine, who was a Kamakura period samurai called Sasaki Moritsuna, saw the pine tree move very slightly and emit sounds <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> koto, so he gave the cape its name.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{theory is}} that the waitoreke is {{actually}} a beaver. This is because several of the sightings report that the waitoreke lives in dams <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beaver. The fur color of a beaver is also close to that of the description of a waitoreke. However, the body shape and the tail structure of a waitoreke are different than that of a beaver. If the waitoreke was a beaver it would most likely be introduced by European settlers and would then be related to the European beaver.|$|E
50|$|Most digital stage pianos have {{weighted}} keys or semi-weighted keys. The {{difference is}} how much force it {{will take you to}} push on the keys and how much the keys feel <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic piano.|$|R
60|$|The {{expression}} of the seaman's opinion was here cut short by the sudden awakening of the elder Rimini, who immediately sat bolt upright {{and stared at the}} stranger with eyes <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> owl in sunshine.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} {{formally}} described in 1837 by Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher based on plant material collected from King George Sound by Charles von Hügel. The leaves are shaped <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oak (genus Quercus) , hence the specific epithet quercifolia.|$|R
25|$|De la Cierva's early autogyros were {{fitted with}} fixed rotor hubs, small fixed wings, and control {{surfaces}} <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed-wing aircraft. At low airspeeds, the control surfaces became ineffective and could readily lead to loss of control, particularly during landing. In response, Cierva developed a direct control rotor hub, {{which could be}} tilted in any direction by the pilot. De la Cierva's direct control was first developed on the Cierva C.19 Mk. V and saw production on the Cierva C.30 series of 1934. In March 1934 this type of autogyro became the first rotorcraft to take off and land {{on the deck of}} a ship, when a C.30 performed trials on board the Spanish navy seaplane tender Dédalo off Valencia.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, after a tragedy, the Marine Spa was {{demolished}} to {{make way}} for the ill-fated Coral Island leisure complex. This was characterised by its concrete arches on its uppermost floor and sunbathing decks <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cruise liner. The site featured a hexagonal outdoor plunge pool surrounded by sunbathing terraces leading down to Beacon Cove beach. Inside the building were several lounges, a restaurant and a nightclub within the arches of the ancient swimming bath. All levels were served by a hydraulic passenger lift. Coral Island opened in 1977 and closed in 1988. The complex was demolished in 1997, 20 years after its construction. The site remained derelict until 2002 when the Living Coasts coastal zoo was built there.|$|E
25|$|Many locals say Orang Pendek's feet look <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child, {{evidenced}} by foot prints {{they have found}} while walking through the forest. However, another local animal, the sun bear, is a possible source of these sightings. Bears in general are known for having feet that look quite human-like, {{and the size of}} a sun bear's {{are similar to those of}} a child. In addition, gibbons populate the forests in this area and are known to occasionally descend to the ground and walk for a few seconds at a time on two legs. Witnesses could possibly be seeing orangutans; however: 1) this species has long been thought to have died out in all but the northern regions of Sumatra and 2) witnesses almost never describe the animal as having orange fur.|$|E
60|$|She {{heard him}} moving towards the door. He stopped, {{then went on}} again. The door closed quietly. Presently from the room above came the sound of footsteps--footsteps pacing monotonously to and fro <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animal in a cage.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{the king and queen}} stared at their son, {{as if he had been}} unknown to them; he had grown so thin and weak during his illness that his {{shoulders}} were bowed <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old man.|$|R
60|$|Her cheeks {{no longer}} glowed, they seemed pale and {{transparent}} <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ascetic; {{her lips were}} slightly parted, her eyes appeared unconscious of everything round her, and gazing at something enchanting beyond that bank of clouds which glimmered, snow-white, through the trees.|$|R
25|$|Chatterjee was {{convinced}} {{that some of these}} crushed bones belonged to two individuals– one old, one young– of the same species. However, only a few parts were found, primarily a skull and some limb bones which moreover do not well agree in their proportions respective to each other, and this has led many to believe that the Protoavis fossil is chimaeric, made up of more than one organism: the pieces of skull appear <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coelurosaur, while the femur and ankle bone catalogued under TTU P-9200 and TTU P-9201 respectively suggest affinities to non-tetanuran theropods and at least some vertebrae are most similar to those of Megalancosaurus, an avicephalan diapsid. However, those supposed similarities between the cervicals of Protoavis and drepanosaurids were the same similarities that Feduccia and Wild (1993) used to argue for an affinity between Archaeopteryx and drepanosaurids.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Quanguo Li et al. {{determined}} the plumage coloration of Microraptor {{based on the}} new specimen BMNHC PH881, which also showed several other features previously unknown in Microraptor. By analyzing the fossilized melanosomes (pigment cells) in the fossil with scanning electron microscope techniques, the researchers compared their arrangements to those of modern birds. In Microraptor, these cells were shaped {{in a manner consistent}} with black, glossy coloration in modern birds. These rod-shaped, narrow melanosomes were arranged in stacked layers, much <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modern starling, and indicated iridescence in the plumage of Microraptor. Though the researchers state that the true function of the iridescence is yet unknown, it has been suggested that the tiny dromaeosaur was using its glossy coat as a form of communication or sexual display, much as in modern iridescent birds.|$|E
25|$|At the origin, {{after the}} {{separation}} of hot and cold, a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form {{the rest of the}} Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flute. Consequently, the Sun was the fire that one could see through a hole {{the same size as the}} Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources) and the lunar wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining lunar phases. The stars and the planets, located closer, followed the same model.|$|E
60|$|The {{child was}} pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old man.|$|R

60|$|Standing by the hearth, {{waiting for}} his wife, the Squire {{displayed}} to greater advantage than ever {{the shape of his}} long and narrow head; his neck had grown conspicuously redder; his eyes, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> offended swan, stabbed, as it were, at everything they saw.|$|R
25|$|The beast {{most often}} portrayed in {{heraldry}} is the lion. When posed passant guardant (walking and facing the viewer), he {{is called a}} léopard in French blazon. Other beasts frequently seen include the wolf, bear, boar, horse, bull or ox, and stag or hart. The tiger (unless blazoned as a Bengal tiger) is a fanciful beast with a wolflike body, a mane and a pointed snout. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur more often as crests or supporters than as charges. According to Neubecker, heraldry in the Middle Ages generally distinguished only between pointers, hounds and whippets, when any distinction was made. The unicorn resembles a horse with a single horn, but its hooves are usually cloven <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deer. The griffin combines the head (but with ears), chest, wings and forelegs of the eagle with the hindquarters and legs of a lion. The male griffin lacks wings and his body is scattered with spikes.|$|E
500|$|William gave a {{more nuanced}} picture of the kings of his own day. He {{claimed to have been}} {{commissioned}} to write by King Amalric himself, but William did not allow himself to praise the king excessively; for example, Amalric did not respect the rights of the church, and although he was a good military commander, he could not stop the increasing threat from the neighbouring Muslim states. On a personal level, William admired the king's education and his interest in history and law, but also noted that Amalric had [...] "breasts <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman hanging down to his waist" [...] and was shocked when the king questioned the resurrection of the dead.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, as a {{young woman}} at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was {{depicted}} as a glamorous [...] "fairytale Queen". After the trauma of the Second World War, {{it was a time of}} hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a [...] "new Elizabethan age". Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "priggish schoolgirl" [...] was an extremely rare criticism. In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales. In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd.|$|E

500|$|Dubois {{was bitter}} {{about this and}} locked the fossil up in a trunk until 1923 when he showed it to Ales Hrdlicka from the Smithsonian Institution. In {{response}} to critics who refused to accept that Java Man was a [...] "missing link", in 1932 Dubois published a paper arguing that the Trinil bones looked <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "giant gibbon". Dubois's use of the phrase has been widely misinterpreted as a retraction, but it was intended an argument to support his claim that Pithecanthropus was a transitional form. According to Dubois, evolution occurred by leaps, and the ancestors of humanity had doubled their brain-to-body ratio on each leap. To prove that Java Man was the [...] "missing link" [...] between apes and humans, he therefore had to show that its brain-to-body ratio was double that of apes and half that of humans. The problem was that Java Man's cranial capacity was 900 cubic centimeters, about two thirds of modern humans'.|$|E
500|$|Ellen became {{something}} of a tourist attraction for Turville. She was visited by journalists, medical professionals, religious personnel and the [...] "plain curious" [...] from across the country, many of whom donated money to Ellen's family {{to be allowed to}} see her. Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E
500|$|When the Rangers {{yelled to}} the POWs {{to come out}} and be rescued, many of the POWs feared that it was the Japanese {{attempting}} to trick them into being killed. Also, a substantial number resisted because the Rangers' weapons and uniforms looked nothing <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few years earlier; for example, the Rangers wore caps, earlier soldiers had M1917 Helmets and coincidentally, the Japanese also wore caps. The Rangers were challenged by the POWs and asked who they were and where they were from. Rangers sometimes had to resort to physical force to remove the detainees, throwing or kicking them out. Some of the POWs weighed so little due to illness and malnourishment that several Rangers carried two men on their backs. Once out of the barracks, they were told by the Rangers to proceed to the main, or front gate. Prisoners were disoriented because the [...] "main gate" [...] meant the entrance to the American side of the camp. POWs collided with each other in the confusion but were eventually led out by the Rangers.|$|E
