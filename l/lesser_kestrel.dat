40|$|Aim To {{identify}} the wintering {{grounds of the}} threatened western European <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> to focus conservation efforts in those areas. Location Huelva Province, southern Spain, as breeding range, and western Africa (Senegal and Mauritania), as wintering range. Methods We used archival light level geolocators (1. 5 g) to map the wintering areas and determine some characteristics of the migratory journeys of 20 adult <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> from the Iberian Peninsula tagged in 2007. Results Thirteen geolocators were recovered the following breeding season (2008) after attachment in 2007. Four recovered geolocators provided useful data. According to kernel density analyses, kestrels wintered near the Senegal River (border between Mauritania and Senegal). Pre-nuptial migration took longer than the post-nuptial migration, {{which may be the}} consequence of a loop migration. Main conclusions Geolocators have solved a crucial conservation question (i. e. the winter destination of western European <b>Lesser</b> <b>kestrels),</b> and these devices have thus proved useful to determine the location of the winter quarters of small sized migratory species. Our data indicate that European <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> winter in West Africa, in accordance with previous suggestions based on scattered observations during the winter months. This valuable information should serve to focus conservation efforts both in northern Senegal and southern Mauritania. Large roosts gathering thousands of <b>lesser</b> <b>kestrels</b> had been recorded in these areas over the years, but there was no previous confirmation of individuals staying all winter long. Specific and sustained protection of the roost sites, where the birds may be most vulnerable, should be sought in conjunction with local authorities. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of habitat selection underlies many conservation recommendations. Different researchers use different methods, therefore {{there is a}} need to examine whether the results are consistent. This study examined habitat selection by <b>lesser</b> <b>kestrels,</b> Falco naumanni, a globally threatened species, using two methods: visual sighting data from a 35 -km transect and radio-telemetry of 33 birds. Habitat use and spatial ecology were studied across all of the breeding season in a pseudo-steppe area, where traditional agro-grazing systems are still present but some areas have been transformed into pine plantations. Telemetry data indicate that, in good quality habitat, <b>lesser</b> <b>kestrels</b> prefer to forage close to the colony. Furthermore, the home ranges obtained were smaller than those for <b>lesser</b> <b>kestrels</b> using intensively managed habitats or more forested areas. Habitat availability was determined within a 4 -km radius of the colony and habitat preferences were determined using compositional analysis. Both methods were found to produce similar results, but telemetry provided a larger number of significant differences between habitats. Before the chicks hatched, <b>lesser</b> <b>kestrels</b> preferred grazed fallows, ploughed fields and cereal, while after hatching cereal stubble was the preferred habitat.

500|$|A {{review of}} semipalmated sandpiper records {{took place in}} the 1970s, {{resulting}} in seven of the twelve records being rejected. A review of black-headed wagtail records was initiated in 1983. The results were published in 1994 and 1995, and nine previously accepted records were judged to be unsound, due to possible confusion with grey-headed wagtail. A review of rufous turtle dove records took place in 1994, and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. A review of <b>lesser</b> <b>kestrel</b> records, begun in 1994, and completed in 1995, concluded that six accepted records of this species should no longer be regarded as acceptable. Five of the six were from autumn, whereas the overwhelming majority of records the committee continued to accept are from the spring/summer period. All 24 spring records of Siberian stonechat were reconsidered in 2002–04, in the light of new information on the variability in appearance of European stonechats in spring; the committee decided that all but five should remain accepted.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{mechanisms}} that regulate colony dynamics in a Spanish population of <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels,</b> using {{eight years of}} data from banded individuals in 494 colony-years. Colony growth {{was positively related to}} breeding success at the colony the year before. However, individuals of all dispersal statuses, i. e., adult and first-breeding philopatric and immigrant birds, significantly contributed to changes in colony size, indicating an important effect of dispersal on colony dynamics via colony quality. Given that there is strong evidence that <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> base their settlement decisions on conspecifics, we tested whether immigrants used the number of previously settled residents in year t (social or conspecific attraction hypothesis) and/or the breeding performance of conspecifics in year t - 1 (performance-based attraction hypothesis) to select their breeding colony. Breeding success of colonies varied both in space and time and was autocorrelated from one year to the next. Moreover, lifetime reproductive success of <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> was positively associated with colony size, and individuals can predict final colony size early in the breeding season, so assumptions of both hypotheses were fulfilled. Our results support the social attraction hypothesis, since immigration was positively related to the number of philopatric adults, but not to conspecific breeding success the year before. Given that departure decisions of adults were based on personal information about breeding success and colony size is related to fitness prospects, previously settled individuals provide easy and reliable information about colony quality, and social attraction could be seen as a particular case of public information in <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels.</b> Consistently, absolute numbers of both philopatric adults and immigrants increased with colony size the year before, although immigrants increased only up to a threshold beyond which this trend disappeared. Therefore, immigrants seem to be prevented from settling in the largest colonies, which could explain why all individuals do not concentrate in a few big colonies, but some settle in suboptimal colonies or colonize unoccupied sites. This opposing effect of conspecifics, together with the low levels of temporal autocorrelation in colony quality between time lags ≥ 2 yr, could promote colony size variability and facultative coloniality in this species.

40|$|Capsule:Cereal {{harvesting}} creates high-quality but ephemeral foraging habitats for invertebrate predators. Aims: To {{investigate how}} cereal harvesting affects foraging decisions and hunting success of <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels.</b> Methods: Habitat selection {{in response to}} changing availability of cereal fields (as patches being harvested are turned into stubble) was assessed by transects around colonies to count foraging birds. Focal observations of foraging kestrels were performed to assess hunting success and intake rate before and after harvesting. We performed transects to count Orthoptera to evaluate the impact of cereal cutting on prey abundance. Results: Harvesting impacted prey accessibility due to a temporary flush of prey, {{which resulted in a}} significant reduction in foraging time and an increase in the intake rate of kestrels. Accordingly, patches being harvested became the most preferred habitat. Nonetheless, harvesting likely caused high orthopteran mortality and dispersal leading to a gradual decline in prey abundance in stubbles. Lower prey abundance increased foraging time and reduced intake rate, and stubbles became avoided by foraging individuals. Conclusion: Although harvesting significantly increases foraging opportunities for <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> through intake rate maximization, patches being harvested represent an ephemeral high-quality habitat and its benefits are relatively short-lived as cereals are converted into low-quality stubbles...|$|R
40|$|In colonial species, first-time breeders may use {{the number}} of settled conspecifics in colony selection, but such a {{relationship}} is confused by the correlation between colony size and nest-site availability. To distinguish conspecific attraction from neutral colony selection, we experimentally increased nest availability for first-year <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> Falco naumanni, allowing us to dissociate the number of vacant nest-sites from colony size at the arrival time of first-year birds. Under natural conditions, the number of first-year birds settling {{was positively correlated with}} both the number of philopatric and the total number of breeding pairs (colony size) already settled. However, the probability of occupation of experimentally manipulated nests by first-year birds was independent of colony size. In experimental colonies, the number of first-year birds settling was positively correlated with the number of manipulated nest-sites but not with the number of conspecifics. Overall, these results support a neutral colony selection by first-year <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kestrels</b> based on nest-site availability.

40|$|Background: Departures {{from power}} law group size {{frequency}} distributions {{have been proposed}} as a useful tool to link individual behavior with population patterns and dynamics, although examples are scarce for wild animal populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied a population of <b>Lesser</b> <b>kestrels</b> (Falco naumanni) breeding in groups (colonies) from one to ca. 40 breeding pairs in 10, 000 km 2 in NE Spain. A 3. 5 fold steady population increase occurred during the eight-year study period, accompanied by a geographical expansion from an initial subpopulation which in turn remained stable in numbers. This population instability was mainly driven by first-breeders, which are less competitive at breeding sites, being relegated to breed solitarily or in small colony sizes, and disperse farther than adults. Colony size frequency distributions shifted from an initial power law to a truncated power law mirroring population increase. Thus, we hypothesized that population instability was behind the truncation of the power law. Accordingly, we found a power law distribution through years in the initial subpopulation, and a match between the power law breakpoint (at ca. ten pairs) and those colony sizes from which the despotic behavior of colony owners started to impair the settlement of newcomers. Moreover, the instability hypothesis was further supported by snapshot data from another population of <b>Lesser</b> <b>kestrels</b> in SW Spain suffering a population decline.
