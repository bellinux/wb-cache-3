25|$|Although little-known to {{the general}} public, British Columbia {{is home to a}} huge area of volcanoes and {{volcanic}} activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire. Several mountains that many British Columbians <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> day are dormant volcanoes. Most of them have erupted during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Although none of Canada's volcanoes are currently erupting, several volcanoes, volcanic fields, and volcanic centers are considered potentially active, 49 of which have erupted in the past 10,000 years and many of which have been active in the past two million years. There are hot springs at some volcanoes while 10 volcanoes in British Columbia appear related to seismic activity since 1975, including: Mount Silverthrone, Mount Meager, Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, Castle Rock, The Volcano, Mount Edziza, Hoodoo Mountain and Crow Lagoon. Numerous shield volcanoes developed during the Tertiary period in north-central British Columbia and some were active intermittently to recent times. Mount Edziza and Level Mountain are most spectacular examples. Mount Edziza is a stratovolcano consisting of a basal shield of basaltic flows surmounted by a central vent and flanked by numerous satellite cones, ash beds and blocky lavas. The complex {{has a long history of}} volcanic eruption that began about 10 million years ago and ended about 1300 years ago. The volcanoes are grouped into four volcanic belts with different tectonic settings.|$|E
500|$|While {{the three}} editions of Louis Lambert were being revised and published, Balzac was {{developing}} {{a scheme to}} organize all of his novels – written and unwritten. He called the scheme La Comédie humaine ("The Human Comedy"), and envisioned it as a panoramic <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> part of French life at the time. He placed Louis Lambert in the section named Études philosophiques ("Philosophical Studies"), where it remained throughout his fifteen-year refinement of the project. He returned to the themes of the novel in his later work Séraphîta, which follows the travails of an androgynous angelic creature. Balzac also inserted Lambert and his lover Pauline into later works – as he often did with characters from earlier novels – most notably in the story [...] "Un Drame au bord de la mer" [...] ("A Drama at the Sea's Edge").|$|E

60|$|Have {{you thought}} that you, who've never needed to economise, will have to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> {{shilling}} you spend? You've always been careless with your money, and what you've had you've flung about freely.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Noakes,’ exclaimed Hardy, who {{had been}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> object far and near, through the large telescope, ‘it’s the Fleetwoods and the Wakefields—and two {{children}} with them, by Jove!’ ...|$|R
60|$|It was Rob Dow who spoke. All saw he {{had been}} drinking, or they might have {{wondered}} at his vehemence. As it was, everybody <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> other body, and then everybody sighed.|$|R

6000|$|The {{old lady}} wiped her eyes. [...] "It is good of you, John, {{and it will}} indeed make all the {{difference}} to me. It will almost double my income, and I shan't have to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> halfpenny before I spend it." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{went over}} it together, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> fence and stump and implement. They visited the live stock, and {{estimated}} {{the value of}} the sprouting crop. Then they returned to the house, where they struck a bargain off-hand.|$|R
2500|$|Being an entrepreneur, Walker <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> single {{business}} venture {{possible to}} be able to expand his business. Since Detroit was only a boat-ride across the river to Windsor, Canada, Walker began to weigh his options in expanding into foreign territory.|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} on their way. Now they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> turning when they should have met with the villains; but whether they heard of Mr. Great-heart, or whether they had some other game, they came {{not up to the}} pilgrims.|$|R

6000|$|Breckenridge considered. [...] "No, sir. The one man I am bitter against is Clavering. Now, it {{may sound}} presumptuous, and not come very well from me, but I believe that Clavering, for his own purposes, forced your hand, and I had a certain respect for you, if only because of your thoroughness.

6000|$|Pandemonium {{broke out}} again. The Speaker rapped for order and glanced expectantly at the {{officers}} in the doorways. There were cries of [...] "Sedition!"

60|$|But now, cut {{off from}} taking steps by Bosinney's death--that strange death, to think of which was like putting a hot iron to his heart, like lifting a great weight from it--he {{did not know how}} to pass his day; and he wandered here and there through the streets, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> face he met, devoured by a hundred anxieties.|$|R
60|$|GREAT-HEART. Then said Mr. Great-heart, They be {{the three}} that set upon Little-faith heretofore. Well, said he, {{we are ready}} for them; so they went on their way.

60|$|The {{next day}} was Sunday and Eric went to church twice. The Williamson pew {{was one of the}} side ones {{at the top of the}} church and its {{occupants}} practically faced the congregation. Eric <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> girl and woman in the audience, but he saw nothing of the face which, setting will power and common sense flatly at defiance, haunted his memory like a star.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not easy}} to find Mrs. Crayford in the crowd. Searching here, and searching there, Frank became {{conscious}} of a stranger, who appeared to be looking for somebody, on his side. He was a dark, heavy-browed, strongly-built man, dressed in a shabby old naval officer's uniform. His manner--strikingly resolute and self-contained--was unmistakably the manner of a gentleman. He wound his way slowly through the crowd; stopping to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> lady whom he passed, and then looking away again with a frown. Little by little he approached the conservatory--entered it, after a moment's reflection--detected the glimmer of a white dress in the distance, through the shrubs and flowers--advanced to get a nearer view of the lady--and burst into Clara's presence with a cry of delight.|$|E

The edge of the opening is still more characteristic, I think.] and precise insertion of its point in {{the angle of the}} hexagon, prepared for by the archaic masonry indicated in the oblique joint above; [Footnote: Prints of these photographs which do not show the masonry all round the hexagon are quite valueless for study.] architect and painter thinking at once, and doing as they thought.|$|E
60|$|My list {{comprises}} 226 species--a {{large number}} {{to remember when}} we consider that it exceeds by about 16 or 18 the number of British species; that is to say, those which may truly be described as belonging to these islands, without including the waifs and strays and rare visitants which by a fiction are described as British birds. Of the 226, the sight-impressions of 10 have become indistinct, and one has been completely forgotten. The sight of a specimen might perhaps revive an image of this lost one as it was seen, a living wild bird; but I do not know. This leaves 215, every one of which I can mentally see as distinctly as I see in my mind the common species I am accustomed to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> day in England--thrush, starling, robin, etc.|$|E
60|$|For {{two days}} the Bee-man wandered about the palace and its grounds, {{avoiding}} notice {{as much as}} possible, but <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>every</b> thing.
