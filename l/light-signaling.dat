50|$|In relation, {{males of}} the Photinus species are the prey for females of a {{different}} genus, Photuris. Photuris females actually mimic {{the effects of the}} Photinus males <b>light-signaling</b> patterns, and by doing this the females lure in the Photinus males. The males naturally produce the steroid lucibufagin, and the reason that the females prey on these males is to obtain this steroid. Once the females prey on the Photinus males, the females gain the steroid lucibufagin to use to their defense against jumping spiders. A study was performed where the Photuris females were collected from nature and forced to reflex bleed which contains the steroid lucibufagin. It was found that when the females were forced to reflex bleed, the samples taken from each female had different amounts of the steroid in each sample. So after experiments were brought out to see which females the jumping spiders would eat it was decided that the jumping spiders were more likely to eat the females with less lucibufagin inside their bodies and the females with more were constantly rejected by the spiders therefore protecting themselves from predation.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBrassinosteroids (BRs) {{regulate}} a {{wide range}} of developmental and physiological processes in plants through a receptor-kinase signaling pathway that controls the BZR transcription factors. Here, we use transcript profiling and chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) experiments to identify 953 BR-regulated BZR 1 target (BRBT) genes. Functional studies of selected BRBTs further demonstrate roles in BR promotion of cell elongation. The BRBT genes reveal numerous molecular links between the BR-signaling pathway and downstream components involved in developmental and physiological processes. Furthermore, the results reveal extensive crosstalk between BR and other hormonal and <b>light-signaling</b> pathways at multiple levels. For example, BZR 1 not only controls the expression of many signaling components of other hormonal and light pathways but also coregulates common target genes with <b>light-signaling</b> transcription factors.

We have used engineering models to understand the control principles of a plant’s response to seasonal variation. We show that the seasonal changes in the timing of circadian outputs require light regulation via feed-forward loops, combining rapid <b>light-signaling</b> pathways with entrained circadian oscillators. Linear time-invariant models of circadian rhythms were computed for 3, 503 circadian-regulated genes and for the concentration of cytosolic-free calcium to quantify the magnitude and timing of regulation by circadian oscillators and <b>light-signaling</b> pathways. Bioinformatic and experimental analysis show that rapid light-induced regulation of circadian outputs is associated with seasonal rephasing of the output rhythm. We identify that external coincidence is required for rephasing of multiple output rhythms, and is therefore important in general phase control in addition to specific photoperiod-dependent processes such as flowering and hypocotyl elongation. Our findings uncover a fundamental design principle of circadian regulation, and identify the importance of rapid <b>light-signaling</b> pathways in temporal control...|$|E

40|$|The HFR 1, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, is {{required}} for a subset of phytochrome A-mediated photoresponses in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that overexpression of the HFR 1 -ΔN 105 mutant, which lacks the N-terminal 105 amino acids, confers exaggerated photoresponses even in darkness. Physiological analysis implied that overexpression of HFR 1 -ΔN 105 activated constitutively a branch pathway of light signaling that mediates a subset of photomorphogenic responses, including germination, de-etiolation, gravitropic hypocotyl growth, blocking of greening, and expression of some light-regulated genes such as CAB, DRT 112, PSAE, PSBL, PORA, and XTR 7, without affecting the light-responsiveness of anthocyanin accumulation and expression of other light-regulated genes such as CHS and PSBS. Although the end-of-day far-red light response and petiole elongation were suppressed in the HFR 1 -ΔN 105 -overexpressing plants, flowering time was not affected by HFR 1 -ΔN 105. In addition, the HFR 1 -ΔN 105 -overexpressing plants showed hypersensitive photoresponses in the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, dependently on phytochrome A, FHY 1, and FHY 3 under FR light or phyB under R light, respectively. Moreover, our double mutant analysis suggested that the hypersensitive photoresponse is due to functional cooperation between HFR 1 -ΔN 105 and other <b>light-signaling</b> components including HY 5, a basic leucine zipper protein. Taken together, our results of gain-of-function approach with HFR 1 -ΔN 105 suggest {{the existence of a}} complex and important basic helix-loop-helix protein-mediated transcriptional network controlling a branch pathway of light signaling and provide a useful framework for further genetic dissection of <b>light-signaling</b> network in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|Light {{is vital}} for plant growth and development. To respond to ambient light signals, plants are {{equipped}} {{with an array of}} photoreceptors, including phytochromes that sense red (R) /far-R (FR) regions and cryptochromes and phototropins that respond to the ultraviolet-A/blue (B) region of the light spectrum, respectively. Several positively and negatively acting components in <b>light-signaling</b> pathways have been identified using genetic approaches; however, the pathways are not saturated. Here, we characterize a new mutant named pleiotropic photosignaling (pps), isolated from a genetic screen under continuous R light. pps has longer hypocotyls and slightly smaller cotyledons under continuous R, FR, and B light compared to that of the wild type. pps is also hyposensitive to both R and FR light-induced seed germination. Although photosynthetic marker genes are constitutively expressed in pps in the dark at high levels, the expression of early light-regulated genes is reduced in the pps seedlings compared to wild-type seedlings under R light. PPS encodes MAX 2 /ORE 9 (for MORE AXILLARY BRANCHES 2 /ORESARA 9), an F-box protein involved in inflorescence architecture and senescence. MAX 2 is expressed ubiquitously in the seedling stage. However, its expression is restricted to vascular tissues and meristems at adult stages. MAX 2 is also localized to the nucleus. As an F-box protein, MAX 2 is predicted to be a component of the SCF (for SKP, Cullin, and F-box protein) complex involved in regulated proteolysis. These results suggest that SCFMAX 2 plays critical roles in R, FR, and B <b>light-signaling</b> pathways. In addition, MAX 2 might regulate multiple targets at different developmental stages to optimize plant growth and development...|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on April 21, 2014). Shoot-borne roots are {{essential}} plant components. Two pathway-based approaches were pursued {{to increase our}} understanding of genetic mechanisms controlling shoot-borne root patterning. The first pathway approach characterized the contribution of gibberellic acid-related genes in shoot-borne root patterning. Quantitative trait loci mapping in the Intermated B 73 xMo 17 linkage mapping population identified chromosome regions controlling shoot-borne root patterning which also contained gibberellic acid biosynthetic and response genes. Phenotyping of mutants with altered gibberellic acid production and response validated these genes as potentially underlying the identified quantitative trait loci. Association analysis was conducted {{in a set of}} 260 diverse maize inbred lines. The association analysis identified significant polymorphisms in the catalytic domain of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic gene dwarf 3 and in the promoter region of the gibberellic acid response regulator Dwarf 8. These results confirmed the previous hypothesis that gibberellic acid production is involved in shoot-borne root patterning and expanded it to include DELLA-mediated gibberellic acid response. In the second pathway-based approach a multivariate phenotypic analysis was conducted on 25 diverse maize inbred lines that were phenotyped for 23 developmental traits along with three shoot-borne root traits to define novel hypotheses about pathways involved in shoot-borne root patterning,. Evidence for a <b>light-signaling</b> component in root development was found.

40|$|SummaryPhytochromes are red/far-red light receptors that {{function}} in photomorphogenesis of plants.

Hence, cuff pressure is lowered and the overall blood volume remains constant.
