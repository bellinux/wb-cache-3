60|$|She sat in {{the bare}} studio and waited for his return. The monotony of the past weeks, which had grown oppressive, was about to end and for this she was very grateful. For from a life of luxury the child had been dumped into a gloomy studio {{in the heart of}} a big, bustling city that was all unknown to her and where she had not a single friend or acquaintance. Her only {{companion}} had been a strange man who happened to be her father but displayed no affection for her, no spark of interest in her happiness or even comforts. For {{the first time in her}} life she lacked a maid to dress her and keep her clothes in order; there was no one to attend to her education, no one to amuse her, no one with whom to counsel in any difficulty. She had been somewhat afraid of her peculiar father and her natural reserve, derived from her mother, had deepened in his society. Yesterday and this morning he had seemed more human, more companionable, yet Alora felt that it was due to a selfish elation and recognized a gulf between them that might never be bridged. Her father differed utterly from her mother in breeding, in intelligence, in sympathy. He was not of the same world; even the child could realize that. And yet, he was her father--all she had <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> upon, to cling to. She wondered if he really possessed the good qualities her mother had attributed to him. If so, when she knew him better, she might learn to like him.|$|E
60|$|It {{is in this}} manner, for example, that loaded dice may be discovered. Of course no dice are so clumsily loaded {{that they}} must always throw certain numbers; {{otherwise}} the fraud would be instantly detected. The loading, a constant cause, mingles with the changeable causes which determine what cast will be thrown in each individual instance. If the dice were not loaded, and the throw were <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> entirely on the changeable causes, these in {{a sufficient number of}} instances would balance one another, {{and there would be no}} preponderant number of throws of any one kind. If, therefore, after such a number of trials that no further increase of their number has any material effect upon the average, we find a preponderance in favor of a particular throw; we may conclude with assurance that there is some constant cause acting in favor of that throw, or, in other words, that the dice are not fair; and the exact amount of the unfairness. In a similar manner, what is called the diurnal variation of the barometer, which is very small compared with the variations arising from the irregular changes in the state of the atmosphere, was discovered by comparing the average height of the barometer at different hours of the day. When this comparison was made, it was found that there was a small difference, which on the average was constant, however the absolute quantities might vary, and which difference, therefore, must be the effect of a constant cause. This cause was afterward ascertained, deductively, to be the rarefaction of the air, occasioned by the increase of temperature as the day advances.|$|E

6000|$|All {{this had}} been for Lady Beldonald an {{agitation}} so great that access to her apartment was denied for a time even to her sister-in-law. It was much more {{out of the question}} of course that she should unveil her face to a person of my special business with it; so that the question of the portrait was by common consent <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> on that of the installation of a successor to her late companion. Such a successor, I gathered from Mrs. Munden, widowed childless and lonely, as well as inapt for the minor offices, she had absolutely to have; a more or less humble alter ago to deal with the servants, keep the accounts, make the tea and watch the window-blinds. Nothing seemed more natural than that she should marry again, and obviously that might come; yet the predecessors of Miss Dadd had been contemporaneous with a first husband, so that others formed in her image might be contemporaneous with a second. I was much occupied in those months at any rate, and these questions and their ramifications losing themselves for a while to my view, I was only brought back to them by Mrs. Munden's arrival one day with the news that we were all right again--her sister-in-law was once more [...] "suited." [...] A certain Mrs. Brash, an American relative whom she hadn't seen for years, but with whom she had continued to communicate, was to come out to her immediately; and this person, it appeared, could be quite trusted to meet the conditions. She was ugly--ugly enough, without abuse of it, and was unlimitedly good. The position offered her by Lady Beldonald was moreover exactly what she needed; widowed also, after many troubles and reverses, with her fortune of the smallest, and her various children either buried or placed about, she had never had time or means to visit England, and would really be grateful in her declining years for the new experience and the pleasant light work involved in her cousin's hospitality. They had been much together early in life and Lady Beldonald was immensely fond of her--would in fact have tried to get hold of her before hadn't Mrs. Brash been always in bondage to family duties, to the variety of her tribulations. I daresay I laughed at my friend's use of the term [...] "position"--the position, one might call it, of a candlestick or a sign-post, and I daresay I must have asked if the special service the poor lady was to render had been made clear to her. Mrs. Munden left me in any case with the rather droll image of her faring forth across the sea quite consciously and resignedly to perform it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Assingham and the Colonel, quitting Fawns {{before the}} end of September, had come back later on; and now, a couple of weeks after, they were again {{interrupting}} their stay, but this time with the question of their return <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend,</b> on matters that were rather hinted at than importunately named. The Lutches and Mrs. Rance had also, by the action of Charlotte Stant's arrival, ceased to linger, though with hopes and theories, as to some promptitude of renewal, of which the lively expression, awakening the echoes of the great stone-paved, oak-panelled, galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place, seemed still a property of the air. It was on this admirable spot that, before her October afternoon had waned, Fanny Assingham spent with her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing her own and her husband's final secession, {{at the same time as}} they tempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations. The double door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine, a wonderful, windless, waiting, golden hour, under the influence of which Adam Verver met his genial friend as she came to drop into the post-box with her own hand a thick sheaf of letters. They presently thereafter left the house together and drew out half-an-hour on the terrace in a manner they were to revert to in thought, later on, as that of persons who really had been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways. He traced his impression, on coming to consider, back to a mere three words she had begun by using about Charlotte Stant. She simply [...] "cleared them out"--those had been the three words, thrown off in reference to the general golden peace that the Kentish October had gradually ushered in, the [...] "halcyon" [...] days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out for them after Charlotte's arrival. For it was during these days that Mrs. Rance and the Miss Lutches had been observed to be gathering themselves for departure, and it was with that difference made that the sense of the whole situation showed most fair--the sense of how right they had been to engage for so ample a residence, and of all the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap. This was what had occurred, that their lesson had been learned; and what Mrs. Assingham had dwelt upon was that without Charlotte it would have been learned but half. It would certainly not have been taught by Mrs. Rance and the Miss Lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable. Charlotte's light intervention had thus become a cause, operating covertly but none the less actively, and Fanny Assingham's speech, which she had followed up a little, echoed within him, fairly to startle him, as the indication of something irresistible. He could see now how this superior force had worked, and he fairly liked to recover the sight--little harm as he dreamed of doing, little ill as he dreamed of wishing, the three ladies, whom he had after all entertained for a stiffish series of days. She had been so vague and quiet about it, wonderful Charlotte, that he hadn't known what was happening-- happening, that is, as a result of her influence. [...] "Their fires, as they felt her, turned to smoke," [...] Mrs. Assingham remarked; which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled. He had retained, since his long talk with Maggie--the talk that had settled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend--an odd little taste, as he would have described it, for hearing things said about this young woman, hearing, so to speak, what COULD be said about her: almost as it her portrait, by some eminent hand, were going on, so that he watched it grow under the multiplication of touches. Mrs. Assingham, it struck him, applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young friend--so different a figure now from that early playmate of Maggie's as to whom he could almost recall from of old the definite occasions of his having paternally lumped the two children together in the recommendation that they shouldn't make too much noise nor eat too much jam. His companion professed that in the light of Charlotte's prompt influence she had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors. [...] "I felt in fact, privately, so sorry for them, that I kept my impression to myself while they were here--wishing not to put the rest of you on the scent; neither Maggie, nor the Prince, nor yourself, nor even Charlotte HERself, if you didn't happen to notice. Since you didn't, apparently, I perhaps now strike you as extravagant. But I'm not--I followed it all. One SAW the consciousness I speak of come over the poor things, very much as I suppose people at the court of the Borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family. My comparison's only a little awkward, for I don't in the least mean that Charlotte was consciously dropping poison into their cup. She was just herself their poison, in the sense of mortally disagreeing with them--but she didn't know it." ...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze whether manual response and physical space codes are independent of each other or whether they interact when both types of information are involved in the task. The participants performed a temporal estimation task with two lateralized response buttons in four experiments. In the first experiment, the target stimuli were presented on the left side, at the center, or on the right side of the space, whereas the reference stimuli were always presented centrally. The reverse situation was presented in the second experiment. In the third experiment, both stimuli were presented in opposite spatial positions (e. g., left-right), whereas in the last experiment, both stimuli were presented in the same spatial position (e. g., left-left). In all experiments, perceptual and motor congruency effects were found, but no modulation of the congruency effects was found when both the perceptual and motor components were congruent. The results indicated that physical, spatial, and manual response codes are independent from each other for time-space associations, even when both codes are involved in the task. These results are discussed in terms of the "intermediate-coding" account...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{concerns}} Swedish family physicians' (FPs) experiences {{collaborating with}} district nurses (DNs) when the DNs provide medical treatment for home care patients. The {{aim was to}} develop a model to illuminate this process from the FPs' perspective. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 FPs concerning one of their patients with home care by a DN. The interview focused on one patient's treatment and care by different care providers and the collaboration among them. Grounded theory methodology (GTM) was used in the analyses. Results It was essential for FPs to collaborate with and rely on DNs in the medical treatment of home care patients. According to the FPs, factors such as the disease, FPs' working conditions and attitude determined how much of the initiative in this treatment FPs retained or <b>left</b> <b>to</b> DNs. <b>Depending</b> on the circumstances, two different roles were adopted by the individual FPs: medical conductors who retain the initiative and medical consultants who leave the initiative to DNs. Factors as the disease, DNs' attitudes towards collaboration and DNs' working conditions influenced whether or not the FPs felt that grounds for relying on DNs were satisfactory. Regardless {{of the role of the}} FP, conditions for medical treatment were judged by the FPs to be good enough when the grounds for relying on the DN were satisfactory and problematic when they were not. Conclusions In the role of conductor, the FP will identify when the grounds for relying on the DN are unsatisfactory and be able to take action, but in the role of consultant the FP will not detect this, leaving home care patients without appropriate support. Only when there are satisfactory grounds for relying on the DN, will conditions for providing home care medical treatment be good enough when the FP adopts a consultative role. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} concept of {{randomness}} within a complexity theoretic framework. We consider an unpredictability approach for defining randomness in which the preditions are carried out by finite-state automata. Our model of a finite-state predicting machine (FPM) reads a binary sequence from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> right and <b>depending</b> on the machine's current state will generate, at each point, one of three possible values: 0, 1, or #. A response of 0 or 1 is to be taken as the FPMs prediction of the next input. A # means no prediction of the next input is made. We say that an infinite binary sequence appears random to an FPM if no {{more than half of}} the predictions made of the sequence's terms by the FPM are correct. The main result of this paper is to establish the equivalence of the sequences which appear random to all FPMs and the ∞-distributed sequences, where a binary sequence is called ∞-distributed if every string of length k occurs in the sequence with frequency 2 −k, for all positive integers k. We also explicitly construct machines that exhibit success in predicting the sequences which are not ∞-distributed. Finally, we show that for any given ∞-distributed sequence, all infinite subsequences which are constructible from FPMs are also ∞-distributed...|$|R

Nevertheless, while the method parameters can be fixed, we show that a crucial choice must be <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the user, <b>depending</b> on the lightning condition of the image: the method must either be applied to each color independently if a color balance is required, or to the luminance only if the goal is to achieve local contrast enhancement.

An unusual case relating to these questions is the bilingual French/Breton satellite channel, TV Breizh.

It will be argued that in a context where the state attitude to minority language broadcasting has been unremittingly intransigent, the intervention of private, global operators is to be welcomed, albeit with no illusions. Scepticism of the motivation behind TV Breizh may be justified. However, even if its Breton language output is insubstantial, it has already outstripped that of the French state channel, F 3.

Bonding community social capital was found to positively affect voluntary citizen participation in local projects, while bridging social capital was found to have a potential role in facilitating community capacity to mobilize needed resources for the successful completion of local projects. In addition, social network analysis was employed to analyze the structural features of networks serving as bridging community social capital in the two communities. Measures of network density, centralization, concentration of centrality, and the presence or absence of cliques were used to assess features of networks deemed likely to facilitate successful community action. Strengths and weaknesses were identified in each network. Results of the network analyses suggested that direct analysis of social networks reveals complexities in social capital that traditional measures often overlook.

In the preface of the theoretical part of the thesis, the term wound is defined and the wounds are subcategorized in the terms of their pathological traumatological origin. In the next chapters, the process of the wound healing is analysed from molecular biological aspect, the terms acute and chronic wound are defined and newly introduces the term non-healing wound for the chronic wound. In the special part, the particular pathological-surgical types of chronic wounds are described from their molecular biological, surgical anatomical and therapeutic point of view. Next, the paper specifies risky factors influencing wound healing process aiming their therapeutic influenceability. These factors are further divided into the system ones and the local ones. The thesis continues with the analysis of the therapeutic and nursing possibilities in the chronic wound treatment describing traditional bandages including sterile pieces of gauze and disinfectant solutions for the materials of the moist wound healing. This is followed by the chapters discussing modern methods of the debridement of the chronic wound such as ultrasonic hydrotherapy, negative-pressure wound therapy or larval therapy. Each chapter describes both the indications and the contraindications for the use of these methods, their advantages and benefits for the patient, aiming the role of the nurse in the chronic wound healing process using these methods. The end of the theoretical part of the thesis is devoted to the nutritional support and the systemic enzymotherapy, which ensures a sufficient energy intake to the organism and both all the macronutrients and micronutrients necessary for building the body tissues. The empirical part of the thesis {{is in the form of}} a qualitative research focused on the documentation of the role of the nurse in the care of the patients with a single type of the chronic wound ? more precisely the patient after laparotomy with an extensive resection of the digestive system and a subsequent secondarily healed chronic wound. The method of using case studies was used to accomplish this goal. The record of the chosen group of the patients and the process of the systemic therapy with the support of the cardiovascular, ventilatory and nutritional functions regarding the surgical performance is acquisited and it is completed with the description of the local therapy of the chronic wound, with the description of the role of the nurse in the healing process and with the enclosed photo documentation. Casuistries describe the regression, the stagnation or the progress of the wound healing process; they map the role and the participation rate of the nurse in this process and the use of alternative equipment in this process and the art of improvisation. The summary of the results brings up the conclusion that the scientific and technological progress opens up new possibilities to the patient with the chronic wound and introduces modern technological procedures into the chronic wound therapy though there is a group of patients after laparotomy surgeries with the conducted extensive resection of the digestive system and with the subsequent anastomosis dehiscence, which is contraindicated for the use of these methods. These patients are <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> on the holistically provided care of a multidisciplinary team with irreplaceable role of the nurse. Biopsychosocial needs of the patient puts great demands on the nurse regarding both the personal and the professional side. The reasoning at the end weighs up and suggests the possibilities of the participation of the nurse in the preoperative preparation of the patient for the planned resection of the digestive system mainly in the form of the education in the support of the nutritive functions and the systemic enzymotherapy...|$|E
60|$|These words {{seemed at}} first to stupefy Mat: they burst upon him {{in the shape of}} a revelation for which he was totally unprepared. It had never once {{occurred}} to him to doubt that Valentine was secretly informed of all that he most wished to know. He had looked forward to what the painter might be persuaded--or, in the last resort, forced--to tell him, as the one certainty on which he might finally depend; and here was this fancied security exposed, in a moment, as the wildest delusion that ever man trusted in! What resource was <b>left?</b> <b>To</b> return to Dibbledean, and, by the legal help of Mr. Tatt, to possess himself of any fragments of evidence which Joanna Grice might have left behind her in writing? This seemed but a broken reed <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> on; and yet nothing else now remained.|$|R
30|$|The second rule of {{operation}} restricts the maximal energy demand per second. Before {{starting a new}} movement, every STS crane requests the energy that it is expecting <b>to</b> consume (<b>depending</b> {{on the type of}} movement and container load). On the basis of this expected consumption, the simulation model looks at whether this demand is available. If not, the crane is asked to pause until there is enough demand <b>left</b> <b>to</b> start the movement.|$|R

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{approach to}} preparing superparamagnetic microspheres with tunable porosity is described. In this method, droplets consisting of iron oxide nanoparticles, a functional polymer and solvent are formed in a microfluidic channel. The droplets are subsequently collected in solutions of {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) where the solvent is <b>left</b> <b>to</b> diffuse out of the droplet phase. By adjusting the concentration of the SDS and the polarity of the solvent of the dispersed phase, the porosity of the microparticles is controlled from non porous to porous structure. The formation of the pores is shown <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> on {{the rate at which}} solvent diffuses out of the droplet phase and the availability of SDS to adsorb at the droplet interface.
