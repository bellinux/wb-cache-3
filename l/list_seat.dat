5|$|The general {{election}} on 20 September 2014 saw the Fifth National Government returned again. National won a plurality with 47.0% {{of the party}} vote and 60 of the 121 seats. On election night counts the party appeared to hold the first majority since 1994 with 61 seats, but lost a <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> (for Maureen Pugh) to the Green Party on the official count (including special votes) of the party vote. National re-entered a confidence and supply arrangement with United Future, the ACT Party and the Māori Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of seats in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number of}} votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first <b>list</b> <b>seat,</b> the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 2012, Wood {{announced}} {{she would be}} abandoning her relatively safe <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> to stand in a constituency at the 2016 National Assembly elections; she later confirmed she would contest the Rhondda. Adam Price was subsequently selected as the party's candidate for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. Lindsay Whittle confirmed he would contest the Caerffili constituency.|$|E
5000|$|This sort of {{strategy}} for {{a coalition of}} parties to capture {{a larger share of}} <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> may be adopted formally as a strategy. By way of example, in Albania's 2005 parliamentary election, the two main parties did not expect to win any <b>list</b> <b>seats,</b> so they encouraged voters to use their list votes for allied minor parties. This tactic was used {{to such an extent that}} it totally distorted the working of the model, to the point that the parties winning <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> were almost always different from the parties winning constituency seats. Indeed, only one constituency member was elected from parties receiving <b>list</b> <b>seats.</b> Rather than increasing the number of <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> or [...] "overhang" [...] seats, Albania subsequently decided to change to a pure-list system.|$|R

25|$|In the National Assembly {{election}} of 3 May 2007, Plaid Cymru increased its {{number of seats}} from 12 to 15, regaining Llanelli, gaining one additional <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> and winning the newly created constituency of Aberconwy. The 2007 election also saw Plaid Cymru's Mohammad Asghar become the first ethnic minority candidate elected to the Welsh Assembly. The party's share of the vote increased to 22.4%.|$|E
25|$|Brash {{deferred}} conceding defeat until 1 October, when National's election-night 49 seats fell to 48 after special {{votes were}} counted. The official count increased the Māori Party {{share of the}} party vote above 2%, entitling them to three rather than two list seats from the party vote. With four electorate seats, the election night overhang of two seats was reduced to one, and as National had the 120th seat allocated under the party vote, National lost one <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> (that of Katrina Shanks) that they appeared to have won on election night.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 2012, the High National Election Commission {{announced}} provisional results. Jibril's National Forces Alliance (NFA) received 48.1%, taking 39 {{out of the}} 80 party-list seats. This {{was followed}} by the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), which received 10.3% and 17 seats and third was the National Front Party with 4.1% and three seats. The Union for the Homeland and the National Centrist Party also took two seats, as did the Wadi Al-Hayah Party for Democracy and Development. Fifteen other parties won one party <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> each. On 8 August 2012, the General National Congress replaced NTC.|$|E

5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Proportional Representation <b>List</b> <b>Seats</b> (332 seats) ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike mixed-member {{proportional}}, where party {{lists are}} used to achieve an overall proportional result in the legislature, under SM, proportionality is confined only to the <b>list</b> <b>seats.</b> Therefore, a party that secured say 5% of the vote will have only 5% of the <b>list</b> <b>seats,</b> and not 5% of all {{the seats in the}} legislature.|$|R

5000|$|Take {{the number}} of {{additional}} <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> off from the other parties' proportional entitlement [...] - [...] A party is allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, and the corresponding number of <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> allocated to other parties is eliminated to maintain {{the number of}} assembly seats. This means that a party with overhang seats has more seats than its entitlement, and other parties have fewer. This approach {{is used in the}} Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia and the National Assembly of Lesotho. It was recently recommended by the Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform for adoption by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. While for the first additional <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> are simply denied to parties, in the latter two cases a fairer procedure was proposed of subtracting the constituency seats won by parties with overhang seats from the total number of seats and recalculating the quota (the largest remainder method was also recommended) to proportionally redistribute the <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> to the other parties.|$|R

50|$|Labour list MP Jacinda Ardern won the {{electorate}} {{and kept the}} seat for the Labour Party. As Ardern moved from a <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> to an electorate seat, the Labour Party will replace her <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> with another person from their party list. Labour party leader, Andrew Little, has announced this will be Raymond Huo. Huo was the third-highest unelected person on Labour's party list, but both Maryan Street and Moana Mackey announced they would decline the chance to return to Parliament.|$|E
50|$|Under the German {{election}} system, only parties which receive {{at least}} 5% {{of the vote}} nationwide or win three constituency <b>seats</b> qualify for <b>list</b> <b>seats.</b> After winning two constituencies, the failure of PDS to win a third seat here or in other seats where they had good prospects such as Berlin Pankow or Berlin Treptow proved significant for the overall result as it meant that the party missed out on 14 <b>list</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R

During the campaign the decision to keep the word [...] "Conservative" [...] off her election literature proved controversial. She was embroiled in further controversy when it emerged that letters apparently backing her candidacy from local independent councillors were not authorised.

50|$|A new {{electoral law}} was finally drafted on 28-29 January 2012. The {{election}} {{system will be}} a form of parallel voting, with 64 constituency seats (with independent candidates only) and 136 <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> for party <b>lists.</b> Lists will have to alternate between male and female candidates, in effect ensuring a women's quota. The age required to stand for election was lowered to 21 years, and citizens with dual nationality will be allowed to vote and run in the election. Further changes were later made, changing the ratio to 120 constituency <b>seats</b> and 80 <b>list</b> <b>seats,</b> reportedly in an attempt to reduce the Muslim Brotherhood's influence in the new parliament. The 120 constituency seats would be elected from 69 constituencies, whilst the 80 <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> would be elected in 20 constituencies.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{increasing}} North Island population, the North Island was awarded an additional electoral seat beginning in the 2008 general election. Another North Island seat was created for the 2014 general election. Each time, {{the need for an}} extra seat was determined from the results of the most recent census, with the seat coming out {{of the total number of}} <b>list</b> <b>seats.</b> The total number of <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> has thus declined from 51 to 49 since 2007.|$|R

50|$|In 2015, National MP Mike Sabin {{was forced}} to resign, leaving his seat of Northland open. The seat, located in the Far North District, and its {{predecessors}} had been in National hands for decades. However, Peters ran for the seat and won it with a commanding majority—the first time that New Zealand First had won an electorate seat since 2005. With Peters resigning his <b>list</b> <b>seat</b> {{in order to take}} up the Northland seat, this allowed New Zealand First's representation in parliament to increase to 12, with Ria Bond, the next available candidate on New Zealand First's party list filling the vacant <b>list</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Commission {{released}} a consultation paper in February 2012 calling for public submissions {{on ways to}} improve the MMP system, with the focus put on six areas: basis of eligibility for <b>list</b> <b>seats</b> (thresholds), by-election candidates, dual candidacy, order of candidates on party lists, overhang, and proportion of electorate <b>seats</b> to <b>list</b> <b>seats.</b> The Commission released its proposal paper for consultation in August 2012, before publishing its final report on 29 October 2012.
