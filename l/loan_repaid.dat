40|$|In recent decades, {{more and}} more European {{households}} have become home owners. Typically, this has been achieved {{with the help of}} a <b>loan,</b> <b>repaid</b> over a number of years to cover a proportion of the purchase price. Some households in some countries and at some times experience financial hardship in repaying the loan, which may lead to mortgage default and eventually repossession. Understanding why some individuals experience financial difficulties, and why that may be translated into housing loan difficulties, non-payment and then the loss of the home, has significance in both scientific and policy terms. The present paper reports preliminary results from ongoing work that aims to combine two approaches to the study of loan repayment difficulties. Reporting first on results from a study using macro data that identifies the importance of national institutional arrangements such as labour and financial markets, these are used second to inform analysis using micro data obtained from the European Community Household Panel survey.

40|$|Abstract: The {{study is}} focused on {{agricultural}} credit sources and determinants of credit acquisition by farmers in Idemili local government area of Anambra State, Nigeria with specific objectives to: describe socio-economic characteristics of rural farmers; identify sources of agricultural credit available to rural farmers; determine socio-economic factors that influence agricultural credit acquisition of farmers; ascertain reasons for any credit misappropriation and identify problems that constrain farmers from agricultural credit acquisition. Ninety farmers were randomly selected by multi stage random sampling technique. Semi-structured questionnaire was used to elicit data for the study. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression model were used in achieving the objectives. Results indicated that 74. 44 % of respondents were males {{with a mean age}} of 45 years. Majority (76. 67 %) were married with large house hold sizes. Majority (93. 33 %) received different level of education, with sources of credit from friends/relatives (30. 00 %), cooperative societies (43. 33 %), money lenders (14. 44 %), and cumulatively from formal sources ((12. 22 %). The result of the multiple regression analysis revealed age, household size, membership of cooperative societies, marital status, education level, farm size and amount of <b>loan</b> <b>repaid</b> at varied signs and levels as significant predictors of amount of agricultural credit acquired by farmers. The most common reason given among the respondents (55. 89 %) of those who misappropriated acquired agricultural credit, was meeting nonfood needs of the household. The farmers encountered problems of high interest rate (78. 89 %), lack of collateral (75. 56 %), long distance from source of credit (50. 00 %), poor harvest (37. 78 %), moratorium (33. 33 %) and delay in loan approval/disbursement (44. 44 %) as constraints to acquire credit.

5000|$|The credit {{against the}} Federal tax {{may be reduced}} if the state has an {{outstanding}} advance (commonly called a “loan”). When states lack the funds to pay UI benefits, they may obtain loans from the federal government. To assure that these <b>loans</b> are <b>repaid,</b> and in accordance with Title XII of the Social Security Act, {{the federal government is}} entitled to recover those monies by reducing the FUTA credit it gives to employers, which is the equivalent of an overall increase in the FUTA tax. When a state has an outstanding loan balance on January 1 for two consecutive years, and the full amount of the <b>loan</b> is not <b>repaid</b> by November 10 of the second year, the FUTA credit will be reduced until the <b>loan</b> is <b>repaid.</b> This process is commonly called FUTA Credit Reduction and was designed as an involuntary repayment mechanism. The reduction schedule is 0.3% for the first year and an additional 0.3% for each succeeding year until the <b>loan</b> is <b>repaid.</b> From the third year onward, there may be additional reduction(s) in the FUTA tax credit (commonly dubbed [...] "add-ons"). For example, for taxable years 2012 and 2013, Virgin Islands had a [...] "2.7 add-on" [...] when its tax rate on total wages was below a national minimum.

Among other contingent factors of the repayment rate, we count mainly the distance between the place of residence of the customers and the institution and the purpose of the loan. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © CIRIEC 2008.
