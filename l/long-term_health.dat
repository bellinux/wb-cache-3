5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer <b>long-term</b> <b>health</b> care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000–40,000 {{people were}} killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from <b>long-term</b> <b>health</b> effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation. Most of the direct deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or industrial workers. Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would have required {{a year to get}} back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity would have required 15 months. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, the factory that manufactured the type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a pluralistic {{evaluation of the}} services provided for women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems receiving care and support within the Rehabilitation and Community Care Service (RCCS) in Nottingham. The thesis is grounded in data collected within an evaluative research framework and developed within a mental health policy framework. The evaluation consists {{of a series of}} six studies which are informed by a set of evaluation criteria which reflect a range of stakeholder perspectives. The first study examines the socio-demographic and psychiatric characteristics, social functioning and service use of all 480 clients registered with the RCCS. The clients' characteristics are similar to those described in previous studies. There are some• differences between the men and the women, notably that the women are under-represented amongst those receiving a high level of input from the services. The second and third studies explore the extent and adequacy of services for women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems in the Nottingham district through interviews with small groups of service providers working throughout the RCCS, and through a postal questionnaire to thirty eight organizations outside the RCCS. Special provision made for women is patchy, and there is no overall strategy to ensure even provision throughout the RCCS and the organizations outside the service, or co-ordination between them. The fourth study assesses the initial socio-demographic and psychiatric characteristics, social functioning, satisfaction with services, and quality of life of 31 men and 10 women at their time of entry into the RCCS and one year later, and their use of all services during this time. The women experienced a greater number of life events than the men, changed their accommodation more frequently, and the services appear to be less responsive to their particular needs. The outcome after twelve months shows that overall the social functioning and quality of life of the clients had not improved. There were some changes in service use, notably the greater number of clients living independently. The fifth study uses semi-structured interviews to explore the problems service providers experience in planning and delivering a service to women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems. Two overriding themes emerge from the data; service providers as empathic women, and service providers as professionals, which lead them to experience a conflict between respecting the rights of women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems and protecting them. The final study uses focus groups to explore the impact of mental health problems on the lives of women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems, and their views of the services they currently receive. Three themes emerge from the data; loss, hope and views about services. Despite overwhelming losses many of the women retain hopes and aspirations for the future. The women identify negative and positive aspects of the services they are receiving together with some recommendations for change. The thesis contributes to current knowledge about the experiences of women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems in a number of ways. First, the findings of the six studies which make up the evaluation highlight {{the ways in which the}} RCCS was successful in meeting these women's needs, and the many gaps in existing provision. Second, women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems can give coherent and comprehensive accounts of their experiences. Third, the findings illuminate the current predicament of women with <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> problems which is that they remain excluded and marginalised from the communities where they are now living...|$|R

40|$|STUDY QUESTION Are {{fertility}} treatment-related factors, parenthood {{status and}} sustained child-wish associated with women's <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health?</b> SUMMARY ANSWER Sustaining a child-wish is more {{strongly associated with}} women's <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> than fertility treatment-related factors and parenthood status. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY About one-third of the couples starting fertility treatment do not achieve parenthood and have to adjust to an unfulfilled child-wish. In women, remaining childless after treatment is associated with less favourable mental health. It is unclear if this is only related to their childlessness or if adjustment after unsuccessful treatment is affected by other variables. These include diagnostic and treatment-related factors (cause of fertility problems, age at first consultation, type and number of treatments) and the psychological ability {{to come to terms}} with the unfulfilled child-wish. Differentiating the relative contribution of these factors to women's <b>long-term</b> mental <b>health</b> will provide useful knowledge to support patients adjusting to negative treatment outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A cross-sectional study with a nationally representative sample of 7148 women who started fertility treatment at any of the 12 IVF hospitals in the Netherlands from 1995 through 2000.
