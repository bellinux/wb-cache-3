The investigation on the early hydration behavior of cements and cementing systems has been {{for a long time}} a very important area of research: understanding the chemical reactions that lead to hardening is fundamental for the prediction of performances and {{durability of}} the materials. The production of 1 ton of Ordinary Portland Cement, OPC, releases into the atmosphere ~ 0. 97 tons of CO 2. This implies that the overall CO 2 emissions from the cement industry are 6 % of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide. An alternative to reduce the CO 2 footprint consists on the development of eco-cements composed by less calcite demanding phases, such as belite and ye'elimite. That is the case of Belite-Ye’elimite cements (BY). Since the reactivity of belite is not quick enough, these materials develop <b>low</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> at intermediate hydration ages. A possible solution to this problem goes through the production of cements which jointly contain alite with the two previously mentioned phases, named as Belite-Alite-Ye’elimite (BAY) cements.

One of the proposed solutions to this problem is the activation of BYF clinkers by preparing clinkers with high percentage of coexisting alite and ye'elimite. These clinkers are known Belite-Alite-Ye’elimite (BAY) cements. Their manufacture would produce ~ 15 % less CO 2 than OPC. Alite is the main component of OPC and is responsible for early <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths.</b> The reaction of alite and ye´elimite with water will develop cements with high <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> at early ages, while belite will contribute to later curing times. Moreover, the high alkalinity of BAY cement pastes/mortars/concretes may facilitate the use of supplementary cementitious materials with pozzolanic activity which also contributes to decrease the CO 2 footprint of these ecocements. The main objective of this work was the design and optimization of all the parameters evolved in the preparation of a BAY eco-cement that develop higher <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> than BYF cements. These parameters include the selection of the raw materials (lime, gypsum, kaolin and sand), milling, clinkering conditions (temperature, and holding time), and clinker characterization The addition of fly ash has also been studied. All BAY clinker and pastes (at different hydration ages) were mineralogically characterized through laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (LXRPD) in combination with the Rietveld methodology to obtain the full phase assemblage including Amorphous and Crystalline non-quantified, ACn, contents. The pastes were also characterized through rheological measurements, thermal analyses (TA), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The compressive strengths were also measured at different hydration times and compared to BYF. Póster en congreso científicoUniversidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech.
