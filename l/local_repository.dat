50|$|Every {{project has}} a central {{repository}} {{that is considered}} as the official repository, which is managed by the project maintainers.

50|$|Repository model {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} various copies of the source code repository. In a client-server model, users access a master repository via a client; typically, their local machines hold only a working copy of a project tree. Changes in one working copy must be committed to the master repository before they are propagated to other users. In a distributed model, repositories act as peers, and users typically have a <b>local</b> <b>repository</b> with version history available, {{in addition to their}} working copies.|$|E
50|$|Documents from Sheffield solicitors' offices {{have been}} {{prominent}} from the start; in the 1960s several similar accumulations were received from solicitors over a wider field — Barnsley, Wath, Snaith and Sherburn-in-Elmet. Archives deposited by industrial firms increased during this period. In 1960 the Library {{was recognized as}} the official <b>local</b> <b>repository</b> for certain categories of public local records and a large deposit of colliery records was handed over by the National Coal Board as a result, making a very substantial modern addition (up to 1948) to older colliery records from private sources.|$|E
50|$|TeamWare {{features}} {{a number of}} advanced features not found in earlier version control systems like RCS and CVS. In particular, it {{features a}} hierarchy of source repositories, and allows atomic updates of multiple files, features found in later version-control systems such as Subversion and Perforce. TeamWare allows distributed development by copying a repository to another which might reside on another machine or network. Developers can then commit changes to the local copy of the repository, periodically integrating accumulated changes in the <b>local</b> <b>repository</b> back into the original repository.|$|E
40|$|Understanding or {{acquiring}} a user's information needs from their <b>local</b> information <b>repository</b> (e. g. {{a set of}} example-documents {{that are relevant to}} user information needs) is important in many applications. However, acquiring the user's information needs from the <b>local</b> information <b>repository</b> is very challenging. Personalised ontology is emerging as a powerful tool to acquire the information needs of users. However, its manual or semi-automatic construction is expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, this paper proposes a model to automatically learn personalised ontology by labelling topic models with concepts, where the topic models are discovered from a user's <b>local</b> information <b>repository.</b> The proposed model is evaluated by comparing against ten baseline models on the standard dataset RCV 1 and a large ontology LCSH. The results show that the model is effective and its performance is significantly improved...|$|R

Tocope with bandwidth limitations, the application supports adaptive re-use of models stored within <b>local</b> <b>repositories,</b> and limits online {{exchange of information}} to high-level commands encoding recurrent interaction patterns {{that are relevant to}} the context of use, so as to support real-time interaction in the virtual set...|$|R

50|$|In November 2009, HP began {{offering}} HP Data Protector Notebook Extension. HP Data Protector Notebook Extension enables users {{to back up}} and recover data while working remotely and offline. With HP Data Protector Notebook Extension, data is captured and backed up automatically each time a user changes, creates or receives a file. These processes are transparent to the user and do not impact laptop or desktop performance. The data is then stored temporarily in a <b>local</b> <b>repository</b> pending transfer to the network data vault for full backup and restore capabilities. Key features include end-user single-click recovery, encryption and compression techniques.|$|E

It is a <b>local</b> <b>repository</b> for copies of the Omaha-related materials collected through the [...] "Mexican American Traditions in Nebraska" [...] project of the Nebraska State Historical Society. Nebraskans for Peace is another organization that seeks to advocate and assist Mexican Americans and Mexicans in Omaha.|$|E
50|$|A central {{feature in}} Maven is {{dependency}} management. Maven's dependency-handling mechanism is organized around a coordinate system identifying individual artifacts such as software libraries or modules. The POM example above references the JUnit coordinates {{as a direct}} dependency of the project. A project that needs, say, the Hibernate library simply has to declare Hibernate's project coordinates in its POM. Maven will automatically download the dependency and the dependencies that Hibernate itself needs (called transitive dependencies) and store them in the user's <b>local</b> <b>repository.</b> Maven 2 Central Repository is used by default to search for libraries, but one can configure the repositories to be used (e.g., company-private repositories) within the POM.|$|E
