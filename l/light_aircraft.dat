5|$|As {{the lead}} ship of the Majestic-class of <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers, Melbourne was {{conceived}} as {{a modified version of}} the Colossus-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. Majestic- and Colossus-class carriers were almost identical in hull design and both were considered subclasses of the '1942 design' <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier program. These carriers were intended as 'disposable warships': to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service.|$|E

5|$|HMS Pioneer and HMS Perseus {{were not}} {{completed}} {{to their original}} design as Colossus-class <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers; the success of Unicorn prompted modification of the ships whilst under construction into aircraft maintenance ships without aircraft catapults and deckhouses built on the flight deck.|$|E
5|$|The main {{airport for}} Roskilde is Copenhagen Airport {{which can be}} reached in about 40 minutes by train. Since April 1973, {{there has also been}} the small local Roskilde Airport, serving <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> for training, taxi, and flight instruction. There are plans to expand it for use by larger aircraft, {{possibly}} including discount international flights. The plans were approved, but lack of commitment from any carriers has postponed progress. The airport currently handles up to 100,000 operations (flights) per year, most of which are <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> operations associated with school flights.|$|E
5|$|All {{terminals}} and hangars were on {{the square}} periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short runway (13R/31L) for <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> was added in 1989.|$|E

50|$|The replica {{performs}} {{better than}} the original Nieuport 24 on the same installed power, because modern materials result in a much <b>lighter</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Note, that <b>lighter</b> <b>aircraft,</b> like Klemm L.25, BFW M.23, RWD-2 (below 322 kg empty weight), {{were in the}} Category II, {{with lower}} cruise speed demands.|$|R
5|$|Entrance to Lundy is {{free for}} anyone {{arriving}} by scheduled transport. Visitors arriving by non-scheduled transport are charged an entrance fee, currently (May 2016) £6.00, {{and there is}} an additional charge payable by those using <b>light</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Anyone arriving on Lundy by non-scheduled transport is also charged an additional fee for transporting luggage {{to the top of the}} island.|$|E
5|$|HMAS Melbourne (R21) was a Majestic-class <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{carrier of}} the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Operating from 1955 until 1982, {{she was the}} third and final {{conventional}} aircraft carrier to serve in the RAN. Melbourne was the only Commonwealth naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime collisions.|$|E
5|$|HMAS Sydney (R17/A214/P214/L134) was a Majestic-class <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier {{operated}} by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

5|$|Lympne {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in the evolution of}} air traffic control, with facilities developing and improving during the 1920s and 1930s. A number of record-breaking flights originated or ended at Lympne. During the 1920s Lympne was the venue for the Lympne <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> trials from which a number of aircraft types entered production. Air racing was also held at Lympne.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Light</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Trials {{included}} a speed section over a triangular course of Lympne-Postling-Brabourne-Lympne. The Folkestone Aero Trophy {{was held at}} Lympne in 1932 and the Wakefield Cup races in 1933. The final air race before the Second World War was the Folkestone Aero Trophy on 5 August 1939. This was won by Andrew Dalrymple in Chilton D.W.1 (G-AFSV).|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-28 (also {{designated}} Su-25UT – Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy) is {{an advanced}} basic jet trainer, {{built on the}} basis of the Su-25UB as a private initiative by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. The Su-28 is a <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> designed to replace the Czechoslovak Aero L-39 Albatros.

50|$|Birdman Aircraft was a U.S. {{aircraft}} manufacturer that marketed the Birdman TL-1 ultralight in the 1970s and early 1980s, at the time, the <b>lightest</b> <b>aircraft</b> to have ever flown. The firm was {{based at the}} Daytona Beach International Airport in Florida.|$|R
5|$|In 1943 the Royal Navy {{commissioned}} six <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers in {{an effort}} to counter the German and Japanese navies. The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized fleet aircraft carriers and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers.|$|E
5|$|In March 1965, a NOTAM {{was issued}} of changes {{had been made}} into the {{arrangements}} for <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> crossing the Channel. These changes were partly to avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd (Ferryfield). Non-radio aircraft could use the route between Hythe and Ambleteuse. Non-radio aircraft were advised to call at Lympne before crossing. On 11 July, one of Skyways Coach Air's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{decided to}} build a class of two {{submarine}} tenders which could be converted into <b>light</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as an aircraft carrier. The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940. In early 1941, Tsurugizaki {{was taken out of}} service, converted to an aircraft carrier, and recommissioned as Shōhō in early 1942.|$|E
50|$|During World War II a need {{sometimes}} also arose for a heavy fighter, {{which could}} not be met by a new design in the time needed. Joining two examples of an existing <b>lighter</b> <b>aircraft</b> was one way to achieve this.|$|R
