40|$|Abstract- This paper {{focuses on}} the study of the behavior, characteristics, causes and effects of arc faults in low voltage (<b>LV)</b> <b>switchboard.</b> A {{pressure}} sensor is designed to have an early detection on the fault by means of detecting the arc pressure. By monitoring the pressure of supply the current, the possibility of arc occurrence is minimized. From simulation results of the proposed circuit, the pressure sensor is able to detect an arc fault, send a signal to the fault protector circuit which in turn alerts the breaker control circuit to trip the appropriate circuit breaker, thus avoiding damages to the switchboard, buildings and personnel injury caused by arc flash...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{original}} diagnosis system for LV switchboards. It {{is based on}} a local and global diagnosis approach with local temperature and current measurements. The thermal measurements including ambient and temperatures near electrical joint, are done by wireless thermal sensors. The system is composed of three complementary stages: An internet data collection stage, and two centralized data processing stages for the local detection of failures and the global diagnosis respectively. The analyses done with the diagnosis stage lead to predictive maintenance recommendations in order to avoid <b>LV</b> <b>switchboard</b> breakdown, which although rare could be catastrophic. Each stage of the centralized data processing is presented and discussed. Some results based on experimental data and expertise's information are presented to validate the feasibility of these methods...|$|E
40|$|The 11 kV {{distribution}} system at Paraburdoo mine site {{has been in}} service {{for the better part}} of the last forty years and has come to the end of its service life and requires replacing. These 11 kV electricity assets include the 11 kV bulk supply switchroom, a significant proportion of the plant distribution, six distribution transformers and a shunt reactor. In addition a new administration/workshop building and wash pad is currently under construction at West Angelas mine site and requires power installed from nearby overhead power lines. The purpose of my internship has been to write a Scope of Works and a Functional Specification for the replacement of the electricity assets at Paraburdoo and the installation of power at West Angelas. This was achieved by assessing the installation requirements, understanding the functionality of the electrical network in which they operate and consulting the relevant Australian Standards applicable to each installation whilst communicating with the project stakeholders in order to facilitate the replacement and installation of these assets at both sites. Specifically the assets at Paraburdoo shall be replaced with contemporary switchgear, transformers and shunt reactors while at West Angelas the new buildings will receive power via new underground cable from nearby take-off poles to a kiosk comprising an <b>LV</b> <b>switchboard...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{deals with}} an entire system of {{monitoring}} and diagnosis of <b>LV</b> <b>switchboards</b> based on the measurements of currents, ambient temperatures and local temperatures of electrical joints. This system meets the needs to prevent the breakdowns of <b>LV</b> <b>switchboards,</b> which, although rare, can involve huge financial and human loss. The thermal measurements are done by wireless thermal sensor. The measured data are transmitted via internet and collected in a server, to be centrally processed. This centralized data processing includes a local detection of failures and a global diagnosis which leads to some maintenance recommendations. This paper will focus on, the local detection by comparison with an healthy model, and the global diagnosis using Bayesian network technique. The feasibility of these methods is tested with experimental data and expert's information...|$|R
