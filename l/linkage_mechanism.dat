40|$|Abstract A {{special class}} of planar and spatial <b>linkage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is {{presented}} in which for a continuous full rotation or continuous rocking motion of the input link, the output link undergoes two continuous rocking motions. In a special case of such mechanisms, for periodic motions of the input link with a fundamental frequency ω, the output motion is periodic but with a fundamental frequency of 2 ω. In this paper, the above class of <b>linkage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are referred to as}} speed-doubling <b>linkage</b> mecha-nisms. Such <b>mechanisms</b> can be cascaded to provide further doubling of the fundamental frequency (rocking motion) of the output motion. They can also be cascaded with other appropriate <b>linkage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to obtain crank-rocker or crank-crank type of mechanisms. The conditions for the existence of speed-doubling <b>linkage</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are provided and their mode of operation is described in detail. Such speed-doubling mechanisms have practical applications, particularly when higher out-put speeds are desired, since higher output motions can be achieved with lower input speeds. Such mechanisms also appear to generally have force transmission and dynamics advantages over regular mecha-nisms designed to achieve similar output speeds...|$|R

50|$|The Brickley Engine is a {{patented}} {{proposal for}} the design of an internal combustion engine. One embodiment uses opposing pistons driving a central <b>linkage</b> <b>mechanism</b> which turns the crankshaft with a single connecting rod. This proposed design configuration changes the way the pistons are connected {{to each other and to}} the crankshaft, thus reducing engine friction. Additionally, by connecting the pistons to each other in a more efficient manner, it reduces the type and number of bearings on the crankshaft for further reductions in friction. Reducing the internal friction of the engine should increase the fuel efficiency of the proposed engine as compared with the current design of one connecting rod per piston. The Brickley Engine was invented by Mike Brickley, an engineer from Austin, Texas. The engine configuration has three US patents.|$|E
