5|$|The {{time frame}} of the Solar System's {{formation}} has been determined using radiometric dating. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains on Earth are approximately 4.4billion years old. Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics. To estimate {{the age of the}} Solar System, scientists use meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> old.|$|E
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E

In modern times, {{in urban areas}} at <b>least,</b> <b>this</b> {{practice}} is not universal and some wives either suffix their husband's surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.|$|E

If each team is able to face at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> number of overs a result is possible and can be calculated using the Duckworth–Lewis method or other competition rules.|$|E
25|$|Orites revolutus is 1 of 9 {{species in}} the genus Orites, with 7 endemic to Australia and only 4 in Tasmania. The {{remaining}} 2 species reside in the Chilean Andes and Bolivia. Recent phylogenetic work suggests the Orites genus spread over the Gondwanan continent from South America to Australia during the Paleogene, reaching Australia by the Early Oligocene. Fossils of Orites revolutus indistinguishable from contemporary specimens have been recorded in Early Pleistocene sediments from western Tasmania, suggesting the species is at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> old.|$|E
25|$|The Korean {{word for}} trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in {{recorded}} history {{around the turn}} of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, the {{development}} of poetry in the American colonies mirrors {{the development}} of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected in the mode of writing which tended to be conservative, to say the <b>least.</b> <b>This</b> {{can be seen as a}} product of the physical remove at which American poets operated from the center of English-language poetic developments in London.|$|E
25|$|No later {{mention of}} Morgantina is made until Thucydides lists {{it as part}} of the terms of a truce in the war of 427–424BCE between Syracuse and the Dorian cities of Sicily on one side, and Kamarina, the Khalkidian cities of Sicily, the Sikels, and Athens on the other side. Thucydides says that Syracuse agreed at the Congress of Gela to give Morgantina to Kamarina in return for payment of an indemnity. Kamarina was {{destroyed}} in 405 by the Carthaginians. Morgantina therefore must have been independent from at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> date, although it was soon recaptured by Dionysios of Syracuse in 396. Syracuse retained (occasionally more nominal than actual) control of Morgantina until the Second Punic War. In 317, Morgantina received the tyrant Agathocles, then in exile, and offered him help in returning to Syracuse. He was elected praetor at Morgantina, and later dux.|$|E
25|$|National glory {{returned}} in 2002–03 when Bayern achieved its fourth double {{by winning the}} Bundesliga with the second largest gap ever to the runner-up and a straight 3–1 win over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the cup final. However, the whole season was overshadowed by Bayern's unceremonious exit from the Champions League in the first group stage, {{without so much as}} a single win in six matches. The following season, the team, enhanced with the €19 million acquisition of Dutch striker Roy Makaay from Deportivo de La Coruña, overcame at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> hurdle, but even an underperforming Real Madrid in crisis managed to eliminate the Reds in the round of 16. Bayern itself was not reaching any consistent form all year and even the formerly sturdy defence proved highly vulnerable. In the end, the club's second-placed finish in the league was not descriptive of Bayern's strength but rather of inconsistent performances by its competitors. The cup elimination by second division Alemannia Aachen was symptomatic for a season in which the team showed not a single convincing performance. Even the newcomers Michael Ballack and 2002 World Cup-winning defender Lúcio could not make a difference.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I see that they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives.

500|$|After {{recovering}} from his wounds in 1945, Beynar {{decided to leave}} the resistance, and instead began publishing in an independent Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny. It was then that he took the pen-name Jasienica (from the name of the place where he had received treatment for his injuries) in order not to endanger his wife, who was still living in Soviet-controlled Vilnius, Lithuania. Soon he {{became a member of the}} weekly's staff and then an editor. In 1948 he was arrested by the Polish secret police (...) but after several weeks was released after the intervention of Bolesław Piasecki from the PAX Association. In gratitude to Piasecki, therefater he worked with PAX, leaving Tygodnik Powszechny for PAX in 1950. In 1950, he became a director of the Polish Caritas charity. Jasienica became a member of the Klub Krzywego Koła (Curved Circle Club), which espoused free speech and open discussion. His essays were published in Dziś i Jutro, Słowo Powszechne, Życie Warszawy, Po Prostu. From at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> period until his death he would live in Warsaw.

500|$|The title song, [...] "Tupelo Honey", is {{a classic}} love ballad in a vein {{established}} with [...] "Crazy Love" [...] from the album Moondance. The two songs both have the same melody, chord progression and are in 4/4 time. [...] Uncut reviewer David Cavanagh wrote that: [...] "On an album where the vocals are exultant to say the <b>least,</b> <b>this</b> song sees Morrison use larynx, diaphragm, teeth and tongue {{to find new ways}} of enunciating the lines 'she's as sweet as Tupelo honey' and 'she's all right with me', seemingly in ever-increasing adoration." [...] Bob Dylan (who performed the song with Morrison during a concert tour in the 1990s) once remarked that [...] "'Tupelo Honey' has always existed and that Morrison was merely the vessel and the earthly vehicle for it". Greil Marcus called the song [...] "a kind of odyssey" [...] evoking Elvis Presley (whose hometown was Tupelo, Mississippi), and [...] "the most gorgeous number on the album" [...] that [...] "was too good not to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeryn Hogarth {{is closely}} {{associated}} with Iron Fist in the comics, and also worked with Luke Cage as part of those characters' Heroes for Hire team. Like Daredevil, the season makes references {{to the events of}} The Avengers and the Avengers (specifically Hulk and Captain America, though not by name). Jessica also mentions Angela del Toro as another private investigator, who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K'un-Lun and Iron Fist. Paul Tassi, writing for Forbes, was disappointed with how the season fit into the larger MCU, feeling the season seemed [...] "removed from the world of The Avengers" [...] and did not acknowledge Daredevil enough given that [...] "it’s supposed to be sharing at <b>least</b> <b>this</b> little [...] of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it." [...] Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU was [...] "the show's chief advantage.

500|$|In {{his review}} {{of the first two}} episodes of the season, Brian Lowry of Variety said that while [...] "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" [...] is {{satisfactory}} and establishes the five-year jump effectively, the second episode is better, calling it [...] "a knock-out." [...] Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker commended the time jump as a reflection of both the characters' and series' ambitions, rating the episode a 'B+'. Joanna Weiss of The Boston Globe gave the episode a mixed review. She said that the time leap proved to be successful, as the show had been [...] "flailing" [...] for several seasons and concluded that, [...] "so far, at <b>least,</b> <b>this</b> season promises to be less about plot than personality. That doesn't mean the show is perfect - it never was - but it's better, and that's a big relief." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Rob Owen was positive in his review, noting that the writers handled the five-year leap well, especially in regards to Lynette's storyline. He complimented the episode's comedy and expressed his hope that the time jump would allow the writers to focus on humor rather than overly-dramatic storylines.|$|E
