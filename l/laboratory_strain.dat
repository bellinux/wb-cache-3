5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system of E. coli, but {{not based on}} evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, {{which is based on}} major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common <b>laboratory</b> <b>strain</b> has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.|$|E
5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} E. coli evolve through the natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>strain</b> MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.|$|E
5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (<b>laboratory</b> <b>strain</b> K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{very large}} number of host organisms and {{molecular}} cloning vectors are in use, the great majority of molecular cloning experiments begin with a <b>laboratory</b> <b>strain</b> of the bacterium E. coli (Escherichia coli) and a plasmid cloning vector. E. coli and plasmid vectors are in common use because they are technically sophisticated, versatile, widely available, and offer rapid growth of recombinant organisms with minimal equipment. If the DNA to be cloned is exceptionally large (hundreds of thousands to millions of base pairs), then a bacterial artificial chromosome or yeast artificial chromosome vector is often chosen.|$|E

In his experimental design in 1974, he cleaved (cut into fragments) the monkey virus SV40. He then cleaved the double helix of another virus; an antibacterial agent known as bacteriophage lambda. In the third step, he fastened DNA from the SV40 to DNA from the bacteriophage lambda.

Growth in Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems) -yeast extract {{in the presence of}} various sugars was almost the same for all of the fresh isolates, which grew generally better than the <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains.</b> This was especially noticeable on sucrose where the fresh isolates (including those isolated from hereditary-fructose-intolerant patients) grew two to four times more rapidly than the <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains.</b> The rate of acid production by the fresh isolates, measured with resting cells in the presence of glucose, was quite comparable to the rate of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains.</b> The glucose analog, 2 -deoxyglucose, inhibited the acid production from glucose by two <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains</b> (6715 and ATCC 27352), but none of the fresh isolates was affected by its presence. The antibiotic, gramicidin D, which allows free diffusion of H+ across the cell membrane, inhibited the acid production of all of the strains. Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase activity toward α-methylglucoside was found in all of the laboratory and freshly isolated strains. 2 -Deoxyglucose phosphotransferase activity was detected in all of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains,</b> but many clinical strains, especially those from hereditary-fructose-intolerant patients, contained very low or almost undetectable 2 -deoxyglucose phosphotransferase activity. In one strain, the activity was restored after repeated culturing in Trypticase-yeast extract medium supplemented with glucose. Glucokinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were detected in all of the strains tested. No marked differences were observed for these two enzymes between the fresh isolates and the <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains</b> except for three clinical strains which possessed low levels of glucokinase. The growth of all of the strains in a broth containing 4 mM glucose and 4 mM lactose was studied.

2500|$|In a {{conventional}} molecular cloning experiment, the DNA to be cloned is obtained from an organism of interest, then treated with enzymes {{in the test}} tube to generate smaller DNA fragments. Subsequently, these fragments are then combined with vector DNA to generate recombinant DNA molecules. The recombinant DNA is then introduced into a host organism (typically an easy-to-grow, benign, <b>laboratory</b> <b>strain</b> of E. coli bacteria). This will generate a population of organisms in which recombinant DNA molecules are replicated along with the host DNA. Because they contain foreign DNA fragments, these are transgenic or genetically modified microorganisms (GMO). This process {{takes advantage of the}} fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take up and replicate a single recombinant DNA molecule. This single cell can then be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule. Thus, both the resulting bacterial population, and the recombinant DNA molecule, are commonly referred to as [...] "clones". Strictly speaking, recombinant DNA refers to DNA molecules, while molecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them. The idea arose that different DNA sequences could be inserted into a plasmid and that these foreign sequences would be carried into bacteria and digested as part of the plasmid. That is, these plasmids could serve as cloning vectors to carry genes.|$|E

40|$|Gross {{variations}} {{in the structure of}} the centromere of Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromosome III (cen 3) were apparent following characterization of this centromeric DNA in strain Sp 223 and comparison of the structure with that of cen 3 in three other commonly used <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains.</b> Further differences in centromere structure were revealed when the structure of the centromere of S. pombe chromosome II (cen 2) was compared among common <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains</b> and when the structures of cen 2 and cen 3 from our <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains</b> were compared with those reported from other laboratories. Differences observed in cen 3 structure include {{variations in}} the arrangement of the centromeric K repeats and an inverted orientation of the conserved centromeric central core.

Here we describe the development and characterization of a new inbred rat strain, DOB/Oda, from wild rats (Rattus norvegicus) captured in Shitara, Aichi, Japan. Phenotype analysis of 109 parameters revealed that the DOB/Oda rats had small body weight, preference for darkness, and high locomotor activity compared with the rat strains in the National BioResource Project for the Rat (NBRP-Rat) database. Genome analysis with 357 SSLP markers identified DOB/Oda-specific alleles in 70 markers. The percentage of SSLP markers that showed polymorphism between the DOB/Oda strain and any of 132 <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains</b> from NBRP-Rat varied from 89 to 95  %.

40|$|Background: Copy number {{variation}} {{is an important}} dimension of genetic diversity and has implications in development and disease. As an important model organism, the mouse is a prime candidate for copy number variant (CNV) characterization, but this {{has yet to be}} completed for a large sample size. Here we report CNV analysis of publicly available, high-density microarray data files for 351 mouse tail samples, including 290 mice that had not been characterized for CNVs previously. Results: We found 9634 putative autosomal CNVs across the samples affecting 6. 87 % of the mouse reference genome. We find significant differences in the degree of CNV uniqueness (single sample occurrence) and the nature of CNV-gene overlap between wild-caught mice and classical <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains.</b> CNV-gene overlap was associated with lipid metabolism, pheromone response and olfaction compared to immunity, carbohydrate metabolism and amino-acid metabolism for wild-caught mice and classical <b>laboratory</b> <b>strains,</b> respectively.
