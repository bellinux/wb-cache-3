There was a crash forward as the swinging anchor struck the bow, but Miguel had men enough to stow it, and Grahame fixed his eyes ahead as he turned his wheel. Rolling across the broken swell, the Enchantress stemmed the strong flood-tide; bending palms and shadowy beach were sliding past, and the turmoil on the shoals drew nearer. Ahead was a narrow channel with about a fathom of water to the good, but the <b>leading</b> <b>marks</b> were obscured and Grahame doubted {{if he could find}} it. If the boat struck, she would be washed up, badly damaged, among the sands; but the tide was rising, and before long Macallister would have raised full steam.

40|$|A presente pesquisa explora as possibilidades de obtenção de uma resposta correta nas decisões sobre a constitucionalidade da impositividade das emendas parlamentares à lei de orçamento público, a partir dos questionamentos trazidos nas ADI 4743 e 4663, sob exame do STF. A construção dessa resposta correta, à base dos aportes de Dworkin e da hermenêutica de Gadamer, exige a concretização do princípio constitucional do planejamento público, praticamente negligenciado nas discussões sobre o processo orçamentário brasileiro. À luz da noção de pré-compreensão em Gadamer e levando-se em conta a experiência autoritária de planejamento no caso brasileiro, que evidencia o protagonismo do Poder Executivo nas áreas de planejamento e orçamento, compreende-se melhor os discursos jurídicos e decisões judiciais que reduzem ou restringem o papel do Legislativo no processo orçamentário. Advoga-se aqui que essas “opiniões prévias” afetam diretamente a interpretação quanto à possibilidade constitucional de se tornar obrigatória, pela via legislativa, a execução das despesas decorrentes das emendas parlamentares à LOA. A partir do princípio do planejamento público, os casos semelhantes aos das ADI 4743 e 4663 podem ser solucionados levando a sério o que os Ministros do STF e a doutrina jurídica já disseram sobre o assunto, sem perder de vista os horizontes abertos pelo texto constitucional vigente. Essa aposta, que estimula a narrativa jurisprudencial como um “romance em cadeia” (no dizer de Dworkin), associada à densificação do princípio constitucional do planejamento, se apresenta como blindagem possível contra decisões fundamentadas em argumentos extrajurídicos, que favorecem a discricionariedade interpretativa na aplicação do Direito, uma das principais marcas do positivismo jurídico. E a resposta correta, ao que tudo indica, acena para a adequação constitucional da execução obrigatória das emendas parlamentares, como consequência da devida participação do Legislativo nas escolhas orçamentárias. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis {{research}} explores {{possibilities of}} reaching a correct answer {{pursuant to the}} constitutionality of imposed governmental budgeting by congressional amendments, {{on the grounds of}} the issues brought by the Direct Unconstitutionality Actions (ADI) numbers 4. 743 and 4. 663 under consideration by the Brazilian Supreme Court. The construction of the correct answer, based on the contributions of Dworkin and Gadamer's hermeneutics, requires the implementation of the constitutional principle of public planning, virtually neglected in the discussions held during the Brazilian governmental budgetary process. In light of the concept of pre-understanding in Gadamer and taking into account the Brazilian authoritarian planning experience which highlights the active role of the Executive Branch in the areas of planning and budgeting, better understands the legal discourses and judicial decisions that have reduced or restricted the role of the legislative branch in the budgetary process. It is advocated here that these "preliminary opinions" have a direct effect on the interpretation of the constitutionality of budgetary constraints by congressional amendments made during the annual governmental budgetary process. In attention to the principle of public planning, cases brought to court similar to the ADI 4. 743 and 4. 663 can be solved strictly {{on the grounds of the}} previous understandings of The Supreme Court Justices and what the legal doctrine has said, without losing sight of the horizons opened by the current Constitution. This belief, that triggers the jurisprudential narrative as a "chain of romances" (in the words of Dworkin), associated with the densification of the constitutional principle of planning, is presented as a possible shield against decisions based on extra-judicial arguments that favor an interpretive discretion in the application of Law, one of the <b>leading</b> <b>marks</b> of legal positivism. And the correct answer, as it appears, indicates the constitutionality of the imposed governmental budgeting by congressional amendments as a necessary participation of the legislative branch in the public choices pertinent to the budgetary process...|$|E
