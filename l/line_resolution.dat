50|$|Pixel {{resolution}} {{is the number}} of pixels of one row on a given screen.

It is alternatively known as <b>Lines</b> of Horizontal <b>Resolution</b> (LoHR) or <b>lines</b> of <b>resolution.</b> The TVL {{is one of}} the most important resolution measures in a video system. The TVL can be measured with the standard EIA-1956 resolution chart.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1985, Sony would {{introduce}} a new feature, High Band or SuperBeta, by again shifting the Y carrier—this time by 800 kHz. This improved the bandwidth available to the Y sideband and increased the horizontal resolution from 240 to 290 lines on a regular-grade Betamax cassette. Since over-the-antenna and cable signals were only 300-330 <b>lines</b> <b>resolution,</b> SuperBeta could make a nearly identical copy of live television. However, the chroma resolution still remained relatively poor, limited to just under 0.4 MHz or approximately 30 <b>lines</b> <b>resolution,</b> whereas live broadcast chrominance resolution was over 100 lines. The heads were also narrowed to 29 μm to reduce crosstalk, with a narrower head gap to play back the higher carrier frequency at 5.6 MHz. Later, some models would feature further improvement, {{in the form of}} Beta-Is, a high band version of the Beta-I recording mode. There were some incompatibilities between the older Beta decks and SuperBeta, but most could play back a high band tape without major problems. SuperBeta decks had a switch to disable the SuperBeta mode for compatibility purposes. (SuperBeta was only marginally supported outside of Sony, as many licensees had already discontinued their Betamax line.) ...|$|R

50|$|Kell {{factor is}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly stated to exist {{to account for}} the effects of interlacing. Interlacing itself does not affect Kell factor, but because interlaced video must be low-pass filtered (i.e., blurred) in the vertical dimension to avoid spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e., flickering effects), the Kell factor of interlaced video is said to be about 70% that of progressive video with the same scan <b>line</b> <b>resolution.</b>|$|E

50|$|Whether {{the spatial}} {{resolution}} will increase accordingly, {{depends on the}} optical resolution of the complete system. The relevant parameter is the resolving power, i.e. how many lines per mm can be resolved. It increases with the aperture of the optical system and is inversely proportional to its magnification. As a result, a low-resolution camera with 500 lines would be enough for an 100X objective with 0.9 aperture. On the other hand, low-magnification objectives profit most from micro scanning: for instance for a 2,5X objective with N.A.=0.12 cameras with as high as 2500 <b>lines</b> <b>resolution</b> could be used.|$|R

When picture height is kept the same, the same 720 pixels are spread to a wider area in 16:9, hence lower horizontal resolution per picture height.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers also {{introduced}} other {{systems such as}} needle-based, record-style discs (RCA's Capacitance Electronic Disc, JVC's Video High Density disc) and Philips' LaserDisc. None of these disc formats gained much ground as none was capable of home recording; however, they did hold small niche markets. CED's inexpensive record-like format (using a fine keel-shaped stylus to read an electronic signal rather than mechanical vibrations) made it attractive to low-income families during the 1980s, and LaserDisc's 5 megahertz/420 <b>line</b> <b>resolution</b> made it popular with discerning videophiles until circa 1997 (when DVD-Video became the new standard for high-quality).|$|E
50|$|Once {{finished}} and saved to the floppy, a slide was then 'imaged' onto 35mm transparency via an electronic rostrum camera. A batch file on the VAX mini-computer would then send the images {{to the camera}} one at a time. It took about 2 minutes to produce a 2000 <b>line</b> <b>resolution</b> slide. It was also possible to mix traditional media (slide text photographed on a manual rostrum via litho film negatives) and the background 'double-exposed' over the text via the Genigraphics system. This saved time when slide presentations were in a hurry (as they usually were!).|$|E
