60|$|The Caudebec, in the Rivers of France, {{is a fine}} {{instance}} of almost every fact which we have been pointing out. We have in it, first, the clear expression of what takes place constantly among hills,--that the river, as it passes through the valley, will fall backwards and forwards from side to side, lying first, if I may so speak, with all its weight against the hills on the one side, and then against those on the other; so that, as here it is exquisitely told, in each of its circular sweeps the whole force of its current is brought deep {{and close to the}} bases of the hills, while the water on the side next the plain is shallow, deepening gradually. In consequence of this, the hills are cut away at their bases by the current, so that their slopes are interrupted by precipices mouldering to the water. Observe first, how nobly Turner has given us the perfect unity of the whole mass of hill, making us understand that every ravine in it has been cut gradually by streams. The first eminence, beyond the city, is not disjointed from, or independent of, the one succeeding, but evidently part of the same whole, originally united, separated only by the action of the stream between. The association of the second and third is still more clearly told, for we see {{that there has been a}} little <b>longitudinal</b> <b>valley</b> running along the brow of their former united mass, which, after the ravine had been cut between, formed the two jags which Turner has given us at the same point in each of their curves. This great triple group has, however, been originally distinct from those beyond it; for we see that these latter are only the termination of the enormous even slope, which appears again on the extreme right, having been interrupted by the rise of the near hills. Observe how the descent of the whole series is kept gentle and subdued, never suffered to become steep except where it has been cut away by the river, the sudden precipice caused by which is exquisitely marked in the last two promontories, where they are defined against the bright horizon; and, finally, observe how, in the ascent of the nearest eminence beyond the city, without one cast shadow or any division of distances, every yard of surface is felt to be retiring by the mere painting of its details,--how we are permitted to walk up it, and along its top, and are carried, before we are half way up, a league or two forward into the picture. The difficulty of doing this, however, can scarcely be appreciated except by an artist.|$|E

40|$|El objetivo general de este trabajo es analizar la procedencia, génesis y dinámica de transporte de los depósitos eólicos arenosos del centro-este de la provincia de la Pampa. Para ello, se analizaron el marco geológico-geomorfológico y los aspectos estratigráficos de tres sectores considerados como sendos estudios de casos: cordón medanoso La Pastoril-Santa Isabel, cordón medanoso Toay y cordón medanoso General Acha. Estos cordones se caracterizaron sedimentológicamente (granulometría, mineralogía) a través del análisis de 20 muestras. Se identificaron dos unidades eólicas asociadas a dos ciclos de sedimentación, informalmente denominadas {{inferior}} (Pleistoceno tardío-Holoceno medio) y superior (originado por acción antrópica durante el siglo XX) relacionados con vientos del cuadrante O-NO en Santa Isabel y del S y SO en General Acha. Los resultados obtenidos sugieren que la topografía sería un factor de control importante en la distribución de los sedimentos, además de la distancia al sistema fluvial, que determinaría su tamaño de grano. Los análisis mineralógicos indicarían {{un aporte}} mixto de materiales, tanto distal (sistema fluvial del Bermejo-Desaguadero-Salado-Curacó), como local (afloramientos rocosos de la provincia). The main {{goal of this}} paper is to analyze the provenience of sandy eolian deposits of the central eastern part of La Pampa Province. Considering present eolian models proposed by different authors, the hypothesis tested in this paper is that eolian sediments are the result of deflation of alluvial deposits from the Bermejo-Desaguadero-Salado-Curacó fluvial system. With this purpose in mind, three case studies were selected (La Pastoril-Santa Isabel, Toay and General Acha) (Fig. 1). The analysis was made following the concept of spatial scale hierarchy which considered the geological and general environmental setting of the studied areas along with fundamental geomorphological features of the analyzed dune systems. This was complemented by the stratigraphic survey of selected sections from which 20 samples were collected for sedimentological analysis (grain-size and mineralogy). Also, due to the lack of information, three samples were collected from the present Desaguadero fluvial system for general characterization. At the regional scale two main geoforms were identified: an extensive plain and the paleovalley of the Desaguadero fluvial system. The plain grades eastward and includes several <b>longitudinal</b> depressions (<b>longitudinal</b> <b>valleys).</b> A sandy silt mantle is covering the plain, whereas the main dune system is located along the longitudinal depressions and the Desaguadero paleovalley (Fig. 1). In the three studied areas two eolian units, informally named lower and upper, were identified. These units, separated by a buried soil, were generated by winds from the W-NW in Santa Isabel and from the S and SW in General Acha. Wind directions coincide with present wind systems. The upper part of the lower unit is modified by the development of a buried soil showing an A-C horizon sequence. This soil is only buried in areas deeply affected by anthropic activities. Away from these impacted settings, the soil is on the present groundsurface. In Toay, fossil remains of Megatherium americanum were exhumed from the lowermost part of the sampled section which together with regional evidences indicate a late Pleistocene-Holocene age to the lower eolian unit. The upper eolian unit is also restricted to areas deeply modified by human activities, where the vegetation cover was removed and the sediments exposed to eolian reactivation. The occurrence of cultural artifacts (pieces of wire fences, plastic bags) as well as written documents suggest that this eolian reactivation occurred during the XXth century. Based on the stratigraphic results, the sedimentolo-gical analysis was focused on the lower eolian unit. In all three areas the eolian sediments are medium to fine sands with unimodal distribution, transported in saltation and modified saltation or short term suspensions under relatively moderate to high wind shear velocities (Fig. 2; Tables 1 and 2). The most common light components are altered grains (24 - 56 %), quartz (14 - 36 %), K-feldspar (2 - 35 %), volcanic shards (3 - 23 %) and acid plagioclases (0. 5 - 6 %) (Table 3). Microcline, complex pyroclast (crystals with glass edges) and lithics grains are present in low percentages (up to 3 %). A high percentage of heavy minerals (4. 41 - 36. 96 %), is present showing a high variable participation of each component (Table 4). Following the classification by Dott (1964) and modified by Pettijohn et al. (1972), the eolian sediments of Santa Isabel and General Acha may be considered as arkosic sands, those from Toay as lithic sands while the fluvial samples from Santa Isabel and Puelches can be considered as sublithic sands and lithic sands respectively (Fig. 3). However, due to the higher content of volcanic glass shards in most of the samples, the sediments were renamed considering this major component plus their alteration state. Consequently, the sedimentary material is classified as altered arkosic-vitric ash sands and altered lithic-vitric ash sand (Fig. 4). The mineral assemblages of the studied eolian sediments suggest mixed sources of materials, both from distal areas (the Bermejo-Desaguadero-Salado-Curacó fluvial system), and local areas (rock outcrops located in the central part of la Pampa Province). The high degree of roundness shown by the grains, indicates that the transported material was eroded and/or weathered prior to sedimentation, suggesting a policyclic process of reworking and subaereal exposure. Regionally, the areal distribution pattern of sandy eolian deposits with dominance of bedforms (dunes) along the depressions (<b>longitudinal</b> <b>valleys)</b> and paleovalley of the Desaguadero fluvial system suggest a topographic control in the spatial distribution of eolian facies. Likely, these topographic depressions, particularly the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>valleys,</b> acted as wind corridors. At the geographic scale analyzed, the working hypothesis tested oversimplified the complexity of the eolian system...|$|R

40|$|This study aims at the {{reconstruction}} of magnitude and timing of surface uplift affecting a wide sector of the Central Apennines (Italy) by means of morphometric and morphostructural analyses. In the chain interiors (where stratigraphic and geomorphological markers of past sea-level positions are lacking) the study is based on analysis of erosional landforms and river valleys. A large-scale topographic analysis, by processing 90 -m and 230 -m DEMs, is performed. The spatial distribution of several morphometric parameters, together with characteristic wavelengths of relief, allowed the differentiation of three main regions affected by different cumulative surface uplift and tectonic/erosional fragmentation: a Peri-Tyrrhenian Belt, an Axial Belt and a Peri-Adriatic Belt. Particular attention is devoted to fluvial landforms, with analysis of longitudinal profiles and geometric pattern of the main drainage lines and their relations with the major structures. Major differences occur between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic valley systems. The Tyrrhenian drainage mainly consists of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>valleys</b> displaying overall concave-up longitudinal profiles. The Adriatic drainage is mainly constituted by transverse streams and shows less regular longitudinal profiles. Topographic features and the river valley architecture seem related to different styles and amounts of uplift in the three belts. Within the study area, a coast to coast transect (Gaeta-Vasto Transect, GVT) has been investigated in detail, focusing the analysis on its axial sector, around the Apennines main divide (Main Divide Area,MDA). A possible scheme of Quaternary surface uplift along the GVT is proposed. In the MDA, the main stages of landscape evolution and drainage organization can be reconstructed {{by means of the}} analysis of paleosurfaces coupled with study of the relict and present-day drainage networks. This allowed the recognition of a major phase of surface uplift (exceeding 1500 m in the Meta-Mainarde massif) that occurred in response to thrusting during the Pliocene. For Quaternary surface uplift a minimum value of 400 m can be estimated. This study suggests that, during the Quaternary, the Peri-Tyrrhenian Belt suffered a subdued uplift acting over small wavelengths (10 – 15 km), while the Axial and Peri-Adriatic Belts were subject to a larger and longwavelength (90 km) surface uplift, with maximum values (about 700 m) shifted to the NE of the Axial Belt and tapering to zero towards the Adriatic coast. The reconstructed pattern of uplift is coherent with the topographic properties of the three belts and with the observed drainage features...|$|R
