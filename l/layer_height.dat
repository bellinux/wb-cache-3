A NASA-sponsored study indicates an increase in the drying tendency from spring to summer over the U.S. Central Plains, especially during the transition from June to July.

5000|$|Since the {{formation}} of wetting layers occurs in a commensurate fashion at a crystal surface, there is often an associated misfit between the film and the substrate due to the different lattice parameters of each material. Attachment of the thinner film to the thicker substrate induces a misfit strain at the interface given by [...] Here [...] and [...] are the film and substrate lattice constants, respectively. As the wetting layer thickens, the associated strain energy increases rapidly. In order to relieve the strain, island formation can occur in either a dislocated or coherent fashion. In dislocated islands, strain relief arises by forming interfacial misfit dislocations. The reduction in strain energy accommodated by introducing a dislocation is generally greater than the concomitant cost of increased surface energy associated with creating the clusters. The thickness of the wetting layer at which island nucleation initiates, called the critical thickness , {{is strongly dependent on}} the lattice mismatch between the film and substrate, with a greater mismatch leading to smaller critical thicknesses. Values of [...] can range from submonlayer coverage to up to several monolayers thick.

5000|$|The main {{driver of}} the Sq current is the {{external}} (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo <b>layer</b> <b>height,</b> while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights. A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by 180°. This {{appears to be the}} result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity [...] The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity. [...] Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150 km from the equator. Such enhancement of the Sq current by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. During a solar flare, bursts of solar radiation from the environment of an active sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet. During a solar eclipse, the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area. It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity. In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar thermosphere. This current system is called Ddyn.|$|E

(iv) Occasional intense reflections from a height of about 100 km. are found - these cannot be attributed to the normal E layer and have received the name "Sporadic E". The presence of two E layers (E₁ and E₂) has been suggested by HALLIDAY (1936) and BEST and RATCLIFFE (l 978) but until recently most workers still seem to attribute these reflections to Sporadic E. Recent measurement by rockets of the electron density at E <b>layer</b> <b>heights</b> still do not confirm whether such bifurcation exists in the E region. The diurnal and seasonal variations of the first three layers indicate that the sun is the chief agent in their production.

We have studied the quarter-hourly ionograms of Kodaikanal (10. 2 ° N; 77. 5 ° E; dip 4 ° N) for the northern summer months (May-August) of 1994 and 1995 to ascertain the ambient ionospheric conditions against which the post-midnight onset of spread-F takes place.

40|$|International audienceImperfect {{representation}} of vertical mixing {{near the surface}} in atmospheric transport models leads to uncertainties in modelled tracer mixing ratios. When using the atmosphere as an integrator to derive surface-atmosphere exchange from mixing ratio observations made in the atmospheric boundary layer, this uncertainty has to be quantified and taken into account. A comparison between radiosonde-derived mixed <b>layer</b> <b>heights</b> and mixed <b>layer</b> <b>heights</b> derived from ECMWF meteorological data during May?June 2005 in Europe revealed random discrepancies of about 40 % for the daytime with insignificant bias errors, and much larger values approaching 100 % for nocturnal mixed layers with bias errors also exceeding 50 %. The Stochastic Time Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model was used to propagate this uncertainty into CO 2 mixing ratio uncertainties, accounting for spatial and temporal error covariance. Average values of 3 ppm were found for the 2 month period, indicating that this represents a large fraction of the overall uncertainty. A pseudo data experiment shows that the error propagation with STILT avoids biases in flux retrievals when applied in inversions.
