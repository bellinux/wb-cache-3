The fog layer thickness was less than 200 m. Radar reflectivity values did not exceed 225 dBZ even with visibilities less than 100 m. The onset andevaporation of fog produce different radar reflectivity-visibility relationships. The evolution of the fog layerwas modeled with a droplet activation model tha used the aerosol size distribution observed at the 60 -m altitude tower level as input. Radar reflectivity and visibility were calculated from model drop ize spectra using Mie scattering theory. Since radiative cooling rates are small in comparison with cooling rates due to adiabatic lift of aerosol-laden air, the modeled supersaturation remains low so that few aerosol particles are activated to cloud droplets. The modeling {{results suggest that the}} different radar reflectivity-v sibility relationshipsare the result of differences in the interplay between water vapor and cloud droplets during formation and evaporation of the fog. During droplet activation, only a few large cloud droplets remain after successfully competing for water vapor with the smaller activated droplets. These small droplets eventually evaporate (deactivate) again. In the fog dissolution/evaporation stage, only these large droplet need to be evaporated.

The method relies on the pan-sharpening of 3 km narrow-band channels using the 1 km high-resolution visible (HRV) channel. As solar and thermal channels had to be sharpened for the technique, a new approach based on an existing pan-sharpening method was developed using <b>local</b> regressions. A <b>fog</b> and low stratus detection scheme origi-nally developed for 3 km SEVIRI data was used as the basis to derive 1 km resolution fog and low stratus masks from the sharpened channels. The sharpened channels and the fog and low stratus masks based on them were evaluated visually and by various statistical measures. The sharpened channels devi-ate only slightly from reference images regarding their pixel values as well as spatial features. The 1 km fog and low stra-tus masks are therefore deemed of high quality. They contain many details, especially where fog is restricted by complex terrain in its extent, that cannot be detected in the 3 km reso-lution. ...|$|R
40|$|Fog {{computing}} {{is emerging}} as a promising paradigm to perform distributed, low-latency computation by jointly exploiting the radio and computing resources of end-user devices and cloud servers. However, the dynamic and distributed formation of <b>local</b> <b>fog</b> networks is highly challenging due to the unpredictable arrival and departure of neighboring fog nodes. Therefore, a given fog node must properly select a set of neighboring nodes and intelligently offload its computational tasks to this set of neighboring fog nodes and the cloud {{in order to achieve}} low-latency transmission and computation. In this paper, the problem of fog network formation and task distribution is jointly investigated while considering a hybrid fog-cloud architecture. The goal is to minimize the maximum computational latency by enabling a given fog node to form a suitable fog network and optimize the task distribution, under uncertainty on the arrival process of neighboring fog nodes. To solve this problem, a novel online optimization framework is proposed in which the neighboring nodes are selected by using a threshold-based online algorithm that uses a target competitive ratio, defined as the ratio between the latency of the online algorithm and the offline optimal latency. The proposed framework repeatedly updates its target competitive ratio and optimizes the distribution of the fog node's computational tasks in order to minimize latency. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can successfully select a set of neighboring nodes while reducing latency by up to 19. 25 % compared to a baseline approach based on the well-known online secretary framework. The results also show how, using the proposed framework, the computational tasks can be properly offloaded between the fog network and a remote cloud server in different network settings...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of the 'typical' {{amounts of}} fog intercepted by {{different}} types of cloud forests is hampered {{by a lack of}} comparative information on <b>local</b> <b>fog</b> climatology. Usually some kind of 'fog gauge' is used to characterize fog occurrence and amounts. Moreover, wind-driven fog and precipitation are difficult to measure separately and reported measurements of 'fog' often represent a combination of the two. In this paper, the term 'occult precipitation' (HP) is used to represent fog in combination with the horizontal component of wind-driven precipitation (WDR). Collection efficiencies of three widely used types of passive fog gauges, viz. a wire harp (WH) screen, a modified cylindrical gauge (MJU, Juvik-type) and a tunnel gauge (TTG, Daube-type), were derived by comparing the volumes of water collected by the respective gauges with horizontal cloud water fluxes (CWFs) derived from wind speed (u) and the fog liquid water content (LWC) as measured by a cloud particle spectrometer during conditions of fog at a windward cloud forest site in northern Costa Rica. Under conditions of fog-only, the collection efficiencies of the three gauges were linearly related to the horizontal CWF as measured by the gauges themselves. Therefore, additional information on wind speed, droplet size and fog LWC was not needed. During conditions of HP, relative collection efficiencies were derived by comparing the volumes collected by the respective gauge types. The modified Juvik gauge had an efficiency close to 100 %, independently of the wind speed and direction, whereas the efficiency of the WH depended critically on the wind speed. The tunnel gauge had an efficiency comparable to that of the Juvik gauge, with some additional catch occurring under conditions of low precipitation angles due to the reclined frontal surface of the gauge.

To achieve this, the seasonal and diurnal characteristics of fog are investigated using 35 years (1971 – 2005) of observations of meteorological parameters such as: visibility, air temperature, dew point temperature, air relative humidity, wind vector, precipitation, and cloud base height and coverage. Hourly surface observations of fifteen (15) years (1991 – 2005) are used to identify fog events induced by various physical mechanisms. Fog events are classified into fog types {{through the application of}} objective criteria that are derived upon fog formation processes and under the influence of various physiographic features. The temporal variability of different fog type occurrences are examined and the events are characterized according to their duration and intensity. The results are somehow affected by regional and <b>local</b> factors. <b>Fog</b> is mainly formed in winter time (~ 64 %) with an enhanced likelihood to appear also in late autumn (19 %).

40|$|International audienceFog is {{a weather}} {{condition}} with significant socioeconomic impacts {{associated with increased}} hazards and constraints in road, maritime, and air traffic. While current numerical weather prediction models are able to forecast situations that are favorable to fog events, {{it is very difficult}} to determine the exact location and time of formation or dissipation. One-dimensional assimilation-forecast models have been implemented at a few airports and provide improved <b>local</b> predictions of <b>fog</b> events, but this approach is limited to specific locations. The occurrence, development, and dissipation of fog result from multiple processes (thermodynamical, radiative, dynamical, microphysical) that occur simultaneously, through a wide range of conditions, and that interact nonlinearly with each other. Hence, to advance our ability to forecast fog processes, we must gain a better understanding of how critical physical processes feed back on each other and improve their parametric representations in models. To provide a dataset suitable to study these processes simultaneously in continental fog, a suite of active and passive remote sensing instruments and in situ sensors was deployed at the Site Instrumental de Recherche en Télédétection Atmosphérique (SIRTA; instrumented site for atmospheric remote sensing research) observatory, near Paris, France, for 6 months (winter 2006 / 07) to monitor profiles of wind, turbulence, microphysical, and radiative properties as well as temperature, humidity, aerosol, and fog droplet microphysics and chemical composition in the surface layer.

40|$|The {{planetary}} surfaces that {{evolve in}} the near absence of water are strikingly different from surfaces where water is abundant, but their formation is poorly documented. This research is an in-depth exemplary work in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile to understand the soil formation in hyper-arid environments, as an analog for planetary surfaces such as the Mars. In detail, the basic mechanism regarding the source material, timescale, paleo-climatic settings {{and the role of}} crypto-biotic crusts have been investigated to constrain the Atacama soil development. The geochemical, isotopic and mineralogical composition of atmospheric dust deposited along a West-East transect in the Atacama Desert, stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Andean Altiplano, was evaluated. Results suggested that the deposited salts are mainly sourced from marine aerosol, as well as <b>fog,</b> <b>local</b> entrainment of surface material and secondary reactions. A comparison of the deposition data with the geochemistry of a paleosol in the hyper-arid core of the Atacama showed that the total paleosol ion composition can be explained by long-term accumulation of atmospheric deposition, while post-depositional leaching and salt precipitation account for the ion segregation typically found in the Atacama soil profiles. This has led to a proposed soil formation mechanism in hyper-arid environments consisting of four stages of development: 1) initiation of soil development on regional bedrock material induced by salt fracturing, 2) maturation of soil sequence featured by a continuous trapping of atmospheric dust and salts and the salt segregation into discrete ionic zones, 3) termination of soil accretion due to the formation of surface blocky layer, and 4) unexpected alteration of soil accumulation induced by anthropogenic disturbance. A combination of two long-lived radioactive nuclides (10 Be and 36 Cl) was used to constrain the timescale of a 225 -cm-deep soil profile from the hyper-arid core of the Atacama. Considering the differences of 10 Be and 36 Cl nuclides in the half-life and mobility in the soil, 10 Be could indicate the fate of insoluble silicate dust (dominant in the soil matrix) because it readily adsorbs to soil particles, while 36 Cl could be used to trace the transport and fate of salts considering the chlorine 2 ̆ 7 s solubility. Soil 10 Be concentrations showed a systematic decline from surface to 225 cm deep, which has been reproduced using a simple model that assumes the soil matrix, including 10 Be, builds up as layers over time while 10 Be decays in situ. This concurs with the essence of the soil formation mechanism proposed above, i. e. the net soil accumulation via atmospheric deposition. The model estimates an age of 6. 6 ± 0. 4 Ma for the total soil profile. Likewise, the 36 Cl/Cl ratios showed a systematic decline with depth and a simple accumulation model that chloride builds up over time via atmospheric inputs and 36 Cl radioactively decays in situ also reproduces the data remarkably well. This model suggests the atmospheric origin of soil chloride and the chloride age at 225 cm of 860 (± 90) ky. Paleo-precipitation variations, which can potentially impact soil formation, were first detected from the deviations of the observed 10 Be concentrations from the above model estimates that are likely mainly due to changes in 10 Be delivery rates impacted by invariant precipitation rates. The 10 Be data suggested a drying after 4. 7 Ma, likely due to Andean uplift, and the returning to an insignificant wet period at 1 Ma, possibly connected to global climate change. Similarly, 36 Cl discontinuities with depth also suggested the interruption of long-term hyper-aridity by brief wet periods that induced chloride migration. To investigate the timescale of salt accumulation (36 Cl age: 860 ky), a new precipitation proxy (soil NO 3 - cap-delta 17 O) was calibrated using the stable oxygen isotope measurements in nitrates from four deserts with different mean annual precipitation rates. The paleo-precipitation history for the formation of the 225 -cm deep trench soil profile was then reconstructed based on the soil NO 3 - cap-delta 17 O proxy, indicating seven wet-dry cycles, likely corresponding to possible glacial-interglacial cycles operating on the 100 ky scale. Crypto-biotic crusts (CBC), a consortium of pioneer species in hostile environments, may {{play an important role in}} soil evolution. Preliminary data from a CBC distribution transect indicated that CBCs can enhance dust trapping and physical protection of the dust from wind erosion, leading to the thickened loose soil profile beneath CBCs compared to at nearby sites without CBCs. Fine particle fractions in the soil under CBCs were higher beneath CBC than those in non-CBC sites, and this was probably related to the enhanced small dust particle trapping or in situ weathering. That the profile beneath CBCs had fewer soluble ions compared to sites without CBCs suggested an enhanced leaching at sites with CBCs, though it is still unclear whether the enhanced leaching was the cause or the reason of the presence of CBCs. The bomb spike with the 36 Cl/Cl ratio of 398 × 10 - 15 was preserved on the surface at a CBC site over the past 60 years, while the subsurface 36 Cl/Cl ratios were likely homogenized due to the past more significant wet events...|$|R
