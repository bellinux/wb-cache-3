5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can <b>live</b> <b>a</b> full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
