5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered {{in a period of}} economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, over 500,000 {{jobs were}} lost, which marked the largest <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> in the United States in 34 years.

5|$|By 1950, {{more than}} half of all {{employment}} was in the manufacturing sector. Due to economic difficulties, Studebaker closed its automotive manufacturing plants in South Bend in December 1963. A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. Due to the severe <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> the city's population decreased by nearly 30,000 people during that period.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{efforts have}} been made to improve the downtown; the {{restructuring}} of manufacturing resulted in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> and retail businesses. In the early 21st century, city, university and private developers undertook several initiatives to revive downtown, related to urban design, clustering activities to attract people to the area as a destination from day through evening events.|$|E
25|$|Many {{schools in}} New Jersey {{closed for the}} day, evacuated, or were locked-down. The {{destruction}} of 30% (28.7 million sq ft) of Lower Manhattan office space accelerated the pre-2001 trend of moving jobs from Lower Manhattan to Midtown and New Jersey. Many questioned whether this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> and its associated tax base would ever be restored.|$|E
25|$|After the {{legislature}} refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism {{when he decided}} not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove.

5000|$|The {{population}} of Covington has gradually declined since reaching its peak of 11,062 in 1960. The population decline has mainly resulted from <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>jobs</b> in the area. One major <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>jobs</b> occurred after {{a fire at}} the [...] Hercules plant in June 1980, causing $23 million in damage and worker layoffs.|$|R

25|$|After World War II, coal lost {{favor to}} {{oil and natural}} gas as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more {{convenient}} to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and Luzerne counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The town, {{founded in}} 1858 upon the {{formation}} of Buchanan County, was named for Felix Grundy (1777–1840), United States Attorney General (1838–1839) and United States Senator from Tennessee (1839–1840). It was incorporated in 1876. The present courthouse dates from 1905. Since the late 19th century, this area depended on coal mining {{as the basis of}} its economy. The decline in mining resulted in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> and population.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, as {{the plant}} was no longer {{economically}} competitive with other manufacturing facilities, it was permanently closed, resulting in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> for the 900 {{people who had been}} producing seat adjusters, moldings and painted exterior components. The last day of operation was on June 12, 1998, and the 350 workers still on the payroll, who were promised job opportunities elsewhere, were given commemorative books as they punched out for their last time.|$|E
50|$|Equally, the {{railways}} that had also supported the area were also scaled back, ultimately {{culminating in the}} closure of Shildon's Wagon works in 1984 {{which resulted in the}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Among the {{indicators}} {{that might be}} used to establish an initial minimum wage rate are ones that minimize the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> while preserving international competitiveness. Among these are general economic conditions as measured by real and nominal gross domestic product; inflation; labor supply and demand; wage levels, distribution and differentials; employment terms; productivity growth; labor costs; business operating costs; the number and trend of bankruptcies; economic freedom rankings; standards of living and the prevailing average wage rate.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Pfizer {{merged with}} Pharmacia. The merger was again driven {{in part by}} the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex (celecoxib), the COX-2 {{selective}} inhibitor previously jointly marketed by Searle (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> including Terre Haute, Indiana; Holland, Michigan; Groton, Connecticut; Brooklyn, New York; Sandwich, UK; and Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Long a major {{population}} center and site of worldwide automobile manufacturing, Detroit {{has suffered a}} long economic decline produced by numerous factors. Like many industrial American cities, Detroit reached its population peak in the 1950 census. The peak population was 1.8 million people. Following suburbanization, industrial restructuring, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> (as described above), by the 2010 census, the city had less than 40 percent of that number, with just over 700,000 residents. The city has declined in population in each census since 1950.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of huge oil fields in western Canada {{starting with the}} Leduc, Alberta field in 1947, and growing imports of cheap foreign oil into eastern Canada drastically affected the demand for Canadian coal. Beginning about 1950, almost all the coal used for heating, industry, and transportation was replaced by petroleum products and natural gas. This had a devastating effect on the coal mining communities of Atlantic Canada, although in western Canada the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> in the coal industry was more than compensated for by gains in the oil industry.|$|E
25|$|Although {{still an}} {{important}} industrial city, Hopewell {{has struggled with}} transitions through <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> due to plant closures, changes in residential housing patterns, {{and the costs of}} environmental clean-up. Much of its middle class population moved to neighboring Prince George and Chesterfield Counties for newer housing during the suburban expansion of the 1960s and 1970s. The city's housing stock is dominated by relatively small homes with a significant percentage being offered as rental properties. Of these, many were hastily constructed over a century ago by DuPont to house plant workers during the First World War.|$|E
25|$|For {{decades the}} Census Bureau had been {{reporting}} a steady {{decline in the}} city's population as residents moved out to new suburbs in the postwar years, aided by newly built highways. In addition, industrial restructuring cost a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> in the late 20th century. But, according to the Census Bureau's 2006 estimates, the population was 332,252, representing a slight increase from 331,310 in 2005. The city had officially challenged the original census numbers. In addition, Mayor Mark Mallory has repeatedly argued that the city's population is 378,259, after a drill-down study was performed by an independent, non-profit group based in Washington, D.C.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, {{particularly}} in the old urban areas, this type of conflict is a common sight. In downtown Los Angeles, however, the problem is opposite. Industrial facilities are being converted to residential use, and the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles believes that this trend will cause a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> opportunities for unskilled workers.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the housing}} was {{intended}} to be temporary, for working people with families. It was a significant improvement over housing then available to them.
