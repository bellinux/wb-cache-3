40|$|Introduction: Despite great {{advances}} {{in the fields of}} medicine and sanitation, nosocomial infections remain a very common and serious issue. Many of these problems can be avoided by simple hand washing; however, pathogenic microbes can spread through other modes too. In our study, we aim to determine if the setting of an open cadaver laboratory was conducive to the transmission of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis. Methods: For this investigation, 67 volunteer medical students had their <b>laboratory</b> <b>coats</b> swabbed and sampled during their time in anatomy <b>laboratory</b> class. Each <b>coat</b> was sampled prior to cadaver contact {{and at the end of}} their time in the laboratory, which coincided with the exploration of the gastrointestinal tract. Results: We found that pathogens were present on the <b>laboratory</b> <b>coats</b> of the students. An increase in each of the three microbes for which we tested was detected at the end of the anatomy laboratory course on the garments of the participants. There were six more student <b>laboratory</b> <b>coats</b> with S. aureus in the post-dissection swabbing and there were three more student <b>laboratory</b> <b>coats</b> with S. pyogenes in the post-dissection swabbing than originally documented. E. faecalis was found on four student <b>laboratory</b> <b>coats</b> in the post-dissection swabbing compared to none pre-dissection. Discussion: From these results, we conclude that stronger infection control measures are warranted to prevent the occurrence of unnecessary disease transmission in this setting. Our study provides data that support further investigation of potential pathogen transmission by student laboratory clothing and supports the use of universal infection control procedures to provide safer environments for medical students and their contacts, including laundering protocols for coats...|$|R

The Draw-a-Scientist Test (DAST) (Chamber, 183) was used to collect data. Drawings were eval-uated using certain criterion such as a scien-tist’s appearance and investigation, knowledge and technology symbols and gender and working style, place work, expressions, titles-captions-symbols and alternative images and age. The results showed that gifted students’ perceptions about scientists were stereotypical, generally with glasses and <b>laboratory</b> <b>coats</b> and working with experiment tubes, beakers indoors and using books, technological tools and dominantly lonely males. Most gifted stu-dents drew male scientists. Although females drew male scientists, none of the boys drew female scientist...|$|R

40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} are described for {{the recovery of}} cell culture-derived varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Of the cells tested, human embryonic lung fibroblasts were the most sensitive. Storage and handling procedures were examined to determine the stability of VZV in viral transport medium. When the initial VZV titer was high (2 X 10 (4) PFU/ml) 40 % of the VZV survived room temperature for 24 h and 75 % of the VZV remained viable for this long at 4 degrees C. Recovery was 5 - to 10 -fold less at lower initial VZV titers (less than 2 X 10 (3) PFU/ml). Other factors which influenced VZV recovery included freezing at - 20 degrees C, the use of cotton or calcium alginate swabs, and filtration to remove bacterial contaminants. The tissue culture methods described were used in a reconstruction experiment to demonstrate that VZV could be recovered from a <b>laboratory</b> <b>coat</b> or human skin (0. 1 to 0. 3 % of input VZV) or from a stethoscope (19 % of input VZV) as late as 30 min after inoculation.

40|$|Physician {{and patient}} gender both {{influence}} medical communication. Nonverbal behavior is generally under-researched {{in the medical}} encounter but {{plays an important role}} for patient outcomes such as satisfaction. This article aims at identifying how specific physician nonverbal behaviors predict analogue patient satisfaction depending on physician and patient gender. Eleven physicians in a real medical encounter were videotaped and analogue patients indicated their satisfaction with each physician while viewing the videotapes. One hundred sixty-three university students participated (analogue patients). From the videotapes, 17 physician nonverbal behaviors (related to face, body, voice/speech), 2 physician appearance cues, 2 characteristics of the examination room, and 1 patient behavior were coded. For each analogue patient, the correlation between each of these coded characteristics and the patient's satisfaction was calculated, across all physicians and across male and female physicians separately. There was no main effect for patient gender but most coded characteristics showed different relations to patient satisfaction according to physician gender. Analogue patients were most satisfied with female physicians who behaved in line with the female gender role (eg, more gazing, more forward lean, softer voice) while still stressing their professionalism (<b>laboratory</b> <b>coat,</b> medical-looking examination room). For male physicians, satisfaction was high for a broader range of behaviors, partly related to their gender role (eg, louder voice, more distance to patient). To be satisfied, patients expect female and male physicians to show different patterns of nonverbal behavior. Awareness of these gender-specific expectations should be taken into account in medical training...|$|E
