25|$|The third-generation RX's new {{transmission}} can lock-up its torque converter from 2nd through 6th gears to improve fuel economy. By dropping the center <b>locking</b> <b>differential,</b> a new Active Torque Control all-wheel drive system diverts anywhere from 50% {{or up to}} 100% power to the front wheels for reduced drivetrain associated efficiency losses which in turn increases fuel efficiency. An Electric Power Steering (EPS) system replaces the previous belt-driven hydraulic pump. A double wishbone rear suspension setup replaces the previous MacPherson strut design for improved handling and greater cargo space, while an optional Sports Package adds a performance-tuned suspension.|$|E
25|$|The 6C 2500 Coloniale was a staff car {{version of}} the third series 6c 2500. It had been {{commissioned}} in 1938 by the Italian Ministry of Defense, for military use in the Italian colonies. Two prototypes 6C 2500 Coloniale were manufactured in 1939. One of them was shipped to Italian East Africa, where Giambattista Guidotti had been instructed to conduct testing in the harsh operational conditions. The car {{was the first to}} be manufactured using technology developed by the renowned Carrozzeria Touring, the Superleggera. The car had two spare wheels, a fuel tank of 120 litres and four additional reserves with a capacity of 70 litres of gasoline. In addition there was a <b>locking</b> <b>differential,</b> engaged from the dashboard by the driver. Regular production started in 1941, and the first batch of 150 vehicles was delivered between 1941 and 1942; afterwards production stopped due to the war events Total production amounted to 150 series cars plus two prototypes.|$|E
2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, double wishbone front suspension and stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod with coil springs and stabilizer bar. The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses power-assisted four-piston front and two-piston rear ventilated disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to control wheels that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> setups.|$|E

2500|$|For North America, in 2007 Toyota Racing Development (TRD) {{produced}} 3,200 units as limited production TRD Special Edition FJ Cruisers. This {{model was}} released {{with the body}} painted in a black diamond pearl color, and with a matching black roof to set itself apart from its standard, white-roofed counterparts. The special edition model included TRD cat-back exhaust system, TRD Bilstein offroad tuned shocks, rock rails, 16-inch alloy gun-metal gray finished TRD wheels with BFGoodrich all-terrain tires, and TRD badges. The TRD Special Edition also included mechanical changes to synchronize the <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> with the active traction control (resulting in the rear differential no longer overriding the active traction). Early production 2006 FJ Cruisers had an issue that caused the rear differential to override the active traction control, except in the TRD Special Editions. [...] However, by November 2006, Toyota had changed production to incorporate synchronization of the <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> with active traction control on all FJ Cruisers.|$|E
2500|$|A fairly recent {{innovation}} in automobiles is electronic traction control. Traction control typically uses a vehicle's braking system to slow a spinning wheel. This forced slowing emulates {{the function of}} a limited-slip differential, and, by using the brakes more aggressively to ensure wheels are being driven at the same speed, can also emulate a <b>locking</b> <b>differential.</b> It {{should be noted that}} this technique normally requires wheel sensors to detect when a wheel is slipping, and only activates when wheel slip is detected. Therefore, there is typically no mechanism to actively prevent wheel slip (i.e., you can't [...] "lock the differential" [...] in advance of wheel slip), rather the system is designed to expressly permit wheel slip to occur, and then attempt to send torque to the wheels with the best traction. If preventing all-wheel slip is a requirement, this is a limiting design.|$|E

50|$|Because they do {{not operate}} as {{smoothly}} as standard <b>differentials,</b> automatic <b>locking</b> <b>differentials</b> are often responsible for increased tire wear. Some older automatic <b>locking</b> <b>differentials</b> are known for making a clicking or banging noise when locking and unlocking as the vehicle negotiates turns. This is annoying to many drivers. Also, automatic <b>locking</b> <b>differentials</b> will affect {{the ability of a}} vehicle to steer, particularly if a locker is located in the front axle. Aside from tire scuffing while turning any degree on high friction (low slip) surfaces, locked axles provoke understeer and, if used on the front axle, will increase steering forces required to turn the vehicle. Furthermore, automatically <b>locking</b> <b>differentials</b> can cause a loss of control on ice where an open differential would allow one wheel to spin and the other to hold, while not transferring power. An example of this would be a vehicle parked sideways on a slippery grade. When both wheels spin, the vehicle will break traction and slide down the grade.|$|R
40|$|The {{steady-state}} {{cornering behaviour}} of rear-wheel drive vehicles fitted with <b>locked</b> <b>differential</b> is critically analysed {{by means of}} simple, albeit carefully formulated, vehicle models, which allow for a rigorous theoretical analysis. Results obtained for some classical manoeuvres, with either constant forward speed, steer angle or turning radius, clearly show that, {{in the case of}} <b>locked</b> <b>differential,</b> the vehicle cornering behaviour is strongly affected by the manoeuvre. As an important consequence, the handling diagram is not unique and the understeer gradient is no longer dependent only upon the lateral acceleration, as in vehicles equipped with an open differential. Accordingly, this study shows that some typical tools and concepts of vehicle dynamics are indeed inadequate in the case of <b>locked</b> <b>differential...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Four-wheel drive {{vehicles}} that drive off-road often use a <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> {{to keep from}} getting stuck when driving on loose, muddy, or rocky terrain. Locking differentials are considered essential equipment for serious off-road driving. Many such vehicles have a <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> on the central differential (between the front and rear axles), rear differential and front differential; or any combination of any of the three. Differential locks are also used on some [...] "non-utility" [...] four-wheel-drive vehicles (such as the Mitsubishi Shogun) to compensate for a relative lack of axle articulation (vertical wheel movement). High amounts of articulation are desirable for off-road driving, to allow the wheels to maintain ground contact over uneven surfaces, but this can lead to excessive body-roll at high speeds on the road, as well as vague steering. Such 4x4s often have suspension systems designed as a compromise between articulation and handling. If articulation is limited, one wheel on an axle may be lifted off the ground by rough terrain, thus losing all traction to all wheels (all power goes to the lifted wheel, which spins freely). A rear <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> is often supplied to make up for this compromise - if a wheel is lifted off the ground, the <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> can be brought into play, driving the wheel that remains on the ground.|$|E
