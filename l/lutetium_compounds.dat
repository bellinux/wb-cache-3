5000|$|Lutetium ( [...] ) is a {{chemical}} element with the symbol Lu and atomic number 71. It {{is the last}} element in the lanthanide series, which, along with the lanthanide contraction, explains several important properties of lutetium, such as it having the highest hardness or density among lanthanides. Unlike other lanthanides, which lie in the f-block of the periodic table, this element lies in the d-block; however, lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position. Chemically, lutetium is a typical lanthanide: its only common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds. In an aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble <b>lutetium</b> <b>compounds</b> form a complex with nine water molecules.|$|E

Actual study of these scintillators develops {{in the tree}} directions: (i) growth of large size LuAP crystals with stable properties, (ii) relationship between composition of LuYAP crystals and scintillation properties, and (iii) scintillation mechanisms in <b>lutetium</b> <b>compounds.</b> After improving of growth conditions a large size samples (length greater than 40 mm) have been prepared. Crystals show a good correlation between growth parameters, light yield and transmission spectra. We performed a series of samples with calibrated size (2 x 2 x 10 mm 3) and compare the light yield with a standard BGO and LSO samples. Mixed crystals with composition of 0. 6 less than x less than 0. 8 show a significant increase of light yield. We suggest that the short order clusterisation in mixed crystals may by playing {{an important role in}} governing the scintillation efficiency. In order to clarify the scintillation mechanism in LuAP and LuYAP crystals the measurements of absorption, emission and excitation spectra, of thermoluminescence and scintillation decay curves have been performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{order of}} the lanthanoid and cobalt moments in the hexagonal Zr 2 Fe 12 P 7 type phosphides Ln 2 Co 12 P 7 Ln Pr, Nd, Ho and Lu has been investigated by SQUID magnetization measurements and by neutron powder diffraction. The cobalt sublattices order ferromagnetically below the Curie temperatures of 136 2, 140 2, 152 2 and 150 2 K in the praseodymium, neodymium, holmium and <b>lutetium</b> <b>compounds,</b> respectively. The cobalt atoms with tetrahedral and square pyramidal phosphorus coordination carry magnetic moments of 0. 3 1 and 0. 9 1 mu B respectively, and they are aligned parallel to the hexagonal axis. Below the second transition temperature T t 15 1 K the praseodymium moments order ferromagnetically with an antiferromagnetic component relative to the cobalt sublattice and with an angle off thee axis. In contrast, the neodymium and holmium moments do not order at a well defined transition temperature, instead the order is induced gradually by the ferromagnetic cobalt sublattice. In both compounds it sets in at about 65 K. The neodymium moments are antiparallel and the holmium moments are parallel to the cobalt moments, resulting in ferri and ferromagnetism, respectively. The magnetic structures of the three compounds are confirmed by temperature and field dependent SQUID magnetization measurements of powders; for Pr 2 Co 12 P 7 and Nd 2 Co 12 P 7 these measurements were also carried out with oriented single crystals. The experimentally obtained values for the magnetic moments amount to only between 44 and 77 of the theoretical values and this is rationalized by partial disorder. C 1997 Elsevier Science S.

500|$|<b>Lutetium's</b> <b>compounds</b> always {{contain the}} {{element in the}} {{oxidation}} state +3. [...] Aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying, with the common exception of the iodide. The soluble salts, such as nitrate, sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization. The oxide, hydroxide, fluoride, carbonate, phosphate and oxalate are insoluble in water.|$|R
40|$|The title {{compounds}} {{have been}} synthesized by reacting {{the elements in}} sealed niobium or tantalum tubes in a high-frequency furnace. They crystallize with the hexagonal ZrNiAl type structure, space group P¯ 62 m. All gallides have been characterized through their X-ray powder diffractogram. The cell volume decreases from the lanthanum to the <b>lutetium</b> <b>compound</b> as expected from the lanthanoid con-traction. The structures of LaMgGa, PrMgGa, NdMgGa, SmMgGa and TmMgGa have been refined from single crystal diffractometer data. The structures contain two crystallographically independent gallium sites which both have a trigonal prismatic coordination: Ga 1 by six RE and Ga 2 by six Mg atoms. These trigonal prisms are capped on the rectangular sites by three Mg (RE) atoms, leading to coordination number 9 for each gallium atom. Together, the gallium and magnesium atoms form a three-dimensional [MgGa] network in which the rare earth atoms fill distorted hexagonal channels. Within the network the magnesium atoms have short Mg–Mg contacts, i. e. 312 pm in SmMgGa. The Mg–Ga distances in that gallide range from 284 to 287 pm. Bonding in the network is thus governed by strong Mg–Ga and Mg–Mg bonding. EuMgGa crystallizes with the orthorhombic TiNiSi type: Pnma, a = 783. 1 (2), b = 472. 8 (1), c = 829. 8 (2) pm...|$|R

40|$|The {{series of}} anionic lanthanide(III) {{sandwich}} complexes {{of the type}} [Ln(COT'') 2]- (COT'' = 1, 4 -bis(trimethylsilyl) cyclooctatetraenyl dianion) has been largely extended by the synthesis of eight new derivatives ranging from lanthanum to <b>lutetium.</b> The new <b>compounds</b> [Li(DME) 3][Ln(COT'') 2] (Ln = Y (1), La (2), Pr (3), Gd (4), Tm (6), Lu (8)) and [Li(THF) 4][Ln(COT'') 2] (Ln = Ho (5), Tm (7)) were prepared in good yields following a straightforward synthetic protocol which involves treatment of LnCl 3 with 2 equiv. of in situ-prepared Li 2 COT’’ in either DME (= 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane) or THF. The neutral actinide sandwich complexes An(COT'') 2 (An = Th (9), U (10)) and An(COT''') 2 (COT''' = 1, 3, 6 -tris(trimethylsilyl) cyclooctatetraenyl dianion; An = Th (11), U (12)) were synthesized {{in a similar manner}} starting from ThCl 4 or UCl 4, respectively. The COT'' ligand imparts excellent solubility even in low-polar solvents as well as excellent crystallinity to all new compounds studied. All twelve new f-element sandwich complexes have been structurally authenticated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All are nearly perfect sandwich complexes with little deviation from the coplanar arrangement of the substituted COT'' rings. Surprisingly, all six [Li(DME) 3][Ln(COT'') 2] complexes covering the entire range of Ln 3 + ionic radii from La 3 + to Lu 3 + are isostructural (space group P- 1). Compound 10 is the first uranocene derivative for which 13 NMR data are reported. JRC. E. 4 -Nuclear Fuel Safet...|$|R
