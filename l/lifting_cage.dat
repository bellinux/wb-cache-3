5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to <b>lift</b> a <b>cage</b> at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|R
50|$|The winding {{house at}} the Museum is a replica based on the one that used to stand at Amblecote Colliery No.2 Pit. At {{the back of the}} {{building}} is the large drum which holds the wire rope that runs over the wheel {{at the top of the}} head frame and <b>lifts</b> the <b>cage.</b> This drum is rotated by a Steam engine inside the engine house. The steam to power the engine would have come from the Egg-ended boiler in front of the engine house. Heating all the water in the boiler to convert it to steam took a long time so the fire beneath the boiler was kept lit all the time. The engine operator kept the fire stoked during the day, but at about 3pm when the shift ended the fire would be banked up and left overnight. The Museum does not use this boiler to raise steam when it operates the colliery winder, instead a smaller Vertical boiler is used which is housed at the rear of the engine house.|$|R
50|$|This book is {{extensively}} illustrated {{and describes}} {{the tools and}} machinery associated with mining. Handtools and different sorts of buckets, wheelbarrows and trucks on wooded plankways are described. Packs for horses and sledges are used to carry loads above ground. Agricola then provides details of various kinds of machines for lifting weights. Some of these are man-powered and some powered by up to four horses or by waterwheels. Horizontal drive shafts along tunnels allow lifting in shafts not directly connected to the surface. If this is not possible treadmills will be installed underground. Instead of lifting weights similar machines use chains of buckets to lift water. Agricola also describes several designs of piston force pumps which are either man or animal powered or powered by waterwheels. Because these pumps can only lift water about 24 feet, batteries of pumps are required for the deepest mines. Water pipe designs are also covered in this section. Designs of wind scoop for ventilating shafts or forced air using fans or bellows are also described. Finally ladders and <b>lifts</b> using wicker <b>cages</b> are used to get miners up and down shafts.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{describe}} behavioural responses and welfare parameters for the physostome Atlantic salmon and physoclist Atlantic cod when out of neutral buoyancy at different degrees and periods of time. The background {{for this approach}} {{is to improve the}} culture conditions by fully submergence of the farming installations, as the water below 10 m depth often is more stable in terms of environmental factors such as temperature and current in addition to the lack of waves, which again opens for alternative sites in more exposed oceanic areas. Salmon were submerged in large-scale fully submersible cages at depths between 4 to 15 m for 22 days (Paper I) and 10 to 25 m for 42 days (Paper II) under different light conditions and at various times of year. The behaviour of individual salmon in a school under submerged conditions was studied to reveal whether a range of coping abilities among individuals exists during the new and more challenging conditions (Paper III). Atlantic cod in an experimental submersible cage were raised from five different starting depths (between 30 and 8 m) and lowered from surface position to 10 m, 20 m and 30 m to test a protocol for safe lifting and lowering steps. Based on the behavioural responses, safe acclimation times before the next vertical step at high and low sea temperatures were identified (Paper IV). In Papers I and II, the general patterns of swimming depth and schooling density were studied at group level using echo-sounders in addition to swimming speed and swimming angle based on instantaneous observations with underwater cameras. Welfare parameters were defined as weight gain, feed intake, feed utilisation and fin and vertebral condition during the experimental period. The behaviour of individual salmon was studied by monitoring the swimming depth and body temperature using data storage tags implanted in randomly selected fish. Whether the development of diel vertical migration (DVM) activity during feeding was linked with individual growth rates was analysed to study individual coping styles. The immediate response and recovery time after lifting and lowering of Atlantic cod were estimated through measurements of swimming speed, swimming tail beat rate and swimming angle based on underwater camera recordings, and additionally by echo-sounder data obtained from resting fish on the net-floor (Paper IV). Atlantic salmon submerged without the opportunity to refill their swim bladder lost gas steadily over time, and the bladder was empty after about three weeks (Papers I and II). Swimming speeds were elevated on the first day after submergence and schooling became more structured (more constant speed and a greater distance to neighbouring fish). The diurnal vertical swimming pattern for the salmon in spring was broadly similar to that observed prior to submergence, as the artificial underwater lighting allowed the salmon to keep high swimming speed and lift during night (Paper III). In contrast, about 90 % of the salmon submerged below 10 m during the dark winter reversed their diurnal pattern from swimming at shallow depths at night and deeper during the day to swimming deep at night and shallower during the day (reversed DVM) or to swimming with a normal or reversed diurnal pattern on different days (irregular). A separation of faster- and slower-growing salmon also gradually appeared, where the faster-growing individuals occupied the deeper part of the water column. This situation occurred also at night {{at the end of the}} experiment among the salmon given continuous light (Paper III). Growth was clearly reduced in the salmon that were submerged during the winter, with more injuries recorded on their fins and snout. Slightly compressed vertebrae in the tail region were also observed, probably due to their tilted head-up tail-down swimming angle during the dark nights (Paper II). Lifting farmed cod from five different start depths, equivalent to a 40 % pressure reduction, resulted in strong downwards swimming movements dependent on the water temperature (Paper IV). The depth before <b>cage</b> <b>lifting</b> affected the immediate response, as the fish became more active after lifting events from shallow compared to deeper depths. Appetite decreased after lifting, but loss of behavioural control was never observed. During the subsequent 8 - 10 hr recovery periods, swimming activity gradually decreased to the same level as before lifting. The overall recovery time did not depend on start depth or temperature. Independent of final depth or temperature, rapid lowering of cod only resulted in a moderate short-term increase in upwards swimming movements, while appetite was less affected than after lifting. A compressed swim bladder after descents from the surface to 10 - 30 m leads to negative buoyancy, which required 18 - 90 h to re-fill by gas secretion, which is a temperature-related process (Paper IV). In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that air gulping is a behavioural need for Atlantic salmon, and that long term denial of surface access will reduce their welfare Atlantic cod cope well in fully submerged cages, but 40 % pressure reduction is near the upper limit for lifts of healthy farmed cod. Secondary lifts should not be done until at least 10 h after the first <b>lift.</b> <b>Cage</b> lowering should be done slowly to avoid potentially stressful crowding of negatively buoyant fish on the cage bottom, especially at low temperatures...|$|R

Reaching for the second flare, Kate drops it. Lisa lights the third flare, which reveals the face of a shark. The sisters are now surrounded by them and must rush to the surface.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Our {{experience}} with 137 patients operated on without general anesthesia is reviewed {{to explore the}} validity of our surgical strategy. Methods: Between October 1998 and January 2002, 137 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with high thoracic epidural anesthesia. There were 47 female and 90 male patients, {{ranging in age from}} 37 to 92 years (mean, 68 ± 12 years). Two patients underwent reoperation. Nineteen patients had contraindications for general anesthesia. Target vessels involved were the left anterior descending artery in 122, the right coronary artery in 6, the left anterior descending artery plus right coronary artery in 7, and the left anterior descending artery plus circumflex artery in 2 patients. Coronary artery bypass was performed through limited access in 74 patients (H-graft in 42 and rib <b>cage</b> <b>lifting</b> in 32 patients) and through a median sternotomy in 63 patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass was not used. Results: In 39 (28. 4 %) patients pneumothorax was observed during surgical intervention. There was no mortality. Of the 137 patients, 132 (96. 3 %) completed the procedure awake. In 58 patients the intensive care unit was not used. Eight patients were discharged from the hospital on the day of their operation. Mean length of hospitalization was 1 day (range, 0 – 3 days). One hundred thirty-one patients were followed up for a period of 3 months and 3 years after their operations, and 94. 7 % of the patients were symptom free. Control angiograms were obtained in 41 patients. Graft patency was 100 %, with one radial artery graft spasm. Conclusions: Our initial experience confirms the feasibility and safety of performing coronary artery bypass grafting in the conscious patient without general anesthesia. Further study is required to define the possible extent and limitations of this strategy...|$|R
