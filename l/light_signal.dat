5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February, {{the evening}} before the attacks, back in Sơn Dương, a large {{contingent}} of rebels made their final preparations before heading into battle. They met at three points; the homes of Bang and the local Confucian scholar, and in the fields. They then joined together for a final meeting before Nhu divided the combined forces in two groups. Nhu led one towards a barracks in Hưng Hóa, while the other would attack the town facilities in the district capital of Lâm Thao. Some members of the rebels wore khaki uniforms and they departed for their objective after midnight. Nhu was armed with the pistol, while the others were each given a scimitar and two bombs. The groups traversed rivers on boats and arrived outside their attack points, where they were to synchronised their assaults by sending a <b>light</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E

50|$|Double <b>Light</b> <b>signals</b> {{are capable}} of showing more {{indications}} than Single <b>Light</b> <b>signals,</b> therefore Double <b>Light</b> <b>signals</b> are more appropriate for use in dense traffic areas, such as the Sydney metropolitan area, and Single <b>Light</b> <b>signals</b> for the less intense areas.

50|$|On {{the main}} south line from Sydney, Single <b>Light</b> Colour <b>Light</b> <b>signals</b> are now {{exclusively}} used from Spring Creek bridge (south of Galong) to Albury on the Victorian border. This forms a buffer zone between the areas giving conflicting signal indications.

25|$|Right turns are {{permissible}} {{only when}} one's lane has the green <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> and the opposing traffic lane, travelling {{in the opposite}} direction, is clear and favourable to execute a right turn. However, green turning signals (the outline of a right-pointing arrow) are installed onto some traffic lights.|$|E
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|E
25|$|Drifting in open {{seas and}} {{international}} waters, as encountered on long sea voyages and by military forces, requires prolonged survival in water. Suitable life jackets are often {{attached to a}} vest with pockets and attachment points for distress signaling and survival aids, for example, a handheld two-way radio (walkie-talkie), emergency beacon (406MHz frequency), signal mirror, sea marker dye, smoke or <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> flares, strobe light, first-aid supplies, concentrated nutritional items, water purification supplies, shark repellent, knife, and pistol.|$|E

50|$|On {{most modern}} railways, colour <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> have largely {{replaced}} mechanical ones. Colour <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> {{have the advantage}} of displaying the same aspects by night as by day, and require less maintenance than mechanical signals.|$|R
50|$|In an {{inertial}} frame an observer cannot detect their motion via <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> as {{the speed of}} light in a vacuum is constant. This means an observer can detect when their motion is accelerated by studying <b>light</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
25|$|The right lane {{should be}} used when it is free (Rechtsfahrgebot) and the left lane is {{generally}} intended only for overtaking unless traffic is too dense to justify driving only on the right lane. It is legal to give a short horn or <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> (flashing headlights or Lichthupe) in order to indicate the intention of overtaking, but a safe distance to the vehicle in front must be maintained, otherwise this might be regarded {{as an act of}} coercion.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} physical mechanisms {{that can be}} used to amplify a <b>light</b> <b>signal,</b> which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, stimulated emission in the amplifier's gain medium causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), electron-hole recombination occurs. In Raman amplifiers, Raman scattering of incoming light with phonons in the lattice of the gain medium produces photons coherent with the incoming photons. Parametric amplifiers use parametric amplification.|$|E
25|$|The entire railway {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{comprehensively}} signalled heritage railways. With the exception of the connection at Kidderminster to Network Rail metals (which uses a colour <b>light</b> <b>signal)</b> the whole railway is signalled using GW style lower quadrant signals, of both metal and wooden pole/arm types (Exceptionally, the down starter at Highley has a rare concrete post). Each station (not including halts) has a signal box, with Bewdley having two boxes (North and South), due to the size of the layout there (Bewdley originally being a junction station).|$|E
50|$|Vertical color <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> are {{the second}} major pattern of color <b>light</b> <b>signals,</b> and today {{represent}} the most popular form of signal in North America, supplanting the searchlight.

40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} highly complex sensory {{mechanisms}} {{to monitor their}} surroundings and adapt their growth and development to the prevailing environmental conditions. The integration of information from multiple environmental cues enables the coordination of development with favourable seasonal conditions and, ultimately, determines plant form. <b>Light</b> <b>signals,</b> perceived via the phytochrome, cryptochrome and phototropin photoreceptor families, are especially important environmental signals. Redundancy of function among phytochromes and their interaction with blue light photoreceptors enhance sensitivity to <b>light</b> <b>signals,</b> facilitating the accurate detection of, and response to, environmental ¯uctuations. In this review, current understanding of Arabidopsis phytochrome functions will be summarized, in particular, the interactions among the phytochromes and the integration of <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> with directional and temperature sensing mechanisms. Key words: Arabidopsis, environmental cues, <b>light</b> <b>signals,</b> photoreceptors, temperature sensing mechanisms...|$|R

25|$|Many {{fish that}} exhibit biofluorescence, such as sharks, lizardfish, scorpionfish, wrasses, and flatfishes, also possess yellow intraocular filters. Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes {{function}} as long-pass filters, thus enabling {{the species that}} possess them to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fishes that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing biofluorescence potentially exploit a <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> from members of it or a similar functional role. Biofluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage, and {{that many of these}} lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.|$|E
25|$|If a {{spaceship}} travels to a planet one light-year (as {{measured in the}} Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be {{less than one year}} as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a proper velocity. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> that left the Earth {{at the same time as}} the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Cherenkov {{light has}} been used to image {{substances}} in the body. These discoveries have led to intense interest around the idea of using this <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> to quantify and/or detect radiation in the body, either from internal sources such as injected radiopharmaceuticals or from external beam radiotherapy in oncology. Radioisotopes such as the Beta emitters 18-F and 13-N or positron emitters 32-P or 90-Y have measurable Cherenkov emission and isotopes 18-F and 131-I have been imaged in humans for diagnostic value demonstration. External beam radiation therapy has been shown to induce a substantial amount of Cherenkov light in the tissue being treated, due to the photon beam energy levels used in the 6 MV to 18 MV ranges. The secondary electrons induced by these high energy x-rays result in the Cherenkov light emission, where the detected signal can be imaged at the entry and exit surfaces of the tissue.|$|E

25|$|When a 8m (26ft) long whale was sighted, chalupas (chaloupes in French, {{and later}} shallops in English) were sent out, each manned by a steersman, five oarsmen, and a harpooner. The whale was harpooned {{and forced to}} tow a wooden drogue or drag, which was used to tire the whale. Once exhausted, the whale was lanced and killed. If {{darkness}} fell upon the crews before they returned, those ashore would <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> fires at the vigías to guild {{them back to the}} station. The whales were brought alongside a wharf or cutting stage, where they were flensed. The blubber was tried out, cooled, and poured into barricas – casks of oak that held 55 gallons of oil. These casks were towed out to the ship by a boat, where they were stored in the hold. When a full cargo had been obtained, either during the right whale season, or, more often during the later bowhead season, many of the larger ships sailed to Pasaia to discharge their cargoes; they also fitted out of the same port. Pasaia was preferred by both French and Spanish Basques because of its deep-water entrance and the excellent shelter it provided from Biscay storms.|$|E
25|$|The {{track work}} is quite complex there, {{allowing}} trains {{to enter the}} Pitkin Yard from both the express and local tracks (where C trains relay {{to get from the}} southbound to the northbound local track), and with connections to the two-track Grant Avenue station from both the express and local tracks; the Grant Avenue spur then veers northeast towards Liberty Avenue. All four mainline tracks continue below the Grant Avenue connection, used only to store trains, east under Pitkin Avenue until approximately Eldert Lane (just south of the Grant Avenue station). It was planned that these tracks would continue under Pitkin Avenue to Cross Bay Boulevard, as part of a never-built system expansion which would have extended the Fulton Street Subway to the Rockaways and to Cambria Heights near the Queens-Nassau County border. On the electric <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> board in the control room at Euclid Avenue, there is a taped-over section of the board that hides the 76th Street station. There are also two tracks coming from the Pitkin Yard heading towards the planned 76th Street station site. These tracks would have merged with the mainline tracks just before 76th Street station. When Pitkin Yard originally opened, the yard leads toward 76th Street were usable to relay short trains on. Today, those two tracks are no longer connected via switches. Parts of the trackways still exist, but the switches were removed and the tunnel ends in a cinderblock wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and was similarly timed to the previous day's session. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Asmer {{come out on top}} with a time of two minutes and 13.122 seconds set nine minutes remaining in the session. The heavy damage to Grosjean's car forced him to sit out the session's opening minutes and gradually improved to be two-tenths adrift of Asmer and settled for provisionally second. Despite clipping the wall Yelmer Buurman ran strongly throughout and finished in third place with Buemi battling for pole position {{for the majority of the}} session until he dropped to fourth. Esteban Guerrieri made an improvement late on to end up fifth in front of Tsukakoshi in sixth and 2006 pole sitter Kamui Kobayashi stood in seventh. James Jakes, Streit and Jelley rounded out the top ten. Although he was at one point high up as fourth in the time sheets Jarvis was the quickest driver not to reach the top ten. Following him were the highest placed rookie Mortara, Oshima with Hülkenberg provisionally joining the Japanese driver on the seventh row in spite of him glancing the tyre barriers at Lisboa corner. Niall Breen was next up ahead of Atte Mustonen, Jonathan Kennard, Van Dam, Renger van der Zande and Senna. The rest of the order was completed Bird, Mailleux, Hartley, Grubmüller, Takuya Izawa, Ávila, Ho, Kit Meng. Cheong Lou Meng and the only driver to fail to record within 110% of Asmer was Merszei. Other incidents that occurred during first qualifying were Mustonen damaging his suspension against the tyre wall and Bird went into the barrier at Fisherman's Bend. Senna then crashed into the tyre barriers at San Francisco Bend and then was impacted by Izawa which prompted the waving of the red flags. After qualifying, numerous penalties were handed out. Kobayashi and Mutstonen were given three-place grid penalties for moving into the fast lane of the pit lane before it was declared open. Hülkenberg and Lou Meng were similarly penalised for ignoring the red <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> at the end of the pit lane which mandated them to enter the weighbridge.|$|E

The {{orientation}} of the sunrise, and birds the Malagasy had seen, did not match those of his homeland, which he pointed out to Leij, who spoke enough of the Malagasy language {{to tell him that}} the land they saw was a different part of Madagascar. They dropped anchor when the ship was [...] "a mile [...] offshore", and the mutiny's leader, with more than fifty perhaps as many as seventy other Malagasy men and women set off for the shore in the ship's longboat and pinnace.

500|$|The {{first new}} effect is the {{gravitational}} frequency shift of light. Consider two observers aboard an accelerating rocket-ship. [...] Aboard such a ship, {{there is a}} natural concept of [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down": the direction in which the ship accelerates is [...] "up", and unattached objects accelerate in the opposite direction, falling [...] "downward". Assume that one of the observers is [...] "higher up" [...] than the other. When the lower observer sends a <b>light</b> <b>signal</b> to the higher observer, the acceleration causes the light to be red-shifted, as may be calculated from special relativity; the second observer will measure a lower frequency for the light than the first. Conversely, light sent from the higher observer to the lower is blue-shifted, that is, shifted towards higher frequencies. Einstein argued that such frequency shifts must also be observed in a gravitational field. This is illustrated in the figure at left, which shows a light wave that is gradually red-shifted as it works its way upwards against the gravitational acceleration. This effect has been confirmed experimentally, as described below.|$|E
