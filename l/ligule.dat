25|$|Like {{all members}} of the Asteraceae family, Senecio squalidus has a {{composite}} flower head known as a capitulum. What look like single flowers are actually a cluster of florets, each petal or <b>ligule</b> being a flower, or floret, possessing its own stamen and capable of producing the specialized seed of the family Asteraceae, the parachute-like achene.|$|E
500|$|Seed {{germination}} is adjacent ligular—during germination, as the cotyledon expands it only {{pushes a}} portion of the embryo out of the seed. [...] As a result, the seedling develops adjacent to the seed. [...] The embryo forms a <b>ligule,</b> and the plumule protrudes from this. [...] Seedlings in cultivation are reported to begin producing a stem two years after germination, at the point where they produce their thirteenth leaf. [...] Growth rates of seedlings averaged [...] per year in Florida.|$|E
500|$|Depending on {{the variety}} and time of year, lettuce {{generally}} lives 65–130 days from planting to harvesting. Because lettuce that flowers (through the process known as [...] "bolting") becomes bitter and unsaleable, plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity. Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures, while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves. Once plants move past the edible stage, they develop flower stalks up to [...] high with small yellow blossoms. Like {{other members of the}} tribe Cichorieae, lettuce inflorescences (also known as flower heads or capitula) are composed of multiple florets, each with a modified calyx called a pappus (which becomes the feathery [...] "parachute" [...] of the fruit), a corolla of five petals fused into a <b>ligule</b> or strap, and the reproductive parts. These include fused anthers that form a tube which surrounds a style and [...] stigma. As the anthers shed pollen, the style elongates to allow the stigmas, now coated with pollen, to emerge from the tube. The ovaries form compressed, obovate (teardrop-shaped) dry fruits that do not open at maturity, measuring 3 to 4mm long. The fruits have 5–7 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs. The pappus remains at the top of each fruit as a dispersal structure. Each fruit contains one seed, which can be white, yellow, gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce.|$|E
50|$|Nereis vexillosa {{belongs to}} the phylum Annelida, a group known as the {{segmented}} worms. It is generally iridescent green and can reach 30 cm in length. It can be distinguished {{by the size of}} the upper <b>ligules</b> on the notopodia of the posterior region of the body. The upper <b>ligules</b> are much larger than the lower <b>ligules.</b> It is also without a collar-like structure around the peristomium.|$|R
50|$|The inflorescences {{are small}} flower heads with white <b>ligules</b> {{arranged}} around the yellow center.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ligules</b> {{are quite}} long, up to 5 mm, blunt, with hairy fringes around the side.|$|R
2500|$|The {{stems of}} grasses, called culms, are usually {{cylindrical}} (more rarely flattened, but not 3-angled) and are hollow, [...] plugged at the nodes, where {{the leaves are}} attached. Grass leaves are nearly always alternate and distichous (in one plane), and have parallel veins. Each leaf is differentiated into a lower sheath hugging the stem and a blade with entire (i.e., smooth) margins. The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals; some, such as sword grass, are sharp enough to cut human skin. A membranous appendage or fringe of hairs called the <b>ligule</b> lies at the junction between sheath and blade, preventing water or insects from penetrating into the sheath.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ligule</b> {{is pointed}} and silvery. Compared this to Common Meadowgrass Poa pratensis, {{which has a}} squared <b>ligule,</b> and Poa trivialis, which has a pointed, but less silvery <b>ligule.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>ligule</b> is rounded.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The purple {{colouring}} of the <b>ligules</b> {{and other}} basal parts, {{is characteristic of}} C. spicata.|$|R
50|$|In grass-like {{plants such}} as sedges (Cyperaceae) and rushes (Juncaceae), <b>ligules</b> are usually absent or poorly developed.|$|R
50|$|It is {{slightly}} creeping. The leaves are narrow, tapering to a point. The <b>ligules</b> are short (0.5 mm).|$|R
50|$|The <b>ligule</b> {{is short}} and blunt.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ligule</b> {{can also}} {{be defined as a}} membrane-like tissue or row of {{delicate}} hairs typically found in grasses at the junction of the leaf sheath and blade. The <b>ligule</b> appears to be a continuation of the leaf sheath and encircles or clasps the stem as does the leaf sheath. The three basic types of ligules are: membranous, a fringe of hairs (ciliate), and absent or lacking. Most grasses have ligules, and the shape, length, and appearance of the <b>ligule</b> margin provide consistent characters for separating genera and some species of grasses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ligule</b> {{is part of}} {{the leaf}} that is found at the {{junction}} of the blade and sheath of the leaf. It may take several forms, but it is commonly some form of translucent membrane or a fringe of hairs. The membranous <b>ligule</b> can be very short 1 - 2 mm (Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis) to very long 10 - 20 mm (Johnson grass, Sorghum halepense), it can also be smooth on the edge or very ragged. Some grasses do not have a <b>ligule,</b> for example barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli).|$|E
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is {{a cluster}} of several flower heads, each made up of about 20 golden yellow <b>ligules</b> with toothed tips, but no disc florets.|$|R
50|$|Flower {{heads are}} solitary. There is one yellow (or white with red veins) ray flower per phyllary, with 3-lobed <b>ligules.</b> The yellow disk flowers are {{narrowly}} funnel shaped.|$|R
50|$|Festucca altimssima {{also known}} as Wood Fescue, is similar but is found in rocky woods, has spikelets which droop much more but are half as long, and <b>ligules</b> 3mm long.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ligule</b> is blunt. Leaves are {{folded in}} shoot.|$|E

50|$|They {{have pointed}} <b>ligules</b> 4-10 mm long. Compare to annual meadow grass Poa annua which is silvery and pointed, and common meadow grass Poa pratensis which {{is short and}} blunt.|$|R
50|$|Lycopodiopsida is a {{class of}} {{herbaceous}} vascular plants known as the clubmosses and firmosses. They have dichotomously branching stems bearing simple leaves without <b>ligules</b> and reproduce by means of spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves. Traditionally, the group also included the spikemosses (Selaginella and relatives) and the quillworts (Isoetes and relatives) but because these groups have leaves with <b>ligules</b> and reproduce using spores of two different sizes both are now placed into another class, Isoetopsida that also includes the extinct Lepidodendrales. These groups, together with the horsetails are often referred to informally as fern allies.|$|R
50|$|Senecio inaequidens is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant about 80cm high, with practically hairless stems and leaves. The leaves are linear, entire or almost so and without petioles. The flower heads are capitula with yellow <b>ligules</b> (ray florets) about 10mm in length.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ligule</b> (from ligula [...] "strap", {{variant of}} lingula, from lingua [...] "tongue") — {{is a thin}} {{outgrowth}} at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A <b>ligule</b> is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, {{such as that of}} a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ligule</b> is 1 - 2.5 mm long, with a {{slightly}} tattered top.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Blunt <b>ligule</b> 1mm high, also {{showing a}} few very fine hairs {{of the plant}} ...|$|E
50|$|This is a small, mat-forming, {{long-lived}} perennial herb with gray-green, hairy {{leaves and}} solitary flower heads. The heads contain whitish or greenish disc florets {{and a few}} pistillate ray florets {{that do not have}} <b>ligules.</b> Flowering occurs in mid-April through mid-May.|$|R
50|$|The microphylls of Lycopodiophyta of the {{families}} Selaginellaceae (spikemosses or lesser clubmosses) and Isoetaceae (quillworts) have minute, scale-like flaps of tissue called <b>ligules</b> {{at the base of}} the upper surface of each leaf blade. This feature distinguishes them from clubmosses of the family Lycopodiaceae.|$|R
5000|$|Leaves flat, glabrous, elongate, 30-50 cm long, 1-2 cm broad, scabrous, {{slightly}} thickened at margin; <b>ligules</b> absent; sheaths smooth, lower ones often reddish; panicle 8-30 cm long, {{green or}} purple, exerted, somewhat nodding, densely branched, the branches to 5 cm long, erect or ascending sessile; ...|$|R
50|$|It {{can grow}} to 4.5 feet (1.5 Meters) tall, {{and has a}} long, narrow, pointed <b>ligule.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Between 1965 and 1971 it {{was played}} by 4 clubs (2 of each country, both Champion's and both Runner's-up), that {{face each other}} in <b>ligule</b> type {{competition}}. The competition stopped being played in 1972, but returned in 1983 with a new format, with the 2 Champion's facing each other in just one game. In the season 2007-2008 it returned to the <b>ligule</b> type competition.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} dull green. The <b>ligule</b> is blunt, but toothed {{and up to}} 6 mm long.|$|E
40|$|Stipa klimesii sp. nov. {{from the}} Western Himalayas (India: Ladakh) and its variety S. klimesii var. pubescens var. nov. are described. The new species {{is similar to}} S. roborowskyi but differs by its longer anthecium, longer <b>ligules</b> of {{vegetative}} shoots, longer hairs on seta and shorter awns. Stipa klimesii is also similar to S. purpurea, but differs by longer <b>ligules</b> of vegetative shoots, shorter awns, slightly shorter hairs on seta and by {{the character of the}} panicle, which is compressed and with straight branches in S. klimesii vs. lax and with flexuous branches in S. purpurea. Epidermal patterns of the lemma in S. klimesii and both above-mentioned species, were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Images of macromorphological and micromorphological structures are provided...|$|R
50|$|Homozeugos conciliatumis a {{perennial}} herb forming clumps, spreading {{by means of}} underground rhizomes. Stems can attain a height of up to 100 cm. It is easily distinguished from the other species in the genus by its short <b>ligules</b> (less than 6 mmm long) and involute leaves.|$|R
50|$|Petasites albus is a {{perennial}} rhizomatous herb, with large suborbicular leaves covered with lax cottony hairs.
