Microscope was initially used to detect the defect by connecting charge couple device (CCD) as an auxiliary device. In general, for microscopic measurement human eyes are used {{to focus on the}} sample. The adjustment depends on the operator’s astute measurement ability, which affected the repeatability and accuracy of the readings.

The present investigation describes about the development of an autofocus system to carry out microscopic measurement more precisely and accurately with less time. The measurement system consists of a <b>light</b> source, two <b>beam</b> <b>splitters,</b> a movable sample stage and a Mirau’s interferometer, a photo-detector and 8051 microcontroller (MCU 89 C 51).
