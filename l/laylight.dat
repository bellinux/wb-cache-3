50|$|On the {{interior}} of the building, the primary public space is the Main Hall, positioned directly in the center, and designed so that each major room is directly connected. The Main Hall is open at the second floor level (which contains a balcony that connects all the public spaces on the second floor) and is capped with a square <b>laylight</b> above. On the west side, a large wooden stair with a landing provides the primary means of getting between floors.|$|E
50|$|Some {{interior}} spaces {{have been}} altered over time. During World War II, a skylight and <b>laylight</b> that originally illuminated the postal work floor were covered {{to comply with}} black-out laws implemented to protect the country from enemy bombings. In 1980, the monumental lobby of the original building was altered and most features removed. To accommodate the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and U.S. Attorneys, GSA began an extensive renovation project in 1999. A U-shaped green-glass and aluminum curtain wall {{was added to the}} 1933 portion of the building in 2003, forming an interior atrium that, along with new skylights, admits natural light. GSA also refurbished interior stone, metal, plaster, and wood finishes; restored historic windows and doors; and added three new courtrooms. On the exterior, the cast-iron roof cresting was repaired and historically appropriate street-lights were installed on the site. The design, which was completed by R.M. Kliment & Frances Halsband Architects, received a 1998 Design Award citation from GSA.|$|E
50|$|The primary room on {{the second}} floor is the Plavcan Gallery, located {{in the center of the}} north side, {{connecting}} with the upper part of the Main Hall. The Plavcan Gallery is a large room that contains a vaulted, coffered ceiling with <b>laylights</b> set in the coffers. On the south side of the second floor, two of the offices contain <b>laylights</b> in the ceilings. The basement contains the Children's Library spaces and numerous stack areas; most of the original finishes have been replaced with modern, sound-absorbing, light materials.|$|R
50|$|Murals in {{the main}} library {{originated}} as Public Works Administration projects. Two lunettes {{in the main}} hall, designed by Bancel LaFarge of Mt. Carmel, Connecticut, depict scenes from New Haven's history. The Rip Van Winkle murals in the meeting room were painted in 1934 {{by a team of}} artists led by Salvatore DiNaio and Frank J. Rutkowski. There is also a set of stained glass windows in the Ives Library designed by David Wilson of South New Berlin, New York including circular and rectangular <b>laylights</b> as well as rectangular and half-round windows.|$|R
