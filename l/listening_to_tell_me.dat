I don't {{know what else to}} say. papal nuncio Archbishop Sambi called the office at the parish and it was my day off. We had to play phone tag. I was up at the family farm with a chain saw, working in the woods. And, when he called, I was just getting out of my pickup truck. I was in my Carhart jeans and in my work boots, and had nothing to take notes with. I was just sitting there in my truck <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> him <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I've just been named bishop. And he had to say 'Cheyenne' four times before I could understand what he was saying." ...|$|R
50|$|Coltart {{attended}} Sherborne School for Girls {{and from}} there went to Somerville College, Oxford, where she read English and Modern Languages. She applied to St. Bartholomew's Hospital's Medical College, where {{she was the first}} female editor of the Barts Journal. She earned a medical degree there and began work as a psychiatrist. Soon after Coltart began training in psychoanalysis. In her training analysis she was analyzed by Eva Rosenfeld. Coltart began her private practice in London in 1961. In 1964 Coltart qualified as an Associate Member of the British Psychoanalytical Society. She became a Full Member in 1969, and a training analyst in 1971. Much later she would write, “Ever since childhood, I could think of nothing that gave me more intense enjoyment than <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> people <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> their stories. <b>To</b> that end she consulted with patients for referral, assessing more than 3,000 patients in her career.|$|R
50|$|On July 29, 2004, {{a member}} of Atheists of Florida (Michael R. Harvey) was {{scheduled}} to give the invocation to the Tampa City Council. As the meeting opened, one of the City Council members made a motion to stop the delivery of the invocation by an atheist. Several council members defended {{the right of the}} member to deliver the invocation. The motion ended in a tie, after one council member left the meeting, asserting that “I don’t have to sit here and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> an atheist <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what I should or should not believe.” With the invocation set to begin, another two council members left the meeting rather than <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> an atheist.|$|R
5000|$|On September 14, 2016, Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Joshua Arnold {{ruled that}} all charges against Apostol and Greer must be stayed {{due to the}} {{unreasonably}} long delays in bringing the case to trial. This included long waits for the disclosure of Crown's evidence against Apostol in the case. Thomas Singleton, Apostol's lawyer, suggested that the Crown's evidence against Apostol was weak and entirely circumstantial, which contributed to the delays. Singleton was quoted as saying: [...] "From my review {{of all of the}} evidence and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Apostol <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this over the past four years, Mr. Apostol was an innocent man who {{happened to be in the}} wrong place at the wrong time." ...|$|R
40|$|For several years, I {{have been}} {{measuring}} nurse caring behaviorsand linking them to patient outcomes. Recently this work has ledto the Quality-Caring Model © (Duffy & Hoskins, 2003) and {{the testing of}} caring-based interventions. In {{the course of this}} research, I have <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> patients <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the positive outcomes that have resulted from caring interactions with nurses. Sadly, I also have heard patients voice concerns about lack of nurse caring and the resultant effects. For example, patients have reported feeling helpless, uncomfortable, anxious, unsafe, and even frightened when interacting with noncaring nurses (Duffy, 1992). Patients and their families long for human caring interactions with nurses and report negative consequences when such interactions are infrequent or absent (Reiman, 1986; Duffy, 1992). As an educator, ensuring that nursing graduates can meet the needs of patients and families is a paramount concern, and I have often wondered if nursing students are competent in caring on graduation. Identifying caring values, attitudes, and behaviors as important student learning outcomes and assessing the degree of their attainment provides im-portant evidence from which nurse educators can judge the success of their programs. The challenges of evidence-based practice are prompting nurse educators to evaluate the results of their programs in terms of specific learning outcomes. In fact, the evaluation of educational outcomes i...|$|R
60|$|How well I {{recollect}} our sitting there, {{talking in}} whispers; or their talking, and my respectfully listening, I ought rather to say; the moonlight falling {{a little way}} into the room, through the window, painting a pale window on the floor, and {{the greater part of}} us in shadow, except when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorus-box, when he wanted to look for anything on the board, and shed a blue glare over us that was gone directly! A certain mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness, the secrecy of the revel, and the whisper in which everything was said, steals over me again, and I <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> all they <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that they are all so near, and frightens me (though I feign to laugh) when Traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner.|$|R
40|$|My initial {{focus as}} a final project in the Creative Pulse was to begin to sing again. Singing {{fulfilled}} the three requirements of choice in a project: risk, rigor, and the requirement of ‘having to do it’. I had sung as a young man, and stopped {{as the result of}} <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> an adult <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I could not sing. During the following 23 years, I used percussion and became a dancer in order to express myself. The art forms of percussion and dance I was drawn to like a man is drawn to a woman that he must have. What about being drawn to an art form in order to continue existing? An artistic pursuit whose means of expression are a salvation? One can read about many artists who came into an art form out of necessity. Their life outside of expressing themselves was bleak and the art form became their cry. I by no means wish to place myself at the level of expertise of such artists that came to their art to survive, or to imply that I “paid my dues ” to th...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Running Back" [...] {{was chosen to}} be a single ahead of [...] "The Boys Are Back in Town", the latter being seen as {{possibly}} too aggressive for some radio stations to play. Frontman and songwriter Phil Lynott and producer John Alcock decided to employ session musicians to add more commercial elements {{to some of the}} tracks to try to produce a hit single, and Tim Hinkley was brought in to add keyboard parts to [...] "Running Back". Guitarist Brian Robertson was against the idea, as he liked the song as it had originally been arranged, in a blues format with his own additions of piano and bottleneck guitar. He later said, [...] "I took enormous offence to changes. I couldn't understand why they'd pay this guy a fortune just for playing what he did. <b>Listen</b> <b>to</b> it and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> it's not bollocks." [...] Robertson did not play on the finished version of the song and Hinkley is not credited on the album sleeve. Lynott said at the time that [...] "Running Back" [...] was [...] "very much influenced by Van Morrison. I really like that song." [...] Hinkley later recalled, [...] "Robbo and Scott were not keen on it at all but they were overruled." [...] Thirty-five years later, Robertson recorded his own versions of the song on his 2011 album Diamonds and Dirt.|$|R
