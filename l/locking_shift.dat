50|$|Sometimes {{it may be}} {{used for}} Arabic {{language}} as well, but the Eastern digits (encoded here in their Persian-Hindu variant) won't be used in that case because standard Arabic prefer its traditional Eastern Arabic digits, and will frequently be replaced by Western Arabic digits (encoded in the <b>locking</b> <b>shift</b> character set in column 0x30) which are also used now frequently in Urdu as well. However, in India, phones recognizing the Arabic language indication may substitute the Persian-Hindu variants of the Eastern Arabic digits by the traditional Eastern Arabic digits.|$|E
50|$|These tables allow {{using of}} {{different}} character sets {{according to the}} language the text {{is going to be}} written. The choice of table for a given message is selected in the User Data Header section of an SMS message and can be specified for the whole text (a <b>Locking</b> <b>shift</b> table replacing standard GSM 7 bit default alphabet table) or a single character (Single shift table replacing the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table). Locking and Single shift tables together in the same message are possible, if both standard default alphabet table and default alphabet extension table are to be replaced.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{stateful}} {{nature of}} ISO/IEC 2022, an identical and equivalent character may be encoded in different character sets, {{which may be}} delegated to any of G0 through G3, which may be accessed using single shifts or by using <b>locking</b> <b>shifts</b> to GL or GR. Consequently, characters can be represented in multiple ways, meaning that two visually identical and equivalent strings can not be reliably compared for equality.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the shift key while Caps Lock is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already shifted), will also shift keys which are not being <b>shifted</b> by Caps <b>Lock</b> alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>shifts</b> all keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where Caps <b>Lock</b> only <b>shifts</b> alphabet keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if Caps Lock is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the Shift key {{is the most common}} variant on English keyboards.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a new 3 D {{numerical}} code designed to solve the Einstein equations for general vacuum spacetimes. This code {{is based on the}} standard 3 + 1 approach using Cartesian coordinates. We discuss the numerical techniques used in developing this code, and its performance on massively parallel and vector supercomputers. As a test case, we present evolutions for the first 3 D black hole spacetimes. We identify a number of difficulties in evolving 3 D black holes and suggest approaches to overcome them. We show how special treatment of the conformal factor can lead to more accurate evolution, and discuss techniques we developed to handle black hole spacetimes in the absence of symmetries. Many different slicing conditions are tested, including geodesic, maximal, and various algebraic conditions on the lapse. With current resolutions, limited by computer memory sizes, we show that with certain lapse conditions we can evolve the black hole to about t = 50 M, where M is the black hole mass. Comparisons are made with results obtained by evolving spherical initial black hole data sets with a 1 D spherically symmetric code. We also demonstrate that an “apparent horizon <b>locking</b> <b>shift</b> ” can be used to prevent the development of large gradients in the metric functions that result from singularity avoiding time slicings. We compute the mass of the apparent horizon in these spacetimes, and find that in many cases it can be conserved to within about 5 % throughout the evolution with our techniques and current 1 resolution...|$|E

50|$|A key {{providing}} one of {{the functions}} Capitals lock (usually called “Caps Lock”), Level 2 lock (i. e. “Shift lock”), or Generalized lock shall be present, occupying the position C00. (The function “Generalized lock” is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series). It is to {{be noted that the}} specific way the Caps <b>Lock</b> or <b>Shift</b> <b>Lock</b> works (i. e. swapping the lock state by hitting the key, as it is usually implemented) is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series. Thus, solutions avoiding the status dependency as well as the problem of inadvertent hitting (e.g., the lock key pressed together with <b>Shift</b> turns <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> on, together with AltGr turns Caps Lock on, pressed alone switches off any lock status but has no effect when no lock status is activated) would not prevent compliance to the standard.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} above, the Caps Lock behaviour in most QWERTY keyboard layouts {{differs from}} the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> behaviour in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation.

50|$|The Kermit {{protocol}} supports {{text and}} binary file transfers on both full-duplex and half-duplex 8 bit and 7-bit serial connections in a system- and medium-independent fashion, and is implemented {{on hundreds of}} different computer and operating system platforms. On full-duplex connections, a Sliding Window Protocol is used with selective retransmission which provides excellent performance and error recovery characteristics. On 7-bit connections, <b>locking</b> <b>shifts</b> provide efficient transfer of 8-bit data. When properly implemented, as in the Columbia University Kermit Software collection, its authors claim performance is equal to or better than other protocols such as ZMODEM, YMODEM, and XMODEM, especially on poor connections. On connections over RS-232 Statistical Multiplexers where some control characters cannot be transmitted, Kermit can be configured to work, unlike protocols like XMODEM that require the connection to be transparent (i.e. all 256 possible values of a byte to be transferable).|$|R

50|$|The <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was {{introduced}} so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and {{were meant to}} be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for {{more than two or three}} consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.|$|R

50|$|In some {{keyboard}} layouts, {{the status}} of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys (verbatim as per capital <b>shift</b> <b>lock),</b> not that of the number row, which then still requires the Shift key to be pressed to reach the alternative key definitions.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} Caps Lock that behaves like a {{traditional}} <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> does exist on certain layouts {{such as the}} French AZERTY. Some operating systems and window managers allow Caps Lock {{to be used for}} a similar function. This behavior of the Caps Lock survives, however, in German and Austrian QWERTZ keyboards.|$|R
50|$|While {{the typical}} locking {{behaviour}} on keyboards with Caps Lock key {{is that of}} a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> mode.|$|R

40|$|A digital {{negative}} {{phase shifter}} circuit is present to provide negative delays (phase shift) {{in order to}} avoid multi-locking hazards. It can adjust the negative phase by using mul-tiplexers and voltage variable delay cells to select the re-quired phase shift. The design is implemented by 0. 35 m CMOS 1 P 4 M technology. A single-shot locking method is adopted to reduce the locking time. Most important of all, the negative phase shift is predictable and adjustable.

40|$|AbstractNeuronal firing in the hippocampal {{formation}} {{relative to}} the phase of local field potentials (LFP) has {{a key role in}} memory processing and spatial navigation. Firing can be in either tonic or burst mode. Although bursting neurons are common in the hippocampal formation, the characteristics of their locking to LFP phase are not completely understood. We investigated phase-locking properties of bursting neurons using simulations generated by a dual compartmental model of a pyramidal neuron adapted to match the bursting activity in the subiculum of a rat. The model was driven with stochastic input signals containing a power spectral profile consistent with physiologically relevant frequencies observed in LFP. The single spikes and spike bursts fired by the model were locked to a preferred phase of the predominant frequency band where there was a peak {{in the power of the}} driving signal. Moreover, the preferred phase of <b>locking</b> <b>shifted</b> with increasing burst size, providing evidence that LFP phase can be encoded by burst size. We also provide initial support for the model results by analysing example data of spontaneous LFP and spiking activity recorded from the subiculum of a single urethane-anaesthetised rat. Subicular neurons fired single spikes, two-spike bursts and larger bursts that locked to a preferred phase of either dominant slow oscillations or theta rhythms within the LFP, according to the model prediction. Both power-modulated phase-locking and gradual shift in the preferred phase of locking as a function of burst size suggest that neurons can use bursts to encode timing information contained in LFP phase into a spike-count code...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new stable high order Digital Phase Lock Loop (DPLL) design {{technique}} is proposed. This technique uses linear theory {{to design the}} DPLL. The stability of the DPLL is guaranteed by placing a restriction on the system gain. This stability boundary is found by transforming the system transfer function to the Z-domain and plotting the root locus of the LPLL for values of gain where all the system poles lie inside the unit circle. The max value of gain where all the poles lie inside the unit circle is the stability boundary. It is shown that the stability boundary of the LPLL {{is comparable to the}} stability boundary of the DPLL. Finally where the above Bessel filter system produces slow <b>lock,</b> gear <b>shifting</b> of the DPLL components is considered. This allows the DPLL to start off with a wide loop bandwidth and switch to the narrow bandwidth once the system has locked...|$|R
50|$|The Caps Lock key {{originated}} as a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key on mechanical typewriters. An early {{innovation in}} typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|R

Since the RAM exists and the coefficient rAM varies from 0 to 2 % owing to environmental changes, the LD frequency is unstable with a maximum instability of ~[*] 10 −[*] 9. It is noted that, the RAM level {{is not necessary to}} be eliminated but need to be constant for a frequency stabilized LD. And under a well stable environment, the RAM fluctuation can be smaller than its maximum value of 2 %, for example, with RAM fluctuation of 0.5 %, the stability of 10 −[*] 10 order can be achieved. However, since the RAM can be randomly fluctuated by environmental effects, it should be locked to some reliable point, such as the elimination point. The simulation shows that the RAM error can significantly reduce the frequency stability of iodine-frequency-stabilized LDs and limit their application in high-precision engineering.|$|R
