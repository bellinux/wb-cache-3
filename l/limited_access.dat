5|$|Groesbeck Highway runs {{northeast}} from Hoover Street crossing out of Wayne County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road. The trunkline here is {{parallel to}} railroad tracks through Warren. M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange located on the Warren–Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System. M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which is a <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System. Between this intersection and Harrington Street, Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north, crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt. Clemens. M-97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt. Clemens before re-entering Clinton Township. Groesbeck Highway and M-97 ends at M-59/Hall Road, another <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> county primary road in Macomb County located in place of 20 Mile Road.

5|$|In 2001, the DelDOT {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{for a future}} north–south <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> highway in Sussex County.

The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; {{and the ability to}} build the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US113 corridor, using as much of the current US113 route as possible. For its standing US113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro–South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.|$|E
