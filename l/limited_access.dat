5|$|Groesbeck Highway runs {{northeast}} from Hoover Street crossing out of Wayne County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road. The trunkline here is {{parallel to}} railroad tracks through Warren. M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange located on the Warrenâ€“Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System. M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which is a <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System.

5|$|In 2001, the DelDOT {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{for a future}} northâ€“south <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> highway in Sussex County.

The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; {{and the ability to}} build the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US113 corridor, using as much of the current US113 route as possible. For its standing US113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboroâ€“South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.|$|E
