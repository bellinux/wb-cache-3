25|$|On February 14, 2014, Toyota {{announced}} a global recall of third generation Prius. The recall {{is related to}} a software fault having been identified in the hybrid-control system which might cause the hybrid drive inverter transistors to overheat. This will cause the car {{to go into a}} limited performance mode (i.e. <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> mode) or may even stall the car entirely. Owners will be notified with a letter to rectify the problem for free of charge or reimbursement for anyone who was charged to rectify the problem prior to recall.|$|E
2500|$|... {{chance to}} {{challenge}} Häkkinen. Both Williams were gone, and the teammates {{of the two}} front-runners were showing no signs of mounting an attack, but it seemed the Brazilian might indeed have the speed to chase down the Finn's McLaren. The gap dropped steadily, down to 2.2 seconds on Lap 61, until smoke started to appear intermittently {{at the back of}} car number 2. The engine note on the long front straight each time by {{made it clear that the}} usually bulletproof Ferrari was on its last legs. On Lap 71, with Coulthard closing in, Schumacher could hope no longer that his teammate would <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> in second. The German took second from Barrichello, and on the next lap, Coulthard took third, just a few turns before the Ferrari seized and spun on the infield straight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{performance}} of the Spitfire over Dunkirk {{came as a surprise}} to the Jagdwaffe, although the German pilots retained a strong belief that the 109 was the superior fighter. The British fighters were equipped with eight Browning [...]303 (7.7mm) machine guns, while most Bf 109Es had two 7.92mm machine guns supplemented by two 20mm cannons. The latter was much more effective than the [...]303; during the Battle it was not unknown for damaged German bombers to <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> with up to two hundred [...]303 hits. At some altitudes, the Bf 109 could outclimb the British fighter. It could also engage in vertical-plane negative-g manoeuvres without the engine cutting out because its DB 601 engine used fuel injection; this allowed the 109 to dive away from attackers more readily than the carburettor-equipped Merlin. On the other hand, the Bf 109E had a much larger turning circle than its two foes. In general, though, as Alfred Price noted in The Spitfire Story: ...|$|E

60|$|Dragging is {{even more}} wearisome than plowing, in some respects, for you have no handles to assist you and your heels sinking deep into the soft loam bring such unwonted strain upon the tendons of your legs that you can {{scarcely}} <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> to supper, {{and it seems that}} you cannot possibly go on another day,--but you do--at least I did.|$|E

50|$|On February 13, 2010, Carnival Legend had {{to reduce}} speed and <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> due to a {{mechanical}} problem that drastically reduced the ship's speed.

50|$|Villeneuve running {{very low}} {{downforce}} soon {{spun out of}} the race, and Häkkinen started catching Schumacher again. Häkkinen was just three seconds behind {{with a handful of}} laps remaining, but then his rear brakes failed, sending him into a wild spin at the Roggia chicane. He was able to keep his engine running and kept going, but {{at the beginning of the}} next lap he went off again at the first Rettifilo chicane, and Irvine reeled him in and took 2nd off him. Soon after Ralf Schumacher caught and over took Häkkinen who was able to <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> in 4th.|$|E
5000|$|Deteriorating weather conditions, however, {{hampered}} {{the clearing}} of group 13, in an operation begun on 5 September.

As fierce fighting over Dunkirk took place, McKnight claimed a victory over a Bf 109 on 28 May but his Hurricane was hit, {{and he had to}} <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> with his oil and coolant systems shot up.

50|$|In New Guinea, the {{squadron}} covered landings and supported offensive ground operations in New Britain, New Guinea, and Hollandia, {{with the group}} moving forward to different bases as territory was captured from the Japanese. At Cape Gloucester, the P-40s were replaced by P-38F Lightnings that were ferried up from Australia. It was with the P-38 that the 8th Fighter Group became truly effective both against the Japanese Zero in air-to-air battles, {{as well as providing}} ground support to MacArthur's ground forces. Its twin engines offered an additional safety factory when operating over long stretches of water and jungle. The Lightnings proved to be extremely rugged and could take a lot of battle damage and still keep flying. Missions lasting 9, 10, or even 12 hours became routine, and many wounded Lightnings were able to <b>limp</b> <b>home</b> on only one engine.|$|E

The Spurs would be near the top in the Western Conference all season battling the Phoenix Suns for {{the best record in the}} NBA. Just as it appeared the Spurs would cruise toward the playoffs, their season suddenly hit a bump in the road when Tim Duncan went down in a March 20 loss to the Detroit Pistons with a sprained ankle.

Anna just continues to do so anyway, affectionately reassuring him that since they're in a foreign country, nobody would know that they're related as the Prince and Princess (which some fans have interpreted as an implication of possible incest between twins, considering the intense level of intimacy between the pair; while other fans have interpreted it as merely just the personal freedom of the siblings to express their familial bonds sans expected formalities), despite Mihael's embarrassment.|$|E

50|$|To {{speed up}} the task of {{bringing}} cheese home from the shop, Wallace deploys a remote-controlled trolley equipped with a camera and accessories to retrieve/carry items. Though it successfully picks up the largest wheel of Edam in the shop Wallace frequently patronises, the weight causes one wheel to fall off. Gromit guides it to grab a loaf of French bread, which it uses as a crutch to <b>limp</b> <b>home.</b> The other wheel comes off at the front door, stopping the trolley and, in the process, dumping the Edam in the garden. Wallace sends Shaun the Sheep to bring it in, but Shaun begins eating the cheese instead. Wallace keeps calling Gromit, who {{is still in the}} basement, to stop Shaun, but Gromit ignores him while Shaun happily munches away on the cheese.
