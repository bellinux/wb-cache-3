25|$|Horizontal or lateral gene {{transfer}} (HGT or LGT) is {{the transmission of}} portions of genomic DNA between organisms through a process decoupled from vertical inheritance. In the presence of HGT events, different fragments of the genome {{are the result of}} different evolutionary histories. This can therefore complicate the investigations of evolutionary relatedness of lineages and species. Also, as HGT can bring into genomes radically different genotypes from distant lineages, or even new genes bearing new functions, it is a major source of phenotypic innovation and a mechanism of niche adaptation. For example, of particular relevance to human health is the <b>lateral</b> <b>transfer</b> of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants, leading to the emergence of pathogenic lineages.|$|E
500|$|One {{important}} {{development in}} the study of microbial evolution came with the discovery in Japan in 1959 of horizontal gene transfer. This transfer of genetic material between different species of bacteria {{came to the attention of}} scientists because it played a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. More recently, as knowledge of genomes has continued to expand, it has been suggested that <b>lateral</b> <b>transfer</b> of genetic material has played an important role in the evolution of all organisms. These high levels of horizontal gene transfer have led to suggestions that the family tree of today's organisms, the so-called [...] "tree of life," [...] is more similar to an interconnected web or net.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 December 2001, Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov {{presented}} {{a preliminary report}} to Putin. Ustinov wrote that the entire exercise had been [...] "poorly organized" [...] and that the probe had revealed [...] "serious violations by both Northern Fleet chiefs and the Kursk crew." [...] Shortly afterward, Putin transferred the Northern Fleet commander, Vyacheslav Popov, and his chief of staff, Admiral Mikhail Motsak. As is common in such circumstances, both soon obtained [...] jobs elsewhere in the government. Popov became a representative for the Murmansk region in the Federation Council, and Motsak became deputy presidential envoy for the North-Western Federal District. Popov and Motsak had championed the story that the accident had been caused by a collision with a NATO submarine. When Putin dismissed them, he {{made a point of}} repudiating the collision theory. In another example of a <b>lateral</b> <b>transfer,</b> Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov had been an outspoken advocate of the theory that the Kursk had collided with a foreign submarine. He had also been in charge of the rescue operation and follow-up inquiry. In February 2002, Putin removed him from his position as Deputy Prime Minister and made him Minister of Industry, Science, and Technology.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} an innovative approach to phylogenies {{based on the}} reduction of multistate characters to binary-state characters. We show that the reduction to binary charactersâ€™ approach {{can be applied to}} both character- and distance-based phylogenies and provides a unifying framework to explain simply and intuitively the similarities and differences between distance- and character-based phylogenies. Building on these results, this article gives a possible explanation on why phylogenetic trees obtained from a distance matrix or a set of characters are often quite reasonable despite <b>lateral</b> <b>transfers</b> of genetic material between taxa.

5000|$|Although gene {{comparisons}} and phylogenetic {{studies are}} helpful in investigating horizontal gene transfer, the DNA sequences of genes {{are even more}} revelatory of their origin and ancestry within a genome. Bacterial species differ widely in overall GC content, although the genes in any one species' genome are roughly identical with respect to base composition, patterns of codon usage, and frequencies of di- and trinucleotides. As a result, sequences that are newly acquired through <b>lateral</b> <b>transfer</b> can be identified via their characteristics, which remains that of the donor. For example, many of the S. enterica genes that are not present in E. coli have base compositions that differ from the overall 52% GC content of the entire chromosome. Within this species, some lineages {{have more than a}} megabase of DNA that is not present in other lineages. The base compositions of these lineage-specific sequences imply that at least half of these sequences were captured through <b>lateral</b> <b>transfer.</b> Furthermore, the regions adjacent to horizontally obtained genes often have remnants of translocatable elements, transfer origins of plasmids, or known attachment sites of phage integrases.|$|E
