40|$|A new {{apparatus}} for mixing {{sample and}} reagent in flow injection analysis is described. The continuously variable volume reactor (CVVR) replaces the conventional mixing coil in a flow injection manifold to provide mixing and dilution. A <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> allows {{control of the}} chamber volume via Lab VIEW software. The chamber volume can be incremented in steps of 1 uL over the range 68 - 1704 uL. In addition, the chamber has an integral variable-speed stirring unit that is also under computer control. Experiments were performed to evaluate the dispersion characteristics of this new device, evaluate the volume reproducibility, and understand the mixing characteristics. Use of the chamber {{is shown in the}} determination of iron (II) in pond water, and in NIST SRM 1643 d with excellent results and a detection limit of 3. 7 ug/L iron(II).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPrevious {{studies have}} {{identified}} preload forces {{and an important}} feature of skillful execution of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) as performed by manual therapists (eg, doctors of chiropractic and osteopathy). It {{has been suggested that}} applying a gradual force before the thrust increases the spinal unit stiffness, minimizing displacement during the thrust. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the vertebral unit biomechanical and neuromuscular responses to a graded increase of preload forces. MethodsTwenty-three participants underwent 4 different SMT force-time profiles delivered by a servo-controlled <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> and varying in their preload forces, respectively, set to 5, 50, 95, and 140 N in 1 experimental session. Kinematic markers were place on T 6, T 7, and T 8 and electromyographic electrodes were applied over paraspinal muscles on both sides of the spine. ResultsIncreasing preload forces led to an increase in neuromuscular responses of thoracic paraspinal muscles and vertebral segmental displacements during the preload phase of SMT. Increasing the preload force also yielded a significant decrease in sagittal vertebral displacement and paraspinal muscle activity during and immediately after the thrust phase of spinal manipulation. Changes observed during the SMT thrust phase could be explained by the proportional increase in preload force or the related changes in rate of force application. Although only healthy participants were tested in this study, preload forces may be an important parameter underlying SMT mechanism of action. Future studies should investigate the clinical implications of varying SMT dosages. ConclusionThe present results suggest that neuromuscular and biomechanical responses to SMT may be modulated by preload through changes in the rate of force application. Overall, the present results suggest that preload and rate of force application may be important parameters underlying SMT mechanism of action...|$|E

40|$|Safety {{issue is}} great concern for {{rehabilitation}} robots {{that are expected}} to contribute to future aging society. Appropriate compliance is required for their joints. However, combination of servomotors and high-ratio gears, such as harmonic gears makes the joint of robots nonbackdrivable. The nonbackdrivability causes lack of adaptability and safety.
