5|$|Outer {{space is}} sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic {{molecules}} discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> {{the big bang}} and {{the origin of the}} universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it meets}} the {{definition}} of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|The Epsilon Eridani {{system also}} {{includes}} two belts of rocky asteroids: at about 3AU and 20AU from the star. The orbital structure could be maintained by a hypothetical second planet, which if confirmed would be Epsilon Eridani c. Epsilon Eridani hosts an extensive outer debris disk of remnant planetesimals <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the system's formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall {{was a result of}} unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E
50|$|Siamese was {{released}} in Sweden by Vertigo. Vertigo followed up with a translation of Sauermugg in April 2007. This edition, however, {{was different from the}} Norwegian original. It included some of the later published Sauermugg-monologues, together with <b>left</b> <b>overs</b> <b>from</b> the time the book was written, about 50 pages of new material all together. The expanded edition was entitled Sauermugg Redux. Siamese has since been translated into Danish, Czech and English.|$|R

5|$|His {{regime was}} also hostile towards the country's {{immediate}} neighbours. Albania {{did not end}} its state of war with Greece, <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania (known to Greeks as Northern Epirus) as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the loss of}} life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold War years. <b>Left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought to be used to broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be heard today.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
50|$|The Super 9‘s {{were the}} first Triumphs to use 12-volt {{electrics}} (early Southern Cross’s still used 6-volt for a short period) {{and the first to}} be fitted with a Coventry Climax engine, which was made under licence by Triumph. Two 6-volt batteries were housed under the rear passenger floor, while the prototype had a single 12-volt battery on the bulk head. Many of the chassis and transmission components were <b>left</b> <b>overs</b> <b>from</b> the Super 7’s and 8’s.|$|R

5|$|It was {{formerly}} {{thought that the}} dust was <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> {{the formation of the}} cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure. Instead, it seems that the cluster is simply passing through a particularly dusty region of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford Birchard Hayes (October 4, 1822– January 17, 1893) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 19th President of the United States from 1877 to 1881. He assumed the presidency {{at the end of the}} Reconstruction Era through the Compromise of 1877.

50|$|The album, {{initially}} {{intended for}} a May 19, 2008 release date, was pushed back to May 26, 2009 by Reach Records. In {{order to make}} up for the delay, Reach Records made two <b>left</b> <b>over</b> tracks <b>from</b> the album freely available online.|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms facing {{starvation}} are not modelled accurately by the monod equation. A computer teaching program uses {{additional terms}} to related specific growth rate coefficient to concentration of growth-limiting nutrient {{and focuses on}} endogenous metabolism. It presents graphs of cell concentration and nutrient concentration versus dilution rate in systems for continuous cultivation. Bioreactors with low nutrient concentrations that are analyzed by the program are (1) chemostat with dilute feed, (2) cascade where the second stage gets the dilute <b>left</b> <b>overs</b> <b>from</b> the first stage, and (3) recycle where {{a high concentration of}} cells keeps the nutrient concentration low...|$|R

5|$|The 10 DH-4s were war loss {{replacements}} {{sponsored by}} the Over-Seas Club of London. An additional DH-9 was donated {{by the city of}} Birmingham. The SAAF's initial fleet was completed by two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> Allister Miller's wartime recruitment campaign and handed over to the Union Defence Force in October 1919. According to author Dave Becker, there is no record of the B.E.2s ever being used after 1919.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will {{to see if he was}} capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, and with the dissolution of her third marriage, Kalep began a new business venture in the American toy market. She designed a doll named Patsie Parachute which, when thrown into the air, would fall down slowly as a parachutist would. The dolls were produced in a New York factory where Kalep herself was forced to work to sustain the business. Her health deteriorated, however, and her profits from the business were spent almost entirely on medical costs; {{she was forced to}} close the factory in 1946. She had recovered by 1950 and made a living by selling patents for toy designs to larger businesses. One of her successful designs was Scribbles Dolls—toy dolls with blank faces that could be individually decorated by children—which was inspired by the 50,000 doll heads she had <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the closure of the Patsie Parachute factory.|$|E

50|$|When Changampuzha {{joined the}} preparatory {{class in the}} primary school at Edappally, Raghavan Pillai was {{studying}} in the second form. Because of this seniority he did not mingle with Changampuzha. Changampuzha also had started writing small poems by this time. Ragavan Pillai {{did not want to}} recognise this talent of Changampuzha. Thus he started ridiculing him through poems. Changampuzha's grand mother was a maid servant at the Edappally Palace. So naturally she used to bring home the <b>left</b> <b>overs</b> <b>from</b> the Palace. This issue was highlighted in the poems written by Raghavan Pillai, which made Changampuzha uneasy. Both behaved as enemies and used every situation to defeat each other.|$|R
50|$|Their third album, Bishesh Droshtobbo, was {{initially}} planned as a B-Side {{album of the}} 2nd album with the <b>left</b> <b>over</b> tracks <b>from</b> their second album.

5|$|In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, {{vegetarian}} borscht {{served with}} sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as , is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to {{provide an opportunity to}} use up the beet sour <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended {{with sour cream}} is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the First World War, due in part to a wish to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) <b>left</b> <b>over</b> <b>from</b> the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
50|$|With {{the surge}} of growth seen in major western cities {{emerging}} {{after the end of}} the Second World War, a fluxing demand for large scale high-rise developments within these cities came which, using an à la mode contemporary style, took use of modern technologies and <b>left</b> <b>over</b> materials <b>from</b> the war.|$|R
