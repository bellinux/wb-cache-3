5000|$|For Classic Rock Revisited, Rick Nielsen {{was interviewed}} by Martin Popoff {{at the time of}} the albums release, with the article title [...] "The Rockford Files". One {{question}} asked by Popoff was about the contrast between the assembly of the last two studio albums. Nielsen stated [...] "Well, this one wasnt done like, you know, were going to make an album. We didnt sit down and block off one month in one place. We did it over a year. We mixed it all at one time, but we recorded it... well, just look at the credits: L.A., New York, Boston, Rockford, Chicago, Nashville, Florida. So thats really it. I think the longest we were in one spot was maybe a week. We travel all the time, so were already traveling. We say, <b>lets</b> <b>try</b> out this studio; if weve got extra time available, and our gear is here, lets do it. That way were kind of on the road. And its not like, if you get stuck, and something is not working, youre sitting there for a month trying to figure out something. You decide, well, thats good enough. But this way we get to let the songs breathe a bit. There was good stuff we left off. Its not like we took only the best. Of course, good stuff, but theres some other stuff that is equal or better than some of the things that are on there that was left off because, well, I dont want to put it out until its finished. Robins got one great song we took off. But he was uncomfortable with it. Hey, youve got to respect that. I chose to have it on, but he decided to leave it off. Being a songwriter, I know when something is missing and you dont like it. And if you settle; youre mad forever, because its on an album." ...|$|E
5000|$|T.N.T. {{contains}} {{some of the}} bands best-known songs, including the title track, [...] "Its a Long Way to the Top", [...] "The Jack", and [...] "Rocker." [...] Seven of the albums nine songs were written by the Young brothers and Scott, while [...] "Can I Sit Next to You Girl" [...] predated Scotts involvement in the band, having been recorded as a single with former vocalist Dave Evans. It features a different arrangement and slightly different lyrics from the original version. It also runs almost a minute longer. [...] "School Days" [...] is a cover version of a Chuck Berry song, {{a major influence on}} both Young brothers. [...] "High Voltage" [...] was the first song written and recorded for the album, the title inspired by that of the previous album. In 1993, Angus Young shared the origins of the title track with Vic Garbarini of Guitar For the Practicing Musician: [...] "I remember sitting home one night before going into the studio and playing around with some chords, and I suddenly thought, <b>lets</b> <b>try</b> playing...A...C...D...C. Sounded good. And then I thought AC/DC...power..."High Voltage"! I sang the chorus part to my brother in the studio and he thought it sounded great." [...] Issued as the first single before the T.N.T. sessions began, many fans thought it was from High Voltage. Chris Gilbey of Albert Productions later claimed this caused a late surge in that albums sales. Lyrically, the LP features Bon Scott chronicling both {{the good and the bad}} about the rock and roll lifestyle, warning aspiring musicians that [...] "its harder than it looks" [...] ("Its a Long Way to the Top") but also defiantly telling the moral majority to [...] "stick your moral standards cause its all a dirty lie" [...] ("Rock n Roll Singer"). In 1994, biographer Clifton Walker observed that Bon was [...] "virtually encapsulating his entire life" [...] in both songs. The lyrics of [...] "The Jack," [...] sometimes titled [...] "(Shes Got) The Jack," [...] were developed by Scott, who was inspired by a letter Malcolm Young received during a tour of Adelaide. The letter, from a woman in Melbourne, implied that Malcolm had given her a venereal disease, although he claims that when he got tested, he was clean. Scotts original lyrics were far more explicit than those heard on the album, which he deliberately toned down in case the song got played on radio. The bravado-driven [...] "Live Wire," [...] which was also sexually suggestive, would be the bands show-opener for several years. Almost right from the beginning, the band was taken to task in some quarters for their [...] "smutty" [...] lyrics, as Angus acknowledged to Guitar Worlds Tom Beaujour in 1998: ...|$|E
40|$|Today, science have a {{powerful}} tool for the description of reality - the numbers. However, the concept of number was not immediately, <b>lets</b> <b>try</b> to trace the evolution of the concept. The numbers emerged as the need for accurate estimates of the amount in order to permit a comparison of some objects. So if you see to it how many times a day a person uses the numbers and compare, it becomes evident that the comparison is used much more frequently. However, the comparison is not possible without two opposite basic standards. Thus, to introduce the concept of comparison, must have two opposing standards, in turn, the operation of comparison is necessary to introduce the concept of number. Arguably, the scientific description of reality is impossible without the concept of opposites. In this paper analyzes the concept of opposites, {{as the basis for the}} introduction of the principle of development. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the autho...|$|E

Presenter 1 : Professor MARGARET HAMILTON – Moving on up <b>Lets</b> <b>try</b> to work toward building a workforce that is capable and respected for its alcohol and other drug specific knowledge, evidence grounded interventions and capacity to deliver them with appropriate skill. There remains much to do to achieve this. While there are many committed and experienced people working in this sector, we remain unclear about just what is required to call ourselves alcohol and drug expert workers. At last years APSAD I provocatively said that we sometimes could be accused of dishing up ‘nice mush’; not necessarily sound treatment. This is to the disadvantage of our sector and to those who work in it. If we are to command respect we need capacity to conduct expert assessments and to professionally intervene. To achieve this we need to raise the bar if we want consistency, respectable salaries and clarity of our ‘products’ to ensure appropriate expectations for our service consumers. There is also a place for us to extend and expand our capacity for secondary (and tertiary) consultation through working with other services to ensure that sound alcohol and drug knowledge informs the delivery of services. Drug users often have mixed motivations and complex needs and are not always ready {{to take advantage of the}} interventions that our sector should, in my opinion, be offering directly. Lets discuss and debate this so as to be sure that we move the bar upward; not allow it to be eroded down. Presenter 2 : Dr KEN PIDD – Vocational Education and Training (VET) Certificate IV in AOD work as a workforce development strategy One strategy for up-skilling the existing workforce and ensuring a qualifi ed future workforce is the establishment of a minimum level of AOD qualifi cations. While there is support for the adoption of the Certificate IV in AOD work as a minimum qualification, current use of the Certifi cate IV as a minimum qualification is largely informal (with the exception of Victoria & the ACT). However, there are potential barriers and limitations to the adoption of the Certifi cate IV as a minimum AOD qualifi cation. While it may be an appropriate strategy for workers with few or no relevant skills, it may not be appropriate for the substantial proportion of AOD workers with higher level qualifi cations and skills. A minimum qualifi cation may also result in the minimum qualifi cation becoming the accepted standard for AOD work, providing no incentive for workers to seek out higher level qualifi cations. In addition, some AOD agency managers have expressed dissatisfaction with Certificate IV training. To examine these issues, NCETA conducted a secondary analyses of data obtained from more than 3, 500 students enrolled in VET AOD courses at the Certifi cate IV and Diploma level and from more than 200, 000 students enrolled in AOD relevant graduate and postgraduate courses. The purpose of these analyses was to compare the demographic profile of students enrolled in VET and higher education courses in order to determine any implications for AOD workforce development and to identify the extent to which VET was used as a career/higher education pathway. In addition, an on-line survey of more than 200 AOD treatment agency managers was conducted to determine levels of satisfaction with VET training in AOD work and attitudes toward VET qualifi cations in AOD work as a minimum qualifi cation for AOD workers. Results and implications for AOD workforce development will be presented. Presenter 3 : Dr KIERAN CONNOLLY – Three Community Services Training Packages, one Minimum Qualifi cations Strategy and about 1, 000 AOD workers: Refl ections on the Victorian experience The establishment of nationally accredited AOD qualifi cations within the 1999 Community Service Training Package provided the impetus for the Victorian government to redirect funding away from traditional non accredited training to the provision of formal qualifi cations, primarily at the Certifi cate IV level. This in turn led to the establishment of a Minimum Qualifications Strategy in 2002 that applied to all government funded AOD workers in Victoria whereby it was incumbent upon them to commence/complete additional AOD specifi c courses. This paper reflects on the establishment of the original MQS, associated angst from the sector, the intricacies of working with unwieldy and poorly constructed national competencies, and on forced amendments to the MQS based on non negotiable changes to the Community Services Training Package. It will also provide statistical information on the Victorian AOD sector in terms of attainment of specialist AOD qualifi cations, its progression through MQS and refl ections from AOD workers and AOD managers on their experience with MQS. Presenter 4 : SUE HELFGOTT – Helping Change The Volunteer Addiction Counsellors’ Training program, commenced in 1989 and trained over 600 volunteer counsellors across Western Australia. The program has been adapted and used across a number of Jurisdictions including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Northern Territory and South Australia; as well as Jersey, United Kingdom and the Maldives. In 2001 the program was awarded the Premier’s Award in the category of Social and Community Development and the Organisational excellence prize in the same year by the Ted Noffs Foundation. In 2008 the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing provided a grant to update the current manual and disseminate it across Australia. As part of this review, the program’s name changed to refl ect the broader target group being trained: this includes paid and unpaid Drug and Alcohol Counsellors. This paper will refl ect on the evolution of the Helping Change training program, highlight key ingredients for best practice in AOD knowledge and skills workforce development and discuss barriers and opportunities in training paid and unpaid staff in working in the AOD sector. Panel discussion The above presentations will be followed by a Panel Discussion where the WFD content of the papers presented and related issues will be critiques. Panel participants will include the above speakers together with: David McDonald, Larry Pierce, and James Pitts. Ann Roche will moderate the Panel Discussion.
