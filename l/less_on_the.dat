5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{countryside}} {{and more on}} his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
5|$|In the 1810s and 1820s, greater {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s after the development of wrought-iron-jacketed steel cannon by William Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{opposition of}} prose and poetry, {{focused on the}} poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates. The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between {{the creation of a}} poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.|$|E

5|$|Derby Place was {{situated}} in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter, south of St Paul's Cathedral, more or <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> College's present location. There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications {{to the structure of}} Derby Place over many years. However, little record of its appearance has survived, except the description that the buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle, entered through a gate with a portcullis on the west side. On the south range, roughly where Queen Victoria Street now stands, was a large hall on the western end. Derby Place's hearth tax bill from 1663, discovered in 2009 at the National Archives at Kew, showed that the building had about thirty-two rooms, which were the workplace as well as the home to eleven officers of arms.|$|E
5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made {{minor changes to the}} proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E

5|$|The Loudest Engine {{features}} a sound {{adapted to the}} genres of folk and rock, {{more so than the}} previous two Howling Bells records. Juanita explained that the band relied <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sound technology that was prominent in Radio Wars, instead returning to the more organic state of Howling Bells. For the new album, Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon Düül and Aphrodite's Child. Howling Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You're Strange, which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine.|$|E
5|$|The crémant {{produced}} in the Languedoc is made according to the Méthode Traditionnelle - formerly known as méthode champenoise, the same method used to produce the Champagne, including a second fermentation in the bottle to encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast - in the small villages around the town of Limoux. The wines are normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging on the lees. The Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled méthode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lees before the bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.|$|E
5|$|The progressions in {{northern}} art developed almost simultaneously {{with the early}} Italian Renaissance. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, {{to the extent that}} many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north. The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, {{as can be seen in}} the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks. The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition, and <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> classical tradition prevalent in Italy.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{parliamentary}} {{discussion of}} the design focused <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anticipated cost of the ships than the idea that France was being {{left behind in the}} technological arms race, particularly in regard to the innovative Parsons steam turbines used by HMS Dreadnought. In response the navy sent a technical mission to inspect the Parsons factory, several shipyards, and gun factories as well as the Barr & Stroud rangefinder factory in May 1906 and concluded that the turbines offered more power in a smaller volume than triple-expansion steam engines at a significant increase in fuel consumption at low speeds. Two ships had already been ordered from the naval dockyards three months previously when the navy decided to use the turbines in July. To further complicate things, Gaston requested a study using the heavier and more powerful 45-caliber 305-millimeter Modèle 1906 gun on 3 August while not endorsing the navy's decision to use turbines. On 6 October the director of naval construction, M. Dudebout, urgently requested a decision while recommending that three ships use steam engines and the others turbines. He felt that this would minimize delays and expense as the design needed to be modified to accommodate the turbines and their four propeller shafts, no company in France knew how to build the turbines, and the latter were three times as expensive as steam engines. Gaston was inclined to accept Dudebout's recommendation, but prevaricated until December, after parliamentary debates showed overwhelming support for turbines in all six ships. Contracts for the remaining four ships were signed on 26 December, the day after the conclusion of the debate. Gaston also delayed in deciding on which boilers to use. He sent another technical mission to Britain to look at Babcock & Wilcox's design in April 1907, but did not make a decision in favor of French-built boilers until 3 June 1908, after all the ships had been laid down.|$|E
