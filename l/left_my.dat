25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never <b>left</b> <b>my</b> position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball <b>left</b> <b>my</b> hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I <b>left</b> <b>my</b> {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Also in 1962, Bennett {{released}} his recording of [...] "I <b>Left</b> <b>My</b> Heart in San Francisco", a decade-old but little-known song originally written for an opera singer.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{premature}} deaths of Winehouse and Whitney Houston, Bennett called for the legalization of drugs in February 2012. In October 2012, Bennett released Viva Duets, [...] an album of Latin American music duets, featuring Vicente Fernández, Juan Luis Guerra, and Vicentico among others. [...] The recording and filming for the project, in Fort Lauderdale, was co-sponsored by the city. On October 31, 2012, Bennett performed [...] "I <b>Left</b> <b>My</b> Heart in San Francisco" [...] in front of more than 100,000 fans at a City Hall ceremony commemorating the 2012 World Series victory by the San Francisco Giants.

500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Astoria to an Italian-American family, Bennett began singing at an early age. He fought {{in the final stages}} of World War II as a U.S. Army infantryman in the European Theater. Afterward, he {{developed}} his singing technique, signed with Columbia Records and had his first number-one popular song with [...] "Because of You" [...] in 1951. Several top hits such as [...] "Rags to Riches" [...] followed in the early 1950s. He then refined his approach to encompass jazz singing. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as The Beat of My Heart and Basie Swings, Bennett Sings. In 1962, Bennett recorded his signature song, [...] "I <b>Left</b> <b>My</b> Heart in San Francisco". His career and his personal life experienced an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era.|$|E
500|$|The bass aria {{illustrates}} the words [...] "" [...] (Soon to the right, soon to the <b>left</b> <b>my</b> erring steps lean) in jagged motifs {{and a frequent}} switch between winds and strings. In the middle section steady steps picture [...] "" [...] (Yet go with me, my Savior). The final part combines both elements. Gardiner notes that Bach uses the winds and strings in concerting choirs (cori spezzati), enforced by positioning them on galleries, one of them right, the other left of the singers. The technique had been practised in Venice in the late sixteenth century and introduced in Germany by composers such as Heinrich Schütz who studied in Venice. Gardiner observes also a hint at the style of French opera which Bach may have heard, traveling as a boy in northern Germany, at the Hamburg opera, in Celle or Lüneburg.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Debbie Googe and Colm Ó Cíosóig <b>left</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine. Googe, who briefly {{worked as}} a taxi driver {{following}} her departure, formed the indie rock supergroup Snowpony with Katharine Gifford, who also performed with Stereolab and Moonshake, and Ó Cíosóig relocated to the United States, forming Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions with Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star. Shields and Butcher attempted to record a third studio album, which Shields claimed would be released in 1998. However, Butcher departed the band in 1997. Unable to finalise a third album, Shields isolated himself, and {{in his own words}} [...] "went crazy", drawing comparisons in the music press to the eccentric behavior of other musicians, including Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd. Shields later became a touring member of Primal Scream, collaborated with a number of artists including Yo La Tengo, Dinosaur Jr., and Le Volume Courbe and recorded songs for the soundtrack to the 2003 film Lost in Translation.|$|E
500|$|Conway's {{departure}} <b>left</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine {{without a}} lead vocalist—a situation Shields, Ó Cíosóig and Googe decided to amend by placing advertisements {{in the local}} music press. The audition process, which Shields described as [...] "disastrous and excruciating", was unsuccessful due to Shields [...] "mentioning The Smiths, because [...] liked their melodies", which attracted a number of vocalists he referred to as [...] "fruitballs". Although considering forming another group, the band were recommended a number of vocalists from peers and experimented with two lead vocalists, Bilinda Butcher and Joe Byfield. Byfield was deemed unsuited as a vocalist and the band recruited Butcher. Butcher, whose prior musical experience was playing classical guitar {{as a child and}} singing and playing tambourine [...] "with some girlfriends for fun", had learned that My Bloody Valentine needed a backing vocalist from her partner, who had met Colm Ó Cíosóig on a ferry from the Netherlands. At her audition for the band, she sang [...] "The Bargain Store", a song from Dolly Parton's 1975 album of the same name.|$|E
500|$|The song {{features}} a Motown sound-style [...] "telegraph key" [...] rhythm, which {{gave it the}} feeling of a pop song. This and the [...] "baby, baby" [...] refrain gave the song a throwaway quality that fit in with Achtung Babys mission of deconstructing U2's image. Paradoxically, the arrangement also featured U2's 1980s [...] "repeato-riff" [...] guitar style {{and the rest of the}} lyric was a serious love song that dealt with themes of anxiety and despair. [...] Bono has described [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] as [...] "an epic U2 song [...] the key of it <b>left</b> <b>my</b> voice in a conversational place and allowed a different kind of lyric writing." [...] Producer Eno wrote that a combination of opposites within each song was a signature characteristic of Achtung Baby and that as part of that, [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] had a [...] "helicopterish melancholy".
