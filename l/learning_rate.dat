40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>rates</b> for regularized least-squares {{algorithms}} are in {{most cases}} expressed {{with respect to the}} excess risk, or equivalently, the L_ 2 -norm. For some applications, however, guarantees with respect to stronger norms such as the L_∞-norm, are desirable. We address this problem by establishing <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> for a continuous scale of norms between the L_ 2 - and the RKHS norm. As a byproduct we derive L_∞-norm <b>learning</b> <b>rates,</b> {{and in the case of}} Sobolev RKHSs we actually obtain Sobolev norm <b>learning</b> <b>rates,</b> which may also imply L_∞-norm rates for some derivatives. In all cases, we do not need to assume the target function to be contained in the used RKHS. Finally, we show that in many cases the derived rates are minimax optimal...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{established}} an empirically successful framework for adapting <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This effectively removes all needs for tuning, while automatically reducing <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> over time on stationary problems, and permitting <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> to grow appropriately in non-stationary tasks. Here, we extend {{the idea in}} three directions, addressing proper minibatch parallelization, including reweighted updates for sparse or orthogonal gradients, improving robustness on non-smooth loss functions, in the process re-placing the diagonal Hessian estimation procedure that {{may not always be}} avail-able by a robust finite-difference approximation. The final algorithm integrates all these components, has linear complexity and is hyper-parameter free. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Recent {{work has}} shown that AdaBoost {{can be viewed as}} an {{algorithm}} that maximizes the margin on the training data via functional gradient descent. Under this interpretation, the weight computed by AdaBoost, for each hypothesis generated, {{can be viewed as a}} step size parameter in a gradient descent search. Friedman has suggested that shrinking these step sizes could produce improved generalization and reduce overfitting. In a series of experiments, he showed that very small step sizes did indeed reduce overfitting and improve generalization for three variants of Gradient_Boost, his generic functional gradient descent algorithm. For this report, we tested whether reduced <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> can also improve generalization in AdaBoost. We tested AdaBoost (applied to C 4. 5 decision trees) with reduced <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> on 28 benchmark datasets. The results show that reduced <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> provide no statistically significant improvement on these datasets. We conclude that reduced <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> cannot be recommended for use with boosted decision trees on datasets similar to these benchmark datasets...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Barbara Heyns (1978), {{a limited number of}} studies have {{attempted}} to assess the unique contribution of schooling to children’s cognitive achievement by comparing their <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> during the school year and the summer vacation. These studies invariably found significantly faster <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> during the school year as compared to the summer, thereby adding to the evidence of an absolute effect of schooling. Whereas most of these studies indicate that schooling has an attenuating effect on the growth of the achievement gaps between different socioeconomic groups, there is considerably less consensus on the effect of schooling on other(e. g. racial/ethnic) achievement gaps. In this study, we use multilevel piecewise growth curve modelling to analyse growth in mathematical skills throughout kinder-garten and first grade in a sample of more than 3500 Flemish children. First, the <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> during the school year are compared with the <b>learning</b> <b>rates</b> during the summer. Second, we investigate whether schooling has a positive effect on the achievement gaps between children from different socioeconomic, racial/ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.

5000|$|AdaGrad (for {{adaptive}} gradient algorithm) is {{a modified}} stochastic gradient descent with per-parameter <b>learning</b> <b>rate,</b> {{first published in}} 2011. Informally, this increases the <b>learning</b> <b>rate</b> for more sparse parameters and decreases the <b>learning</b> <b>rate</b> for less sparse ones. This strategy often improves convergence performance over standard stochastic gradient descent in settings where data is sparse and sparse parameters are more informative.
