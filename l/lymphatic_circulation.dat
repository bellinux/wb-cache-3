40|$|The {{hyaluronic acid}} {{receptor}} for endocytosis (HARE; also designated Stabilin- 2) mediates systemic clearance of hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfates from the vascular and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>circulations.</b> The internalized glycosaminoglycans are degraded in lysosomes, thus completing their normal turnover process. Sinusoidal endothelial cells of human liver, lymph node, and spleen express two HARE isoforms of 315 and 190 kDa. Here {{we report that}} the 190 - and 315 -kDa HARE isoforms, expressed stably either in Flp-In 293 cell lines or as soluble ectodomains, specifically bind heparin (Hep). The Kd for Hep binding to purified 190 - and 315 -kDa HARE ectodomains was 17. 2 ± 4. 9 and 23. 4 ± 5. 3 nm, respectively. Cells expressing HARE readily and specifically internalized 125 I-streptavidin-biotin-Hep complexes, which was inhibited > 70 % by hyperosmolar conditions, confirming that uptake is mediated by the clathrin-coated pit pathway. Internalization of Hep occurred for many hours with an estimated HARE recycling time of ∼ 12 min. Internalized fluorescent streptavidin-biotin-Hep was present in a typical endocytic vesicular pattern and was delivered to lysosomes.

However, {{it is not known}} whether Stab 2 function or HA-Stab 2 signaling play any role in embryonic development. Here we show that Stab 2 functions in a signal transduction pathway regulating arterial-venous differentiation during zebrafish embryogenesis. Stab 2 morpholino knockdown embryos (morphants) display an absence of intersegmental vessels and defects in the axial vessel formation. In addition, Stab 2 morphants show defects in arterial-venous differentiation including the expansion of venous marker expression. Simultaneous knockdown of Stabilin- 2 and Has 2, an HA synthetase, results in a synergistic effect, arguing that HA and Stab 2 interact during vasculature formation. Stab 2 morphants display reduced Erk phosphorylation in the arterial progenitors, which is a known transducer of VEGF signaling, previously associated with arterial-venous differentiation. In addition, VEGF signaling acts as a negative feedback loop to repress stab 2 expression.

The literally enormous number of publications upon the subject testifies to the interest in it. The naturally radical see in it the greatest therapeutic advance of the century, while even the most conservative concede it a great step in advance. No one dealing with pulmonary tuberculosis can ignore it. Controversy still reigns on some points; is silenced on others. How {{the various forms of}} collapse therapy work their effect physiologically, whether through an influence on the pulmonary <b>lymphatics</b> or <b>circulation,</b> is not settled. On the mechanical side, however, there is considerable agreement. The diseased lung is subject to tension and trauma owing to its enforced apposition to the moving chest wall. Cavities are held open, fibrous scar tissue cannot contract beyond a limited degree. Both stretch and contract with respiration. Collapse procedures change the condition from tension to relaxation, permit the retraction of scar tissue and the closure of cavities, lessen respiratory trauma, and thereby greatly aid nature in the healing process. None of these surgical measures heals in itself, although with their help nature can and does heal more quickly and more effectively. A patient may, with a successful pneumothorax, lose his symptoms, close a cavity, and be outwardly well in a few weeks, but the healing process is only begun. The fundamental point must be stressed that all collapse or compression methods are merely adjuvants to the old, time-tried therapy of rest. They are designed to increase the lung rest and render it more effective. They do not replace other forms of lung rest.

Much less studied is lymphangiogenesis, the growth of lymphatic vessels, which drain extravasated fluid, proteins, and cells and transport {{them back to the}} venous circulation. Nonetheless, insufficient lymphangiogenesis causes incapacitating lymphedema, while lymphatic growth around tumors may facilitate metastatic spread of malignant cells that ultimately kill the patient.

Similar observations were made when 3 MPD (minimum protective dose) of antitoxin were injected into each of the above sites a few minutes after the intramuscular injection of toxin. Local tetanus followed intramuscular, endoneurial, and epineurial injection of the toxin; blood-borne tetanus also appeared in the latter instance. Tetanus dolorosus followed intraspinal injection of toxin. Both dorsal tetanus and blood-borne tetanus developed after subdural administration of toxin. Blood-borne tetanus, alone, appeared following intravenous and subarachnoid injection of toxin. In no case did injection of antitoxin at the various sites listed above prevent local tetanus from developing after intramuscular injection of toxin. Of the various sites injected with antitoxin, the intramuscular, intraspinal, and intravenous were the most effective. It is suggested that the endoneurial tissue spaces serve as a conduit for tetanus toxin from the muscle to the CNS. The perilemma of the peripheral nerve trunk may act as a selectively permeable membrane which permits tetanus toxin to pass from the epineurium to the endoneurium. Outward diffusion of toxin from the endoneurial spaces is apparently markedly reduced. The antitoxin probably is prevented from permeating this barrier in either direction.

Because the short range and high Linear Energy Transfer of alpha particles and the heterogeneous uptake of alpha-immunoconjugates, conventional macroscopic dosimetry is not applicable to Targeted Alpha Therapy. This thesis {{is concerned with}} the development of microdosimetric techniques to investigate therapeutic efficacy and the limitations of alpha and beta radioimmunotherapy at different stages of cancer development. Methods: Specific Monte Carlo microdosimetric models were developed for each cancer stage as follows: 1. 	Isolated cancer cells in transit in the <b>lymphatic</b> and vascular <b>circulation,</b> 2. 	Pre-vascular cancer cell clusters, and 3. 	Solid tumors with vasculature. Specific energy distributions in the target were calculated using the Geant 4 Monte Carlo technique. Hit probability, cell survival fraction and tumor control probability were calculated with different geometries size, different source distribution and different isotopes. Lymphocyte and capillary endothelial cell models were constructed to calculate the therapeutic toxicity. In laboratory studies, two vascular disruption agents were tested in vitro or in vivo for the potential synergy of Targeted Alpha Therapy with 213 Bi by enhancing the delivery of alpha-immunoconjugates in solid tumor. Results: The efficacy of alpha particles to regress isolated cancer cells, small cell clusters and small solid tumors was determined but was found to be limited in larger cell clusters and solid tumors because of the short range and shallow penetration. Compared to beta particles, alpha particles could deposit three logs more dose in the tumor. The therapeutic gain of 180 was found for 213 Bi in the metastatic melanoma clinical trial and validated the hypothesis of Tumor Anti-vascular Alpha Therapy. A vascular disrupting agent was demonstrated to disrupt capillaries formed in vitro by human vascular endothelial cells. However, in vivo studies were inconclusive. Conclusion: The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the damage effects of the Targeted Alpha Therapy for cancer. The success of Targeted Alpha Therapy for solid tumor relies on the extravascular diffusion of the alpha-immunoconjugates, which could be enhanced by vascular disruption agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{lymphatic system}} has {{fundamental}} physiological roles in maintaining fluid homeostasis, immune cell trafficking and lipid transport {{from the small}} intestine to the venous <b>circulation.</b> <b>Lymphatic</b> vessels are the main functional organ responsible for the diverse transport roles the system plays. Unlike the blood vasculature, the lymphatic system {{does not have a}} central pump, such as the heart, and relies on a variety of factors to move lymph through. It was long thought that only external factors, such as skeletal muscle contraction and lymph formation, {{played a role in the}} functional transport capacity of these vessels. With the advancement of imaging capabilities (both hardware and software), it has become clear in the past two decades or so that the main factor in driving lymph transport is the ability of these vessels to intrinsically contract whereby each vessel is comprised of a chain of ‘mini pumps’ in series. The functional capacity of these vessels is thus now understood to be primarily determined by this pumping activity that has been shown to be regulated by various mechanical and biochemical cues. Lymphatic vessel dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of diseases including many lipid related pathologies and a neglected tropical disease known as lymphatic filariasis. While it has been possible to study the vessel function in the context of fluid drainage and immune cell trafficking, the capability to understand the role of lymphatic vessels in lipid transport has not been available due to the lack of experimental animal models and acquisition systems. As part of this thesis, we sought to develop an experimental animal model along with hardware and software tools to investigate the interplay between lymphatics and their lipid content. We report the first functional measurements of how vessels respond to elevated lipid loads.

40|$|Arshad Ali Khan, Jahanzeb Mudassir, Noratiqah Mohtar, Yusrida Darwis School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Minden, Penang, Malaysia Abstract: The {{delivery}} {{of drugs and}} bioactive compounds via the lymphatic system is complex and dependent on the physiological uniqueness of the system. The lymphatic route {{plays an important role}} in transporting extracellular fluid to maintain homeostasis and in transferring immune cells to injury sites, and is able to avoid first-pass metabolism, thus acting as a bypass route for compounds with lower bioavailability, ie, those undergoing more hepatic metabolism. The lymphatic route also provides an option for the {{delivery of}} therapeutic molecules, such as drugs to treat cancer and human immunodeficiency virus, which can travel through the lymphatic system. Lymphatic imaging is useful in evaluating disease states and treatment plans for progressive diseases of the lymph system. Novel lipid-based nanoformulations, such as solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers, have unique characteristics that make them promising candidates for lymphatic delivery. These formulations are superior to colloidal carrier systems because they have controlled release properties and provide better chemical stability for drug molecules. However, multiple factors regulate the lymphatic delivery of drugs. Prior to lymphatic uptake, lipid-based nanoformulations are required to undergo interstitial hindrance that modulates drug delivery. Therefore, uptake and distribution of lipid-based nanoformulations by the lymphatic system depends on factors such as particle size, surface charge, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity. Types of lipid and concentration of the emulsifier are also important factors affecting drug delivery via the lymphatic system. All of these factors can cause changes in intermolecular interactions between the lipid nanoparticle matrix and the incorporated drug, which in turn affects uptake of drug into the lymphatic system. Two lipid-based nanoformulations, ie, solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers, have been administered via multiple routes (subcutaneous, pulmonary, and intestinal) for targeting of the lymphatic system. This paper provides a detailed review of novel lipid-based nanoformulations and their lymphatic delivery via different routes, as well as the in vivo and in vitro models used to study drug transport in the lymphatic system. Physicochemical properties that influence lymphatic delivery as well as the advantages of lipid-based nanoformulations for lymphatic delivery are also discussed.

Our &#x 201 c;Thrifty Microbiome Hypothesis&#x 201 d; posits that gut microbiota {{play a key role}} in human energy homeostasis. Specifically, constituents of the gut microbial community may introduce a survival advantage to its host in times of nutrient scarcity, promoting positive energy balance by increasing efficiency of nutrient absorption and improving metabolic efficiency and energy storage. However, in the presence of excess nutrients, fat accretion and obesity may result, and in genetically predisposed individuals, increased fat mass may result in preferential abdominal obesity, ectopic fat deposition (liver, muscle), and metabolic complications of obesity (insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). Furthermore, in the presence of excess nutrients, a pathological transition of the gut microbial community may occur, causing leakage of bacterial products into the intestinal <b>lymphatics</b> and portal <b>circulation,</b> thereby inducing an inflammatory state, further aggravating metabolic syndrome traits and accelerating atherosclerosis. This pathological transition and the extent to which antimicrobial leakage occurs and causes inflammatory and other maladaptive sequelae of obesity may also be influenced by host factors, including genetics. In the proposed study, we will directly test the Thrifty Mirobiome Hypothesis by performing detailed genomic and functional assessment of gut microbial communities in intensively phenotyped and genotyped human subjects before and after intentional manipulation of the gut microbiome.
