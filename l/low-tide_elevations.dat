2500|$|Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal {{are both}} <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevations</b> that {{generate}} no maritime zones {{of their own}} [...] {{that none of the}} high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own within the meaning of those terms in Article 121(3) of the Convention. All of the high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are therefore legally rocks for purposes of Article 121(3) and do not generate entitlements to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. There is, accordingly, no possible entitlement by China to any maritime zone in the area of either Mischief Reef or Second Thomas Shoal and no jurisdictional obstacle to the tribunal’s consideration of the Philippines’ Submission No. 5.|$|E

40|$|Detailed field {{measurements}} are {{combined with a}} numerical modeling to characterize the groundwater dynamics beneath the discharge zone at Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. Groundwater salinity values revealed a saline circulation cell that overlaid the discharging freshwater and grew and disappeared with the lunar cycle. The cell was initiated by a greater bay water infiltration during the new moon when high tides overtopped the mean high-tide mark, flooding the flatter beach berm and inundating a larger area of the beach. The dynamics of this cell were further characterized by a tracer test and by constructing a density-dependent flow model constrained to salinity and head data. The numerical model captured the growing and diminishing behavior of the circulation cell and provided the estimates of freshwater and saline water fluxes and travel times. Furthermore, the model enabled quantification {{of the relationship between}} the characteristics of the observed tidal cycle (maximum, minimum, and mean tidal elevations) and the different components of the groundwater circulation (freshwater discharge, intertidal saline cycling, and deep saline cycling). We found that (1) recharge to the intertidal saline cell is largely controlled by the high-tide elevation; (2) freshwater discharge is positively correlated to the <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevation,</b> whereas deep saline discharge from below the discharging freshwater is negatively correlated to the <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevation.</b> So, when the <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevation</b> is relatively high, more freshwater discharges and less deep saltwater discharges. In contrast when low tides are very low, less freshwater discharges and more deep salt water discharges; (3) offshore inflow of saline water is largely insensitive to tides and the lunar cycle...|$|R

50|$|On 12 July 2016, the {{tribunal}} of the Permanent Court of Arbitration concluded that Hughes Reef is, or {{in its natural}} condition was, exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide and, accordingly, its <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevations</b> do not generate an entitlement to a territorial sea, exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.|$|E

5|$|South Ledge {{falls within}} the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit {{the extent of the}} territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevation,</b> belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.|$|R
50|$|Takat Unarang ("Unarang End Point/Outcrop") is {{the nearest}} to land {{territory}} {{at stake in}} the dispute, but at best, at <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevation</b> is more a rocky outcrop than a large island, but still meets the meaning of Article 121 of the LOSC. Takat Unarang is 10 nmi km from Indonesia’s low-water line or ‘normal’ baselines, and thus in line with Article 13 of the LOSC dealing with low-tide elevations.Takat Unarang is 12 nmi km from the nearest point on Malaysia’s loq-water line. However, Malaysia contends on occasion Takat Unarang {{is no more than a}} submerged rock and therefore not a valid basepoint for generating maritime claims to jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|On 12 July 2016, the {{tribunal}} of the Permanent Court of Arbitration concluded that {{for purposes of}} Article 121(3) of the Convention, the high-tide features at Gaven Reef (North) is rocks that cannot sustain human habitation or economic {{life of their own}} and accordingly shall be entitled to 12nm of territorial sea measured from its baseline but have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. PCA also concluded that Gaven Reef (South) is, or in their natural condition was, exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide and are, accordingly <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevations</b> that do not generate entitlement to a territorial sea, exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.|$|E

40|$|While {{some still}} debate {{whether or not}} climate change is a reality, one of its impacts, sea level rise, is factual. The cause {{and the rate of}} sea level rise might have been {{inconclusive}} but its impacts have been clearly felt. Sea level rise can also change the legal status of insular features (small islands/rocks and low tide elevation) that will also affect their capacity in making maritime claim. For an archipelagic State like Indonesia, small outer islands/rocks or <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevation</b> are important for location of basepoints forming the entire system of archipelagic baselines. This paper investigates the impact of sea level rise to the change of baselines and maritime limits a coastal state may claim. On the other hand, {{there is a need to}} have fixed maritime limits for better management and to balance rights and duties of coastal to the ocean. This paper provides options on how Indonesia as a coastal and archipelagic State can fix their baselines and or maritime limits in the face of coastal instability due to sea level rise as a consequence of climate change...|$|R
5000|$|The {{status of}} the waters around Nunez Rocks is disputed. Nunez Rocks is a <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevation</b> ("bare at half-tide") area (LTE) that is south of a line known as the [...] "A-B" [...] Line, which was defined in a 1903 {{arbitration}} decision on the Alaska-Canada boundary. The court specified the initial boundary point (Point [...] "A") at {{the northern end of}} Dixon Entrance and Point [...] "B" [...] to the east. Canada relies on the [...] "A-B" [...] Line as rendering nearly all of Dixon Entrance as Canadian internal waters. The U.S. does not recognize the [...] "A-B" [...] Line as an official boundary, instead regarding it as allocating sovereignty over the land masses within the Dixon Entrance, with Canada's land south of the line. The U.S. regards the waters as subject to international marine law, and in 1977 it defined an equidistant territorial sea throughout Dixon Entrance. This territory, which surrounds Nunez Rocks, extends south of the [...] "A-B" [...] line for the most part. The United States has not ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty, although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.|$|R
5000|$|Philippine Justice Antonio T. Carpio {{states that}} the case is solely a {{maritime}} dispute, and not territorial in nature.

40|$|Canada {{was one of}} {{the more}} active members of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Geneva, New York and Caracas during the 1970 s and early 1980 s. Slowly States {{ratified}} the Convention, and in November 1994, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force. Canada has some 10, 000 km of coastal perimeter and has much at stake since many of its resources, living and non-living, are located in or under the sea. However, much of this coast is rarely seen and its precise location and details of its features are poorly understood. In 1964, Canada passed the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act that provided for the use of straight baselines. In 1967, Order in Council, P. C. 1967 - 2025 defined the specific points for the straight baselines of Labrador and Newfoundland, also listed some <b>low-tide</b> <b>elevations</b> and discrete islands. The territorial sea baselines for southern Canada are now defined in Consolidated Regulations of Canada, 1978, chapter 1550, commonly abbreviated: CRC, 1978, c. 1550. The baselines, low water line segments and individual rocks and islets in Arctic Canada were explicitly defined in domestic law by an Order in Council issued in 1986. Except for th...|$|E
