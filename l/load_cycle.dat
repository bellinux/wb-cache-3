40|$|A {{computational}} {{numerical model}} for contact fatigue damage analysis of mechanical elements {{is presented in}} this paper. The computational approach is based on continuum mechanics, where a homogenous and elastic material model isassumed {{in the framework of}} the finite element method analysis.

5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} loading path universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single loading path able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at breaking load and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of permanent strain, a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as residual strain and is present both in monoaxial and biaxial tests. The main value of residual strain is shown {{between the first and second}} <b>load</b> <b>cycle,</b> decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique <b>load</b> <b>cycle,</b> assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the loading cycle considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the residual strain previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 load ratio which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E
50|$|Model-based prognostics {{attempts}} to incorporate physical understanding (physical models) {{of the system}} into the estimation of remaining useful life (RUL). Modeling physics can be accomplished at different levels, for example, micro and macro levels. At the micro level (also called material level), physical models are embodied by series of dynamic equations that define relationships, {{at a given time}} or <b>load</b> <b>cycle,</b> between damage (or degradation) of a system/component and environmental and operational conditions under which the system/component are operated. The micro-level models are often referred as damage propagation model. For example, Yu and Harris’s fatigue life model for ball bearings, which relates the fatigue life of a bearing to the induced stress, Paris and Erdogan's crack growth model, and stochastic defect-propagation model are other examples of micro-level models. Since measurements of critical damage properties (such as stress or strain of a mechanical component) are rarely available, sensed system parameters have to be used to infer the stress/strain values. Micro-level models need to account in the uncertainty management the assumptions and simplifications, which may pose significant limitations of that approach.|$|E
50|$|At least 25% of {{the input}} power must be {{dissipated}} by the cooler when peak power is utilized for long periods. In normal case however, the peak power {{is used for}} only short periods, thus the actual cooler capacity required might be considerably less. The oil volume in the hydraulic tank is also acting as a heat accumulator when peak power is used. The system efficiency is very much dependent {{on the type of}} hydraulic work tool equipment, the hydraulic pumps and motors used and power input to the hydraulics may vary a lot. Each circuit must be evaluated and the <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> estimated. New or modified systems must always be tested in practical work, covering all possible load cycles. An easy way of measuring the actual average power loss in the system is to equip the machine with a test cooler and measure the oil temperature at cooler inlet, oil temperature at cooler outlet and the oil flow through the cooler, when the machine is in normal operating mode. From these figures the test cooler power dissipation can be calculated and this is equal to the power loss when temperatures are stabilized. From this test the actual required cooler can be calculated to reach specified oil temperature in the oil tank. One problem can be to assemble the measuring equipment inline, especially the oil flow meter.|$|E
40|$|The skeleton's osteogenic {{response}} to mechanical loading {{can be affected}} by loading duration and rest insertion during a series of loading events. Prior animal loading {{studies have shown that}} the cortical bone response saturates quickly and short rest insertions between <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> can enhance cortical bone formation. However, it remains unknown how loading duration and short rest insertion affect load-induced osteogenesis in the mouse tibial compressive loading model, and particularly in cancellous bone. To address this issue, we applied cyclic loading (- 9 N peak load; 4 Hz) to the tibiae of three groups of 16 week-old female C 57 BL/ 6 mice for two weeks, with a different number of continuous <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> applied daily to each group (36, 216 and 1200). A fourth group was loaded under 216 daily <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> with a 10 s rest insertion after every fourth cycle. We found that as few as 36 <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> per day were able to induce osteogenic responses in both cancellous and cortical bone. Furthermore, while cortical bone area and thickness continued to increase through 1200 cycles, the incremental increase in the osteogenic response decreased as load number increased, indicating a reduced benefit of the increasing number of <b>load</b> <b>cycles.</b> In the proximal metaphyseal cancellous bone, trabecular thickness increased with load up to 216 cycles. We also found that insertion of a 10 s rest between <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> did not improve the osteogenic response of the cortical or cancellous tissues compared to continuous loading in this model given the age and sex of the mice and the loading parameters used here. These results suggest that relatively few <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> (e. g. 36) are sufficient to induce osteogenic responses in both cortical and cancellous bone in the mouse tibial loading model. Mechanistic studies using the mouse tibial loading model to examine bone formation and skeletal mechanobiology could be accomplished with relatively few <b>load</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Results of {{a series}} of back-analyses of the {{interaction}} between longwall shields and strata at a number of mines are presented. The purpose of these back-analyses was to quantify the impact of cover depth and panel width on shield performance. Recently developed shield <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> analysis theories were used to quantify the interaction between shields and strata. A <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> is the change in support pressure with time from the initial setting of the shield against the roof until the subsequent release and movement of the support, which typically corresponds to a single shear. Historical shield pressure data from five longwall mines in Australia and Europe were back-analysed, together with strata delay data for the longwall faces. An assessment of the geology of the near-seam overburden was also made for each site. The longwall panels incorporated cover depths ranging from 50 to 770 m and panel widths ranging between 168 to 319 m.

Scanning ion microscopy (SIM) images of membrane cross-sections indicate that the amount of Pt deposited in the membrane decreases during drive cycles involving load with short OCV holding times. Investigations of the Pt distribution in the cathode catalyst layer (CL) by using scanning TEM-EDX show that the dissolution of Pt is suppressed on the membrane side in the CL. The Pt dissolution is accelerated by the high Pt oxidation due to the long OCV holding time.

40|$|In the {{introduction}} to a recent symposium on rolling contact fatigue, R. A. Smith stated {{that it was difficult}} to apply our greatly increased understanding of metal fatigue, to rolling contact fatigue, because of "the apparent lack of alternating tensile stresses to drive the cracks. " He went on to say "alternating shear stresses are easily found, but the reproduction of continuous crack growth controlled by shear <Mode II in fracture mechanics terms), has proved to be near impossible. " This project has demonstrated that under specific conditions this mode of growth does occur. The project began by studying rolling contact fatigue defects, in particular the 'squat' defect in railway lines, and the stress analyses that have been performed on them. It was concluded that the largest stress cycle experienced by the cracks must be a shear stress. It. series of tests were then performed that loaded a crack in pure shear, or a mixture of tension and shear, looking at the effects of using fully reversed shear loading, and the effects of applying tensile mean stresses to reduce the friction on the crack flanks. However these tests all produced less than one millimetre of mode II growth, before the cracks arrested or branched. The final series of tests however applied a tensile <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> before each shear <b>load</b> <b>cycle.</b> This time coplanar growth was produced, that is the crack grew {{in the direction of the}} maximum shear stress. This type of <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> is a simplification of the <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> calculated by Bower and Johnson of Cambridge University, where the tensile load is produced by fluid trapped in the crack.
