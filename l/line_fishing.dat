5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef squids (particularly in jigging) are usually done {{at night and}} utilise bright lights, taking advantage of their attraction to illumination. They are especially abundant during the full moon and in foggy weather. Populations of bigfin reef squids are not seasonal, {{and they can be}} fished throughout the year. They are also used as fish bait in hook and <b>line</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E
5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and <b>line</b> <b>fishing</b> was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E

25|$|Inhabitants of Ahus Island, Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, have {{followed}} a generations-old practice of restricting fishing in six areas of their reef lagoon. Their cultural traditions allow <b>line</b> <b>fishing,</b> but no net or spear fishing.

25|$|The sand tiger {{is often}} {{associated}} with being vicious or deadly, due to its relatively large size and sharp, protruding teeth that point outward from its jaws; however, these sharks are quite docile, and are not a threat to humans. Their mouths are not large enough to cause a human fatality. Sand tigers roam the surf, sometimes in close proximity to humans, and there have been only a few instances of unprovoked sand tiger shark attacks on humans, usually associated with spear fishing, <b>line</b> <b>fishing,</b> or shark feeding. As of 2013, the database of Shark Attack Survivors does not list any fatalities due to sand tiger sharks. When the sharks become aggressive, they tend to steal fish or bait from fishing lines rather than attack humans. Owing to its large size and docile temperament, the sand tiger is commonly displayed in aquariums around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{fishing reels}} usually have {{fittings}} aiding in casting for distance and accuracy, {{as well as}} retrieving <b>line.</b> <b>Fishing</b> reels are traditionally used in the recreational sport of angling and competitive casting. [...] They are typically attached to a fishing rod, though some specialized reels are mounted directly to boat gunwales or transoms.|$|E
2500|$|Trout tend {{mostly to}} feed underwater. When fishing deeper waters such as rivers or lakes, putting a fly {{down to the}} trout may be more {{successful}} than fishing on the surface, especially {{in the absence of}} any surface insect activity or hatch. The nymph itself can be weighted, as is the popular bead headed hare's ear nymph or bead headed pheasant tail nymph. Alternatively, the angler can use an attractor pattern such as a prince nymph. Weights can be added to the leader. Probably the best weight to use is twist on lead or other metal strips because it has a much less detrimental effect on the casting ability. A sinking tip fly line can also serve to sink the fly. A common nymphing and general overall fly fishing technique that even beginners can master is a [...] "dead drift" [...] or tight <b>line</b> <b>fishing</b> technique, casting directly across the river, letting the fly line drift downriver while keeping any slack out of the line. If the Nymph is drifting too fast, then you should perform an upstream mend. If the nymph is drifting too slowly, you should mend downstream. A beginner need simply to point the rod at the fly, lifting the rod in the event of a strike. This is a [...] "downstream technique" [...] where the angler moves in a downstream direction. More advanced techniques make use of a highly visible strike indicator attached to the leader above the sinking fly.|$|E

50|$|The {{improved}} clinch knot is a knot that is {{used for}} securing a <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> to the <b>fishing</b> lure, but can also affix <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> to a swivel, clip, or artificial fly. This is a common knot used by anglers because of its simple tie and strong hold. When more pull is being applied, the harder the knot turns into itself, increasing {{the strength of the}} connection. It can be used with many kinds of line including mono-filament, fluorocarbon, and braided <b>fishing</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded <b>fishing</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Fish</b> hooks are swallowed or catch in {{the skin of the}} pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|R

50|$|Before the 1880s, long-lining was {{the usual}} method used to catch white fish such as cod, halibut, saithe, ling and flat fish which live {{at the bottom of}} the sea. It was very {{labour-intensive}} but resulted in a high quality catch. Small <b>line</b> <b>fishing</b> was a family affair with women and children responsible for preparing the equipment. This was a line, up to a mile in length, to which were attached snoods or shorter pieces of line which were baited with fish or shellfish. Great <b>line</b> <b>fishing</b> was similar to small <b>line</b> <b>fishing</b> but was undertaken in deeper waters, further out to sea. The lines could be up to 15 mi in length and would be fitted with 5,000 hooks. The fishermen usually baited the lines on the boat. Because of the work involved in preparing and hauling the lines, new methods of catching white fish were sought. Trawling was introduced into Scotland from England in the late 19th Century and, from the 1920s, seine-netting was introduced from Denmark.|$|E

50|$|Several boats {{worked from}} the harbour within living memory, the catch mainly being herring {{that was sent}} by train to Glasgow. <b>Line</b> <b>fishing</b> catches {{included}} whiting, cod, mackerel, haddock, and flounder.

50|$|A <b>fishing</b> <b>line</b> is a cord used or {{made for}} fishing. The {{earliest}} <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> {{were made from}} leaves or plant stalk (Parker 2002). Later lines were constructed from horse hair or silk thread, with catgut leaders. From the 1850s, modern industrial machinery was employed to fashion <b>fishing</b> <b>lines</b> in quantity. Most of these lines were made from linen or silk, and more rarely cotton.|$|R
