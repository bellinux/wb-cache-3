This thesis proposes a communication perspective for furthering the policy of Gross National Happiness (GNH) of Bhutan. The people’s happiness is treated {{on the model of}} participatory development communication based on Paulo Freire’s theory of dialogical communication and action. Besides, the PDC is augmented by Jurgen Habermas’s theory of communicative action (CA). While an assumption is also made that the level of socio-economic status of the people may have influence on relationship of communication and happiness. The research was conducted in a Bhutanese community of Khaling. 334 respondents participated in the survey research sampled by stratification method. The data analysis reveals that communication (PDC and CA) is significantly related to people’s happiness. Although the level of socio-economic status is significantly related to people’s happiness it is not related to communication variables.

No entanto, o evidente sucesso {{editorial}} do livro não permite concluir que ele tenha ganhado incontestável aprovação do público nem tampouco pode levar-nos a pensar que suas interpretações foram sempre consensuais. Prova disso reside nos dissensos do período pós-publicação os quais se estenderam e alargaram até a era vitoriana, no século XIX, a partir de quando a obra mais importante de Jonathan Swift adquiriu novas leituras, especialmente no mundo anglo-norte-americano, até que, por fim, ingressasse no panteão dos grandes textos da moderna literatura de língua inglesa.

The aims of this research were to investigate the uniqueness and value of the IT employees within the Sri Lankan IT sector, the Human Capital Capability (HCC) management practices adopted by the Sri Lankan IT organizations, whether HCC management practices {{vary according to the}} value and uniqueness of the IT employees, and finally the state of human capital reporting adopted by the IT organizations. The research was conducted using three survey questionnaires sent out via email (one for IT executives, one for Management and a separate questionnaire for the firm as a whole) and the data gathered is analysed with the focus on the importance of He Value and the He Uniqueness across four different employment arrangements (knowledge-based, employment, job-based employment, contract work, and alliance/partnership). The data collected reflects on five areas of a particular job: Job Design, recruitment and selection, Training and development, Performance appraisal, Compensation and Rewarding. Results from 92 executives, 8 managers and 8 firms are analysed out of which the conclusion derived was that the He Value- of IT executives differ across their employee arrangement while He Uniqueness does not show a significant difference across the Employee Arrangements or across the Job Categories. The level of measuring Human Capital across the selected IT firms in Sri Lanka is reasonably on the same level as those in other countries The results also <b>let</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> that when designing jobs for an organization specific and unique position, job security, job empowerment, cross functional teams and task definitions need to be clearly emphasised.

Most of the IT firms keep separate records by gender, training, absenteeism, staff turnover rate and productivity etc., merely not for Human Resource Accounting purpose but which can also be utilized for human resource recording purpose as well.

40|$|A new {{matrix system}} for {{phosphorescent}} organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) {{based on an}} electron transporting component attached to an inert polymer backbone, an electronically neutral co-host, and a phosphorescent dye that serves as both emitter and hole conductor are presented. The inert co-host is used either as small molecules or covalently connected to the same chain as the electron-transporting host. The use of a small molecular inert co-host in the active layer is shown to be highly advantageous in comparison to a purely polymeric matrix bearing the same functionalities. Analysis of the dye phosphorescence decay in pure polymer, small molecular co-host film, and their blend <b>lets</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> that dye molecules distribute mostly in the small molecular co-host phase, where the co-host prevents agglomeration and self-quenching of the phosphorescence as well as energy transfer to the electron transporting units. In addition, the co-host accumulates at the anode interface where it acts as electron blocking layer and improves hole injection. This favorable phase separation between polymeric and small molecular components results in devices with efficiencies of about 47 cd/A at a luminance of 1000 cd/m(2). Investigation of OLED degradation demonstrates the presence of two time regimes: one fast component {{that leads to a}} strong decrease at short times followed by a slower decrease at longer times. Unlike the long time degradation, the efficiency loss that occurs at short times is reversible and can be recovered by annealing of the device at 180 degrees C. We also show that the long-time degradation must be related to a change of the optical and electrical bulk properties...|$|R

Two PR isoforms that are functionally distinct {{in their ability to}} activate genes and regulate distinct physiological processes have been described in chicks: a full length form PR-B and the N-terminally truncated one PR-A which lacks the amino-terminal 128 amino acids of PR-B. PR isoforms have been detected in several tissues of both the adult and the embryo chick such as brain, ovary and oviduct. PR isoforms expression ratio varies among progesterone target tissues and under different hormonal and environmental conditions such as those presented during avian sexual maturity and the seasons of the year.

In this study, we used a D-galactosamine plus lipopolysaccharide (Gal/LPS) -induced acute liver failure mouse model, which caused death of about 50 % of the mice with necrosis of more than 50 % hepatocytes, to compare the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord MSCs (hUCMSCs) before and after induction of differentiation into hepatocyte (i-Heps). Induction of hUCMSCs to become i-Heps was achieved by treatment of the cells with a group of growth factors within 4 weeks.

40|$|Flavivirus {{encephalitis}} {{is believed}} to be the result of two main mechanisms: (i) direct damage to and dysfunction of neurons as a result of viral replication and (ii) destruction of the brain tissue by an inflammatory response. The differential impact of both mechanisms on the progression of flavivirus encephalitis has not been clearly determined. We have now studied the encephalitis caused by Modoc virus (MODV) infection in (i) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, (ii) immunocompetent NMRI mice, and (iii) NMRI mice under varying immunosuppressive treatment regimens. In SCID mice, Modoc virus infection proved to be uniformly lethal (100 %). The virus replicated extensively in neurons and no signs of inflammation of the brain were observed. In immunocompetent NMRI mice, intranasal (but not intraperitoneal) inoculation with MODV caused severe encephalitis accompanied by a fulminate inflammatory response. When NMRI mice, infected with MODV via the intraperitoneal route, were submitted to a brief immunosuppressive treatment, they also developed encephalitis with an obvious inflammatory component. These animals died significantly earlier than NMRI mice, which received immunosuppressive treatment for a longer period of time. In the latter group, no signs of inflammation of the brain were noted. These models thus allow us to distinguish between the impact of direct viral replication and that of immunological factors in the development of MODV encephalitis, and <b>let</b> us <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> that (i) replication of the virus in neurons is sufficient to cause fatal encephalitis and (ii) immunological factors contribute significantly to disease progression. status: publishe...|$|R

We consider this a serious shortcoming since we assume user modeling based on mind maps to be equally effective as user modeling based on other items. Hence, millions of mind-mapping users could benefit from user-modeling applications such as recommender systems. The objective of this doctoral thesis is to develop an effective user-modeling approach based on mind maps. To achieve this objective, we integrate a recommender system in our mind-mapping and reference-management software Docear. The recommender system builds user models based on the mind maps, and recommends research papers based on the user models. As part of our research, we identify several variables relating to mind-map-based user modeling, and evaluate the variables' impact on user-modeling effectiveness with an offline evaluation, a user study, and an online evaluation based on 430, 893 recommendations displayed to 4, 700 users. We find, among others, that the number of analyzed nodes, modification time, visibility of nodes, relations between nodes, and number of children and siblings of a node affect the effectiveness of user modeling. When all variables are combined in a favorable way, this novel approach achieves click-through rates of 7. 20 %, which is nearly twice as effective as the best baseline. In addition, we show that user modeling based on mind maps performs about as well as user modeling based on other items, namely the research articles users downloaded or cited.

40|$|Anatoxin-a is a neurotoxin {{produced}} by various species of cyanobacteria such Anabaena, Planktothrix (formerly Oscillatoria), Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermum, and Microcystis spp. This toxin {{acts as a}} mimic of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and irreversibly binds the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (NAChR) therefore affecting {{the functioning of the}} nervous system. Experimental studies have shown that in few minutes after drinking contaminated water, animals presented typical symptoms of anatoxin-a intoxication such as muscle fasciculation, gasping, violent convulsions, and death due to respiratory arrest. The estimated dosage needed to produce death in 50 % of exposed mice (LD 50) after interperitoneal administration was approximately 200 µg/kg. Anatoxin-a was first detected in Canada (1960 s) and since then has been responsible for a number of animal and human fatalities, {{in different parts of the}} world. The search for efficient and reliable analytical methods for the control of such cyanotoxins is becoming more and more urgent due to their recent appearance and worldwide distribution. The present work, summarizes the development of an automated method combining Solid phase microextraction (SPME) with Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the fast and sensitive determination of Anatoxin-a in water samples. This method is based on the direct derivatization of the analyte by adding isobutylchoroformate to the sample extract in alkaline conditions. The derivatized anatoxin-a was extracted by SPME procedure, submersing a PDMS fiber in an amber vial for 20 min under magnetic stirring. GC-MS is used to identify and quantify the analyte in the SIM mode (quantification ions underlined) : 191, 164 and 265. Parameters affected to the extraction such as: salt concentration, time of extraction, time of reaction and stirring speed, were initially evaluated.

The method employs the distance transform {{of the object}} and least-square fitting of numerically computed weighting functions extracted from it. The method is exemplified {{in the field of}} chemical engineering by calculating the global metal concentration in catalyst grains from uneven metal distribution profiles. Applying the methodology on synthetic profiles {{with the help of a}} very simple deposition model allows us to evaluate the accuracy of the method. For high symmetry objects such as an infinite cylinder, relative errors on global concentration are found lower than 1 % for well resolved profiles. For a less symmetrical object, a tetralobe, the best estimator gives a relative error below 5 % at the cost of increased measurement time. The applicability on a real-case is demonstrated on an aged hydrodemetallation catalyst. Sampling of catalyst grains at the inlet and the outlet of the reactor <b>let</b> us <b>conclude</b> <b>to</b> different reactivity for the trapped metals...|$|R

The results, when compared with previous researches and the theoretical approach allows <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> that even after inclusion of the growing Brazilian women in several sports - including pointing out that this did not occur in the form of confrontation, just as in other countries - this does not represent a rethinking of the social roles of the female and male <b>letting</b> <b>to</b> the athletes maintain a separation between sports life and life as a woman...|$|R
