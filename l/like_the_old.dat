5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Marvel {{announced}} that Daredevil would be filmed in New York City. In April 2014, Quesada reiterated this, {{stating that the}} show would be filming in areas of Brooklyn and Long Island City that still look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Hell’s Kitchen, in addition to sound stage work. Loeb said that Daredevil would begin filming in July 2014, and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month. It filmed under the working title Bluff, on a $56 million budget. The production received $14.3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program. Production concluded on December 21, 2014. Other filming locations in New York City included: the Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Bushwick neighborhoods in Brooklyn; Abe Lebewohl Park in the East Village; Whitestone Lanes bowling alley in Flushing, Queens; the New York State Supreme Court Building, with the interior for court scenes filmed on a set; Brooklyn Borough Hall; the Rockefeller Center rooftop gardens; Brooklyn College for Murdock and Nelson's flashback to their time in college; the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan; and the Honeywell Bridge in Long Island City.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E
25|$|The New Testament, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament, {{references}} Sodom as a {{place of}} God's anger against sin, but the Epistle of Jude provides a certain class of sin as causative of its destruction, the meaning of which is disputed.|$|E

25|$|In December 1934, the CLA {{merged with}} A. J. Muste's American Workers Party {{to form the}} Workers Party of the United States. A new newspaper, much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> one, was {{established}} with Jim Cannon at the editorial helm, given the less than original name New Militant. A new phase of the American Trotskyist movement was begun.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{when the}} {{regiment}} received the Mississippi designation a new 9th Louisiana Infantry (African Descent) was formed. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> 9th, it was renamed with the formalization of the USCT; {{it became the}} 63rd U.S. Colored Infantry Regiment on March 11, 1864. That unit, commanded by Colonel John Eaton, served in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, and was mustered out January 9, 1866.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing B-47 Stratojet gets a {{secondary}} role in Paramount's 1955 film Strategic Air Command, starring James Stewart, {{as the new}} jet that is nothing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Convair B-36 he is used to. The film features good aerial footage of both the B-47 and the B-36. The majority of B-47 scenes were filmed at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, using aircraft from the 306th Bombardment Wing.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the {{university}} opened the new Cardinal Court Apartment {{to replace a}} complex by the same name and on the same site built in 1959. Much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Cardinal Court, the new Cardinal Court provides apartment-style living combined with the benefits of university housing. Besides simply being more modern, the primary {{difference is that the}} old Cardinal Court had been reserved for married couples and graduate students.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} aspect {{when considering the}} origins is that the early Irish law texts are not always consistent. Early Irish law is, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Irish language, remarkably standard across an Island with no central authority. However, close examination has revealed some variations. Among these one can especially point to variations both in style and content {{between two of the}} major legal schools, as they are known; those that produced the Bretha Nemed and Senchas Már respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Ultimate Team, {{players are}} given {{contracts}}. Players who {{run out of}} contracts are rendered unplayable until a contract is applied to them, rather than being removed from the team altogether. Contracts {{can be found in}} packs or bought in the trading section. Unlike the old Ultimate Team, players can now store an unlimited number of players, stadiums, staff members, kits and emblems, to use whenever they need to. The Trading section has also been improved, allowing improved searching and a watch list, to keep track of certain items.|$|E

50|$|Older {{children}} in a composite class get more leadership opportunities and frequently build self-esteem as a sort or role model to the younger class mates. Younger children aspire to do work <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> {{children in}} <b>the</b> class.|$|R
50|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Targa Florio {{and later}} the Carrera Panamericana, the MM made Gran Turismo (Grand Touring) sports cars like Alfa Romeo, BMW, Ferrari, Maserati, Mercedes Benz and Porsche famous. The race brought out an {{estimated}} five million spectators.|$|R
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse {{calendar}}, the Anglo-Saxons {{had their}} own calendar before they were Christianized which reflected native traditions and deities. These months were attested by Bede in his works On Chronology and The Reckoning of Time written in the 8th century. His months are probably those as written in the Northumbrian dialect of Old English which he was familiar with. The months were so named after the moon; the new moon marking {{the end of an}} old month and start of a new month; the full moon occurring {{in the middle of the}} month, after which the month was named.|$|E
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Wäinämöinen, Jääkarhu had a heeling {{system with}} two pumps capable of {{transferring}} 650 tons of ballast water per hour between side tanks, heeling the vessel {{up to five}} degrees in ten minutes. In addition, she had six centrifugal pumps for moving 100 tons of water in five minutes between the fore and aft peak tanks to adjust her trim and release the icebreaker from compressive ice. For escort operations she had a towing winch and a stern notch that was considerably larger than in the older icebreakers. Her single piece cast iron rudder weighed 9 tons.|$|E
25|$|Charlie Cox {{stars as}} Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime at night. Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Rosario Dawson, and Vincent D'Onofrio also star, with Toby Leonard Moore, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Bob Gunton, and Ayelet Zurer joining {{them for the}} first season, and Jon Bernthal, Élodie Yung, and Stephen Rider joining the cast for season two. Daredevil entered {{development}} in late 2013, a year after the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filming takes place in New York City, in areas that still look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Hell's Kitchen.|$|E
