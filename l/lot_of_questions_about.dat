2500|$|In {{the season}} 6 premiere, it is {{discovered}} that the person whom Lucas called is Peyton. She goes {{to the airport and}} they hop on a plane to Vegas to get married. Once they get there, the chapel is too trashy, and so they do not get married. Instead, they drive to L.A. and Lucas proposes to her in the same hotel room he did years before. The two are still in L.A. during Brooke's attack. After Brooke calls Peyton and sounds weird, Lucas and Peyton decide to head back to Tree Hill and have the wedding there instead. Peyton sees that Brooke is beaten up, but Brooke lies and says she fell down the stairs, and Peyton believes her, not knowing that Brooke was attacked. Peyton meets a famous musician named Mick Wolf, who used to know Ellie. He is the one who asked Mia about Peyton during the tour. He keeps dodging around the subject of Peyton's real father, but says a little more about him each time Peyton brings him up. Peyton continues to get to know Mick and continues to ask about her real father. When she asks him why her parents gave her up and, he replies, [...] "We... I mean they, had a tough decision." [...] Mick accidentally lets the truth slip out, and suddenly Peyton realizes this is her father. She invites him over for a nice dinner together, he instead goes and gets drunk at a bar after being sober for a year (as shown by a sobriety chip in his pocket). She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book. Peyton closes herself off emotionally with regard to Mick and is angry with him for not being upfront with her about who he is. She tells him to leave. Not long afterward, during a visit to Brooke's, Brooke tells Peyton the truth about how she got all the bruises on her body. Peyton is later seen on the phone with Larry, her adoptive father. She tells him how much she loves him. Though initially concerned about moving in together, Lucas and Peyton eventually decide to accept their differences and reside in the same house. Peyton reconnects with her biological brother Derek, who has returned from the war. Later, she goes to TRIC to meet up with Lucas and a guy named Julian, who is interested in making a movie out based on Lucas's first novel. Julian was asking Lucas a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Peyton before she got there. She runs into Julian near the bathroom, and it is soon revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. Three weeks go by and Peyton still has not told Lucas the truth about her romantic history with Julian. Lucas is left to discover their past on his own, and is initially angry about it. Peyton throws a USO concert in which Angels and Airwaves, Mia, and Haley play. She continues to connect with her brother, Derek, and clash with Julian over Lucas and his film.|$|E

D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Doctoral program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Universita Autònoma de Barcelona. [...] This work {{has been carried out}} in the Proteomics Laboratory CSIC/UAB and in Oryzon Genomics. The flatfishes represent a group of species with a high biological and economical interest. Due to the decrease in fish hatchings, in the last years different several projects related to the aquaculture of these species were proposed. The project of this doctoral thesis has focused on the Senegal sole (Solea senegalensis), a flatfish specie with a great commercial interest and a candidate with high potential for aquaculture. However, <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> its reproduction haven't been so far … [+]properly addressed, and they should be approached in order to optimize the culture of the Senegal sole. The main problems detected for this specie in captivity are the low spermiation volume and the impaired quality of spermatozoa motility males. This thesis aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the spermatogenesis and sperm production of S. senegalensis through the analysis of the testis proteome of wild and cultured animals under several conditions, in order to unveil the candidate proteins related to these processes. Initially, the proteome of S. senegalensis has been approached by de novo peptide sequencing based on mass spectrometry. Afterwards, the testis proteome from wild and cultured individuals in several spermatogenic stages was compared using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Once this point was performed, a comparative study of testis proteome from individuals cultured with and without hormonal treatment was approached. Both proteomic studies were complemented with mRNA expression analysis using microarrays. Finally, the information related to protein expression obtained during the different parts of the project, the mRNA expression and the histological analysis were integrated in a bioinformatic visual atlas specifically designed for S. senegalensis.
