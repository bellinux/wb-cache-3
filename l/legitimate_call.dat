5000|$|The Emergency Banking Act (the {{official}} {{title of}} which was the Emergency Banking Relief Act), Public Law 1, 48 Stat. 1 (March 9, 1933), was an act passed by the United States Congress in March 1933 in an attempt to stabilize the banking system. Beginning on February 14, 1933, Michigan, an industrial state which had been hit particularly hard by the Great Depression in the United States, declared an eight-day bank holiday. Fears of other bank closures spread from state to state as people rushed to withdraw their deposits while they still could do so. Within weeks, thirty-six other states held their own bank holidays in an attempt to stem the bank runs. The banking system {{was on the verge of}} collapse. On March 4, Delaware became the 48th and last state to close its banks. Following his inauguration on March 4, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt set out to rebuild confidence in the nation's banking system. On March 6 he declared a four-day banking holiday that kept all banks shut until Congress could act. A draft law prepared by the Treasury staff during Herbert Hoover's administration, was passed on March 9, 1933. The new law allowed the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets so that banks that reopened would be able to meet every <b>legitimate</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

40|$|Most <b>legitimate</b> <b>calls</b> {{are from}} persons or {{organizations}} with strong social ties such as friends. Some <b>legitimate</b> <b>calls,</b> however, are from those with weak social ties {{such as a}} restaurant the callee booked a table on-line. Since a callee’s contact list usually contains only the addresses of persons or organizations with strong social ties, filtering out unsolicited calls using the contact list is prone to false positives. To reduce these false positives, we first analyzed call logs and identified that <b>legitimate</b> <b>calls</b> are initiated from persons or organizations with weak social ties through transactions over the web or email exchanges. This paper proposes two approaches to label incoming calls by using cross-media relations to prior contact. One approach is that a potential caller offers the callee his contact addresses which might be used in future calls. Another is that a callee provides a potential caller with weakly-secret information. In order {{to be identified as}} someone the callee contacted before through other means, the caller can convey the information in future calls. The latter approach enables a callee to label incoming calls even without caller identifiers. Reducing false positives during filtering using our proposed approaches will contribute to the reduction in SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony) ...|$|R

40|$|Code-reuse attacks {{continue}} to evolve and remain a severe threat to modern software. Recent research has proposed a variety of defenses with differing security, effciency, and practicality characteristics. Whereas {{the majority of these}} solutions focus on specific code-reuse attack variants such as return-oriented programming (ROP), other attack variants that reuse whole functions, such as the classic return-into-libc, have received much less attention. Mitigating function-level code reuse is highly challenging because one needs to distinguish a <b>legitimate</b> <b>call</b> to a function from an illegitimate one. In fact, the recent counterfeit object-oriented programming (COOP) attack demonstrated that the majority of code-reuse defenses can be bypassed by reusing dynamically bound functions, i. e., functions that are accessed through global offset tables and virtual function tables, respectively. In this paper, we first significantly improve and simplify the COOP attack. Based on a strong adversarial model, we then present the design and implementation of a comprehensive code-reuse defense which is resilient against reuse of dynamically-bound functions. In particular, we introduce two novel defense techniques: (i) a practical technique to randomize the layout of tables containing code pointers resilient to memory disclosure and (ii) booby trap insertion to mitigate the threat of brute-force attacks iterating over the randomized tables. Booby traps serve the dual purpose of preventing fault-analysis side channels and ensuring that each table has suffciently many possible permutations. Our detailed evaluation demonstrates that our approach is secure, effective, and practical. We prevent realistic, COOP-style attacks against the Chromium web browser and report an average overhead of 1. 1 % on the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks...|$|E

50|$|It is {{impossible}} {{to talk about the}} earliest Skete communities without touching briefly on the early days of monasticism itself. The earliest monks were simply men who fled civilization to lead an ascetic lifestyle alone in the desert. Early desert ascetics have been chronicled {{as far back as the}} writings of Eusebius In his book Church history or Ecclesiastical History, he writes of early desert fathers who left civilization behind to wander the desert, eventually drawing a following and settling down into monastic communities. The problem with these earliest writings is that no distinction is made between those who fled civilization for ascetic reasons, and those who fled to avoid persecution. Another problem is that early accounts of monastic life are greatly exaggerated leading some scholars to calculate that if these reports were taken at face value the monasteries were larger than the entire populations of the countries where they were founded. The only thing that is absolutely certain from these early writings is that some early religious figures did flee to the seclusion of the desert while others had a <b>legitimate</b> <b>calling.</b>|$|R

40|$|Phishing attacks target {{individuals}} or organizations to steal information (such as credentials) or plant malware to gain broader access to IT systems. This thesis applies research on vigilance, people’s {{ability to detect}} anomalies for a sustained period, to phishing risk. I (1) measure the human component of phishing susceptibility, (2) evaluate the validity of that measurement, and (3) demonstrate an approach for applying those measurements to risk analysis and evaluating behavioral interventions. I quantify human performance using signal detection theory (SDT) for a detection task (deciding whether a message is phishing) and a behavior task (deciding {{what to do about}} a message). As applied to phishing, SDT distinguishes between users’ ability {{to tell the difference between}} phishing and <b>legitimate</b> emails (<b>called</b> sensitivity, or d’) and bias toward identifying uncertain emails as phishing or <b>legitimate</b> (<b>called</b> response bias, or c). I find that users do not sufficiently compensate for their limited detection ability when choosing behaviors, despite incorporating confidence in their ability and their assessment of the consequences of errors into their decisions. I find similar results in an initial convenience (mTurk) sample and a community sample (enrolled in the Security Behavior Observatory (SBO) study). I find weak evidence for external validity of these tasks, given no relationship between performance in the experiment and negative computer security outcomes in real life (e. g. visits to malicious URLs or presence of malicious files). These results prompt discussion of the challenges of comparing behavior in laboratory and complex real-world settings. Lastly, I create an analytic model for evaluating anti-phishing behavioral interventions in the face of random and spear phishing attacks. Our results suggest the value of focusing on more susceptible users, particularly when defending against random attacks. This recommendation applies even when the ability to identify poor detectors is imperfect. Overall, this thesis bridges the vigilance and computer security literature to improve measurement of phishing susceptibility and show the value of assessing behavioral interventions in terms of signal detection theory...|$|R

First, a point-to-point setting is considered with a single wiretapper, {{a situation in which}} the secrecy capacity has an elegant characterization. Next, a generalized multiple access setting with confidential messages is considered in which each user wishes to communicate secret information to a common destination without the other determining its message.
