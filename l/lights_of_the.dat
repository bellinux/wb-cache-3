Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceiling meet.|$|E

In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
