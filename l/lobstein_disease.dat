40|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta is {{a genetically}} {{determined}} pathology that implies bone variability and osteoporosis with early onset of fractures after low energy trauma. For {{a better understanding}} of the clinical problems, Sillence and Danks created a classification. The study group consisted of 12 patients both males and females, with ages ranging from 2 years and 3 months to 12 years. All of them came to the hospital late, after walking, after several fractures occurred and the only treatment they underwent was with prolonged cast immobilization that caused rapid bone demineralization, axial deformations of the affected bones, increased number of fractures and eventually loss of ambulation. Following the discharged patients, we appreciated that the open bone alignment and Fassier Duval osteosynthesis were the best way to treat a patient with <b>Lobstein</b> <b>disease.</b> The results showed that by using these two techniques a lot of time is saved on a long term because all the great complications associated with older techniques are gone and a rapid ambulation is possible due to the soft tissue damage that is kept to a minimum...|$|E
