5|$|The {{greatest}} {{origin of}} costs for society is the <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> by {{health care professionals}} and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society.

40|$|Objectives: Because most {{research}} on <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospitals {{has focused on}} Medicare, {{the objective of this}} research is to describe the Georgia Medicaid population who received <b>care</b> at a <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital, the type and volume of services provided by these <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospitals, and the costs and outcomes of these services. For those with select respiratory conditions, we descriptively compare costs and outcomes to those of patients who received care for the same services in acute care hospitals. Methods: We describe Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to a <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital between 2011 and 2012. We compare them to a population of Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to an acute care hospital for one of five respiratory diagnosis-related groups. Measurements used include patient descriptive information, admissions, diagnosis-related groups, length of stay, place of discharge, 90 -day episode costs, readmissions, and patient risk scores. Results: We found that <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital admissions for Medicaid patients were fairly low (470 90 -day episodes) and restricted to complex cases. We also found that the majority of <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital patients were blind or disabled (71. 2 %). Compared to patients who stayed at an acute <b>care</b> hospital, <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital patients had higher average risk scores (13. 1 versus 9. 0), lengths of stay (61 versus 38 [*]days), costs (US$ 143, 898 versus US$ 115, 056), but fewer discharges to the community (28. 4 % versus 51. 8 %). Conclusion: We found that the Medicaid population seeking <b>care</b> at <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospitals is markedly different than the Medicare populations described in other <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital studies. In addition, our study revealed that Medicaid patients receiving select respiratory <b>care</b> at a <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital were distinct from Medicaid patients receiving similar care at an acute care hospital. Our findings suggest that state Medicaid programs should carefully consider reimbursement policies for <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospitals, including bundled payments that cover both the original hospitalization and <b>long-term</b> acute <b>care</b> hospital admission...|$|R

Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia).

40|$|The {{role of a}} {{psychologist}} in a <b>long-term</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit Dagmar Brejlová Abstract The thesis defines {{the role of a}} clinical psychologist in the <b>long-term</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit in MEDITERRA-Sedlčany, s. r. o. and reflects the present experience. In contrast to standard acute care, patients of this unit demand <b>long-term</b> intensive <b>care</b> stretching from a number of weeks to a number of years. The care focuses on physiotherapy, the treatment of associated diseases, practicing and developing new competencies and skills. The role of {{a psychologist}} in the <b>long-term</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit has not been defined yet. Thus, the theoretical part describes the structure and aim of the <b>long-term</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit, the possibilities and constraints of psychological cooperation with patients, their relatives and team members. The core of the thesis is a qualitative research based on ten case studies and a semi- structured questionnaire. The aim is to present the background of care and its critical appraisal, to describe its development and to suggest its future direction. Key words: <b>long-term</b> intensive <b>care,</b> psychological care, qualitative analysis, psychological burden, critical illness, quality of life...|$|R
40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{systematically}} examine, {{describe and}} explain how continence care was determined, delivered and communicated in Australian long aged care facilities. BACKGROUND: Incontinence {{is a highly}} stigmatising condition that affects a disproportionally {{large number of people}} living in <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facilities. Its day-to-day management is mainly undertaken by careworkers. We conducted a Grounded theory study to explore how continence care was determined, delivered and communicated in <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facilities. This paper presents one finding, i. e. how careworkers in <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facilities deal with the stigma, devaluation and the aesthetically unpleasant aspects of their work. DESIGN: Grounded theory. METHODS: Eighty-eight hours of field observations in two <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facilities in Australia. In addition, in-depth interviews with 18 nurses and careworkers who had experience of providing, supervising or assessment of continence <b>care</b> in any <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facility in Australia. RESULTS: Occupational exposure to incontinence contributes to the low occupational status of carework in <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facilities, and continence care is a symbolic marker for inequalities within the facility, the nursing profession and society at large. Careworkers 2 ̆ 7 affective and behavioural responses are characterised by: (1) accommodating the context; (2) dissociating oneself; (3) distancing oneself and (4) attempting to elevate one 2 ̆ 7 s role status. CONCLUSION: The theory extends current understandings about the links between incontinence, continence care, courtesy stigma, emotional labour and the low occupational status of carework in <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facilities. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study provides insights into the ways in which tacit beliefs and values about incontinence, cleanliness and contamination may affect the social organisation and delivery of <b>care</b> in <b>long-term</b> aged <b>care</b> facilities. Nurse leaders should challenge the stigma and devaluation of carework and careworkers, and reframe carework as 2 ̆ 7 dignity work 2 ̆ 7...|$|R

5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover <b>long-term</b> <b>care.</b> Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E

5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E
