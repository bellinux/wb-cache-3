It can be a big tree, reaching 50 - 60 m in height with a straight and regular trunk, particularly used for timber constructions, pulpwood for paper and furniture. This widespread species dominates the Boreal forests in Northern Europe and the subalpine areas of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. Thanks to its high performances in different site conditions, it can also be found outside its natural distribution on lower elevations in more temperate forests. Norway spruce has been massively planted up to its niche limits, where it is particularly susceptible to heat and drought, due to its shallow root system. For this reason it is expected to be severely affected under global warming conditions.

50|$|Dry rot is {{the term}} given to brown <b>rot</b> decay caused <b>by</b> certain fungi that {{deteriorate}} timber in buildings and other wooden construction without an apparent source of moisture. The term is a misnomer because all wood decaying fungi need a minimum amount of moisture before decay begins. The decayed wood takes on a dark or browner crumbly appearance, with cubical like cracking or checking, that becomes brittle and can eventually crush the wood into powder. Chemically, wood <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> dry <b>rot</b> fungi is decayed by the same process as other brown rot fungi.

The effects of air pollution on the amounts of leaf nitrogen, total soluble phenols and total tannins of Tibouchina pulchra Cogn., a common species in the area of Cubatão, were investigated, as well as the possible influence of the altered parameters on the leaf area damaged by herbivores. Fully expanded leaves were collected at two sites: the valley of Pilões river (VP), characterized by a vegetation virtually not affected by air pollution and taken as a reference; and valley of Mogi river (VM), close to the core region of the industrial complex, and severely affected by air pollution. No differences were observed for any parameters between samples collected in the summer and winter in both sites. On the other hand, compared to VP, individuals growing in VM presented higher amounts of nitrogen and lower amounts of total soluble phenols and total tannins, as well as higher percentages of galls per leaf and higher leaf area lost to herbivores. Regression analysis revealed that the increase in leaf area lost to herbivores {{can be explained by the}} increase of the content of nitrogen and decrease in the contents of total soluble phenols and total tannins.

Syndesus cornutus (F.) is a relatively common and widespread beetle in eastern Australia, occurring in rotten wood from Tasmania to North Queensland. On 3 January, 1978, {{a large number of}} adults and larvae were found causing extensive dama e to a 14 cm x 30 cm piece of painted timber sup ortin a bridge behind the Entomology Building, CSIRO, hack Mountain, Canberra (Fig. 1).

Eleven species were isolated from the material; soft rot tests of these fungi indicated that all of the isolates were capable of causing Type 2 soft rot attack (cell-wall erosion). These fungi caused little or no weight loss on redwood specimens, but did damage less durable ponderosa pine sapwood. The results suggest that the redwood cooling tower was colonized by a variety of fungi; however, the combination of redwood extractives and a shallow chromium barrier appears to protect against soft rot attack...|$|R

40|$|To study {{functional}} {{relationships between}} the effects of solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) on {{different aspects of the}} physiology of a wild plant, we carried out exclusion experiments in the field with the summer annual Datura ferox L. Solar UV-B incident over Buenos Aires reduced daytime seedling emergence, inhibited stem elongation and leaf expansion, and tended to reduce biomass accumulation during early growth. However, UV-B had no effect on calculated net assimilation rate. Using a monoclonal antibody specific to the cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimer (CPD), we found that plants receiving full sunlight had more CPDs per unit of DNA than plants shielded from solar UV-B, but the positive correlation between UV-B and CPD burden tended to level off at high (near solar) UV-B levels. At our field site, Datura plants were consumed by leaf beetles (Coleoptera), and the proportion of plants <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> insects declined with the amount of UV-B received during growth. Field experiments showed that plant exposure to solar UV-B reduced the likelihood of <b>leaf</b> beetle <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> one-half. Our results highlight the complexities associated with scaling plant responses to solar UV-B, because they show: (a) a lack of correspondence between UV-B effects on net assimilation rate and whole-plant growth rate, (b) nonlinear UV-B dose-response curves, and (c) UV-B effects of plant attractiveness to natural herbivores...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{testing of}} windows Experience from window {{replacement}} The windows {{in one of}} SP's buildings were replaced {{at the end of}} 1994 /beginning of 1995. When the proposal to replace the windows was first raised, it was suggested that it could provide an opportunity for long term testing of P-marked and type-approved windows. The facade faces south east, and is very exposed to weather and wind. The objective of the project was to examine the condition of the old windows and to investigate the durability of the new ones. As far as the new windows were concerned, there was particular interest in investigating different designs, materials and combinations of materials in frames and casements. The old windows had wooden frames and casements, and were in very poor condition as a result of neglected maintenance. The moisture ratio in the bottom members of the casements was particularly high, and many of the casements were badly <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> <b>rot.</b> On the other hand, only a few windows were suffering from rot in the bottom members of the frames. The new windows have been supplied by ten different manufacturers, and together comprise 13 different designs. All are of triple glazed type. The frame and casement materials are wood, wood with an external aluminium cladding, plastic and aluminium. The windows have now been inspected three times: in 1997, 1999 and 2000. The results indicate that the condition of the surface treatment seems to be very important for the moisture ratio in the windows, as is also the design. In particular, fittings such as storm hooks should be avoided, as they have a considerable effect on the durability of the windows. The wooden windows showed high moisture ratios at their last inspection. The external finish on them has deteriorated with time, so that there are now cracks and flaking of the paint that explains the high moisture ratio. Those with aluminium cladding, on the other hand, were dryer, which shows that the cladding has been correctly fitted. Plastic and aluminium windows showed no visible signs of colour or shape change at the last inspection. This experience of long term testing will result in changes to the P-marking rules for windows. It will also be fed back to the manufacturers in order to enable them to improve the performance and durability of their products...|$|R

In this study, BLSD severity and agronomic fruit characteristics of plantain were compared under high and low timber stand densities (TSD), and also under different crop management systems (mulching, burning, intercropping). By 11 months after planting, in high TSDs, plants had 1. 2 more standing leaves, 1. 5 more symptom-free leaves and a lower percentage of total <b>leaf</b> area <b>attacked</b> than in low TSDs. At harvest, plants in high TSDs had, on average, 1. 4 more standing leaves than those in low TSDs.

There was a significant and positive relationship between the number of leaves at flowering and dry fruit bunch mass for plantains grown under low TSD. However, there was no correlation between the number of leaves and fruit mass for the high TSD. The beneficial effects of shade in the high TSD, such as reduced severity of BLSD, were established. However, as there was bunch mass loss associated with reduced leaf production rates under the high TSD, a reduction in BLSD only partially compensated for this yield loss. Thus overall, at the high TSD, there was no yield gain from reduced BLSD. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of cotton}} cellulose depolymerization <b>by</b> the brown <b>rot</b> fungus Postia placenta {{and the white}} rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium were investigated with solid-state cultures. The degree of polymerization (DP; {{the average number of}} glucosyl residues per cellulose molecule) of cellulose removed from soil-block cultures during degradation by P. placenta was first determined viscosimetrically. Changes in molecular size distribution of cellulose <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> either fungus were then determined by size exclusion chromatography as the tricarbanilate derivative. The first study with P. placenta revealed two phases of depolymerization: a rapid decrease to a DP of approximately 800 and then a slower decrease to a DP of approximately 250. Almost all depolymerization occurred before weight loss. Determination of the molecular size distribution of cellulose during <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> the brown <b>rot</b> fungus revealed single major peaks centered over progressively lower DPs. Cellulose <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> P. chrysosporium was continuously consumed and showed a different pattern of change in molecular size distribution than cellulose <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> P. placenta. At first, a broad peak which shifted at a slightly lower average DP appeared, but as attack progressed the peak narrowed and the average DP increased slightly. From these results, it is apparent that the mechanism of cellulose degradation differs fundamentally between brown and white rot fungi, as represented by the species studied here. We conclude that the brown rot fungus cleaved completely through the amorphous regions of the cellulose microfibrils, whereas the white rot fungus attacked the surfaces of the microfibrils, resulting in a progressive erosion...|$|R

Susceptibility of fruit to disease was investigated at three fruit developmental stages (cherelle, young pod and adult pod); disease severity was assessed in laboratory conditions, on detached, artificially inoculated fruits, while disease incidence was assessed in the field, under natural inoculum pressure. In both assessment fruits at the cherelle stage were the most susceptible whereas the young and adult fruits were equally susceptible. The vertical position of the fruits on the tree did not influence their susceptibility. Estimates of the fruit susceptibility and of the infectious potential were derived from the severity and incidence measurements, using a model assuming that the number of spores on a fruit follows a Poisson distribution with the mean, the density of spores per fruit as the parameter. The estimated parameter values allowed the evaluation of the probability of attack of a fruit by the disease, which could be implemented in a disease warning system...|$|R

40|$|Basidiomycetes {{that cause}} brown rot of wood are {{essential}} biomass recyclers in coniferous forest ecosystems {{and a major}} cause of failure in wooden structures. Recent work indicates that distinct lineages of brown rot fungi have arisen independently from ligninolytic white rot ancestors via loss of lignocellulolytic enzymes. Brown rot thus proceeds without significant lignin removal, apparently beginning instead with oxidative attack on wood polymers by Fenton reagent produced when fungal hydroquinones or catechols reduce Fe 3 � in colonized wood. Since {{there is little evidence that}} white rot fungi produce these metabolites, one question is the extent to which independent lineages of brown rot fungi may have evolved different Fe 3 � reductants. Recently, the catechol variegatic acid was proposed to drive Fenton chemistry in Serpula lacrymans, a brown rot member of the Boletales (D. C. Eastwood et al., Science 333 : 762 - 765, 2011). We found no variegatic acid in wood undergoing decay by S. lacrymans. We found also that variegatic acid failed to reduce in vitro the Fe 3 � oxalate chelates that predominate in brown-rotting wood and that it did not drive Fenton chemistry in vitro under physiological conditions.

Similarly, the exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) induced GUS uniformly across leaf tissue, and mechanical wounding activated GUS expression at wound sites, similar to PTM larvae. GFP expression was observed 48 h after treatment, and for mechanical wounding GFP was localised {{in a manner similar}} to PTM damage. For MeJa treatment, GFP expression was more pronounced in cells around the midrib, and it was not uniformly induced across the leaf tissue. GUS reporter gene levels were also assayed to quantify expression, and the results were consistent with the observed histological patterns of expression. The results presented here show that the Shpx 6 b promoter switches on the expression of linked genes after damage by insect herbivores, and could be useful in regulating the expression of heterologous genes for insect and/or pathogen resistance in transgenic plants...|$|R
40|$|The cereal crops of Iowa and {{the upper}} Mississippi valley are {{annually}} <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> five different rusts which are frequently considered identical by many grain growers. Altho superficially they resemble one another closely, their differences are marked, {{not only to the}} eye but also as to their economic importance. One of these rusts occurs chiefly on the stem of oats, wheat, rye and barley and is known as black stem rust, while the other four are <b>leaf</b> rusts, occasionally <b>attacking</b> the stems...|$|R
