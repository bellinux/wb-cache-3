5|$|In contrast, {{the female}} purple-throated cotinga {{is a dark}} brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts. The underparts are a buffy {{cinnamon}} with black barring. The throat is a deeper, unbarred rufous in coloration. The female's tail feathers are <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> pointed at the tip {{than those of the}} male. The juvenile purple-throated cotinga resembles a paler, buffier female; the plumage of the immature is undescribed.|$|E

5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|SIT {{will feature}} the Integrated Work-Study Programme or IWSP, which are <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> {{structured}} internship with a stronger assimilation between classroom learning and practical experience at work. Such features will enable SIT graduates to seize new and diverse job opportunities. Held over {{the span of}} 8 to 12 months, {{the structure of the}} IWSP will be unique and distinct for each degree programme to cater to differing needs of the industry.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, {{was much}} <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> serious {{for both the}} Romans and Samnites. The {{fortunes}} of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course. But the Romans won the Battle of Bovianum, and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC, the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.|$|E

5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, {{and points to the}} influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 {{in the middle of the}} piece.|$|E
5|$|Tubenoses have smaller egg {{clutches}} {{and much}} <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling swifts in these developmental factors. Tubenoses and swifts have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable {{in the nest}} but food is usually plentiful. In the particular case of the storm petrel, it has a body temperature perhaps 3°C lower than other small birds, and this may {{also contribute to the}} lengthy incubation.|$|E

5|$|As traders sailed farther east, the voyages became <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> expensivea Smaller {{enterprises}} were {{merged into}} larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began {{to stand out}} {{as one of the}} most important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed {{for long periods of}} time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit Fruit Society was a communitarian {{group in}} the United States that was {{organized}} {{after a period of}} repeated business depressions during the 1890s. The society had its beginnings in Lisbon, Ohio and, over the years of its existence moved to Ingleside, Illinois and, finally, to California. Plagued by rumor, suspicion, and attacks in the press during its early years, the group remained active until 1930. Although it never numbered {{more than a handful of}} adherents, the Spirit Fruit Society existed <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> successfully than any other American utopian group.|$|E

5|$|The film's second script {{involved}} Pteranodon {{escaping from}} Isla Sorna and causing {{a spate of}} mysterious killings on the mainland, {{which was to be}} investigated by Alan Grant {{and a number of other}} characters including Billy Brennan, a naturalist named Simone, a tough military attaché, wealthy Paul Roby, and Roby's teenage son Miles. Grant's group crash-lands on the island, while a parallel investigation is being carried out on the mainland. The aviary sequence and laboratory set piece were initially much <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> complex, including Velociraptor stealthily entering the hatchery as the team spends the night there. Sets, costumes, and props were built for this version.|$|E
5|$|The musical {{style of}} The Book of Taliesyn {{is a mix}} of {{progressive}} rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers think that in this album the band is more mature and in greater control of its own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{paleontologist}} Barnum Brown {{recovered a}} duckbill skull in 1915 for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 5836) from the Red Deer River of Alberta, near Steveville. He described the specimen in 1916 {{as a new}} genus, Prosaurolophus. Brown's choice of name comes from a comparison to the genus Saurolophus, which he had described in 1912. Saurolophus had a similar but <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> spike-like head crest. The skull had a damaged muzzle and was inadvertently reconstructed too long, but better remains were soon found that showed the true shape; one is a nearly complete skeleton and skull, described by William Parks in 1924. Twenty to twenty-five individuals are known for this species, including seven skulls with {{at least some of}} the rest of the skeleton.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{increased}} running time, budget and facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, who handled the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, <b>longer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
