5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the <b>launching</b> <b>and</b> landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{returned}} to the dockyard in November to have the aft turret removed and replaced by another deck for landing, giving her both a <b>launching</b> <b>and</b> a recovery deck. Two lifts (elevators) serving the hangars were also installed. Furious was recommissioned on 15 March 1918, and her embarked aircraft were used on anti-Zeppelin patrols in the North Sea after May. In July 1918, she flew off seven Sopwith Camels which participated in the Tondern raid, attacking the Zeppelin sheds there with moderate success.|$|E
5|$|This CATOBAR {{arrangement}} {{allows for}} faster <b>launching</b> <b>and</b> recovery {{as well as}} a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or arrestor wires. The ship's aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, popular science fiction often {{depicted}} space vehicles as either single-stage reusable rocket ships which could <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> land vertically (SSTO VTOL), or single-stage reusable rocket planes which could <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> land horizontally (SSTO HTOL).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> recovery system, {{which looks like}} a submersible platform, for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Without the help of the special support ship, this system {{can be applied to the}} <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> recovery of an AW that operates in sea state 4. The system is composed of a crane, a control panel, a cable winch, a tether management system (TMS) <b>and</b> a <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> recovery unit (LRU), and the LRU is the key component of the system, The difficulty underlying the <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> recovery of an AW is on the recovering, and the difficulty underlying the recovery is on the butt of an AUV and the LRU. To ensure a successful butt, the LRU must keep a stable attitude. In order to overcome the effects of rolling, pitching and heaving of the support ship and the effects of the wind wave of the sea the system employs the TMS and the butt is carried out under the depth of 30 similar to 50 meters (more than 1 / 2 wave length). The successful application of this <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> recovery system enables the AUV to operate in more rough sea state for a long time, therefore provides a unique means to the <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> recovery of an AUV.

5|$|Condor {{was ordered}} as a {{replacement}} for the gunboat , which had been sunk by the hurricane that hit Apia in 1889. She was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1891. An outbreak of Cholera in Hamburg made work on the ship difficult, but the completed hull was nevertheless ready for launching as scheduled, on 23 February 1892. Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Wilhelm Schröder, the Chief of the Baltic Station, gave the speech at her <b>launching,</b> <b>and</b> she was christened by Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) von Bodenhausen, the director of the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven. The ship accidentally launched itself due to the tide coming earlier than expected. She was completed on 9 December of that year, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy; precautions against cholera delayed the beginning of sea trials until 15 December.|$|E
5|$|Posen {{was ordered}} under the {{provisional}} name Ersatz Baden, {{as a replacement}} for the , one of the elderly s. She was laid down on 11 June 1907 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel. As with her sister , construction proceeded under absolute secrecy; detachments of soldiers guarded the shipyard and also guarded contractors that supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched {{a year and a half}} later, on 12 December 1908. Wilhelm August Hans von Waldow-Reitzenstein gave a speech at her <b>launching,</b> <b>and</b> Posen was christened by Johanna von Radolin, the wife of Hugo Fürst von Radolin, a German diplomat who hailed from the ship's namesake province. Initial trials were conducted through April 1910, followed by final fitting-out in May. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 31 May. Sea trials were conducted afterward and completed by 27 August. In total, her construction cost the German government 36,920,000marks.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{white paper}} {{outlined}} the replacement submarine as a 4,000-ton vessel fitted with land-attack cruise missiles {{in addition to}} torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, capable of <b>launching</b> <b>and</b> recovering covert operatives while submerged, and carrying surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment. The project initially had four options: a Military-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) design without modification, a MOTS design modified for Australian conditions, an evolution of an existing submarine, or a newly designed submarine. Nuclear propulsion was ruled out {{because of the lack}} of nuclear infrastructure and public opposition to nuclear technology. Designs initially considered for purchase or modification included the Spanish S-80 class, the French-designed Scorpène class, the German-designed Type 214, and Japan's Sōryū class, along with an evolution of the Collins.|$|E

5|$|The keel {{for the new}} cruiser {{was laid}} down on 28 March 1892 at the Schichau-Werke {{shipyard}} in Danzig, and the completed hull was launched on 31 March 1893. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended her <b>launching,</b> <b>and</b> the speech was given by {{the director of the}} Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig, Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Graf Kurt von Haugwitz. Sea trials began on 27 June 1894 at Kiel and lasted until 2 October. Serious defects in her design, in particular poor ventilation, were revealed through the trials, which necessitated modifications at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel. She was accordingly placed in reserve after completing her trials. The work lasted until mid-1895, and the ship was ready for commissioning on 5 June 1895. That month, she was present for the celebration marking the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} poor results of XXIBomber Command's {{precision}} bombing campaign. The {{most important of}} these was the weather; the American raiders frequently encountered cloudy conditions and high winds over Japan which made accurate bombing extremely difficult. Moreover, the bomber forces often had to pass through severe weather fronts between the Mariana Islands and Japan, which broke up formations and caused navigation problems. XXIBomber Command's effectiveness was also limited by poor B-29 maintenance practices and over-crowding at its airfields – these factors reduced the number of aircraft which were available for operations and complicated the process of <b>launching</b> <b>and</b> recovering the bombers. By March 1945 the USAAF's commanders were highly concerned about the failure of the campaigns mounted from China and the Mariana Islands, and believed that the results to date made it difficult to justify the high costs of the B-29 program and also threatened their goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of independent air power.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for <b>launching</b> <b>and</b> outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E

5|$|Tensions between Japan and China {{heightened}} {{after the}} former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation {{of the murder}} of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines. China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain. The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon <b>launching</b> <b>and</b> the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan. The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥3.9–4.2 million to purchase three warships from abroad. No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain. This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥2.3 million was approved later that month. Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard. No response was made by the Prime Minister's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships, one armored frigate and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed, formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost. The Prime Minister's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul, Ueno Kagenori, that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed.|$|E
