5|$|Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Firebrand {{features}} an even younger Troilus, just twelve when he becomes Hector's charioteer. (His brother {{wants to keep}} a protective eye on him now he is ready for war.) Troilus helps kill Patroclus. Although he manages to escape {{the immediate aftermath of}} Hector's death, he is wounded. After the Trojans witness Achilles' treatment of Hector's body, Troilus insists on rejoining the battle despite his wounds and Hecuba's attempts to stop him. Achilles kills him with an arrow. The mourning Hecuba comments {{that he did not want}} to <b>live</b> <b>because</b> he blamed himself for Hector's death.|$|E
25|$|No {{radio or}} {{television}} stations broadcast the assassination <b>live</b> <b>because</b> the area {{through which the}} motorcade was traveling was not considered important enough for a live broadcast. Most media crews were not even with the motorcade but were waiting instead at the Dallas Trade Mart in anticipation of President Kennedy's arrival. Those {{members of the media}} who were with the motorcade were riding {{at the rear of the}} procession.|$|E
25|$|Concentrated in San Miguel de Allende {{are foreign}} {{residents}} {{mostly from the}} United States and Canada {{who have come to}} <b>live</b> <b>because</b> of the area's mild climate, cultural opportunities and low crime. While only about ten percent of San Miguel's total population, they have had a large impact on the area economically, accounting for most home buyers. Estimates of foreign residents range from 8,000 to 12,000 with about 7,000 of these from the United States alone. This makes San Miguel one of the largest American communities in Mexico, large enough to warrant its own U.S. consulate to provide services such as notary and passport.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, however, homeowner's discriminatory {{covenant}} {{practices were}} killed in state courts. The increasingly large black population in Chicago (40,000 in 1910, and 278,000 in 1940) faced {{some of the same}} discrimination in Chicago as they had in the South. It was hard for many blacks to find jobs and find decent places to <b>live</b> <b>because</b> of the competition for housing among different groups of people {{at a time when the}} city was expanding in population so dramatically. At the same time that blacks moved from the South in the Great Migration, Chicago was still receiving thousands of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The groups competed with each other for working-class wages.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} the {{citizens}} of New York will pay so large {{a part of the}} tax is New York City is the chief financial and commercial centre of a great country with vast resources and industrial activity. For many years Americans engaged in developing the wealth of all parts of the country have been going to New York to secure capital and market their securities and to buy their supplies. Thousands of men who have amassed fortunes in all sorts of enterprises in other states have gone to New York to <b>live</b> <b>because</b> they like the life of the city or because their distant enterprises require representation at the financial centre. The incomes of New York are in a great measure derived from the country at large. A continual stream of wealth sets toward the great city from the mines and manufactories and railroads outside of New York.|$|E
25|$|Despite some successes by Abwehr elements, Henlein {{was greatly}} {{impressed}} with Hitler's {{victory in the}} Austrian Anschluss and decided {{to side with the}} radicals backed by Heydrich. Once the Germans occupied the Sudentenland, Heydrich turned on Henlein, undermining his power and murdering or imprisoning many of his friends and allies. Terrified, Henlein's wife begged Groscurth to protect them from the SS, which Groscurth and the Abwehr tried to do, with limited success. Although Henlein wasn't killed outright, he was removed from the proximity of power, only being allowed to <b>live</b> <b>because</b> of the personal relationship he had built with Hitler. After his assignment in the Sudentenland, Gorscurth successfully advocated on behalf of his subordinate Theodor von Hippel's proposal to form the Brandenburgers within Abwehr II. Groscurth was replaced by Erwin von Lahousen and promoted to be the chief of Abteilung Heerwesen zbV, a newly created liaison unit between the Abwehr and the OKH. This new position proved to be key in his coordination of anti-Nazi activities between military intelligence, the regular army, and the German diplomatic corps.|$|E

25|$|In 1128 Aleppo became {{capital of}} the {{expanding}} Zengid dynasty, which ultimately conquered Damascus in 1154. In 1183 Aleppo came {{under the control of}} Saladin and then the Ayyubid Dynasty. When the Ayyubids were toppled in Egypt by the Mamluks, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo An-Nasir Yusuf became sultan of the remaining part of the Ayyubid Empire. He ruled Syria from his seat in Aleppo until, on 24 January 1260, the city was taken by the Mongols under Hulagu in alliance with their vassals the Frank knights of the ruler of Antioch Bohemond VI and his father-in-law the Armenian ruler Hetoum I. The city was poorly defended by Turanshah, and as a result the walls fell after six days of bombardment, and the citadel fell four weeks later. The Muslim population was massacred and many Jews were also killed. The Christian population was spared. Turanshah was shown unusual respect by the Mongols, and was allowed to <b>live</b> <b>because</b> of his age and bravery. The city was then given to the former Emir of Homs, al-Ashraf, and a Mongol garrison was established in the city. Some of the spoils were also given to Hethoum I for his assistance in the attack. The Mongol Army then continued on to Damascus, which surrendered, and the Mongols entered the city on 1 March 1260.|$|E

500|$|The band {{started in}} Bellflower, California in 2007. During its early days, {{the band played}} several live shows in the California area, {{as well as in}} Tecate, Mexico. Their eponymous first album The Boxmasters was {{released}} on June 10, 2008 by Vanguard Records. It received a mostly poor review from Allmusic, which stated that [...] "The Boxmasters might work <b>live</b> <b>because</b> there will be visuals; but merely as a listening exercise, it's best taken in small doses so the novelty doesn't wear off." [...] The review also alleged that [...] "Thornton can't drum to save his life, and he can't sing". The Washington Post praised the album, and the paper remarked that listeners will get their money's worth if they enjoy the music even half as much as the band did during the recordings.|$|E

2500|$|... {{advances}} in the testing system for contaminated clams have allowed geoduck harvesters to deliver live clams more consistently. The new testing system determines the viability of clams from tested beds before the harvesters fish the area. Previous methods tested clams after harvest. This advancement has meant that 90 percent of clams were delivered live to market in 2007. In 2001, only 10 percent were <b>live.</b> <b>Because</b> geoduck have a much higher market value live—an additional $2 to $3 per pound—this development has helped to stimulate the burgeoning industry.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Epic and Novel", Bakhtin {{demonstrates}} the novel’s distinct nature by contrasting {{it with the}} epic. By doing so, Bakhtin shows that the novel is well-suited to the post-industrial civilization in which we <b>live</b> <b>because</b> it flourishes on diversity. It is this same diversity that the epic attempts to eliminate from the world. According to Bakhtin, the novel as a genre is unique {{in that it is}} able to embrace, ingest, and devour other genres while still maintaining its status as a novel. Other genres, however, cannot emulate the novel without damaging their own distinct identity.|$|E

Its first single, [...] "Haven't Met You Yet" [...] was released 31 August 2009, and reached No.1 on Billboards Canadian Adult Contemporary chart. Most {{of the tracks}} off the album were recorded <b>live</b> <b>because</b> Bublé did not want his album to sound overproduced and slick. Bublé wrote the opening part for his cover on the single [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] in Bond-like theme because he wanted the song to sound very cinematic and bombastic.|$|E

Moore and Gordon's daughter, Coco Hayley Moore, was born later in the year, {{and many of the}} songs from the album were never played <b>live</b> <b>because</b> there was never a full tour to support the album due to Gordon's pregnancy.

When they recorded [...] "Kaiowas", the quartet never even considered playing the track <b>live,</b> <b>because</b> they thought it would be too difficult to recreate the drumming on stage. They changed their minds after seeing a video of the American band Neurosis: [...] "We saw in that live video that the Neurosis guys put down their guitars and everybody started to play the drums on stage", lead guitarist Andreas remembers.
