5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to Romania, {{and that he had}} these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> along {{with the fact that he}} was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E

5|$|In the 1800s–1900s, the Lutheran State Church {{supported}} the Swedish government by opposing both emigration and preachers' efforts recommending sobriety. This escalated {{to a point}} where its ministers even were persecuted by the church for preaching sobriety, and the reactions of many congregation members to that contributed to an inspiration to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> (which however was against the law until 1840).|$|E
5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the Nazi Party and the Nazi government. Discrimination and violent attacks against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power in 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazis to encourage Jews to voluntarily <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Palestine, and other countries.|$|E
5|$|Violence and {{economic}} pressure {{were used by}} the regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers and deprived of access to government contracts.

5|$|Women's {{football}} in Africa {{as a whole}} faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental gender inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. Another problem with the development for the national team, one faced throughout the continent, is if quality female football players are found, many <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States.|$|E

They discover that if they do not <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked for six months. Andrew and Samantha decide to hitchhike their way to the coast.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{proceeds}} to the enclave, {{where he is}} met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist. Bond meets Solomon Adeka and realises that the leader will shortly die of cancer: his mission to kill Adeka is needless. Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment coming into the country, all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck; the aeroplanes all show the AfriKIN name on the fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{on one of the}} supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die.|$|E

5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> or expected to leave in the near future and would not be available for immediate combat operations.|$|E
5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving {{his head}} like a Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu had decided to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E

5|$|Kogălniceanu's {{term was}} {{confirmed}} by the 1869 election, after which {{he was able to}} persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman. The poet, who had been nominated without expressing his consent, cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu's main supporters in the chamber. Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.|$|E
5|$|Legalized {{discrimination}} against Jews in Germany began {{immediately after the}} Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal of}} obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race.|$|E
