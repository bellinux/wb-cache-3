500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, {{there are people who are}} doing things <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do and they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|... "Nature Boy" [...] was {{released}} for streaming on Gaga's Vevo channel from September 16, 2014. Preceding the release, Gaga tweeted about {{the background of}} the song, about the death of flautist Horn, as well as about ahbez, saying [...] "This composer was part of a sub-culture of nomadic hippies! We channeled our own Gypsy lives in this performance". Gil Kaufman from MTV News gave a positive review, saying that [...] "This song sounds <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> imagine a smoky jazz club in 1940s New York would feel like." [...] Grow praised it as [...] "sublime", describing the track as a [...] "loungier" [...] version Gaga and Bennett's collaboration. Dave Lewis from HitFix believed that the [...] "magic" [...] of the song really happened once Bennett's vocals were heard, following Gaga's singing and the orchestration. Lewis said that [...] "It's not exactly 'Do What You Want with My Body', but Gaga and Bennett generate a different kind of heat." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the song was [...] "treated with the greatest delicacy". He praised the flute sounds and the contrast between Gaga's [...] "vulnerable" [...] vocals and Bennett's [...] "assured" [...] one. Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave a negative review, saying that her timbre in [...] "Nature Boy" [...] appeared inconsistent, [...] "shifting from soft and almost pleasant to parodic and comical, often within just a few short bars." [...] "Nature Boy" [...] debuted on the Billboard Trending 140 Chart at number five and within a few hours, rose to number one. It also debuted at number 22 on the Billboard Jazz Digital Songs chart. In Russia, it peaked at number 259 on the official Tophit airplay chart.|$|E
2500|$|Tubridy {{started in}} {{broadcasting}} {{at the age}} of 12, reviewing books for the RTÉ 2FM show Poporama presented by Ruth Buchanan. [...] He earned £25 per show. After leaving college he became a runner in RTÉ, initially working on The Gerry Ryan Show as maker of tea and coffee. Tubridy said at the death of Gerry Ryan that “The moment I set foot in RTÉ, he put his wing around me and said: 'I <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do. I <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are. I'm going to look after you.'” He credits Ryan for his kindness [...] "in a place which is so full of ego and bizarre resentment". Tubridy was also influenced by the [...] "nerd made good" [...] style of British broadcaster Chris Evans.|$|E

2500|$|Sulayman donned an {{impressive}} green robe and turban and seeing {{himself in the}} mirror commented on how he looked to be in the prime of life. A week later he was dead. He died on either September 22 or October 1, 717. Al-Tabari records the following anecdote: [...] "According to 'Ali--Suhaym b.

2500|$|Beckjord said {{he heard}} Bigfoot's voice telling him [...] "We're {{not what you}} think we are, we're here, but we're not real, <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think is real." [...] Along with the {{photographs}} of leaves and shadows Beckjord believed showed images of Bigfoot, he also reported having seen Bigfoot footprints that turned into deer tracks, confirming for him that the creature had the ability to shift its shape. He theorized that Bigfoot creatures share a [...] "space-time origin and connection with UFOs and come from an alternative universe by a wormhole." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chromium 11.0 was {{released}} on 28 January 2011, with 11.0.652.0 as the initial version. Development work in this version centered on cleaning up the settings menu, including the Sync menu and eliminating all checkboxes. Reviewer Wolfgang Gruener said [...] "The Settings menu isn't quite as messy anymore and looks much more <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would expect from a professionally designed software." [...] Language and spell checking support was expanded to 100 languages. Chromium 11 used WebKit 534.18 and V8 3.1.1 which resulted in improved speed in JavaScript and other benchmark tests. In early testing Chromium 11 was faster than Firefox 4 in V8 and Kraken benchmarks, but was 12% slower than Internet Explorer 9 in Sunspider tests.|$|E

2500|$|On “Can You Learn,” {{which was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} the title-track, T.I. and R. Kelly talk to the ladies from a different perspective: [...] "This record sounds to me <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would expect to hear if Tupac collaborated with Nate Dogg,” said T.I. of the DJ Montay-produced track, which was inspired by his own leading lady, Tameka [...] "Tiny" [...] Cottle. [...] "I really feel the connection between the music and the listener, especially if the listener is a lady or a gentleman who has had a lady who stuck by him through all of the ups and downs, the peaks and valleys that life has to offer.

2500|$|The film {{revisited}} Almodóvar's familiar {{themes of}} the power of sisterhood and of family. Almodóvar shot parts of the film in Barcelona and used lush colors to emphasise the richness of the city. Dedicated to Bette Davis, Romy Schneider and Gena Rowlands, All About My Mother is steeped in theatricality, from its backstage setting to its plot, modeled on the works of Federico García Lorca and Tennessee Williams, to the characters' preoccupation with modes of performance. Almodóvar inserts a number of references to American cinema. One of the film's key scenes, where Manuela watches her son die, was inspired by John Cassavetes' 1977 film Opening Night. The film's title is also a nod to All About Eve, which Manuela and her son are shown watching in the film. The comic relief of the film centers on Agrado, a pre-operative transsexual. In one scene, she tells the story of her body and its relationship to plastic surgery and silicone, culminating with a statement of her own philosophy: [...] "you get to be more authentic the more you become <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have dreamed of yourself".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2014 {{review for}} Uncut, Richard Williams said {{that just as}} the Beatles' fan-club Christmas records were {{inspired}} by the Goons, Harrison's inspiration for Electronic Sound {{appears to have been}} [...] "another BBC institution of their formative years: the Radiophonic Workshop". According to Williams, the album conveys [...] "the joy of a boy with a new toy" [...] and [...] "sounds <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> might get if you taped a contact microphone to the stomach of a digestively challenged robot". He concluded by saying that the self-deprecating sleeve note from Arthur Wax [...] "still sums it up". Scott Elingburg of PopMatters welcomed its Apple Years reissue and described the album as the artist's [...] "most 'experimental' work" [...] and, like the remastered Wonderwall Music, [...] "raw and gorgeous, alive and capable of sparking ingenuity". He said that while Harrison was [...] "no Brian Eno or Jeff Lynne" [...] in terms of synthesizer innovation, [...] "the intention behind Electronic Sound is one of exploration and discovery, an artist limbering up his musical mind to discover how far the boundaries of modern instrumentation could take him. Out of context, Electronic Sound would sound maudlin, even dull. Here, as a key step in the progression of Harrison the solo artist, it sounds audacious in its primitiveness ..." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1969, Spinney {{performed}} at a Puppeteers of America festival in Utah. His {{show was a}} mixture of live actors and puppets but was ruined by an errant spotlight that washed out the animated backgrounds. Henson was once again in attendance and noticed Spinney's performance. [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were trying to do," [...] Henson said, and he asked once more if they could [...] "talk about the Muppets".

5000|$|Well, it {{was kind}} of odd. We turned in a {{proposal}} to Fox, just because it was something I had always wanted to do.
