[...] In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing how great the album was.|$|E

Though the review criticized Inna's pronunciation of the lyrics and wished the text was stronger, it concluded: [...] "this is definitely a song that we need on our summer playlist". Outlet Magazine applauded [...] "Heaven" [...] for [...] "bringing the summer heat" [...] and for being [...] "the ideal song to sit outside and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> day long as the sun's rays caress your skin".

500|$|In April 1907, Rimsky-Korsakov {{conducted}} {{a pair of}} concerts in Paris, hosted by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, which featured music of the Russian nationalist school. The concerts were hugely successful in popularizing Russian classical music of this kind in Europe, Rimsky-Korsakov's in particular. The following year, his opera Sadko was produced at the Paris Opéra and The Snow Maiden at the Opéra-Comique. He also {{had the opportunity to}} hear more recent music by European composers. He hissed unabashedly when he heard Richard Strauss's opera Salome, and told Diaghilev after hearing Claude Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande, [...] "Don't make me <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> these horrors or I shall end up liking them!" [...] Hearing these works led him to appreciate his place in the world of classical music. He admitted that he was a [...] "convinced kuchkist" [...] (after kuchka, the shortened Russian term for The Five) and that his works belonged to an era that musical trends had left behind.|$|E
500|$|... 1972 was {{the least}} active year for the Who since they had formed. The group had {{achieved}} great commercial and critical success with the albums Tommy and Who's Next, but were struggling {{to come up with}} a suitable follow up. The group recorded new material with Who's Next collaborator Glyn Johns in May 1972, including [...] "Is It In My Head" [...] and [...] "Love Reign O'er Me" [...] which were eventually released on Quadrophenia, and a mini-opera called [...] "Long Live Rock – Rock Is Dead", but the material was considered too derivative of Who's Next and sessions were abandoned. In an interview for Melody Maker, guitarist and bandleader Pete Townshend said [...] "I've got to get a new act together… People don't really want to sit and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> our past". He had become frustrated that the group had been unable to produce a film of Tommy or Lifehouse (the abortive project that resulted in Who's Next), and decided to follow Frank Zappa's idea of producing a musical soundtrack that could produce a narrative in the same way as a film. Unlike Tommy, the new work would be grounded in reality and tell a story of youth and adolescence that the audience could relate to.|$|E

Howard remained loyal to Premier Campbell, praising his October 2010 announcement of using the remainder of the budget to cut income tax by 15%, two weeks before the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services was to deliver its report on public consultation for budget priorities. After Campbell resigned, and the tax cut undone, the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election ensued. Along with Richmond's other two MLAs, John Yap and Linda Reid, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon to be the new party leader, citing Falcon's willingness to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> arguments and saying [...] "I think he can bring a new dynamic, a youthful energy to the discussion; he's a great speaker, a great debater." [...] Christy Clark eventually won the leadership and became premier but, like Campbell, did not include Howard in the executive council. In March 2012, Premier Clark promoted Howard to a parliamentary secretary position under the Ministry of Transportation and directed to focus on air services agreements where he served until September. In early 2013, Howard was selected by BC Liberal caucus chair, Gordon Hogg, to assist with the party's investigation into the party's alleged use of government resources and employees in partisan promotional efforts in certain ethnic communities.|$|E

And {{if it seems}} like it's missing something, I'll go back and add something." [...] Most of his music {{is the product of}} several hours' work, rather than that of a few days. [...] To Pitchfork Media Cox said that, with each song, [...] "The genesis is usually a beat." [...] Cox considers the music of Let the Blind Lead to have a [...] "dynamic arc": {{the first half of the}} record contains [...] "more accessible songs. I was very depressed in the middle, and it created this kind of black hole of misery. Then I tried to bring it up again at the end." [...] Cox intended for his music to be [...] "therapeutic", for both himself and his audience. [...] In addition, he wanted the album to have a healing element, and be something [...] "somebody could <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the way through and feel like they went through a bad period of time and came out of it." [...] Pauline Oliveros, a composer who runs an organization that studies music therapy, was described by Cox as having [...] "a big influence" [...] on him and his ideas of therapeutic music. [...] He considers music [...] "the only art form I know of that has such an immediate effect on the human psyche", and found the time he first met and talked with Oliveros as being [...] "like meeting a hero of mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

You must <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> and not have any preconceived ideas as a director". Invigorated by his new filmmaking technique, Rivette invited over forty actors (including Jean-Pierre Leaud, Juliet Berto, Michael Lonsdale and Bulle Ogier) to each develop a character for a new film without a plot or interaction with each other. He then developed the basic structure for what would become Out 1. From April to June 1970, Rivette shot over 30 hours of 16mm footage as his cast improvised a story involving conspiracy theories and theatrical rehearsals.|$|E

On September 4, 2013, Kid Ink appeared on Los Angeles' Power 106 to announce his major label debut studio album would be titled, My Own Lane.

An OSCE spokesman said that [...] "the key point here is that it's not the OSCE's role to pass judgment, or point the finger. It's to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> sides, and to recommend and seek ways to avoid similar incidents and tensions in the future. So this is not about trying to establish who was responsible, or what exactly happened, but to look to the future to try to find ways to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although not {{initially}} receiving public and commercial praise until {{years after its}} release, the album is widely revered by critics, musicians, audiences. Serving as an inspiration for other artists, Afrodisiac has been credited {{as one of a}} precursors to the PBR subgenre. In a 2014 music and fashion conversation with NPR, singer and model Solange discussed the album, saying [...] "Brandy is really the foundation of a lot of this very innovative, progressive, experimental R Brandy really influenced a lot of that. Frank Ocean will say it. Miguel will say it." [...] Barbadian singer Rihanna revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that her 2007 multi-platinum album, Good Girl Gone Bad, was primarily influenced by Afrodisiac. In the interview she stated, [...] "Brandy's album really helped to inspire, because that album I <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> day, all night when I was in the studio [...] I really admired that every song was a great song." [...] Rock musician John Frusciante, viruoso guitarist of the popular rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, mentioned that Norwood and the album were the “main inspiration” behind the guitar work on the Red Hot Chili Pepper’s 2006 Grammy winning album, Stadium Arcadium. In 2008, singer Beyoncé Knowles chose the album cut [...] "Focus" [...] for her personal music playlist on iTunes, citing her love of the lyrics, and Brandy's voice and vocal arrangements. Hip-Hop producer Hit-Boy has often lauded the album as an influence on his work via his social media outlets. R singer Nivea interpolated the song [...] "I Tried" [...] on her 2010 single [...] "Love Hurts".|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} being {{asked if she}} is putting on a geeky and gaming persona for the cameras, Hex {{explains}} that it [...] "would be so impossible to manufacture a whole persona" [...] across all the different platforms that she uses to interact with people. Hex said the capture and logging is the most challenging part of the job, {{but it is also}} unique as if she is referencing a particular part of the game, she can show her own personal experience rather than rolling stock footage. Bajo says this is also for editorial reasons in that, [...] "We need to defend our point by showing the footage to satisfy the ABC's charter." [...] Bajo notes that in the show's early days, there were some intense forum flames over things like missing a detail out, or not agreeing with the general consensus among viewers. He also says {{that if there is a}} genre of games that he and Hex don't like or aren't very good at, such as sports games, they won't ignore it and will try to be as honest as possible with their reviews. Bajo says that as people invest so many hours into a game, it is justified to feel a sense of ownership over it and feel defensive if someone doesn't feel the same way. For this reason he loves [...] "getting to the bottom of" [...] why certain games are liked by some and disliked by others. Bajo says you can't speak with conviction if you haven't done something, especially [...] " [...] something as involving as games". Bajo explains [...] " [...] the odd publisher/developer who wasn't happy with our review [...] we try to be fair, honest, and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> feedback we get to make sure we're not ever crossing any lines." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
