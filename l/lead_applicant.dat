40|$|Very little {{research}} has investigated the comparability of telephone and face-to-face employment interviews. This exploratory study investigated interviewers' questioning strategies and applicants' causal attributions produced during semi structured telephone and face-to-face graduate recruitment interviews (N= 62). A total of 2044 causal attributions were extracted from verbatim transcripts of these 62 interviews. It was predicted that an absence of visual cues would <b>lead</b> <b>applicants</b> to produce, and interviewers to focus on, information that might reduce the comparative anonymity of telephone interviews. Results indicate that applicants produce more personal causal attributions in telephone interviews. Personal attributions are also associated with higher ratings in telephone, but not face-to-face interviews. In face-to-face interviews, applicants who attributed outcomes to more global causes received lower ratings. There was also a non-significant tendency for interviewers to ask more closed questions in telephone interviews. The implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

It was initiated in a panel at the Association for the Psychoanalysis of Culture and Society Conference at Rutgers University, NJ (2001). Part One of the book (by Professor Dany Nobus) examined the epistemological legacy of Freud and Lacan, Part Two (by Dr Malcolm Quinn) focused on the ‘Four Discourses’ of Lacan’s Seminar XVII (1969 - 70), which express a relationship between knowledge and the social bond. This book was described by Jason B. Jones in 'The Journal for the Psychoanalysis of Culture and Society, 11 (2006), as ‘the most useful guide to so-called applied psychoanalysis that I have ever read. ’ Quinn’s chapter ‘Reading Seminar XVII’ was the most extended engagement with this seminar in English, until {{the publication of the}} first full English translation of the seminar and an accompanying edited collection in 2006, both of which Quinn has reviewed for Journal for Lacanian Studies and are due be published in December 2007.

The evaluation criteria are experience-based and reflect professional merits for the competition.   The three developer competitions generated a total of sixteen applications from candidates, teams of constructors, and developers in cooperation with architect firms. The <b>lead</b> <b>applicant</b> was the constructor or developer – not the architect firm. Eleven design teams were invited to the developer competitions after prequalification.   Winners in developer competitions receive building permits and can implement their proposal, either by purchasing the land or acquiring the leasehold.

Our objective was to a) describe 4 -year change in the prevalence of meeting guidelines, and characteristics of participants across categories of physical activity maintenance, and b) identify familial factors in childhood that are longitudinally associated with meeting guidelines in adolescence. Data on 17 parent- and child-reported family variables and objectively measured physical activity (ActiGraph GT 1 M) were available from 406 children (10. 3  ±  0. 3  years, 53. 5 % female) participating in the SPEEDY study. Average duration of week- and weekend day moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA, ≥  2000  cpm) at baseline and follow-up (14. 3  ±  0. 3  years) were calculated to determine whether participants met 60  min MVPA/day guidelines at each assessment. Descriptives were calculated across four MVPA change categories. Multi-level logistic regression examined the association of baseline familial factors with meeting guidelines at follow-up, adjusting for sex, baseline physical activity, family socio-economic position, and school clustering. At follow-up, 51. 5 % and 36. 1 % of adolescents met guidelines on weekdays and weekend days, respectively (baseline: 68. 0 %, 67. 2 %). Girls were less likely than boys to remain sufficiently active, particularly on weekdays. Family social support was positively associated with adolescents meeting guidelines at weekends (OR 1. 2; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 4). The presence of play equipment at home was negatively associated with meeting guidelines on weekdays (OR 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 8). Interventions that foster parent's facilitation of physical activity may help to encourage the upkeep of healthy behaviours during the transition from childhood to adolescence.

Applicants with disabilities and able-bodied applicants report similar feelings of anxiety towards an interview. [...] Applicants with disabilities often report that interviewers react nervously and insecurely, which <b>leads</b> such <b>applicants</b> to experience anxiety and tension themselves. The interview is felt to be {{the part of the}} selection process where covert discrimination against applicants with disabilities can occur. Many applicants with disabilities feel they cannot disclose (i.e., inform potential employer of disability) or discuss their disability because they want to demonstrate their abilities. If the disability is visible, then disclosure will inevitably occur when the applicant meets the interviewer, so the applicant can decide if they want to discuss their disability. If an applicant has a non-visible disability, however, then that applicant has more of a choice in disclosing and discussing. In addition, applicants who were aware that the recruiting employer already had employed people with disabilities felt they had a more positive interview experience. Applicants should consider if they are comfortable with talking about and answering questions about their disability before deciding how to approach the interview.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{promising}} to keep Medicare Locals, the Abbott government abolished the fledgling organisations after it took office, writes economist John Thompson Even {{when it had}} no clear policies or plans to replace them, the Abbott government seemed determined to undo many of the initiatives of the previous Labor government. This was certainly the case in relation to primary health care. In 2008, the then Labor government established the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission (NHHRC) to conduct {{a comprehensive review of}} Australia’s health system. The review provided the basis for the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) signed by the Australian government and the states and territories in August 2011. The reforms set out in the NHRA had three main objectives: 	Reforming the fundamentals of our health and hospital system, including funding and governance, to provide a sustainable foundation for providing better services now and in the future. 	Changing the way health services are delivered, through better access to high quality integrated care designed around the needs of patients, and a greater focus on prevention, early intervention and the provision of care outside of hospitals. 	Providing better care and better access to services for patients, through increased investments to provide better hospitals, improved infrastructure, and more doctors and nurses. The establishment of 61 Medicare Locals across Australia was one of the key initiatives taken to address these objectives. These regional structures aimed to strengthen the primary care system (and thereby relieve pressure on hospitals and other acute providers) by integrating Commonwealth and state government health planning and service delivery and access. Medicare Locals were non-profit companies selected after a competitive application process and funded largely by the Commonwealth with $ 1. 8 billion for the period 2011 – 12 to 2015 – 16. While the Commonwealth funding deed specified program schedules and reporting requirements, Medicare Locals were provided with considerable scope to arrange their structure, operations and relationships to reflect their local health environment. To provide this focus on primary care, Medicare Locals were required “to work with the full spectrum of general practice, allied health and community health care providers and improve access to care and drive integration between services. ” They established collaboration with health care services and other community organisations in their region to develop strategies to meet the overall primary health care needs of their communities. Considerable effort was made to ensure that general practice had {{a central role in the}} work of Medicare Locals – with varying effectiveness. Medicare Locals worked at a regional level with state and local government in the planning of primary health care services and in the linking of these services with Local Hospital Networks and aged care programs to deliver improved integration and effective transitions for patients across the entire health care system. The Medicare Locals program was a contentious one, not just because it was a Labor government initiative, but many GPs saw it as a threat to their primacy in their local primary care market and saw the regional health planning activities of the Medicare Locals as an unnecessary additional layer of bureaucracy. This negative view was reinforced by the AMA, the doctors’ union, that lobbied the Coalition Opposition on the basis of the perceived threat to the GP small businesses. For this reason, the Coalition went to the 2013 election with a health policy that included brief mention of Medicare Locals as follows: “We will also review the Medicare Locals structure to ensure that funding is being spent as effectively as possible to support frontline services rather than administration. ” However, the then Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, made a promise that no Medicare Locals would be closed should the Coalition form government. About a month after coming into office, the new Minister for Health, Peter Dutton, announced a review of Medicare Locals to be conducted by Professor John Horvath. The review was aimed at “reducing waste and spending on administration and bureaucracy, so that greater investment can be made in services that directly benefit patients and support health professionals who deliver those services to patients. ” Comments from selected “stakeholders” were invited. Professor Horvath, previously Chief Medical Officer, was assisted in the review by two consulting firms: Ernst & Young provided advice on the current operations of Medicare Locals and future structure and governance options, and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte), conducted an assessment of their financial performance and compliance to their Deed. The conduct of the review attracted substantial criticism, particularly for its lack of transparency. A Senate committee subsequently reported that it had not been able to obtain much definitive information about the process and methodology used to conduct the review. More than 270 submissions were received, indicating a high level of interest in the review, but none was made available by the Department of Health or as supporting documents with the review as is the usual case. Horvath advised that he “personally conducted” interviews with key stakeholders but did not identify who they were. A small number of Medicare Locals were asked for input to the review but were restricted in the amount of information they could provide. It is understood that the Deloitte audit involved what the Department of Health called “a basic review” of the 2012 – 13 operations of the Medicare Locals functioning at that time, with a more considered audit of six of the 61 Medicare Locals. As most Medicare Locals had only just begun operating (setting up structures, employing staff, developing IT systems, etc.), it is not surprising that their audited financial and other achievements were not substantial, and the auditors were not interested in the future plans of the Medicare Locals. The review was completed in March 2014 and was highly critical of the performance of the Medicare Locals. It recommended that the recently established Medicare Local system (one third of the Medicare Locals were only established as from July 2012) be replaced with a system comprising a smaller number of regional organisations called Primary Health Organisations. The Senate committee referred to above reported: “With limited information available publicly, and no detailed discussion of methodology in the Review report, it is difficult to understand the Review’s recommendations. Similarly, without the transparency that would have been achieved by the publication of the consultancy reports and the 270 submissions, the Review’s assertions that the Medicare Locals are ‘flawed’ cannot be tested. ” The Senate Committee also stated that it could not reconcile the positive evidence it heard of the progress and achievements of Medicare Locals with the highly critical and negative findings of Horvath’s review of the work of the Medicare Locals. Notwithstandinga clear public statement by Tony Abbott that no Medicare Locals would be closed should the Coalition form government, when his government brought down the 2014 - 15 Budget in May 2014 it was announced that all Medicare Locals would cease operation on 30 June 2015 and a new network of Primary Health Networks (PHNs) would be established. There have been substantial costs incurred in the closure of the 61 newly established Medicare Locals, both financial and in terms of disruption or termination of valuable health services. In a relatively short time, boards had been established, staff had been recruited, premises and operating resources were acquired, relationships and collaborations established with local health organisations, and services and programs initiated. On the basis of government commitments, the Medicare Locals had entered into contracts, leases and employment obligations. The costs of winding up the Medicare Locals have been estimated at between $ 112 million to $ 200 million. The Health Department admitted that closing Medicare Locals would cost $ 112 million but refused a Freedom of Information request for details of this estimate claiming it would not be in the public interest to release these figures because it could jeopardise “its good relationship with Medicare Locals. ” However, many Medicare Locals showed no reluctance to publicly announce their wind up costs at the Senate Committee hearing. The Barwon Medicare Local estimated their costs at $ 2 million; the North Adelaide Medicare Local’s estimated costs were $ 2. 2 million. Skilled, and often very scarce, staff were lost as they became aware of the uncertainty of their future employment. These staff losses were felt most keenly in non-metropolitan areas where health workers are often difficult to find. Perhaps more crucially, many highly needed health services that had been recently begun were terminated. Although in their early stage of operation, Medicare Locals had established or funded a range of vital services, made important advances in population health, identified and filled key gaps in services, and begun the critical task of integrating primary care with hospital services. This momentum was lost and many communities lost the gains made. Furthermore, key health staff were lost, a particularly important factor in rural and remote areas. The Department of Health then announced that the new PHNs would be selected on the basis of a public tender process so that the new organisations could begin operations on 1 July 2015. This tender process was very poorly managed by the Department. The notice of tender for the PHN Program was issued on 28 November 2014, almost a month after the previously advised scheduled release date. The tender period was very short and conducted over the Christmas–New Year period with tenders to be submitted by 28 January 2015. This was an absurdly short time for major organisational relationships to be established and business structures and financial decisions to be made, particularly as the minister encouraged new private sector interests to participate. Although broad guidelines were provided to potential tenderers at the start of the process, major decisions and criteria such as the geographic boundaries of the proposed PHNs were drip fed to interested tenderers as the tenders were being prepared. State government officials advised that there was very little consultation with the key state health agencies to recognise and capitalise on existing health planning and coordination bodies. Information meetings for prospective tenderers were conducted in each state by Department of Health officials but the information provided was no more than that which already available on the Department’s website. The Department even refused to provide notes of the meetings or lists of attendees (which would have been of assistance to facilitate collaboration in the preparation of tenders). Horvarth’s review criticised Medicare Locals for focussing too much on service delivery, not entirely coincidentally a concern of GPs and other providers. His report recommended that PHNs “should only provide services where there is demonstrable market failure, significant economies of scale or absence of services”. However, he did not define “market failure” and the Department clearly had difficulty in providing potential tenderers any reasonable clarity on this matter. This certainly made the preparation of submissions very difficult, especially for tenderers in rural and regional areas where Medicare Locals had provided services to meet significant gaps in services. In summary, the tender process was very deficient. The Senate Committee noted the confusion surrounding the tender process and considered “flaws in the government’s PHN tender process raises doubts regarding any outcome of the tender process. ” It is not surprising that about this time a poll of more than 1100 doctors across Australia conducted by the AMA declared the Minister for Health, Peter Dutton MP, the worst Minister for Health for 35 years. In April 2015 the Commonwealth government announced that 31 PHNs would be funded as from 1 July 2015. They would be required to establish Clinical Councils involving GPs, and Consumer Advisory Committees. Announcing the successful bidders, the Minister of Health, Sussan Ley, said the new PHNs would replace “Labor’s flawed Medicare Local system,” yet almost all PHNs selected (24 of the 28 PHNs) are either consortia of former Medicare Locals or have a Medicare Local as the <b>lead</b> <b>applicant.</b> The new PHNs will be responsible for populations and geographic areas that are much larger than those of the Medicare Locals. (For example, one PHN will now be responsible for all of Western Australia except the Perth metropolitan area.) Medicare Locals had an average population of 355, 000; PHNs will service an average population of 738, 000. Six PHNs will service populations of more than one million. Many health experts doubt the effectiveness and efficiency of such very large organisations, citing the failure of the NSW government’s establishment of mega health services. The substantial costs of establishing these new organisations are not known and it will be interesting to discover their operating costs when their first financial reports are made. The concerns of the Senate Committee that the inadequate Horvarth review and the Department’s inept tender process could lead to a poor result appear to be justified. Now, several months after the PHNs were formally established, there has been little progress in developing any useful operations. Many in the health system are of the view that the whole exercise is a very expensive ideological move that, despite very substantial financial resources and lengthy disruption and dislocation, may not achieve the results that the fledgling Medicare Locals were beginning to realise.

This article reviews research on what selection tools work, what recruitment strategies work, how selection-tool use relates to workforce diversity, and what staffing and recruiting processes <b>lead</b> to positive <b>applicant</b> perceptions. Knowledge and implementation gaps in these areas are discussed, and key research findings are presented. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. HR professionals are challenged to address an organization’s varied needs when it comes to recruiting and staffing. One often hears that the proposed solution to a “people problem” is {{to do a better job}} in the recruiting process of attracting better people, do a better job in the hiring process of identifying future stars and “weeding out ” the problems, and do a better job of attracting and selecting a more diverse workforce. Moreover, organizational demands require that HR professionals accomplish these goals quickly and in a cost-effective manner. HR professionals are continually called upon to come up with new strategies for attraction, new tools for selection, and new ways to enhance workforce diversity, while incorporating the sometimes competing needs and views of varied stakeholders—the hiring managers, the applicants, the legal department, recruiters, labor unions, other external groups, and so on. While recruitment and staffing strategies and tools are sometimes prone to fads, there is a substantial body of research to guide HR professionals in meeting these challenges. In this article, we will discuss four areas where this research can provide some clarity regarding what works and what does not, yet where the research often gets overlooked.

30|$|Thus, if direct {{interventions}} render impossible—because any reaction will be {{according to}} operational criteria {{defined by the}} targets themselves—a concept is needed {{that takes into account}} a focal system’s idiosyncrasy. This is why the term irritation is a helpful one in this context. Unlike other kinds of external disturbances, irritations are characterized by their quality to make their addressees actually deal with aspects of their environment. 2 Irritations indicate that the target’s usual way of processing information does not work and triggers it to ask why this routine failed. This does not mean that an irritation automatically facilitates the change envisaged by the irritation’s “sender”. Irritations may be suppressed or the like. However, it works the other way round: If a system should be pushed into a direction it had not chosen on its own, the initiator of this kind of change will need to irritate it. A focal system will only change its usual way of processing, if an irritation is able to indicate a problem of this otherwise smoothly running routine. However, this still remains a problem in the system’s own perspective and must not be the same aspect the irritator intended to hint at. To give a simple example, the political system cannot directly push scientists to deliver more applicable knowledge—but it has the opportunity to remind science of this expectation over and over again. A failing routine could be a scientific proposal that only accounts for scientific values and its refusal could serve as an irritation that <b>leads</b> the <b>applicant</b> to search for the reasons why something that worked out beforehand no longer does. Here, the reasons are easily comprehensible—they are even handed over in cold print. This example rather intended to shed light on the mechanism. Irritations are hard to reject, being hit by a communication of that kind means to have to spend time and energy for something your environment wants you to.|$|R

However, researchers and evaluators are often faced with a small or moderate number of applicants but must still attempt to estimate the population correlation between predictor and criterion. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we investigated the accuracy of population correlation estimates and their associated standard error in terms of small and moderate sample sizes. We applied multiple imputation by chained equations for continuous and naturally dichotomous criterion variables. The results show that multiple imputation by chained equations is accurate for a continuous criterion variable, even for a small number of applicants when the selection ratio is not too small. In the case of a naturally dichotomous criterion variable, a small or moderate number of <b>applicants</b> <b>leads</b> to biased estimates when the selection ratio is small. In contrast, the standard error of the population correlation estimate is accurate over a wide range of conditions of sample size, selection ratio, true population correlation, for continuous and naturally dichotomous criterion variables, and for direct and indirect range restriction scenarios. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence about the accuracy of the correction, and support researchers and evaluators in their assessment of conditions under which correlation coefficients corrected for range restriction can be trusted...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose Arranging work {{experience}} prior {{to medical school}} can for many potential applicants prove extremely difficult, with access to clinical settings often considered the ideal type. Potential applicants struggle to interpret the official guidance from medical schools 1, making the application process intensely unsettling. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some UK-based candidates have been responding to these perceived requirements by paying to undertake commercially-mediated international {{work experience}} (i-WEX) 2, 3. A recent Medical Schools Council announcement highlights that overseas work experience prior to studying medicine is problematic. 4 However, there is no literature that would tell us anything about why it is being undertaken, by whom or about the potential consequences for participants and hosts. This project addresses this gap and offers insights into applicants’ mind-sets and the commercial environment that appears to provide a potential solution to their dilemma. It draws on parallels with existing debates around the benefits and drawbacks of volunteer tourism pertaining to medical electives and gap year volunteer projects. Methodology This is an exploratory interview-based study with UK undergraduate medical students (n= 15). Following completion of the individual interviews, each one will be transcribed, before a thematic analysis is performed. Results To date some seven interviews have been conducted already and we expect the final analysis and writing up to conclude in May 2015. Discussion and Conclusions Preliminary analysis suggests that the seemingly conflicting guidance regarding work experience requirements has left applicants susceptible to panic when observing the apparent opportunities enjoyed by peers encountered at school and on online forums. As previously suggested in the literature, networks (into the healthcare professions) are invaluable for organising work experience, though many applicants do not have such contacts. Apparently, this <b>leads</b> some <b>applicants</b> to undertake i-WEX, which promises exotic and exciting experiences to elaborate on in personal statements and interviews. 1 - Timm A.

40|$|Army recruiters have {{an uphill}} battle {{recruiting}} wellqualified volunteers into military service. With a prospering economy, there are many alternatives to joining the military, and all services are having difficulty recruiting young people. United States Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) sponsored our research in simulating the workings of an Army recruiting station {{in an effort to}} help understand more about the recruiting process. Specifically, USAREC wanted a management tool {{to examine the effects of}} changing a variety of controllable factors on the way an individual recruiting station performs. We focused this study on the effect of recruiting station commander leadership on recruiting productivity, and the differences in processing times and success rates for different types of applicants (potential recruits). This study added capability to a previous simulation model developed at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) (Cordeiro and Friend 1998). Cordeiro & Friend’s model depicted an Army recruiting station with three types of recruiters, and a single (average) recruiter type. For the current work, we needed to gather pertinent data on the effects of leadership and on the differences between different applicant types. In addition, we needed to incorporate the new data into the simulation model. The remainder of this paper includes an overview of the recruiting process, considerations for modeling leadership effects and applicant types, a discussion of incorporating these features in the simulation, a brief look at some simulation output, and some future research interests. 1 RECRUITING PROCESS Army recruiters produce <b>leads</b> for new <b>applicants</b> two ways. First, they prospect for new applicants by visiting high schools or calling potential candidates on th...|$|R
