50|$|The coal {{burned in}} the station's boilers was {{delivered}} to the station by rail from Trafalgar South Yard, on the East Coast Main Line at Argyle Street. From here the <b>hoppered</b> <b>waggons</b> were moved along a high timber and steel staith from which they could discharge the coal directly into bunkers above the boilers. From these bunkers it was fed by automatic weighing machines into automatic stokers.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the film}} is shot outside with natural <b>lighting.</b> <b>Hopper</b> said all the outdoor {{shooting}} was an intentional choice on his part, because [...] "God is a great gaffer." [...] The production used two five-ton trucks, one for the equipment and one for the motorcycles, with the cast and crew in a motor home. One of the locations was Monument Valley.|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{evaluated the}} effect of magazine training on acquisition of the pigeon's key peck during autoshaping. In Experiment I, pigeons were exposed to two days of extended magazine training, followed {{on the third day}} by keylight-only presentations. All pigeons pecked the keylight early in the keylight-only session. Experiment II examined the relationship between the number of magazine-training trials and trials to the first peck. Pigeons were given either 0, 3, 10, or 25 magazine-training trials followed by the standard autoshaping procedure. The number of trials to the first peck was related to the number of magazine-training trials. In Experiment III, pigeons were exposed to the standard autoshaping procedure without prior magazine training. The data from Experiment III suggested that key pecking will occur only after the response of eating from the <b>lighted</b> <b>hopper</b> has occurred. Taken together, these results suggest that initial magazine training is an important variable in autoshaping. Key pecking is discussed as a generalized consummatory response...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} generalization decrement during an extinction resistance-to-change test for pigeon key pecking using a two-component multiple schedule with equal variable–interval 3 -min schedules and different reinforcer amounts (one component presented 2 -s access to reinforcement {{and the other}} 8 s). After establishing baseline responding, subjects were {{assigned to one of}} the two extinction conditions: hopper stimuli (<b>hopper</b> and <b>hopper</b> <b>light</b> were activated but no food was available) or Control (inactive <b>hopper</b> and <b>hopper</b> <b>light).</b> Responding in the 8 -s component was more resistant to extinction than responding in the 2 -s component, the hopper stimuli group was more resistant to extinction compared to the Control group, and an interaction between amount of reinforcement, extinction condition, and session block was present. This finding supports generalization decrement as a factor that influences resistance to extinction. Hopper-time data (the amount of time subjects spent with their heads in the hopper) were compared to resistance-to-change data in an investigation of the role of conditioned reinforcement on resistance to change...|$|R
40|$|In a two-key {{concurrent}} variable-interval schedule (using pigeons), if the reinforcement frequency for one {{response is}} held constant while {{that for the}} other is increased, the rate of response on the constant key decreases. The immediate reinforcement for key pecking can usually be conceptualized as the change from {{a condition in which}} the key light is on and the food <b>hopper</b> <b>light</b> is off to one in which the key light is off and the <b>hopper</b> <b>light</b> is on. The prechange condition is associated with a delay to food of one-half the average interreinforcement interval in effect during this condition. The postchange condition is associated with a delay to food of about. 5 seconds. The programming of additional reinforcement results in a decrease in the delay to food associated with the prechange stimulus condition, and thus a decrease {{in the value of the}} improvement that results from the change. This would appear to be analogous to a decrease in the amount of reinforcement, and thus sufficient explanation for the decrease in the rate of the response...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a number of recent studies suggest that {{acquisitions}} of autoshaped key pecking in pigeons is affected by the similarity of the grain-hopper stimulus and response-key stimulus. In Experiment 1 this hypothesis was tested by training independent groups of pigeons to key peck under six different hopper-stimulus and key-stimulus similarity conditions, and three procedures containing either immediate reinforcement, variable delay of reinforcement, or omission of reinforcement for key pecking. Number of trials to acquisition was found {{to be related to the}} similarity variable. Maintained responding was affected by the response-reinforcer contingency. This effect was found both within and between subjects. Under two of the contingencies (automaintenance and omission), maintained responding continued to be affected by the similarity of the hopper stimulus and key stimulus. In Experiment 2 pigeons were given omission training with a <b>hopper</b> <b>light</b> on or off. Both acquisition and maintenance of key pecking were facilitated by the presence of the <b>hopper</b> <b>light.</b> The present findings suggest that much of the responding reported in various automatic shaping and training procedures may reflect the effects of key stimulus/food stimulus similarity...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} tested the hypothesis that initial key pecks in the autoshaping procedure are generalized pecks at the illuminated grain hopper. Experiment I found that autoshaping readily occurred when the chamber was continuously illuminated by a house-light. In Experiment II, pigeons given magazine training and autoshaping with an unlighted grain hopper failed to autoshape in 200 trials. Acquisition of autoshaped key pecking was retarded in Experiment III when stimulus control by the magazine light was reduced. In the fourth study, pigeons were given magazine training with either a red or white magazine light and then given autoshaping with concurrently presented red and white keys. For all pigeons in this experiment, the first key peck occurred on the key of {{the same color as}} that pigeon's magazine light. The results of these experiments were interpreted as supporting an account of autoshaping that identifies initial key pecks as arising due to generalization of pecking at the <b>lighted</b> grain <b>hopper</b> to pecking at the lighted key...|$|R
50|$|The nearby twin lighthouses {{were built}} in 1828, but cannot be viewed from this park. The easternmost light is still active; the other was {{decommissioned}} in 1924, served as a fire control tower in World War II, {{and is now a}} private home. Although the lighthouses cannot be seen from within the park, they can be viewed from a turnaround at the end of Two <b>Lights</b> Road. Edward <b>Hopper</b> made one of the towers the subject of his 1929 painting The Lighthouse at Two Lights, which was used on a U.S. postage stamp in 1970 commemorating the sesquicentennial of Maine statehood.|$|R
2500|$|In Office at Night (1940), another [...] "couple" [...] painting, Hopper {{creates a}} {{psychological}} puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing {{on his work}} papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he {{is working hard to}} ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how <b>Hopper</b> employs three <b>light</b> sources, from a desk lamp, through a window and indirect <b>light</b> from above. <b>Hopper</b> went on to make several [...] "office" [...] pictures, but none with a sensual undercurrent.|$|R
40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to key-peck for food, first with single-stimulus {{training}} and then with successive discrimination (multiple schedule) training. In the multiple schedule, two different wavelengths were each correlated with equally frequent variable-interval reinforcement but different durations (6 sec vs. 2 sec) of access to grain. For some birds, the different durations of feeding cycle were cued by different intensities of the food <b>hopper</b> <b>light.</b> For some of these “cued” birds, single-stimulus training had been carried out with 6 -sec feedings and when multiple-schedule training was introduced, the novel stimulus was correlated with 2 -sec feedings. For the others, 2 -sec feedings were originally used, and the novel stimulus was then present during the 6 -sec reinforcement duration. The cueing procedure enhanced discrimination performance, and was necessary for the consistent production of a peak shift. In addition, the condition in which original training had been carried out with 6 -sec feedings, and thus reinforcement duration was reduced {{in the presence of}} the novel stimulus, led to the best performance...|$|R
40|$|Four experiments, each {{using the}} same six pigeons, {{investigated}} the effects of varying component durations and component reinforcement rates in multiple variable-interval schedules. Experiment 1 used unequal component durations in which one component was five times {{the duration of the}} other, and the shorter component was varied over conditions from 120 seconds to 5 seconds. The schedules were varied over five values for each pair of component durations. Sensitivity to reinforcement rate changes was the same at all component durations. In Experiment 2, both component durations were 5 seconds, and the schedules were again varied using both one and two response keys. Sensitivity to reinforcement was not different from the values found in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, various manipulations, including body-weight changes, reinforcer duration changes, blackouts, <b>hopper</b> <b>lights</b> correlated with keylights, and overall reinforcement rate changes were carried out. No reliable increase in reinforcement sensitivity resulted from any manipulation. Finally, in Experiment 4, reinforcement rates in the two components were kept constant and unequal, and the component durations were varied. Shorter components produced significantly increased response rates normally in the higher reinforcement rate component, but schedule reversals at short component durations eliminated the response rate increases. The effects of component duration on multiple schedule performance cannot be interpreted as changing sensitivity to reinforcement nor to changing bias...|$|R
40|$|In Experiment 1 all pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} 2 ﬂashes of <b>hopper</b> <b>light</b> in 4 sec from 8 ﬂashes in 4 sec, at a 0 sec delay. One group of pigeons experienced dark lTl’s (Group Dark) while the other experienced an illuminated lTl (Group Light). All birds were then tested with dark delays of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 sec. Analysis showed a signiﬁcant bias {{to respond to the}} comparison correct for small at extended delays, with no difference between groups. In Experiment 2 training was identical to that in Experiment l except that a 5 sec baseline delay was used. The pigeons were then tested at delays of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 sec. Again, analysis showed a tendency to choose the comparison correct for small at delays longer than baseline, while at delays shorter than baseline they showed a bias to respond large. No group differences were observed. In Experiment 3, an illuminated Dl was introduced for both groups. Analysis showed a reversal of the biases observed in Experiment 2. At delays longer than baseline a choose-large bias occurred, while at delays shorter than baseline a choose-small bias was observed. Again, there were no group differences. It was hypothesized that illuminating the Dl added pulse counts to the pigeons’ memory for the samples, suggesting that an event switch was not being used, but that the total amount of light in each trial was being summed. The results are clearly inconsistent with the contusion hypothesis and support a subjective shortening account of memory biases for temporal discriminations. However, whether this theory can be extended to include a subjective shrinking of number remains in question...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to examine extinction of responding with regard to the rapidity and thoroughness of the process when conditioned reinforcement was available on one of five schedules during extinction. Forty-five mixed-breed pigeons served as subjects with 15 in each of three experiments. Reinforcement training schedules were as follows: Experiment 1, continuous; Experiment 2, fixed ratio 15; Experiment 3, variable-interval one-minute. After training, subjects experienced one of five extinction procedures (here called schedules of extinction) which were as follows: traditional schedule without keylight did not provide conditioned reinforcement; traditional with keylight had the keylight on continuously but withheld other conditioned reinforcement (no schedule, per se, was used); the remaining three schedules (i. e., continuous, fixed ratio 15, and variable-interval one-minute) provided the following four conditioned reinforcers: the sound of the food magazine, the <b>hopper</b> <b>light,</b> the sight of food, and the keylight. Predictions for responding were based on the discrimination hypothesis which states that the more alike training and extinction conditions are, the slower the process of extinction. In order to compare response rates among subjects, a percentage of baseline responding was computed. Four spontaneous recovery tests were conducted to measure the thoroughness of the extinction procedures. Results did not support predictions based on the discrimination hypothesis; that is, subject response rates {{did not appear to be}} affected by the similarity of the extinction condition to previous training history. The second finding was that the most rapid and thorough extinction was obtained when the extinction schedule was traditional without keylight. When conditioned reinforcement was available, the continuous extinction schedule produced the most rapid and thorough extinction. The third major finding was that the schedule of unconditioned reinforcement was more predictive of extinction responding than was the conditioned reinforcement schedule during extinction. The last finding was that a subject 2 ̆ 7 s pattern of responding was typical of the schedule whether it was on an unconditioned or a conditioned reinforcement schedule. It is suggested that extinction-of-a-human-intervention strategies might be more effective if conditioned reinforcement was identified and controlled...|$|R
