5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical <b>lenses,</b> <b>and</b> explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E
5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses <b>lenses</b> <b>and</b> curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The {{company now}} maintained its full inventory, making its <b>lenses</b> <b>and</b> the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg <b>lenses),</b> <b>and</b> wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers.

5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into <b>lenses</b> <b>and</b> windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on August 15, 1983. All but {{two days}} of production were filmed on Paramount soundstages, by cinematographer Charles Correll. The Search for Spock {{was one of the}} first major feature films to use Eastman 5294, a color high speed negative film stock. The film allowed Correll latitude in choosing a broad range of exposure indexes. Since The Search for Spock was shot with anamorphic <b>lenses</b> <b>and</b> many theatergoers would see widescreen 70mm prints, Correll needed to produce a crisp depth of field, a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the exposure index above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50foot-candles.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive <b>lenses,</b> <b>and</b> the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{calculations}} by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, {{along with}} confirmations by Fermi, {{had shown that}} not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951 Teller and Ulam made a breakthrough, and invented a new design, proposed in a classified March 1951 paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I: Hydrodynamic <b>Lenses</b> <b>and</b> Radiation Mirrors, for a practical megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to {{what became known as the}} Teller–Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the <b>lenses</b> <b>and</b> moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{quantify}} whole <b>lens</b> <b>and</b> nuclear <b>lens</b> densities using anterior-segment {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) with {{a liquid}} optics interface and evaluate their correlation with Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) <b>lens</b> grading <b>and</b> corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA). Methods. OCT images of the whole <b>lens</b> <b>and</b> <b>lens</b> nucleus of eyes with age-related nuclear cataract were analyzed using ImageJ software. The <b>lens</b> grade <b>and</b> nuclear density were represented in pixel intensity units (PIU) and correlations between PIU, BCVA, and LOCS III were assessed. Results. Forty-seven eyes were analyzed. The mean whole <b>lens</b> <b>and</b> <b>lens</b> nuclear densities were 26. 99 ± 5. 23 and 19. 43 ± 6. 15 [*]PIU, respectively. A positive linear correlation was observed between lens opacities (R 2 = 0. 187, p< 0. 01) and nuclear density (R 2 = 0. 316, p< 0. 01) obtained from OCT images and LOCS III. Preoperative BCVA and LOCS III were also positively correlated (R 2 = 0. 454, p< 0. 01). Conclusions. Whole <b>lens</b> <b>and</b> <b>lens</b> nuclear densities obtained from OCT correlated with LOCS III. Nuclear density showed a higher positive correlation with LOCS III than whole lens density. OCT with a liquid optics interface is a potential quantitative method for <b>lens</b> grading <b>and</b> can aid in monitoring and managing age-related cataracts...|$|R
