40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} more {{realistic}} multi-period <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> fleet planning problem for a <b>liner</b> container <b>shipping</b> company than has been studied in previous literature. The proposed problem is formulated as a scenario-based dynamic programming model consisting {{of a number of}} integer linear programming formulations for each single planning period, and the model can be solved efficiently by a shortest path algorithm on an acyclic network. A numerical example is carried out to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model and solution method. The numerical results show that chartering in ships may not always be a better policy for a long-term planning horizon though it is much cheaper than buying ships in the short-term. Purchasing ships seems to be a more profitable investment in the long run.

This paper first reformulates {{the maximum number of}} voyages that can be completed in the planning horizon, which is incorrectly defined by the existing studies on <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> fleet deployment. It proceeds to remedy a constraint in Gelareh and Meng (Transp Res 46 E: 76 - 89 2010) such that the nonlinear programming model proposed by Gelareh and Meng (Transp Res 46 E: 76 - 89 2010) is equivalent to its linear formulation. Finally, a reformulation of the fleet deployment model is presented to eliminate the combinatorial behavior of the model proposed by Gelareh and Meng (Transp Res 46 E: 76 - 89 2010). Computational study demonstrates significant efficiency improvement of the reformulated model...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{estimate}} capacity utilization of a <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> route with a bounded polyhedral container shipment demand pattern, arising in the <b>liner</b> container <b>shipping</b> industry. The proposed maximum and minimum <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> route capacity utilization problems are formulated as a linear programming model and a min-max model, respectively. We examine two fundamental {{properties of the}} min-max model. These two nice properties enable us to develop two e-optimal global optimization algorithms for solving the min- max model, which find a globally e-optimal solution by iteratively cutting off the bounded polyhedral container shipment demand set with a cut. The latter algorithm overcomes non-convexity of the remaining feasible demand set generated by the former algorithm via a novel hyperplane cut. Each hyperplane cut can assure that the current vertex of the polyhedral demand set is cut off, whereas solutions that may improve the current one {{by more than a}} factor of e are retained. Extensive numerical experiments for problems larger than those encountered in real applications demonstrate the computational efficacy of the latter algorithm...|$|R

The best way to avoid any inconvenience when solving the predictive task of the <b>liner</b> <b>ships</b> is to use simulation taking into account both deterministic and stochastic processes arising from the operation of <b>liner</b> <b>ships.</b> The article describes a simulation model of a sea container line, for example, the company Fesco, working on a regular container line in St. Petersburg (Russia), using mathematical model and proposed model “follow the leader” to describe the movement of ships.

Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can obtain the optimal decision within a reasonable time (about 170 s) for various scales of problem instances (up to 30 ports) as well as various settings of probability distributions. In addition, some comparative experiments also show that the proposed optimal decision policy can save at least 8 % fuel consumption cost by comparing with some relatively simple rules and save about 1 % cost on average by comparing with some brilliantly-designed rules.

40|$|Abstract. The liner {{transport}} {{has brought}} enormous {{influence on the}} <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> company and the container port. The most obvious change is the arrival time of ships, which is restricted by the corresponding schedule timetables. Based on a hypothesis that ships reach port completely randomly, thus, the traditional queuing model is no longer suit for modern container terminal. Therefore, a new queuing model is suggested in this paper. And a simulation for the service system is also developed. Results of numerical examples show that the proposed queuing model is significant to the construction and operation of container terminals...|$|R

A mixed-integer nonlinear non-convex optimization model is first formulated to maximize the total profit of a ship route. In view of the problem structure, a branch-and-bound based holistic solution method is developed. It is rigorously demonstrated that this solution method can obtain an e-optimal solution in a finite number of iterations for general forms of transit-time-sensitive demand. Computational results based on a trans-Pacific <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> route demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the solution method...|$|R
