5|$|Due to this {{it often}} suffices to find {{representations}} of the <b>Lie</b> algebra. <b>Lie</b> algebras are much simpler objects than <b>Lie</b> groups to work with. Due {{to the fact that}} the <b>Lie</b> algebra is a finite-dimensional vector space, in the case of the Lorentz <b>Lie</b> algebra the dimension is , one need only find a finite number of representative matrices of the <b>Lie</b> algebra, one for each element of a basis of the <b>Lie</b> algebra as a vector space. The rest follow from extension by linearity, and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lie</b> {{was born}} in Buitenzorg (now Bogor), West Java, on 1 November 1853, the first child of seven born to <b>Lie</b> Hian Tjouw and his second wife Oey Tjiok Nio. The elder <b>Lie</b> had four {{children}} from a previous marriage, with <b>Lie</b> Kim Hok his first child from the new marriage. The well-to-do peranakan Chinese couple was living in Cianjur at the time but went to Buitenzorg, <b>Lie</b> Hian Tjouw's hometown, for the birth as they had family there. The family soon returned to Cianjur, where <b>Lie</b> Kim Hok was homeschooled in Chinese tradition and the local Sundanese culture and language. By age seven he could haltingly read Sundanese and Malay.|$|E

40|$|In 2 diary {{studies of}} <b>lying,</b> 77 college {{students}} reported telling 2 <b>lies</b> a day, and 70 community mem-bers told 1. Participants old more self-centered <b>lies</b> than other-oriented <b>lies,</b> except in dyads involv-ing only women, in which other-oriented <b>lies</b> were {{as common as}} self-centered ones. Participants told relatively more self-centered <b>lies</b> to men and relatively more other-oriented <b>lies</b> to women. Consistent with the view of <b>lying</b> as an everyday social interaction process, participants {{said that they did}} not regard their <b>lies</b> as serious and did not plan them much or worry about being caught. Still, social interactions inwhich <b>lies</b> were told were less pleasant and less intimate than those in which no <b>lies</b> were told. Although psychologists ofmany orientations have had much to say about <b>lying</b> (DePaulo, Stone, & Lassiter, 1985; Ford, King, & Hollender, 1988; Lewis & Saarni, 1993), the topic is hardly their exclusive domain.

5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used systematically, {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus <b>Lie</b> founded the study of <b>Lie</b> groups in 1884.|$|E

This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E

Gerhardsen had grown more and more frustrated at Lie's hard-line tactics against communists and perceived Soviet sympathisers, as well as his attempts to stifle foreign policy debate within the Central Committee. <b>Lie</b> on his part grew embittered over what he perceived was the Gerhardsen-couple protecting key leftists, such as Trygve Bull.

We also study two weak forms of dishonesty, bullshit and deception, and provide their logical features in contrast to <b>lying.</b> We finally argue dishonesty postulates that agents should try to satisfy for both moral and self-interested reasons...|$|R
