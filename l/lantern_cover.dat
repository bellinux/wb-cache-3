Doctor Gao (Gao-yisheng, Cui Zhigang), who is {{secretly}} having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's <b>lanterns</b> <b>covered</b> with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming {{the sequence of}} events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bed.|$|R
5000|$|Howard Purcell, whose early {{influences}} {{included the}} adventure comic strip artists Hal Foster and Alex Raymond, {{as well as}} illustrators Harvey Dunn and Dean Cornwell, took art classes at the Art Students League of New York. He worked as an animator in New York City studios before entering the comics industry, where his earliest known credit is National's Adventure Comics #53 (Aug. 1940), for which he wrote and drew the six-page feature [...] "Mark Lansing". The titular adventurer's exploits with subterranean races and other science fictiony conceits ran through issue #62. By that time Purcell had drawn the cover of All-American's All Star Comics #2 (Fall 1940) - reprinted as the cover of DC Comics' quirkily numbered, 2006 hardcover collection All Star Archives #0 - {{as well as the}} feature [...] "Lando, Man of Magic" [...] in World's Best Comics #1 (Spring 1941), and both the Green <b>Lantern</b> <b>cover</b> of, and the humorous adventure feature [...] "Red, White and Blue" [...] in, All-American Comics #25 (April 1941).|$|E

5000|$|In South Korea the {{birthday}} of Buddha is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th month in the Korean lunar calendar (as well as in Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam) and is an official holiday. This day is called [...] (Seokga tansinil), meaning [...] "Buddha's birthday" [...] or [...] (Bucheonim osin nal) meaning [...] "the day when the Buddha came". It has now grown {{into one of the}} nationâ€™s biggest cultural festivals. Lotus <b>lanterns</b> <b>cover</b> the entire temple throughout the month which are often flooded down the street.

5000|$|When {{news of this}} {{reached the}} Guardians, Chance was quickly {{recalled}} to Oa for judgement. The Guardians decided Chance would be subjected to rigorous training and a probationary period before {{he was allowed to}} continue serving with the Green Lantern Corps. Chance in turn threatened to simply quit if forced to play by their rules and pointed out his brutal approach was the first thing that had ever worked on Hellhole. The Guardians conceded they lacked a suitable alternative candidate to serve as Garnet's Green Lantern, and {{had no choice but to}} appoint Chance as Green Lantern of his planet. Chance and the Guardians brokered a deal whereby he was restricted to his planet (other <b>Lanterns</b> <b>covered</b> whole sectors). His deeds were also subject to reviews to ensure he was not using 'questionable methods'.|$|R
25|$|The lower {{floors are}} rusticated; the rusticated stone {{continues}} as quoining {{to the upper}} floors, contrasting with the smoother ashlar masonry. The stone balustrades of the tower gallery are supported by corbelling with modillion cornicing. The <b>lantern</b> is <b>covered</b> with a black zinc domed roof, while the light itself is enclosed.|$|R
60|$|Here the {{stranger}} paused before {{the trunk of}} a tree which stood between the city wall and himself, and drew from beneath his ragged cloak a small <b>lantern,</b> carefully <b>covered</b> with a piece of cloth, which he now removed, and holding the light high above his head, regarded the Goth with a steady and anxious scrutiny.|$|R
500|$|The best-known Belgian {{resistance}} action {{during the}} Holocaust was {{the attack on}} the 20th rail convoy to Auschwitz. In the evening of 19 April 1943, three poorly armed members of the resistance attacked the railway convoy as it passed near Haacht in Flemish Brabant. The train, containing over 1,600 Jews, was guarded by 16 Germans from the [...] Resistance members used a <b>lantern</b> <b>covered</b> with red paper (a danger signal) to stop the train, and freed 17 prisoners from one wagon before they were discovered by the Germans. A further 200 managed to jump from the train later in the journey, as the train's Belgian driver deliberately kept his speed low to allow others to escape. All three resistance members responsible for the attack were arrested {{before the end of the}} occupation. Youra Livchitz was executed and Jean Franklemon and Robert Maistriau were deported to concentration camps but survived the war.|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{made his}} way {{up to the top of}} the hill, threw himself down under some trees near the summit, and was soon fast asleep. When he awoke it was already dark. He lit his <b>lantern,</b> <b>covered</b> it up in his jacket, and took his station at the highest point. He had plenty to think about. Another twelve hours and he would be with friends! He had no reason to {{complain}} of the treatment he had received on board the privateer, but had he remained with her he might not have returned to France for a couple of years, and would then have had difficulty in crossing to England; beside, it was painful to him to be with men fighting against his country, and each prize taken instead of causing delight to him as to his comrades, would have been a source of pain.|$|R
50|$|The {{elaborate}} auditorium of {{the theatre}} is designed {{according to the}} atmospheric style which was popular in movie houses built in the 1920s. This style simulates an outdoor theater-going experience. The Coronado's auditorium walls are decorated with the facades of gilded Spanish and Italian-style buildings, and the ceiling looks like a deep blue sky filled with twinkling stars and floating clouds. The auditorium is full of gilded detail. Green stained-glass lamps with fluted bulbs adorn the walls. Japanese dragons and glowing <b>lanterns</b> <b>cover</b> the organ screens {{on either side of}} the stage. Seating is located on two levels, the main floor and a sizeable balcony. At the front of the theatre, in front and below the stage is an orchestra pit. Incorporated into the gilded sides of the interior of the theatre hall are several alcoves that resemble box seats along the sides, which can be accessed from the balcony level but usually do not have seats. All of the seats are covered with plush red velvet.|$|R
5000|$|... 1563 {{there was}} a new stone tower with 12 candlelight as source for light but already 1585 it was {{replaced}} with a <b>covered</b> <b>lantern</b> and from 1624 coal was used for light.|$|R
25|$|A dome (from Latin: domus) is an {{architectural}} element that resembles the hollow {{upper half of}} a sphere. The precise definition has {{been a matter of}} controversy. There are also a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them. A dome can rest upon a rotunda or drum, and can be supported by columns or piers that transition to the dome through squinches or pendentives. A <b>lantern</b> may <b>cover</b> an oculus and may itself have another dome.|$|R
5|$|Green Lantern {{is located}} in the Boardwalk section of the park. Green Lantern is the third roller coaster to occupy this plot of land, {{following}} the Sarajevo Bobsled (which ran at Great Adventure from 1984 to 1988 before moving to Six Flags Great America and Great Escape) and the Great American Scream Machine (an Arrow Dynamics looping coaster which had occupied this area from 1989 to 2010). Like the Great American Scream Machine, the infield of Green <b>Lantern</b> is <b>covered</b> with gravel. The coaster also reuses the Scream Machine's queue area building.|$|R

5000|$|By the 1920s it was {{determined}} the church building was {{too small for the}} growing congregation, so plans were made to replace it with the current structure. The present St. Mary of the Visitation Church was designed by C.I. Krajewski, an architect from Dubuque, Iowa. [...] He designed the building in the Late Gothic Revival style, which was popular at the time. The building features an asymmetrical facade with a corner bell tower. The exterior is constructed of blocks of Bedford limestone. The tower is crenellated across the top, and features finials on three of the corners and a copper <b>covered</b> <b>lantern</b> topped by a cross on the fourth.|$|R
50|$|The first {{performances}} at Caffe Cino were {{done on the}} cafÃ© floor. Eventually, Cino constructed a makeshift 8â€™ x 8â€™ stage from milk cartons and carpet remnants which was used for some productions. The limited space dictated a need for small casts and for minimal sets, usually built from scraps Cino found in the streets. Cino relied heavily on lighting designer Johnny Dodd, who lit the stage using electricity stolen from the city grid by Joe Cinoâ€™s lover, electrician Jon Torrey. The space made for intimacy between the performers and audience, with little room for typical fourth-wall illusionary theatre. Cino decorated the cafÃ© with fairy lights, mobiles, glitter dust, and Chinese <b>lanterns,</b> and he <b>covered</b> the walls with memorabilia and personal effects.|$|R
25|$|In England, a dome with a {{pyramidal}} {{roof and}} lantern at the Abbot's kitchen of Glastonbury Abbey {{dates to the}} early 14th century. Similar vaulting was built over the kitchen of Newenham Abbey by 1338. Timber star vaults such as those over York Minster's octagonal Chapter house (ca. 1286â€“1296) and the elongated octagon plan of Wells Cathedral's Lady Chapel (ca. 1320â€“1340) imitated much heavier stone vaulting. The wooden vaulting over the crossing of Ely Cathedral was built after the original crossing tower collapsed in 1322. It was conceived by Alan of Walsingham and designed by master carpenter William Hurley. Eight hammer vaults extend from eight piers over the 22 meter wide octagonal crossing and meet {{at the base of}} a large octagonal <b>lantern,</b> which is <b>covered</b> by a star vault.|$|R
50|$|Newburyport's {{front range}} light is a {{circular}} structure, with a steel plate exterior, that is 35 ft tall. Access is gained via a hatch-like curved door. The tower is {{topped by a}} ten-sided lantern house, surrounded by an iron balcony with railing. The windows of the <b>lantern</b> house are <b>covered</b> in wood. The light was constructed in 1873 on Bayley's Wharf, a short way west of its present location, along with the rear range light, which stands near Water Street. The light was converted from coal-based power to electricity in 1933, and automated in 1952. In about 1961 a 20 ft hexagonal extension was built to increase the tower's height; this has since been removed. The tower was moved to its present site in 1964, at which the Coast Guard station was built in 1972.|$|R
50|$|The lecture was {{delivered}} at the University of Cambridge on 13 June 1894. It was reported in The Times on the day following with mention {{of the use of}} <b>lantern</b> slides. It <b>covered</b> what it refers to the libraries of the Ancient Romans as being the precursors for the libraries of the Middle Ages and Renaissance period. Then stepping through the publication of the rule of St. Benedict, early in the sixth century, {{that by the end of}} the 11th century that Benedictine houses possessed two sets of booksâ€”(1) distributed among the brethren; (2) that were kept in some safe place, and recounts that the Durham Rites spoke of book-presses standing in the cloister against the walls. Then by the beginning of the 15th century the larger monasteries at least had accumulated many hundred volumes as the number of the books had naturally increased.|$|R
50|$|It is {{inferred}} {{that the}} temples are built in clusters known as tunks, as Jains undertake pilgrimage mostly on foot and hence {{they would like}} to reduce the distance of travel on foot to the minimum. As a religious practice they cover their mouth while offering puja to the tirthankaras at the temples so that they don't hurt any insects by swallowing them with an open mouth. Also, for this reason they do not offer open lighted lamps but offer aarti with <b>covered</b> <b>lanterns.</b> The religious practice also involves pilgrimage by fasting throughout the journey to and from the shrines. They also build their temples in white marble to demonstrate purity. Silence and prayers are {{the order of the day}} when one is climbing up the hills on pilgrimage. Fasting continues until they have returned to the auditorium of Anandji Kalyanji Trust at the foothill. Eating any food items when on the mountain(Giriraj) is considered to be a sin.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened the}} gate, and raising her skirts with both hands, {{stepped into the}} plantation. Her small, white-shod feet fell noiselessly upon the thick undergrowth; she reached the {{entrance}} of the shelter without making any sound. Cautiously she peeped in. Her eyes grew round with surprise, her bosom began rapidly to rise and fall. It was Macheson who lay there, fast asleep! He had fallen asleep evidently whilst reading. A book was lying by his side, and a <b>covered</b> <b>lantern</b> was burning by his left shoulder. He was dressed in trousers and shirt; the latter was open at the throat, showing its outline firm and white, and his regular breathing. She drew a step nearer, and leaned over him. Curiously enough, in sleep the boyishness of his face was less apparent. The straight, firm mouth, rigidly closed, was the mouth of a man; his limbs, in repose, seemed heavy, even massive, especially the bare arm upon which his head was resting. His shirt was old, but spotlessly clean; his socks were neatly darned in many places. He occupied nearly the whole of the shelter, in fact one foot was protruding through the opening. In the corner a looking-glass was hanging from a stick, and a few simple toilet articles were spread upon the ground.|$|R
