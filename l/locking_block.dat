25|$|The Beretta 92's open slide design ensures smooth {{feeding and}} {{ejection}} of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors {{due to the}} in-line travel of the barrel. This {{is in contrast to}} the complex travel of Browning designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.|$|E
25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the <b>locking</b> <b>block,</b> which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, {{the frame}} was further {{modified}} with an accessory rail (called the [...] "Universal Glock rail") {{to allow the}} mounting of laser sights, tactical lights, and other accessories. Thumb rests {{on both sides of}} the frame and finger grooves on the front strap were added. Glock pistols with these upgrades are informally referred to as (early) [...] "third-generation" [...] models. Later third-generation models additionally featured a modified extractor that serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> was enlarged, along with the addition of an extra cross pin to aid the distribution of bolt thrust forces exerted by the <b>locking</b> <b>block.</b> This cross pin is known as the <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> pin and is located above the trigger pin.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a <b>lock</b> <b>block</b> and a <b>lock</b> pin. The <b>lock</b> <b>block</b> has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The <b>lock</b> <b>block</b> includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the <b>lock</b> <b>block</b> serves to align and register the respective holes on the <b>lock</b> <b>block</b> and switch handle. A lock pin is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the <b>lock</b> <b>block</b> to the switch handle. Once the <b>lock</b> <b>block</b> and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the lock pin is installed, an apertured-end portion of the lock pin is in registration with another hole on the <b>lock</b> <b>block.</b> Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the lock pin from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R

2500|$|Due to the {{relatively}} low bolt thrust of the [...]380 ACP cartridge, the locked-breech design of the Glock 19 and Glock 26 was minimally modified for the Glock 25 and Glock 28 to implement unlocked breech operation. [...] It operates via straight blowback of the slide. This required modification of the locking surfaces on the barrel, {{as well as a}} redesign of the former <b>locking</b> <b>block.</b> [...] Unusual for a blowback design, the barrel is not fixed to the frame. [...] It moves rearward in recoil until it is tilted below the slide, similar to the standard locked-breech system. [...] The reduced size and mass of the Glock 42 required return to the Glock-standard locked-breech design.|$|E
2500|$|The Beretta 92 pistol {{evolved from}} earlier Beretta designs, {{most notably the}} M1923 and M1951. From the M1923 comes the open slide design, while the alloy frame and <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> barrel, {{originally}} from Walther P38, were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92's two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 [...]380 caliber Model 84. These improvements both involved the magazine, which featured direct feed; that is, there was no feed ramp between the magazine and the chamber (a Beretta innovation in pistols). In addition, the magazine was a [...] "double-stacked" [...] design, a feature originally introduced in 1935 on the Browning Hi-Power.|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 26 is a 9×19mm [...] "subcompact" [...] variant {{designed}} for concealed carry and {{was introduced in}} 1995, mainly for the civilian market. It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a [...] "shortened" [...] Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, <b>locking</b> <b>block,</b> and spring assembly that features a dual recoil spring.|$|E

2500|$|The Glock 17 is a 9 mm short recoil–operated, locked-breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The firearm's locking mechanism uses a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks into the ejection port cut-out in the slide. During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about [...] until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension {{at the base of}} the barrel then interacts with a tapered <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2017, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fifth generation" [...] or [...] "Gen5". The revisions centered on ergonomics and improving reliability. Many parts of fifth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The two fifth-generation models announced were the Glock 17 and Glock 19, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum. Some conspicuous changes on the fifth-generation models are: ambidextrous slide stop levers, nDLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) surface finish for barrel and slide, a barrel featuring conventional land-and-groove rifling (called the “Glock Marksman Barrel” by Glock) rather than the polygonal rifling used in earlier models, a deeper recessed barrel crown, omission of the finger grooves on the grip, a flared magazine well, and a reintroduction of a (half moon shaped) cutout on the bottom front of the grip. The <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> pin located above the trigger pin that was introduced in the third-generation is omitted. Many internal parts were less conspicuously revised.|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 19 is {{effectively}} a reduced-size Glock 17, called the [...] "Compact" [...] by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about [...] {{compared to the}} Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, {{the mass of the}} slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, <b>locking</b> <b>block,</b> recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19 iwb holster.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{variations}} and refinements {{of these}} major lock types exist, with respective variations of blocking behavior. If a first <b>lock</b> <b>blocks</b> another <b>lock,</b> the two locks are called incompatible; otherwise the locks are compatible.

2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a steel wedge or <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|E

50|$|The moving-barrel design {{mechanism}} operates {{by use of}} a wedge-shaped falling <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> {{underneath the}} breech. When the pistol is fired both the barrel and slide recoil for a short distance together, where the <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> drives down, disengaging the slide and arresting further rearward movement of the barrel. The slide however continues its rearward movement on the frame, ejecting the spent case and cocking the hammer before reaching the end of travel. Two return springs located {{on either side of}} the frame and below the slide, having been compressed by the slide's rearward movement, drive the slide forward, stripping a new round from the magazine, driving it into the breech and, in the process, re-engaging the barrel; ending its return travel with a fresh round chambered, hammer cocked and ready to repeat the process. The falling <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> design provides good accuracy due to the in-line travel of the barrel and slide.|$|E

50|$|The Model 1905 used a short recoil {{action with}} a tilting <b>locking</b> <b>block.</b> This was same {{principle}} Mannlicher {{used in his}} 1901 pistol-caliber carbine.

Although his company patented the design in 1905, Mannlicher's death in 1904 ended any further development of the design.|$|E
50|$|When the gun {{was ready}} to fire, a round {{would be in the}} chamber and the bolt and barrel group would be locked together, with the <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> {{at the rear of the}} bolt.

50|$|The {{precursors}} of Permissive Action Links {{were simple}} mechanical combination locks that were {{set into the}} control systems of nuclear weapons, such as the Minuteman ICBM. There they could perform different functions: some blocked the cavity through which the nuclear materials were shot to create a reaction; other <b>locks</b> <b>blocked</b> circuits; and some simply prevented access to the control panel.

50|$|Open Slide Design. The {{primary role}} of the open-top slide {{was to provide a}} 180° {{ejection}} port. Open top slide virtually eliminated jamming or stovepiping. The slide retention device, which caused the slide and barrel assembly to remain open after the last cartridge had been fired and ejected, allowed the user to load the chamber one cartridge at a time (emergency tactical loading) should the magazine be lost or damaged. The pistols were designed so that the extractor would not be damaged by direct chamber loading. These models operated on the short recoil, delayed <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> system, which yielded a faster cycle time.|$|E
50|$|The APX {{design is}} a major {{departure}} from the M9. The M9 uses a P38-style locked breech short recoil system, but {{this has not been}} carried over to the APX. The APX, instead, uses the system pioneered on the SIG Sauer P220; instead of a tilting <b>locking</b> <b>block,</b> as in the M9, the breech is now locked by the breech block being cammed into engagement with the slide, {{in the same manner as}} was first seen on the SIG Sauer P220. The core of the system is a stainless steel chassis which allows true modular reconfiguration.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} locking and {{unlocking}} the barrel differentiates the {{wide array of}} short recoil designs. Most common are the John Browning tilting barrel designs based on either the swinging link and locking lugs as used in the M1911 pistol or the linkless cam design used in the Hi Power and CZ 75. Other designs are the <b>locking</b> <b>block</b> design found in the Walther P38 and Beretta 92, rollers in the MG42, or a rotating barrel used in the Beretta 8000 and others. An unusual variant is the toggle bolt design of the Borchardt C-93 and its descendant, the Luger pistol.|$|E

However, most implementations of such locks suffer from two major problems [...] latency and scalability. In this paper, we propose an implementation of <b>blocking</b> <b>locks</b> using scheduler adaptation which exploits the interaction between thread schedulers and locks. By experimentation using wellknown multiprocessor applications on a KSR 2 multiprocessor, we demonstrate how such an implementation considerably reduces the latency and improves the scalability of <b>blocking</b> <b>locks...</b>|$|R
5000|$|As noted above, only case 4 {{describes}} a cycle in the (regular) conflict graph which affects serializability. Cases 1-3 describe cycles of locking based global deadlocks (at least one <b>lock</b> <b>blocking</b> exists). All cycle types are equally {{resolved by the}} atomic commitment protocol. Case 1 is the common Distributed SS2PL, utilized since the 1980s. However, no research article, except the CO articles, is known to notice this automatic locking global deadlock resolution as of 2009. Such global deadlocks typically have been dealt with by dedicated mechanisms.|$|R
30|$|A common {{method for}} {{avoiding}} data caches is an onchip memory called scratchpad memory, which is under program control. This program managed memory entails {{a more complicated}} programming model although it can be automatically partitioned [50, 51]. A similar approach for time-predictable caching is to <b>lock</b> cache <b>blocks.</b> The control of the cache locking [52] and the allocation of data in the scratchpad memory [53, 54] can be optimized for the WCET. A comparison between <b>locked</b> cache <b>blocks</b> and a scratchpad memory {{with respect to the}} WCET can be found in [55].|$|R
