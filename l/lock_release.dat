2500|$|The Rally-based Spirit liftbacks were {{available}} in two sports versions, the standard [...] "Rally AMX" [...] and the high performance [...] "Rally GT" [...] in their first year. Both versions came standard with a Transmission Technologies Corporation (Tremec) 176-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage, power brakes with front disks and rear drums, power steering, front and rear sway bars, heavy-duty shock absorbers and springs, seven-bladed flexible cooling fan, tinted windshield, leather-wrapped three-arm sports steering wheel, tachometer, center console with armrest and [...] "Rallye" [...] gauges plus rear ashtray, reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, split-back rear seat, three-point retractable seatbelts, woodgrain panels on dashboard, full light group (hood, courtesy, ashtray, glove box) except reading dome light, blacked-out dual remote-controlled mirrors and VAM-designed aluminum grille with a central [...] "Rally" [...] emblem. The Rally AMX had the standard [...] I6 using a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio, while the Rally GT came with the high-performance [...] version of this VAM engine and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The heavy duty cooling system consisting of fan shroud and coolant recovery tank was optional on the AMX and standard on the GT, some units of this version came with a clutch fan instead of the regular belt-type. The Rally AMX was the [...] "base model" [...] {{of the line and}} the Rally GT was closer to the European tradition of performance cars with its analog tachometer (instead of the AMX's digital tach), while convenience items such as air conditioning or automatic transmission were not available. The GT model also included a rear spoiler with electric liftgate <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> and eight-spoke steel wheels (which were optional on the AMX). The AMX came with VAM's own design five-spoke wheels with trim rings and blacked-out volcano hubcaps. The marketing effort by VAM's sales department had most GT units be equipped from the factory with all the options originally intended to be extra cost, such as rear defroster, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, and AM FM stereo radio aside from the already mentioned steel wheels and rear spoiler. These items were all optional on the AMX.|$|E

50|$|Swordmakers in Toledo, Spain, {{developed}} {{a market in}} the 1920s for gold plated automatic leverlock knives with pearl handles and enamel inlaid blades. Italian knifemakers had their own style of knives including both pushbutton and leverlock styles, some bearing design characteristics similar to the early French Châtellerault knife. Prior to World War II, hand crafted automatic knives marked Campobasso or Frosolone were often called Flat Guards because of the two-piece top bolster design. Some Italian switchblades incorporated a bayonet-type blade equipped with a blade <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> activated by picking a lever at the hinge end, and were known as picklocks. These were later supplanted by newer designs which incorporated the blade <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> into a tilting bolster, which released a spearpoint or bayonet-style blade.|$|E

50|$|A <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> can be {{considered}} as a type of release synchronization. Assume a loop operation is concerned as the code shown to the right. Two threads intend to enter a critical section and read the most recent value of a, then exit the critical section. The code shows that thread 0 first acquires the lock and enters the critical section. In order to execute correctly, P1 must read the latest value of ‘a’ written by P0. In that case, only one thread can be in the critical section at a time. Therefore, the synchronization itself has ensured that the successful lock acquisition at P1 occurs after <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> by P0. Besides, the S2 -> S3 ordering has to be ensured, since the P0 must propagate the new value of ‘a’ to P1. For the same reason, S5 must occur after S4.|$|E
50|$|Array Based Queuing Lock is an {{extension}} to ticket lock algorithm which ensures that on a <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> only one processor attempts to acquire the lock resulting in {{decrease in the number}} of cache misses. This can be achieved by having all the processors spin on unique memory locations. One analogy used to explain the lock mechanism is the relay race where the athlete passes on the baton to the next athlete in queue which ensures that only one athlete acquires the baton.|$|E
50|$|SS2PL Vs. S2PL: Both provide Serializability and Strictness. Since S2PL is a super {{class of}} SS2PL it may, in principle, provide more {{concurrency}}. However, no concurrency advantage is typically practically noticed (exactly same locking exists for both, with practically not much earlier <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> for S2PL), and the overhead {{of dealing with}} an end-of-phase-1 mechanism in S2PL, separate from transaction-end, is not justified. Also, while SS2PL provides Commitment ordering, S2PL does not. This explains the preference of SS2PL over S2PL.|$|E

5000|$|Developed by Bosch in 1975 for hammer drills, the SDS System uses an SDS Shank {{which is}} a {{cylindrical}} shank with indentations to be held by the chuck. [...] A tool is inserted into the chuck by pressing in, and is locked in place until a separate <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> is used. The rotary force is supplied through wedges that fit into two or three open grooves.

5000|$|Mutual {{blocking}} between transactions {{results in}} a deadlock, where execution of these transactions is stalled, and no completion can be reached. Thus deadlocks need to be resolved to complete these transactions' execution and release related computing resources. A deadlock {{is a reflection of}} a potential cycle in the precedence graph, that would occur without the blocking when conflicts are materialized. A deadlock is resolved by aborting a transaction involved with such potential cycle, and breaking the cycle. It is often detected using a wait-for graph (a graph of conflicts blocked by locks from being materialized; it can be also defined as the graph of non-materialized conflicts; conflicts not materialized are not reflected in the precedence graph and do not affect serializability), which indicates which transaction is [...] "waiting for" [...] <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> by which transaction, and a cycle means a deadlock.

50|$|These safeties, {{similar to}} grip safeties, are de-activated {{as a natural}} {{consequence}} of the shooter firing the firearm, but are engaged in most other circumstances. The trigger is composed of two interdependent parts, and the shooter in firing the firearm manipulates both parts of the trigger. Conversely, unintentional pressure or a strike against the trigger is unlikely to do so, and such an action will not fire the firearm. Such a design, made popular by Glock pistols but originally used in the 1897 Iver Johnson Second Model Safety Hammerless revolver, incorporates a trigger with a spring-loaded lever in its lower half. This lever which protrudes from the trigger face must be fully depressed in order to disengage a lock that allows the main trigger body to move. Unintentional pressure against {{the top of the}} trigger without pressing the lever does not disengage the lock and the trigger will not move. Other designs include a spring-loaded pad that forms the upper portion of the trigger face and manipulates a similar lock. This design has more moving parts, but is advantageous in that accidental pressure on the <b>lock</b> <b>release</b> has reduced leverage thus requiring more force to pull the main trigger, where force against the lower portion does not release the lock and will not move the trigger.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft <b>locking</b> and <b>releasing</b> mechanism. A <b>locking</b> and <b>releasing</b> mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge flap and <b>locking</b> and <b>releasing</b> mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade.

The outcome of the modification was determined by whether or not the client would be able to independently doff the prostheses, if the patient was satisfied with the prostheses and by the condition of the components at the three-month follow-up. The client was independently successful at doffing both prostheses following the modification procedure. The patient expressed satisfaction with operation of the release mechanism but cosmetic covering was an issue. Components were optimally functioning at the three month follow-up. It was concluded that this procedure is a viable option for relocating distomedial release lock buttons more proximally when reach is limited.
