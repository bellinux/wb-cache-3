40|$|Sex Discrimination Ordinance (SDO) for {{organizations}} {{within the}} area of employment relationship was inevitable and it may bring a sequential issue to the organizations. Numerous literature {{has pointed out that}} having an effective planned policy {{is the best way to}} deal with the sex discrimination problem. This can help maintain a fair view of employment and improve efficiency in recruiting the most suitable person for the banks. The objective of this study is to examine if <b>license</b> d <b>banks</b> in Hong Kong have done enough to combat sex discrimination problems in their working environment. According to the questionnaire to the Human Resources Managers as well as another questionnaire to the staff of <b>licensed</b> <b>banks</b> in Hong Kong, we found that most of the <b>licensed</b> <b>banks</b> in Hong Kong had not made enough efforts on dealing with this issue. They had not yet realized the important of taking a proactive approach to prevent the problem because they were still not familiar with its negative impacts. There were quite passive in responding to this new challenge. Even those <b>licensed</b> <b>banks</b> which had already established their sex discrimination policies could not demonstrate good practice in dealing with this problems. There were many apparent defects in their sex discrimination policy regarding the completeness of contents and the implementation of the policy. <b>Licensed</b> <b>banks</b> are advised to pay close attention to the issue and establish an appropriate sex discrimination policy. We have finally put forward our recommendations in four aspects to help <b>licensed</b> <b>banks</b> formulate an effective sex discrimination policy. They are: (1) Support from top management, (2) Written sex discrimination policy in recruitment and selection process, (3) Investigation of sex discrimination policy, (4) Training and education...|$|R
