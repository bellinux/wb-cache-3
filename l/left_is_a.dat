5|$|Homer and Bart {{separate}} from Marge and Lisa and attend a sumo match. When a wrestler steals Homer's pretzel, he and Bart knock him out, {{then when the}} Emperor of Japan, Akihito, congratulates Homer, he throws him into a dumpster of worn mawashi. As a result, he and Bart are put in jail until Marge pays the bail. Consequently, the only money the family has <b>left</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> one-million yen bill, which Lisa loses in the wind after Homer created an origami crane from it.|$|E
5|$|Monument 11 {{is located}} in the southwestern area of Terrace3, to the east of Structure8. It is a natural boulder carved with a {{vertical}} series of five hieroglyphs.

On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror.|$|E

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{interpreted}} as featuring various figures from Norse mythology. The bottom portion of {{the west side of}} the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure.

5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in a recess. A door from the cell leads to a half-cell which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling.

The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the <b>left</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E

5|$|The {{arms were}} {{confirmed}} by the College of Arms on 19 June 1948, {{and at the same}} time the crest (a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannonball) was granted. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to Poole Borough Council. In 1976, the council received the grant of supporters for the coat of arms. The supporters refer to important charters given to the town; to the <b>left</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> gold lion holding a long sword representing William Longespee who in 1248 granted the town's first charter; on the right is a dragon derived from the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I who granted Poole county corporate status in 1568. The Latin motto – Ad Morem Villae De Poole, means: According to the Custom of the Town of Poole, and derives from the Great Charter of 1568.|$|E

25|$|In {{the image}} above, on the <b>left</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{modified}} nucleoside with an iodine (the iodine is added via electrophilic halogenation) {{in the fifth}} carbon in the pyrimidine ring.

The product on the right is then used to in molecular biology in RNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{closely related}} {{manifold}} {{is the real}} projective plane. If a circular disk is {{cut out of the}} real projective plane, what is <b>left</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Möbius strip. Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, the result is the projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.|$|E
