5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, <b>latent</b> TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the <b>latent</b> infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E
5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the <b>latent</b> state. <b>Latent</b> serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric <b>latent</b> state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the <b>latent</b> state.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a <b>latent</b> infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these <b>latent</b> cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium tetroxide exposes <b>latent</b> {{fingerprints}} by reacting on {{contact with}} fatty oils or fats with sebaceous contaminants and producing brown/black ruthenium dioxide pigment.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{stressed}} serpin fold is high-energy, mutations {{can cause}} them to incorrectly change into their lower-energy conformations (e.g. relaxed or <b>latent)</b> before they have correctly performed their inhibitory role.|$|E
5|$|Sthiti (the {{duration}} of the karmic bond) – The karmic bond remains <b>latent</b> and bound to the consciousness up to the time it is activated. Although <b>latent</b> karma {{does not affect the}} soul directly, its existence limits the spiritual growth of the soul. Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such karma is bound before it matures.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with <b>latent</b> TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of <b>latent</b> TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour {{and shape of}} the leaves, as can Nematodes. Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common <b>latent</b> virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus <b>latent</b> virus (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
5|$|Christine Chism distinguishes racist or racialist {{elements}} in Tolkien's views and works as falling into three categories: intentional racism, unconscious Eurocentric bias, and an evolution from <b>latent</b> racism in Tolkien's early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies {{in his late}} work.|$|E
5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone {{begins to}} tilt {{back into the}} colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source {{converts}} from the release of <b>latent</b> heat from condensation (from thunderstorms near the center) to baroclinic processes. The low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold-core system.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{physician}} Pieter Pel {{first proposed}} a tissue {{stage of the}} malaria parasite in 1886, presaging its discovery by over 50 years. This suggestion was reiterated in 1893 when Golgi suggested that the parasites might have an undiscovered tissue phase (this time in endothelial cells). Pel in 1896 supported Golgi's <b>latent</b> phase theory.|$|E
5|$|<b>Latent</b> {{schizophrenia}} (F21.1), schizophrenic reaction (F21.2), pseudoneurotic schizophrenia (F21.3), pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia (F21.4), “symptom-depleted” schizophrenia (F21.5) {{are in the}} Russian {{version of}} the ICD-10. They are {{in the category of}} “schizotypal” disorder in section F21 of chapter V.|$|E
5|$|Many of Weber's works famous {{today were}} collected, revised and {{published}} posthumously. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C. Wright Mills. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, teleological perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a <b>latent</b> conservatism.|$|E
5|$|Several viruses {{are known}} to infect the plant, {{including}} seed-borne strawberry <b>latent</b> ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leafcurl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus. The latter causes clearing or yellowing of {{the areas of the}} leaf immediately beside the veins, the appearance of ochre mosaic spots, and crinkling of the leaves in infected plants.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is <b>latent</b> and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with herpes viruses.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} also under <b>latent</b> danger of {{attack by the}} Venetians. For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to {{preserve}} their city-republic by skillful maneuvering between East and West. A strategic treaty with Turkey protracted Ragusa’s liberty and maintained {{the opportunity for a}} major trading role between the Ottoman Empire and Europe.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{may also}} express <b>latent</b> dissent in {{response}} to functional and other-focused dissent-triggering. They determine to use <b>latent</b> instead of articulate when they believe that management is not receptive to employee dissent. This indicates that individuals would use articulate dissent if they feel those channels are not available and accessible. <b>Latent</b> dissent is also used in protective dissent–triggering events.|$|E
25|$|The 3-dimensional {{structure}} of native antithrombin was first determined in 1994. Unexpectedly the protein crystallized as a heterodimer composed of one molecule of native antithrombin and one molecule of <b>latent</b> antithrombin. <b>Latent</b> antithrombin on formation immediately links to a molecule of native antithrombin {{to form the}} heterodimer, {{and it is not}} until the concentration of <b>latent</b> antithrombin exceeds 50% of the total antithrombin that it can be detected analytically. Not only is the <b>latent</b> form of antithrombin inactive against its target coagulation proteases, but its dimerisation with an otherwise active native antithrombin molecule also results in the native molecules inactivation. The physiological impact of the loss of antithrombin activity either through <b>latent</b> antithrombin formation or through subsequent dimer formation is exacerbated by the preference for dimerisation to occur between heparin activated β-antithrombin and <b>latent</b> antithrombin as opposed to α-antithrombin.|$|E
25|$|Kassing (2001) {{found that}} {{articulated}} and <b>latent</b> dissenters were perceived differently. People perceived articulated dissenters {{to be more}} satisfied, more committed, possess higher quality relationships with their supervisors, and seen as employees who believed they have influence within their organizations than <b>latent</b> dissenters. Furthermore, articulated dissenters, compared to <b>latent</b> dissenters, were perceived to be less verbally aggressive.|$|E
25|$|For {{diagnosing}} <b>latent</b> TB, three systematic {{reviews of}} IGRAs concluded the tests noted excellent specificity for the tests to distinguish <b>latent</b> TB from prior vaccination.|$|E
25|$|Anomalies in <b>latent</b> {{inhibition}} {{have been}} linked with schizophrenia in acute events. in <b>latent</b> inhibition, frequent presentation of a stimulus reduces {{the rate at which}} the stimulus produces meaning.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>latent</b> {{infections are}} common.|$|E
25|$|During film {{development}} the <b>latent</b> {{image is}} intensified by {{addition of a}} chemical, typically hydroquinone, that selectivity reduces those grains which contain atoms of silver. The process, which is sensitive to temperature and concentration, will completely reduce grains to silver metal, intensifying the <b>latent</b> image {{on the order of}} 1010 to 1011. This step demonstrates the advantage and superiority of silver halides over other systems: the <b>latent</b> image, which takes only milliseconds to form and is invisible, is sufficient to produce a full image from it.|$|E
25|$|All five {{conditions}} must be met. If {{one or more}} of {{the conditions}} are not met the person is ineligible for nationality by this particular means under the recent changes to the option procedure affecting the <b>latent</b> Dutch. Residency in the Netherlands is not an eligibility requirement for <b>latent</b> Dutch applicants.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the word}} <b>latent</b> means hidden or invisible, in modern usage for {{forensic}} science the term <b>latent</b> prints means any chance or accidental impression left by friction ridge skin on a surface, {{regardless of whether}} it is visible or invisible at the time of deposition. Electronic, chemical and physical processing techniques permit visualization of invisible <b>latent</b> print residues whether they are from natural sweat on the skin or from a contaminant such as motor oil, blood, ink, paint or some other form of dirt. The different types of fingerprint patterns, such as arch, loop and whorl, will be described below.|$|E

25|$|Up to 90% of {{the genetic}} {{carriers}} of the more common, dominantly inherited acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria) have been noted in DNA tests to be <b>latent</b> for classic symptoms and may require DNA or enzyme testing. The exception to this may be <b>latent</b> post-puberty genetic carriers of hereditary coproporphyria.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} types of dissent: articulated, <b>latent,</b> and {{displaced}} (Kassing, 1998).|$|E
25|$|<b>Latent</b> image: {{when viewed}} at eye level, {{the image of}} “BM” becomes visible.|$|E
25|$|Extensions and generalizations to {{the method}} {{have also been}} developed, such as the {{extended}} Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter which work on nonlinear systems. The underlying model is a Bayesian model similar to a hidden Markov model except that the state space of the <b>latent</b> variables is continuous and all <b>latent</b> and observed variables have Gaussian distributions.|$|E

25|$|The {{period between}} {{exposure}} to methylmercury {{and the appearance}} of symptoms in adult poisoning cases is long. The longest recorded <b>latent</b> period is five months after a single exposure, in the Dartmouth case (see History); other <b>latent</b> periods in the range of weeks to months have also been reported. No explanation for this long <b>latent</b> period is known. When the first symptom appears, typically paresthesia (a tingling or numbness in the skin), it is followed rapidly by more severe effects, sometimes ending in coma and death. The toxic damage appears to be determined by the peak value of mercury, not the length of the exposure.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin {{begins in}} its native state, {{which has a}} higher free energy {{compared}} to the <b>latent</b> state, which it decays to on average after 3 days. The <b>latent</b> state has the same form as the activated state - that is, when it is inhibiting thrombin. As such it {{is a classic example}} of the utility of kinetic vs thermodynamic control of protein folding.|$|E
