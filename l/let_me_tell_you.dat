5|$|There {{seems to}} prevail the opinion in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

If money's to be the measurer, man, and the {{accountants}} have computed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] quoth Little John testily, at {{the same}} time rising carefully, as though his bones had been made of glass, [...] "I can help myself, good fellow, without thy aid; and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> {{had it not been for}} that vile cowskin cap of thine, it would have been ill for thee this day." ...|$|R
60|$|Don Felix [kneeling]. Here at thy feet, dear Nina. Nay, do {{not turn}} away, but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> {{of the love}} that hath grown within my heart.

25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story {{in her own}} words, in the literal sense that she can use only the words she is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of {{events leading up to}} {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
500|$|St. Leger took {{advantage}} of his victory to deliver another demand for the fort's surrender, which Gansevoort also rejected. The next day St. Leger sent in a third surrender demand, which included (false) news that Burgoyne was in Albany as well as threats that the Indians would be permitted to massacre the garrison and destroy the Mohawk valley communities from which the garrison was drawn. [...] In an eloquent refusal, Lieutenant Colonel Willett responded, [...] "By your uniform you are British officers. Therefore <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the message you have brought is a degrading one for a British officer to send and by no means reputable for a British officer to carry." ...|$|E
500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea," [...] quoth Robin, [...] "but this salt {{is of an}} odd kind, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> for it {{can only}} be gotten by boiling down a quart of moonbeams in a wooden platter, and then one hath but a pinch. But <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> now, thou witty man, what hast thou gotten there in that pouch by thy side and in that pottle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And who {{art thou}} dost so boldly check a fair song?" [...] quoth the Tinker, {{stopping}} in his singing. [...] "Halloa, shine own self, whether thou be good friend or no. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> thou stout fellow, gin thou {{be a good}} friend it were well for us both; but gin thou be no good friend it were ill for thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, when he {{had done}} speaking, Robin {{stretched}} {{out his hand and}} grasped the Knight's palm. Quoth he in a trembling voice, [...] "I owe thee a debt I can never hope to repay, Sir Richard, for <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> I would rather lose my right hand than have such ill befall young David of Doncaster as seemed like to come upon him at Denby." ...|$|R
500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E
500|$|She made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War. [...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
6000|$|Robin Hood {{looked up}} and he looked down, biting his nether lip. Quoth he, [...] "Thou cunning Friar, thou hast me fair and fast enow. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> that not one of thy cloth hath so hoodwinked me {{in all my life}} before. I might have known from thy looks that thou wert no such holy man as thou didst pretend to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 4. It {{is partly}} by {{the virtue of}} Christ's intercession that the elect are brought in. There are many that are to come to Christ which are not yet brought in to Christ: {{and it is one}} part of His work to pray for their {{salvation}} too--"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe," [...] though as yet they do not believe [...] "on Me," [...] but that they may believe [...] "through their word" [...] (John 17:20). And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> soul, for thy comfort, who art a-coming to Christ, panting and sighing, as if thy heart would break, I <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> soul, thou wouldst never have come to Christ, if He had not first, by the virtue of His blood and intercession, sent into thy heart an earnest desire after Christ; and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> also, that it is His business to make intercession for thee, not only that thou mightest come in, but that thou mightest be preserved when thou art come in (Compare Heb 7:25; Rom 8:33-39).|$|R
6000|$|... "Then give me thy hand, Allan," [...] cried Robin, [...] "and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> I {{swear by}} the bright hair of Saint AElfrida {{that this time}} two days hence Ellen a Dale shall be thy wife. I will seek this same Friar of Fountain Abbey {{tomorrow}} day, and I warrant I will get upon the soft side of him, even if I have to drub one soft." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1925, Szigeti met Leopold Stokowski {{and played}} the Bach Chaconne in D minor for him. Less than two weeks later, Szigeti {{received}} a telegram from Stokowski’s manager in Philadelphia inviting him to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra later that year: it was his American debut. Szigeti had never played with an American orchestra before, nor heard one, and later he wrote of suffering stage fright. He was {{taken aback by the}} American concert scene, and the way that its publicity and popularity driven agents and managers determined much of what was heard in American concert halls. He believed they were not interested in works by the great masters, but preferred the popular light salon pieces he had left behind in his prodigy days. (To the end of his life, Szigeti loved to quote one memorable, cigar-chewing impresario who told him, with regard to Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, [...] "Well, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Mister Dzigedy—and I know what I’m talking about—your Krewtzer Sonata bores the pants off my audiences!") ...|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take notice, friend," [...] he said hoarsely, [...] "that I'll {{not bear}} thine impudence. Thou mayest go and bully {{the old woman}} at the cottage when I am absent--Oh! I've heard thee!" [...] he added with {{unbridled}} savagery, [...] "ordering her about {{as if she were}} thy serving wench ... but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> that she is no servant of thine, nor I ... so have done, my fine prince ... dost understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right," [...] she said. [...] "So I'll just {{resolve that}} I will say 'no' if I don't {{want to say}} 'yes.' That really amounts to the same thing, you know. Thank {{you so much for}} <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all about it. It must have bored you terribly, but it has done me so much good. I feel quite calm and {{rational}} now, and can go home and behave myself. Goodbye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, {{you might}} learn to lay aside this scorn of Soldanrie, when you hold so high of a Scot," [...] said the King. [...] "I hold Saladin to be truer {{to his word}} than this William of Scotland, who must needs be called a Lion, forsooth; he hath foully faulted towards me in failing to send the {{auxiliary}} aid he promised. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> Edith, thou mayest live to prefer a true Turk to a false Scot." ...|$|R
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E

So now I prithee ask thy boon that I may have the pleasure of granting it to thee." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{stated that}} the National Party members were as upset about Biko's murder as were blacks; [...] "The white {{community}} was thoroughly upset, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> The nationalists themselves were very upset." ...|$|E
