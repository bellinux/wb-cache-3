5|$|The {{armistice}} {{that ended}} World War I was signed on 11November 1918. The next day, all Spruce Production Division logging ended, most construction projects were stopped, and sawmill operations were curtailed. Government {{machinery and equipment}} {{from all over the}} Northwest was shipped back to Vancouver Barracks, and division personnel were quickly discharged from military service. Over $12million worth of <b>logging</b> <b>equipment,</b> sawmill machinery, and other property was eventually sold in a government auction.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, the Collier {{brothers}} donated {{a collection}} of antique <b>logging</b> <b>equipment</b> to be displayed as an outdoor logging museum on the park grounds. The equipment shows {{the evolution of the}} logging industry from axes and oxen to diesel tractors and logging trucks. The museum also highlights the role railroads played in developing the timber industry. Alfred Collier continued to add to the collection until his death in 1988.

30|$|Saltwater {{intrusion}} into aquifer units of freshwater has decreased the potability {{of water in}} coastal regions which necessitates the use of wireline geophysical <b>logging</b> <b>equipments</b> to delineate polluted zones and locate freshwater aquiferous layer of which acquisition of such data is expensive (Fligg and Rodrigues 1981; Keys 1990). The applicability of geophysical borehole logging in saltwater intrusion studies is brought about by its ability in lithologic differentiation, identification of salt–freshwater interface and place or places to be screened for freshwater abstraction in wells during well development.|$|R

As a result, Collier Memorial State Park has an excellent museum with a world-class collection of <b>logging</b> <b>equipment</b> and artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Another use {{for nuclear}} {{magnetic}} resonance is data acquisition in the petroleum industry for petroleum and natural gas exploration and recovery. Initial research in this domain began in the 1950s, however, the first commercial instruments were not released until the early 1990s. A borehole is drilled into rock and sedimentary strata into which {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} <b>logging</b> <b>equipment</b> is lowered. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of these boreholes is used to measure rock porosity, estimate permeability from pore size distribution and identify pore fluids (water, oil and gas). These instruments are typically low field NMR spectrometers.|$|E

500|$|In September 1999 the {{remnants}} of Hurricane Floyd caused massive damage to the park, temporarily closing it and downing thousands of trees. The DCNR hired Carson Helicopters to salvage timber from the downed beech, cherry, maple, and oak trees for $994,000; a crew of 36workers spent several months cutting the fallen trees into manageable logs, then helicopters flew the logs to the Hayfield area of the park. The salvage operation ran until the fall of 2001, and yielded [...] of lumber. The operation had revenue of almost $7million, and had the ecological advantage of not requiring heavy <b>logging</b> <b>equipment</b> or new roads in the park.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Meperidine is a {{synthetic}} opioid analog that is frequently prescribed for acute pain management. Normeperidine, the only active metabolite of meperidine, is neurotoxic {{and can cause}} significant central nervous system adverse events. Case summary: A 29 -year-old woman (height, 170 cm; weight, 85 kg) presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department, Istanbul, Turkey, complaining of low back pain she described as “stabbing. ” Physical examination revealed impaired lower-extremity mobility and normal vital-sign findings. There {{was no evidence of}} foot drop, head or other trauma, and systemic physical examination was unremarkable. Other common causes (eg, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, pancreatitis, trauma) of lower back pain were excluded. To achieve analgesia, meperidine 80 mg was administered intravenously in 100 mL of isotonic saline solution for 20 minutes. Within 20 minutes,analgesia was achieved,but the patient developed retrograde amnesia, becoming disoriented to time, location, and persons. Her speech slowed and perceptional changes developed. After the onset of amnesia, a complete physical examination was conducted. It failed to reveal focal neurologic deficit,and laboratory (sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, bilirubin, hemoglobin,and platelet count) and subsequent vital-sign findings (blood pressure, 150 / 100 mm Hg; heart rate, 100 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; body temperature, 37 ଌ and pulse oximetry, 99 %) were within the normal range. Noncontrast computed tomography did not reveal any abnormality. Initially, the patient's condition was attributed to medication error due to incorrect dosage or infusion rate. Despite a review of medication <b>logs,</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the vital-sign record, the etiology for the phenomenon could not be identified. Meperidine was discontinued and oxygen and intravenous isotonic saline solution were initiated as supportive treatment. Three hours after meperidine administration was discontinued, the amnesia and disorientation spontaneously resolved. Conclusion: Meperidine was probably associated with reversible amnesia in this healthy patient after a single therapeutic dose...|$|R
