40|$|This study quantifies the {{effectiveness}} of current European car driver restraint systems in frontal crashes, notably steering wheel mounted airbags and seat belts (some pretensioned) compared to the previous generation of vehicles fitted with standard <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagonal</b> seat <b>belts</b> alone. This data is then used to analyse and predict the potential effectiveness in terms of injury mitigation of future adaptive restraints for frontal impacts only. Adaptive restraint sytems {{were found to be}} likely to provide upto 41 % and 25 % reductions in MAIS 2 + and MAIS 3 + injury respectively, when compared with the previous generation of vehicles with seat belted drivers only. The study presents a method to predict the potential benefits of a change in vehicle restraint technology based on the UK’s current injury car crash population. However, the project does not specify the technical criteria or details of such a future adaptive restraint system...|$|R
40|$|Results of the swov-accident {{investigation}} {{prove that}} {{if there are any}} differences in the effectiveness of <b>lap</b> belts <b>and</b> three-point belts, these are so small that they cannot form a basis for giving preference to one type over the other. Furthermore, in spite of the results of this investigation which show some disadvantageous effects of <b>diagonal</b> <b>belts</b> (as compared to <b>lap</b> belts <b>and</b> three-point belts), involving a higher injury risk, which leads to the conclusion that general use of this type should not be favoured, a complete comdemnation of <b>diagonal</b> <b>belts</b> seems exaggerated. The effectiveness percentages of both <b>lap</b> belts <b>and</b> three-point belts show independently very high values. It is justifiable to draw the conclusion that both <b>lap</b> belts <b>and</b> three-point belts are highly effective measures for safety in traffic.

40|$|Some {{researches}} {{have shown}} that critical phenomena {{on the use of}} FRP sheets as external reinforcement is debounding between the FRP sheet and concrete. This research was done to investigate the effect of <b>Diagonal</b> GFRP <b>belt</b> on failure behavior and flexural strength of reinforced concrete beam with additional 1 layer of GFRP sheet. The test was done on reinforced concrete beam specimens with dimension of 150 x 200 x 2500 mm on 2 simple support and were loaded using 2 point concentrated loads at 975. 5 mm from the supports. Specimens were made in 4 group, without the addition of layers of GFRP beams, beams with the addition of one layer of GFRP without the belt and with the addition of 1 layer of GFRP beams with <b>Diagonal</b> GFRP <b>belt.</b> Each group consists of 2 specimens. The data observed during the test are cracking loads, crack patterns, crack widths, ultimate load capacities, deflections and failure modes. The results showed that with the addition of GFRP <b>Diagonal</b> <b>belt</b> can change the mode of failure of the release of the bond between GFRP and concrete for beams with the addition of one layer of GFRP without belts to break GFRP sheets to the beams with <b>Diagonal</b> GFRP <b>belt.</b> Use of GFRP <b>Diagonal</b> <b>belt</b> can also improve the bending strength of reinforced concrete beams. When it is compared with the control beam (without the addition of GFRP sheet) for beam bending capacity with the addition of 1 layer of GFRP without a belt, to increase the load by 122 %, while for the beam with the addition of 1 ply GFRP GFRP <b>Diagonal</b> <b>belt</b> by 141, 5 %...|$|R

40|$|The FRP sheet {{has been}} applied in many fields of civil {{engineering}} structures. The study on the application has been spread out involving of precast concrete structures, such as the application on the connection of beam and column of precast concrete structures. Since {{the strength of the}} CFRP sheet is depend on the bonding capacity, it is necessary to apply a vertical U-wrap belt on the main sheet to increase its bonding strength. However, it was reported that the vertical U-wrap belt may cause a prematurely rupture on the fibers of main CFRP sheet. Therefor, the <b>diagonal</b> U-wrap <b>belt</b> was considered to avoid premature rupture. This paper presents the effect of the <b>diagonal</b> U-wrap <b>belt</b> on the moment capacity of the connection system using CFRP sheet on the beam-column join of precast concrete. A series of specimens with parameter of CFRP sheet belts patterns was prepared. The specimens were subjected by one point load on the beam to create a moment at the connection. Results indicated that the applying of <b>diagonal</b> U-wrap <b>belt</b> on the connection system using CFRP sheet on the beam-column join may avoid a premature rupture of fibers.
