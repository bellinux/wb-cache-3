5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the <b>ligament</b> which bears his name. His work on the rare and vestigial <b>Ligament</b> of Struthers came to the {{attention}} of Charles Darwin, who used it in his Descent of Man to help argue the case that man and other mammals shared a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the pulp}} and {{periodontal}} <b>ligament</b> have nociceptors (pain receptors), but the pulp lacks proprioceptors (motion or position receptors) and mechanoreceptors (mechanical pressure receptors). Consequently, pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex {{tends to be}} poorly localized, whereas pain from the periodontal <b>ligament</b> will typically be well localized, although not always.|$|E
5|$|During a Whipple's procedure, {{commonly}} used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the pancreas, duodenum, {{and part of the}} jejunum, the <b>ligament</b> of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved. When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the <b>ligament.</b>|$|E
50|$|The uterosacral <b>ligaments</b> (or recto-uterine <b>ligaments)</b> {{belong to}} the major <b>ligaments</b> of uterus.|$|R
50|$|Capsular <b>ligaments</b> {{are part}} of the {{articular}} capsule that surrounds synovial joints. They act as mechanical reinforcements. Extra-capsular <b>ligaments</b> join together in harmony with the other <b>ligaments</b> and provide joint stability. Intra-capsular <b>ligaments,</b> which are much less common, also provide stability but permit a far larger range of motion. Cruciate <b>ligaments</b> are paired <b>ligaments</b> {{in the form of a}} cross.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ligaments</b> of malleus {{are three}} <b>ligaments</b> that attach the malleus {{in the middle}} ear. They are the anterior, lateral and {{superior}} <b>ligaments.</b>|$|R
5|$|As a side note, {{research}} indicates that women have a significantly higher likelihood of anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> injuries in the pre-ovulatory stage, than post-ovulatory stage.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009–10 season, Berger played {{just two}} league matches before {{undergoing}} more knee surgery. On 6 January 2010 {{he announced his}} retirement after failing to recover from a <b>ligament</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning {{there are}} two nerves, {{one on the left}} and one {{on the right side of}} the body. Each is formed as three roots {{immediately}} converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous <b>ligament</b> and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord, and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous <b>ligament.</b> The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves, with the primary contribution coming from the fourth.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{relation}} between their insertions {{on the sides of}} the metacarpal head and the axis of rotation in the joint, the collateral <b>ligaments</b> are taut in flexion but lax in extension, while the accessory collateral <b>ligaments</b> are lax in flexion but taut in extension.The collateral <b>ligaments</b> are lengthened 3-4 mm when the joint flexes 0-80° while the accessory collateral <b>ligaments</b> are shortened 1-2 mm. During hyperextension the accessory <b>ligaments</b> are lengthened while the proper <b>ligaments</b> are shortened.As a result, the joint is stable during full flexion while the relaxed collateral <b>ligaments</b> allows lateral and rotation movements during extension.|$|R
40|$|Following dissection, {{the spinal}} <b>ligaments</b> were {{observed}} in a selection of bipedal, pseudobipedal and quadrupedal animals during a search for an appropriate animal model for investigating the innervation of these <b>ligaments.</b> Midline spinal <b>ligaments</b> were found in all animals while lateral spinal <b>ligaments</b> could only be observed in bipedal (human) and pseudobipedal (avian) species. The presence of lateral spinal <b>ligaments</b> in these animals and their absence in quadrupeds suggests {{that the development of}} the lateral <b>ligaments</b> reflects a mechanical challenge unique to the erect spine and that these lateral spinal <b>ligaments</b> are fundamental to the stability of an erect posture...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ligaments</b> {{may also}} {{restrict}} some actions: movements such as hyper extension and hyper flexion are restricted by <b>ligaments</b> to an extent. Also <b>ligaments</b> prevent certain directional movement.|$|R
5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a <b>ligament</b> composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the <b>ligament</b> may be internal or external in position. The main function of the <b>ligament</b> (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
5|$|At age 17, Morgan {{was called}} up to the United States under-20 women's {{national}} soccer team. While playing in a scrimmage against the men's junior national team, she endured an anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> (ACL) injury and did not play for the team again until April 2008.|$|E
5|$|Dunsmore {{was one of}} two Northwestern true freshmen to {{play for}} the 2007 Northwestern Wildcats. He had a pair of 35-yard receptions against Duke on September 15, 2007. He was named to the 2007 Sporting News Big Ten All-Freshman Team. Dunsmore redshirted for the 2008 Big Ten Conference {{football}} season after injuring his anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> on the fifth day of practice during his sophomore year.|$|E
30|$|As {{the fetus}} {{has not been}} able to bend the knees, the {{collateral}} <b>ligaments</b> are short, and the cruciate <b>ligaments</b> will not have developed correctly. In severe cases there are no cruciate <b>ligaments,</b> the collateral <b>ligaments</b> are very short, and the tibial plateau is luxated anteriorly [14, 15].|$|R
5000|$|Many {{important}} <b>ligaments</b> {{attach to}} the coccyx: the anterior and posterior sacrococcygeal <b>ligaments</b> are the continuations of the anterior and posterior longitudinal <b>ligaments</b> that stretches along the entire spine. [...] Additionally, the lateral sacrococcygeal <b>ligaments</b> complete the foramina for the last sacral nerve. [...] And, lastly, some fibers of the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous <b>ligaments</b> (arising from {{the spine of the}} ischium and the ischial tuberosity respectively) also {{attach to the}} coccyx.|$|R

5|$|Eligible for salary arbitration, Nova and the Yankees {{agreed on}} a $3.3million salary for the 2014 season. He was removed from his April 19 start with an elbow injury, which was {{diagnosed}} as a partially torn ulnar collateral <b>ligament</b> and required Tommy John surgery, ending Nova's season. He had a 2–2 record and a 8.47 ERA in four starts before the surgery.|$|E
5|$|Feldman {{underwent}} reconstructive elbow {{surgery for}} a torn ulnar collateral <b>ligament</b> in October 2003. In his four appearances in 2004 for the Arizona League Rangers in the Arizona League, he pitched seven scoreless innings. He began the 2005 {{season with the}} Single-A Bakersfield Blaze, but after nine scoreless innings in relief was quickly promoted to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders.|$|E
5|$|Fowler's {{performance}} in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an anterior cruciate (knee) <b>ligament</b> injury that {{kept him out of}} action for half the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup. During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence.|$|E
5000|$|Suspensory <b>ligaments</b> of breast, {{also known}} as Cooper's <b>ligaments</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The uterus {{contains}} three suspensory <b>ligaments</b> {{that help}} stabilize {{the position of}} the uterus and limits its range of movement. The uterosacral <b>ligaments</b> keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The round <b>ligaments</b> restrict posterior movement of the uterus. The cardinal <b>ligaments</b> also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus.|$|R
25|$|Suspensory <b>ligaments.</b> The {{subcutaneous}} {{layer of}} adipose {{tissue in the}} breast is traversed with thin suspensory <b>ligaments</b> (Cooper's <b>ligaments)</b> that extend obliquely to the skin surface, and from the skin to the deep pectoral fascia. The structural stability provided by the Cooper's <b>ligaments</b> derives from its closely packed bundles of collagen fibers oriented in parallel; the principal, ligament-component cell is the fibroblast, interspersed throughout the parallel collagen-fiber bundles of the shoulder, axilla, and thorax <b>ligaments.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2006–07, Torres {{recorded}} 15 {{goals and}} 34 points. The Oilers did not, however, {{qualify for the}} playoffs. In the off-season, they re-signed him to a three-year, $6.75 million deal. The following season, he missed the last 49 games of the campaign to an anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> injury. Limited to 32 contests, he recorded 11 points.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, just a {{week after}} {{suffering}} a cruciate <b>ligament</b> injury with Real Madrid, Jesé had to be rescued when a suspected gas explosion {{set fire to the}} luxury apartment block in which he was staying at the time.|$|E
5|$|In all molluscs, {{the mantle}} forms a thin {{membrane}} {{that covers the}} animal's body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes. In bivalves, the mantle lobes secrete the valves, and the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of <b>ligament,</b> byssus threads (where present), and teeth.|$|E
