40|$|Mypaper {{examines}} {{the public health}} consequences of the regulatory subsidy given to <b>light</b> <b>trucks.</b> The empirical challenge is to disentangle the causal effects of <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> from the selection bias that may occur due to drivers sorting into different vehicle types depending on their unobservable characteristics. Iaddress this by using state variation of snow depth as an instrumental variable for vehicle miles traveled of <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> and cars. This instrument has strong first-stage explanatory power. Since snow depth is likely a direct determinant of crashes,Imeet the exclusion criteria by restricting the dependent variable to those crashes {{that occurred in the}} summer. Myfindings suggest that, given a crash, <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> are more dangerous to others but less dangerous for those driving them. However,Ialso find that <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> are more likely to crash than cars, which neutralizes the safety advantage to those who drive them. Myestimates for aggregate fatalities suggest that a world of <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> leads to substantially more fatalities than a world of cars. ...|$|R
