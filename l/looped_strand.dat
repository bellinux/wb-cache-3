40|$|We model a coronal loop as {{a bundle}} of seven {{separate}} strands or filaments. Each of the <b>loop</b> <b>strands</b> used in this model can independently be heated (near their left footpoints) by Alfvén/ion-cyclotron waves via wave-particle interactions. The Alfvén waves are assumed to penetrate the strands from their footpoints, at which we consider different wave energy inputs. As a result, the <b>loop</b> <b>strands</b> can have different heating profiles, and the differential heating {{can lead to a}} varying cross-field temperature in the total coronal loop. The simulation of TRACE observations by means of this loop model implies two uniform temperatures along the loop length, one inferred from the 171 : 195 filter ratio and the other from the 171 : 284 ratio. The reproduced flat temperature profiles are consistent with those inferred from the observed EUV coronal loops. According to our model, the flat temperature profile is a consequence of the coronal loop consisting of filaments, which have different temperatures but almost similar emission measures in the cross-field direction. Furthermore, when we assume certain errors in the simulated loop emissions (e. g., due to photometric uncertainties in the TRACE filters) and use the triple-filter analysis, our simulated loop conditions become consistent with those of an isothermal plasma. This implies that the use of TRACE/EIT triple filters for observation of a warm coronal loop may not help in determining whether the cross-field isothermal assumption is satisfied or not...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the dynamic {{properties}} of unknotted ring polymers at high densities is investigated. We hypothesise an unusual type of glass transition which is purely {{attributed to the}} topological constraints between the penetrating rings. A mean-field model is developed to describe the strongly constrained ring polymers as ideal lattice trees. Equilibrium properties can be derived {{within the framework of}} statistical thermodynamics using an argument based on structural recurrence. Here each ring {{can be seen as a}} linear object|as a <b>loop</b> <b>strand</b> with branching protrusions. The ring polymers were simplified as <b>loop</b> <b>strands</b> without any branching. We focused on the constraints emerging from the circular topology, and the polymer dynamics was simulated using a Monte Carlo technique. The degree of inter-ring penetrations essentially controls the slowing of dynamics and represents a universal parameter for the glass transition. The penetrating rings form a percolating network involving reversible quasi-topological entanglements. As such, the stress relaxation of each ring is prolonged by the coupled penetrations which have limited pathways to release constraints from one another. The simulation data suggest the existence of a glassy material exclusively formed by the topological constraints associated with the circular structure. In order to test the picture of topological glass, the uorescence-labelled circular DNA was used to observe its self-diffusion in the entangled state. The experimental method has demonstrated its potential for the future investigation of the dynamics of entangled ring polymers despite the fact that it failed to provide evidence of the glassy state in our experiment.

40|$|The bulk {{of solar}} coronal {{radiative}} loss consists of soft X-ray emission from quasi-static loops at the cores of Active Regions. In {{order to develop}} diagnostics for determining the heating mechanism of these loops from observations by coronal imaging instruments, I have developed analytical solutions for the temperature structure and scaling laws of <b>loop</b> <b>strands</b> {{for a set of}} temperature and pressure dependent heating functions that encompass heating concentrated at the footpoints, uniform heating, and heating concentrated at the loop apex. Key results are that the temperature profile depends only weakly on the heating distribution – not sufficiently to be of significant diagnostic value – and that the scaling laws survive for this wide range of heating distributions, but with the constant of proportionality in the RTV scaling law (P 0 L ∼ T 3 max) depending on the specific heating function. Furthermore, quasi-static solutions do not exist for an excessive concentration of heating near the loop footpoints, a result in agreement with recent numerical simulations. It is demonstrated that a generalization of the results to a set of solutions for strands with a functionally prescribed variable diameter leads to only relatively small correction factors in the scaling laws and temperature profiles for constant diameter <b>loop</b> <b>strands.</b> A quintet of leading theoretical coronal heating mechanisms is shown to be captured by the formalism of this paper, and the differences in thermal structure between them may be verified through observations.

Aims. Analysis of persistent kink displacements of the loop seen in different bandpasses that correspond to different temperatures of the plasma allows sub-resolution structuring of the loop to be revealed. Methods. A vertically oriented slit is taken at the loop top, and time-distance maps are made from it. Loop displacements in time-distance maps are automatically tracked with the Gaussian fitting technique and fitted with a sinusoidal function that is “guessed”.

The <b>loop</b> <b>strands</b> are found to oscillate with the periods ranging between 3 and 15 min.

40|$|Sequence repeats constituting the {{telomeric}} {{regions of}} chromosomes {{are known to}} adopt a variety of unusual structures, consisting of a G tetraplex stem and short stretches of thymines or thymines and adenines forming loops over the stem. Detailed model building and molecular mechanics studies {{have been carried out}} for these telomeric sequences to elucidate different types of loop orientations and possible conformations of thymines in the loop. The model building studies indicate that a minimum of two thymines have to be interspersed between guanine stretches to form folded-back structures with <b>loops</b> across adjacent <b>strands</b> in a G tetraplex (both over the small as well as large groove), while the minimum number of thymines required to build a loop across the diagonal strands in a G tetraplex is three. For two repeat sequences, these hairpins, resulting from different types of folding, can dimerize in three distinct ways i. e., with <b>loops</b> across adjacent <b>strands</b> and on same side, with <b>loops</b> across adjacent <b>strands</b> and on opposite sides, and with <b>loops</b> across diagonal <b>strands</b> and on opposite sides to form hairpin dimer structures. Energy minimization studies indicate that all possible hairpin dimers have very similar total energy values, though different structures are stabilized by different types of interactions. When the two loops are on the same side, in the hairpin dimer structures of $d(G_ 4 T_nG_ 4) $, the thymines form favorably stacked tetrads in the loop region and there is interloop hydrogen bonding involving two hydrogen bonds for each thymine-thymine pair. Our molecular mechanics calculations on various folded-back as well as parallel tetraplex structures of these telomeric sequences provide a theoretical rationale for the experimentally observed feature that the presence of intervening thymine stretches stabilizes folded-back structures, while isolated stretches of guanines adopt a parallel tetraplex structure. 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is two-fold: to {{increase}} the number of examples of observed longitudinal oscillations in coronal loops and to find evidence of the small temporal and spatial scales of these loop oscillations. Increasing the number of observed longitudinal oscillations allows for improvement in the statistics of the measured parameters, providing more accurate values for numerical and theoretical models. Furthermore, the small temporal and spatial scales of these loop oscillations could give indication of a driving force, symptomatic of coupling with the global p-modes. We found evidence that individual <b>loop</b> <b>strands</b> of wide coronal loop footpoints oscillate independently for short time periods. These strands have a diameter of the order of a few Mm, and the timescales on which the oscillations exist are typically less than an hour. We suggest that this is indicative of the oscillating strands being driven by the leakage of the global 5 min p-modes up into the corona, as simulated by De Pontieu et al. (2005, ApJ, 624, L 61).
