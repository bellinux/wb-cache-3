The TA (TL) {{is based on an}} ensemble of 7 - 9 high-performance Agilent- 5071 A cesium clocks. The weight of each clock was set to be proportional to the inverse exponential with the index of each clock’s frequency deviation. We removed the long-term frequency drift of each clock and then weighted the residual fluctuations, in order that the frequency drift of our time scale not change too rapidly when we add or remove one clock from the ensemble. A mechanism was also developed to convert the virtual paper clock into physical output. Through this mechanism, the phase difference between the paper clock and the physical output can always be kept to within 250 picoseconds. The stability of TA (TL) is about 3 × 10 - 15 (τ = 30 days vs. UTC); here, the average stability of the cesium clocks in ensemble is about 1 × 10 - 14. We estimate this time scale to have an accuracy of 10 ns/month, and it’s quite good enough to be TL’s local coordinated time scale, UTC (TL) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the atomic configuration of metallic glasses is a long-standing problem in materials science and solid-state physics(1, 2). So far, only average structural information derived from diffraction and spectroscopic methods has been obtained. Although various atomic models have been proposed in the past fifty years(3 - 8), a direct observation of the <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> structure in disordered materials has not been achieved. Here we report <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> configurations of a metallic glass investigated by nanobeam electron diffraction combined with ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Distinct diffraction patterns from individual atomic clusters and their assemblies, which have been theoretically predicted as short- and medium-range order(6 - 8), can be experimentally observed.

40|$|Hole-doped perovskites such as La 1 -xCaxMnO 3 present special {{magnetic}} and magnetotransport properties, and it {{is commonly}} accepted that the <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> structure around Mn ions {{plays a crucial role}} in determining these peculiar features. Therefore experimental techniques directly probing the <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> structure, like x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), have been widely exploited to deeply understand the physics of these compounds. Quantitative XAS analysis usually concerns the extended region [extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) ] of the absorption spectra. The near-edge region [x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) ] of XAS spectra can provide detailed complementary information on the electronic structure and <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> topology around the absorber. However, the complexity of the XANES analysis usually prevents a quantitative understanding of the data. This work exploits the recently developed MXAN code to achieve a quantitative structural refinement of the Mn K-edge XANES of LaMnO 3 and CaMnO 3 compounds; they are the end compounds of the doped manganite series LaxCa 1 -xMnO 3. The results derived from the EXAFS and XANES analyses are in good agreement, demonstrating that a quantitative picture of the local structure can be obtained from XANES in these crystalline compounds. Moreover, the quantitative XANES analysis provides topological information not directly achievable from EXAFS data analysis. This work demonstrates that combining the analysis of extended and near-edge regions of Mn K-edge XAS spectra could provide a complete and accurate description of Mn <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> environment in these compounds...|$|R

The temperature dependence of the Knight shift reveals that certain <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> motion decreases rapidly below a crossover temperature Tc down to the glass transition temperature Tg. Above Tc as well as below Tg the mean-squared amplitude of local motions depends linearly on the temperature. The observed gradual transition below Tc is inconsistent with heterogeneity effects.

Structural analyses and theoretical calculations together indicate that the origin of the enhanced activity could be attributed to the tailored electronic structure by means of the <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> structure modulations. We anticipate that suitable structure modulations might be applied on other transition metal oxides to meet the optimal thermodynamic and kinetic requirements, which may pave the way to unlock the potential of other promising candidates as cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in industry.

The <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> order around Zr and Cu atoms was investigated.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{characterization of}} proteins {{is crucial to}} understand protein function. From a microscopic point of view, protein dynamics is governed by the <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> interactions that, in turn, trigger the functional conformational changes. Unfortunately, the relationship between <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> fluctuations and global protein rearrangements is still elusive. Here, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with complex network analysis show that fast peptide relaxations effectively build {{the backbone of the}} global free-energy landscape, providing a connection between <b>local</b> and global <b>atomic</b> rearrangements. A minimum-spanning-tree representation, built on the base of transition gradients networks, results in a high resolution mapping of the system dynamics and thermodynamics without requiring any a priori knowledge of the relevant degrees of freedom. These results suggest the presence of a local mechanism for the high communication efficiency generally observed in complex systems. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|MoleCoolQt is a {{molecule}} viewer for charge-density research. Features include the visualization of <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> coordinate systems in multipole refinements {{based on the}} Hansen and Coppens formalism as implemented, for example, in the XD suite. Residual peaks and holes from XDfft are translated so that they appear close to the nearest atom of the asymmetric unit. Critical points from a topological analysis of the charge density can also be visualized. As in the program MolIso, color-mapped isosurfaces can be generated with a simple interface. Apart from its visualization features the program interactively helps in assigning <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> coordinate systems and local symmetry, which can be automatically detected and altered. Dummy atoms – as sometimes required for <b>local</b> <b>atomic</b> coordinate systems – are calculated on demand; XD system files are updated after changes. When using the invariom database, potential scattering factor assignment problems can be resolved {{by the use of}} an interactive dialog. The following file formats are supported: XD, MoPro, SHELX, GAUSSIAN (com, FChk, cube), CIF and PDB. MoleCoolQt is written in C++ using the Qt 4 library, has a user-friendly graphical user interface, and is available for several flavors of Linux, Windows and MacOS. 1...|$|R
