40|$|Since its {{judicial}} {{creation in}} the 1970 s, strong controversy has surrounded the practice <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> merchandising. Trademark scholars have generally opposed merchandising rights {{because of the}} departure from the traditional interpretation <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> law—protecting consumers and market competition—in favor of a direct protection <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> value. Despite this opposition, courts and Congress have favored the acceptance of this practice by broadening the scope <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> protection and by introducing the concept of confusion as to the products’ “sponsorship” or “affiliation” {{as part of the}} standard for trademark infringement. Not surprisingly, trademark scholars have criticized these developments but have not offered, so far, a solution that is responsive to the changes that have affected the role of marks in the past decades. This Article fills this gap and, contrary to the position of the majority of scholars, advocates in favor of providing legal protection to trademark merchandising under the current rule <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> law. Specifically, this Article accepts that in the modern economy the concept of commercial source can also include products’ sponsorship and affiliation as indicated by the courts and accepted by the legislature. Based upon this premise, this Article recognizes that the use <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> on promotional products that are offered for sale can legitimately serve the traditional distinctive function <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> and indicate to the public the origin of the marked products, at least in terms <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> owners’ sponsorship or affiliation. Contrary to common criticism, this recognition of merchandising marks as legitimate source indicators would not negatively affect competition in the market or consumers. Instead, it would finally provide a clear guideline in this important area of the law and subject trademark merchandising to the general rules for the acquisition and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> rights as well as to existing trademark defenses and fair uses...|$|R

40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{uniqueness}} <b>of</b> all <b>trademarks</b> registered is very important. With ever increasing number <b>of</b> registered <b>trademarks,</b> this {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult. A system for search and registration <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> is presented in this paper. Trademarks are complex patterns consisting of various image and text patterns, called devicemark and word-in-mark respectively. Traditionally, only text part {{has been used for}} search and retrieval of such patterns. This was largely due to the diversity and complexity of image patterns occurring in trademarks. The System for Trademark Archival and Registration (STAR) presented here, uses features based on image as well as text components <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> and brings out the conflicting trademarks for the consideration <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> officer. Thus, it simplifies the task <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> office to a great extent. A structural representation consisting of image, graphics, text, and phonetics has been proposed to handle the diversity and complexity <b>of</b> <b>trademarks.</b> Based on this structural representation, an object-oriented database schema, a sophisticated segmentation technique, a composite similarity measure for searching conflicting trademarks, and an indexing scheme have been developed. Initial results are very promising. More testing is in progress...|$|R

The following chapter describes the concepts <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> and legal sources. The law <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> is divided into a three level jurisdictional system - international, European and domestic law. The chapter also discusses the division <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> and describes their function. The conclusion of the chapter {{is devoted to the}} reasons for the refusal <b>of</b> registration <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> - namely absolute and relative. The third chapter focuses on the ways how trademark law is established. The establishment <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> is fundamentally based on the principle of registration. The exception is well known trademarks, which enjoy legal protection despite not being registered. The chapter is divided into three parts dealing with the registration procedure at the domestic, European and international level.

Today, the rights arising from the trademarks increasingly cover large portion of activities going beyond the mere misrepresentation of goods and services.

In this comparative study, we will contrast European and Japanese approach to the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> use, i. e. doctrine that decides whether the trademark laws extend rights to regulate a particular use of a sign prior to any considerations of confusion or unfair advantage. Evolution {{of the law in}} the two countries illustratively shows the gradual departure from origins <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> protection, still persisting in Japan, to more advanced, but not necessarily better, systems of protection in the European Union.
