They applied and were {{accepted into the}} Atlantic Container Line in December 1966, joining with the founding companies Wallenius Lines, Swedish American Line, Swedish Transatlantic Line and Holland America Line. Cunard joined {{at the same time}} as Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (French Line). Cunard inherited planning work and ship designs when they joined with Atlantic Container <b>Line</b> <b>group,</b> and as part of their application to join, Cunard would build two ships for the ACL fleet, the SS Atlantic Causeway and the SS Atlantic Conveyor. The SS Atlantic Conveyor would, in 1982, become the first British merchant ship to be lost to enemy action since World War II, after being requisitioned for use in the Falklands War.|$|E

25|$|The {{design and}} {{maintenance}} procedures of all systems involved methods {{to avoid that}} subscribers experienced undue changes {{in the quality of}} the service or that they noticed failures. A variety of tools referred to as make-busys were plugged into electromechanical switch elements upon failure and during repairs. A make-busy identified the part being worked on as in-use, causing the switching logic to route around it. A similar tool was called a TD tool. Delinquent subscribers had their service temporarily denied (TDed). This was effected by plugging a tool into the subscriber's office equipment on Crossbar systems or <b>line</b> <b>group</b> in step-by-step switches.

25|$|Other {{well-known}} vase {{painters of}} the time are the Painter of the Vatican Mourner, The Princeton Painter, the Painter of Munich 1410 and the Swing Painter (540-520 BC), to whom many vases are attributed. He is {{not considered to be}} a very good artist, but his figures are unintentionally humorous because of the figures with their large heads, strange noses and frequently clenched fists. The work of the Rycroft Painter bears a resemblance to red-figure vase painting and the new forms of expression. He liked to depict Dionysian scenes, horses and chariots, and the adventures of Heracles. He often uses outline drawings. The approximately 50 usually large-size vessels attributed to him are elegantly painted. The Class of C.M. 218 primarily decorated variations of the Nikosthenic amphoras. The Hypobibazon Class worked with a new type of belly amphora with rounded handles and feet, whose decoration is characterized by a key meander above the image fields. A smaller variant of neck amphora was decorated by the Three <b>Line</b> <b>Group.</b> The Perizoma Group adopted around 520 BC the newly introduced form of the stamnos. Toward the end of the century, high quality productions were still being produced by the Euphiletos Painter, the Madrid Painter and the imaginative Priam Painter.|$|E
25|$|Hunting-Clan Air Transport was {{a wholly}} private, British {{independent}} airline that {{was founded in}} the immediate post-World War II period. It began trading on January 1, 1946 as Hunting Air Travel Ltd. It was {{a subsidiary of the}} Hunting Group of companies, which had come from the shipping industry and could trace its history back to the 19th century. The newly formed airline's first operating base was at Bovingdon Airport in Southeast England. Its main activities were contract, scheduled and non-scheduled domestic and international air services that were initially operated with Douglas Dakota and Vickers Viking piston airliners from the company's Bovingdon base. A change of name to Hunting Air Transport occurred in 1951. By that time, the airline had {{emerged as one of the}} healthiest and most securely financed independent airlines in Britain. In October 1953, the firm's name changed to Hunting-Clan Air Transport, as a result of an agreement between the Hunting Group and the Clan <b>Line</b> <b>group</b> of companies to invest £500,000 each in a new company named Hunting-Clan Air Holdings Ltd, the holding company for the combined group's air transport interests. Apart from Hunting-Clan Air Transport itself, this included Field Aircraft Services Ltd, the Hunting group's aircraft maintenance arm. In 1960, Hunting-Clan Air Transport merged with the Airwork group to form British United Airways (BUA).|$|E

Now days different approaches like countours based, Image binarization and enhancement based, Gradient based and colour reduction based techniques {{can be used for}} the text detection from natural scenes. In this paper the combination of morphological operations with structure based partitioning and grouping is used for efficient string detection from any natural scene images. A new framework based on image partition and connected components grouping is used to locate text regions embedded in those images. These described techniques are based on sibling’s method i. e. adjacent character grouping method and Text <b>line</b> <b>grouping</b> method. Text <b>line</b> <b>grouping</b> method can locate text strings situated at arbitrary orientations. In adjacent character grouping detected string is represented by a rectangle while in text <b>line</b> <b>grouping</b> detected string is represented by fitted line. Described techniques can find text strings by using structure-based partition and grouping methods...|$|R
