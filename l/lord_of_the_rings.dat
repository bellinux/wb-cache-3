5|$|Tolkien went on {{to criticize}} the script scene by scene ("yet one more scene of screams and rather {{meaningless}} slashings"). He was not implacably opposed {{to the idea of}} a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of The Hobbit and The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings</b> to United Artists in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings</b> was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S. Beagle. It covered only the first half of the story of The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings.</b> In 1977, an animated musical television film of The Hobbit was made by Rankin-Bass, and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film The Return of the King, which covered some of the portions of The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings</b> that Bakshi was unable to complete.|$|E

5|$|Consistent {{accounts}} of Saruman's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings,</b> {{first published in}} The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, {{is one of five}} 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth circa two thousand years before the beginning of The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings.</b> They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict. Tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels. Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings,</b> after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search.|$|E
