50|$|Many of the Confederate {{guerrillas in}} {{northern}} Alabama were detached cavalry units {{that were used}} to great advantage in protecting the home front, as opposed to serving in the main army. The primary mission of the pro-Confederate guerrillas was to attempt to keep intact the Confederate social and political order. They assisted the war effort in their own backyards by hunting down and arresting Unionists, conscripts, and deserters. In addition, they terrorized Unionists by destroying their property and threatening their families. Confederate guerillas were made up of four types of fighters - the first half of these were under Confederate supervision, being either detached cavalry or enlisted men fighting close to home. The other units either fought disguised as noncombatants or were simply outlaws looking <b>for</b> <b>blood-letting</b> opportunities. These men were not under Confederate control and were as interested in profit as helping the Southern cause.|$|R
5000|$|Bloodletting {{gradually}} {{declined in}} popularity {{over the course}} of the 19th century, becoming rather uncommon in most places, before its validity was thoroughly debated. In the medical community of Edinburgh, bloodletting was abandoned in practice before it was challenged in theory, a contradiction highlighted by physician-physiologist John Hughes Bennett. Authorities such as Austin Flint I, Hiram Corson, and William Osler became prominent supporters of bloodletting in the 1880s and onwards, disputing Bennett's premise that bloodletting had fallen into disuse because it didn't work. These advocates framed bloodletting as an orthodox medical practice, to be used in spite of its general unpopularity. Some physicians considered bloodletting useful for a more limited range of purposes, such as to [...] "clear out" [...] infected or weakened blood or its ability to [...] "cause hæmorrhages to cease"—as evidenced in a call for a [...] "fair trial <b>for</b> <b>blood-letting</b> as a remedy" [...] in 1871.|$|R

Certainly Parsons worked closely with Davis in 1910 on the windows for St Anseln church (seven <b>lancets</b> <b>for</b> the Holy Spirit chapel) and Holy Trinity in St Andrew’s Fife (a five-light Crucifixion window). It was Davis who had introduced Parsons to Robert Lorimer.|$|R
5000|$|Liebig was {{acclaimed}} in The <b>Lancet</b> <b>for</b> revealing [...] "the true {{principles of}} cookery", and physicians promoted [...] "rational diets" [...] {{based on his}} ideas. Well-known British cookery writer Eliza Acton responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her Modern Cookery for Private Families, and subtitling the edition accordingly. Liebig's idea that [...] "searing meat seals in the juices", though still widely believed, is not true.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Catherine and Reginald Hamlin {{answered}} {{an advertisement}} in the The <b>Lancet</b> <b>for</b> an obstetrician and gynaecologist {{to establish a}} midwifery school at the Princess Tsehay Hospital in Addis Ababa. They arrived in Addis Ababa in 1959 on a three-year contract with the Ethiopian government but only about 10 midwives had been trained before the government closed the midwifery school. The Hamlins had never seen an obstetric fistula before and, seeing many cases arrive at the school, decided to create a dedicated hospital.|$|R
2500|$|Chapman {{was born}} in the village of Nagórna, (now part of Koło), in the Warsaw Governorate of Congress Poland. [...] According to a {{certificate}} found in his personal effects after his arrest, he was apprenticed at age 14 to a senior surgeon, Moshko (Mosze) Rappaport, in Zwoleń, whom he assisted in procedures such as the application of leeches <b>for</b> <b>blood-letting.</b> [...] He then enrolled on a course in practical surgery at the Warsaw Praga Hospital. [...] This course was very brief, lasting from October 1885 to January 1886 (attested to by another certificate in his possession) but he continued to serve as a nurse, or doctor's assistant in Warsaw until December 1886. [...] He later left Poland for London, though the time he arrived at London has never been reliably ascertained. Witness testimony at his trial seems to indicate that he emigrated to London in 1888. During his stay in the East End he had married a young Polish girl, Lucie Badewski in 1889 and had two children with her and soon afterwards was confronted because of this by his original Polish wife.|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas was {{apparently}} {{born in the}} Norfolk (UK) port town of King's Lynn (then [...] "Bishop's Lynn"), possibly as early as 1330, although the confirmed details of his career suggest that a date closer to 1360 is more likely. According to early 16th century literary historian John Bale, he became a Carmelite friar {{and moved to the}} university town of Oxford, where he developed a great reputation for his scientific work. In 1386, {{at the request of the}} powerful lord John of Gaunt, he published a Kalendarium of detailed astronomical tables covering the years 1387-1462. It survives in sixteen manuscripts and one printed edition. [...] Designed for use in the astrologically-based science of the time, the tables were very sophisticated, even including rules for synchronising medical treatment with astronomical cycles, such as the right phases of the moon <b>for</b> <b>blood-letting.</b> His contemporary Geoffrey Chaucer wrote very approvingly of Nicholas' work, and made much use of it. [...] Nicholas was also supposedly an excellent musician. Later in life he moved to Cambridge, where he was promoted to subdeacon in 1410 and to deacon in 1411. The date of his death is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|Becoming {{increasing}} {{involved with}} HIV/AIDS, {{he realized the}} need for a simple saliva test to assist screening and surveillance activities. His 1994 call in The <b>Lancet</b> <b>for</b> personal HIV screening in developing countries invoked controversy during a time when detection was viewed as worse than the disease, as did his Epidemiology commentary on HIV winners and losers, [...] and his AIDS article on the harm of not permitting personal HIV screening in developing countries. Controversy continued in his retirement years, when he wrote of the United Nations involvement in the origin of the world’s largest cholera epidemic in Haiti, later expanded in his book Deadly River featuring French epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux.|$|R
5000|$|The third paper, {{published}} in September, 2011, {{in a special}} edition of The <b>Lancet</b> <b>for</b> the 10 year anniversary of the September 11 attacks of 2001, focused on casualties of both civilians and Coalition soldiers specifically by suicide bomb attacks in Iraq between 2003 and 2010. This paper found that there had been at least 12,284 Iraqi civilians and 200 Coalition soldiers killed in at least 1,003 suicide bombings during the period. The study also found that these bombings had [...] "injured no fewer than 30,644 Iraqi civilians," [...] and that, [...] "children are less likely to survive their suicide bomb injuries than adults." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{limited number}} of copies {{available}} at first were targeted at a select fashionable readership. The late Autumn literary season was just getting under way as the first reviews appeared, and by early January the book {{was the subject of}} conversations at elite literary gatherings. At venues such as Buckingham Palace and Lady Byron's parties, cosmic evolution became a topic of discussion {{for the first time in}} many years. Reforming medical journals including The <b>Lancet</b> <b>for</b> 23 November 1844 carried favourable reviews, while criticising specific points. In January the Unitarian quarterly Prospective gave powerful support, but the influential prestige quarterlies which could determine the long term success of books were still looking for reviewers.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Blood {{started out}} of his musings. He had been {{considering}} that in his case of instruments there was a lancet with which he might perform on Captain Hobart a beneficial operation. Beneficial, that is, to humanity. In any case, the dragoon was obviously plethoric and would be the better <b>for</b> a <b>blood-letting.</b> The difficulty lay in making the opportunity. He was beginning to wonder if he could lure the Captain aside with some tale of hidden treasure, when this untimely interruption set a term to that interesting speculation.|$|R
500|$|The {{letter was}} {{reviewed}} by six reviewers – {{three times the}} Lancet's usual number. Four reviewers found it acceptable after revisions. A fifth thought it was flawed, but wanted it published [...] "to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues {{a chance to see}} the data for themselves". The sixth, John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research, also said it was flawed. After consulting with the Royal Society, Pickett publicly criticised The <b>Lancet</b> <b>for</b> agreeing to publish the study. The study, which used data held by Ewen, who was not subject to the veto of Pusztai's work, reported significant differences in thickness of the gut epithelium between control and test subjects, but did not mention growth or immunity problems.|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{whether it would}} be safe to extend the currently recommended area of sampling to the whole heel in neonates.  METHODS—Eighty newborn infants were studied, weight range 0. 56 to 4. 34 kg, gestation 24 to 42 weeks. Ultrasound scanning was used to measure the shortest distance between the skin and the perichondrium of the calcaneum.  RESULTS—The shortest depth of perichondrium was in the centre of the heel and ranged from 3 to 8 mm. In 78 of the 80 infants the distance was 4 mm or more. There was a small but significant positive correlation with weight.  CONCLUSIONS—Standard automated <b>lancets</b> <b>for</b> preterm use that puncture to a depth of 2. 4 mm may be safely used anywhere over the plantar surface of the heel. The posterior aspect of the heel should be avoided. Reducing the density of heel pricks should reduce the associated pain. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Traditional {{methods of}} {{detecting}} Leishmania from cutaneous lesions involve invasive diagnostic procedures, such as scrapings, which cause discomfort, require technical expertise, and carry risks of invasive procedures. We compared {{the performance of}} 2 novel, molecular-based non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Methods: Consecutive patients presenting to the Leishmania Clinic at the Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia were enrolled. PCR was performed on filter paper lesion impressions (FPLIs), cytology brushes, and <b>lancets</b> <b>for</b> detection of Leishmania DNA. Smears from lesion scrapings and leishmanin skin test were also performed. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity. Composite reference standard was any 2 of 5 tests positive. Species identification was performed by PCR assays of positive specimens. Results: Ninety patients with 129 lesions were enrolled, 117 of which fulfilled reference criteria for a diagnosis of CL. Of these 117 lesions, 113 were positive by PCR of <b>lancets</b> used <b>for</b> lesion scrapings versus 116 by PCR of FPLIs (p = 0. 930) or 116 by PCR of cytology brushes (p = 0. 930). Sensitivity and specificity of PCR on lancets were 96. 6 % [95 % CI 93. 3 – 99. 9 %] and 100 %, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of FPLI PCR were 99. 1 % [95 % CI 97. 4 – 100 %] and 100 %, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of cytology brush PCR were 99. 1 % [95 % CI 97. 4 – 100 %] and 100 %, respectively. Giemsa-stained lesion smea...|$|R

5000|$|The {{agency was}} criticised by <b>Lancet</b> <b>for</b> {{allegedly}} using weak {{evidence in a}} review of electronic cigarettes to endorse an estimate that e-cigarette use is 95% less hazardous than smoking. Lancet wrote [...] "it is on this extraordinarily flimsy foundation that PHE based the major conclusion and message of its report". Lancet found this [...] "raises serious questions not only about the conclusions of the PHE report, but also {{about the quality of the}} agency's peer review process." [...] Authors of the PHE report subsequently published a document clarifying that their endorsement of the 95% claim did not stand on the single study criticized in the Lancet, but on their broad review of toxicological evidence. The agency has also been criticised for [...] "serious questions about transparency and conflicts of interest" [...] regarding this review, that PHE's response [...] "did not even begin to address the various relationships and funding connections" [...] in question, and that this [...] "adds to questions about the credibility of the organisation’s advice".|$|R
