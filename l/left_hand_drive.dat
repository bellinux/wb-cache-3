25|$|The Supreme series {{like the}} Panorama I and Panorama Elite were simply a success {{from the outset}} winning many orders from small, national, and some {{international}} operators. It entered most fleets in large multiples. The export market was addressed with <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions, some modified for the Dutch market {{and at least one}} was built on Deutz chassis. The dynamic approach of Plaxtons relationship with their customers requirements was a huge factor in the success of the Supreme.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design {{was different from}} the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, {{the same}} model was {{exported}} to the Middle East badged as the CSV CR8, albeit in <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive.</b> In this instance, CSV stands for [...] "Chevrolet Special Vehicles", {{not to be confused}} with the unrelated, but also Holden Commodore-based Corsa Specialised Vehicles (CSV) cars.|$|E

2500|$|In general, the Gibraltar force follows British police {{models in}} its dress and its mostly male constables and sergeants on foot patrol wear the {{traditional}} custodian helmet, the headgear of the British [...] "bobby on the beat". The helmet is traditionally made of cork covered outside by felt or serge-like material {{that matches the}} tunic. The vehicles also appear virtually identical to typical UK police vehicles, but are <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Singapore, {{cars and}} other {{vehicles}} drive {{on the left side}} of the road, as in neighbouring Malaysia, due to its British colonial history (which led to British driving rules being adopted in India, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong as well). As a result, most vehicles are right-hand drive. However, exemptions have been made to allow foreign vehicles and construction machineries to utilise the roadspace of Singapore. As such, vehicles with <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> configurations are required to either be driven with a sign indicating [...] "LEFT-HAND-DRIVE" [...] or towed.|$|E
50|$|The Wira was {{the first}} Proton to be {{produced}} in both <b>left</b> and right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> configurations, and it remains the company's most widely exported model to date, spanning over seventy countries in Asia, Australasia, Europe, Africa, The Middle East and Latin America.|$|R
50|$|An obscure {{whitewater}} kayak run until 2000, <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> Canyon {{was first}} run in 1998 by Brook Aitken, Chris McEniry, and Craig D. Irwin. The whitewater kayakers first descended the Class V mini-gorge by entering {{through a small}} culvert passing under <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> Canyon <b>Drive</b> and beginning a tight and snaking boulder garden entrance through a cascade along the road. The mini gorge is below the roadway of <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> Canyon and is frequently choked with woody debris. The <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> Creek kayak run is short and full of action. The City of Boulder Mountain Parks and Open Space has one parking facility at Buckingham Park.|$|R

2500|$|After {{production}} of the G40 ended in 1994, Volkswagen decided to release the first GTI-branded Polo in a limited batch of just 3000. It was released in 1995 and available only in <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive.</b> It featured a 1.6 litre 16-valve [...] engine. The GTI was not available in the UK at any stage during its limited production, this meant that as of 1994 the UK only had the [...] 1.4 16v as a model with any sporting intent. This was the case until 2000 when the Polo Mk3 model range was finally revamped and the first GTI-branded Polos arrived in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|At first, Ford in Germany and Ford in Britain built {{different}} models {{from one another}} until the late 1960s, with the Ford Escort and then the Ford Capri being common to both companies. Later on, the Ford Taunus and Ford Cortina became identical, produced in <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> and right hand drive respectively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The Ford Sierra replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the [...] "Jellymould" [...] and [...] "The Salesman's Spaceship." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1963 until around 1990, in West Germany, private {{vehicles}} {{owned by}} members of British Forces Germany and their families were issued registration numbers in a unique format (initially two letters followed by three digits plus a [...] "B" [...] suffix, e.g. RH249B, then from the early 1980s three letters followed by two numbers plus the [...] "B" [...] suffix, e.g. AQQ89B). This was discontinued for security reasons, as it made them vulnerable to Provisional IRA attacks. Private vehicles driven by British military personnel are now issued with either standard UK number plates (if right hand drive) or German ones (if <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive),</b> although the vehicle is not actually registered with the DVLA.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} find out the {{effectiveness}} of ICT on the supply side and how infrastructure limitations have a bearing on service delivery in the Zimbabwean public sector. In this paper we focus on ZINARA a parastatal mandated by the government of Zimbabwe to administer among other things, the collection of tollgates fees for the purposes of building new and up grading the existing infrastructure. A qualitative research design {{in the form of a}} case study was used to guide this research. Observations and interviews were the research instruments used to collect data from the tollgates under study and from senior executives at ZINARA Head Office in Harare. The study shows that ZINARAâ€™s migration from a manual system to ICT led tolling system, has improved revenue collection but has not eliminated queues at some toll gates under study. We recommend that ZINARA should introduce prepaid tolling for <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>driven</b> trucks and other techno-savvy road users and dedicate a green route for them to avoid delays especially at the tollgates with more than one lane. In addition a swiping system that allows use of debit and credit cards may also be introduced...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Mini Clubman, which {{features}} a pair of bi-parting side doors that are always located {{on the right of}} the car (irrespective of the market), the Veloster has different <b>left</b> and right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> configurations. The larger single door is always on the driver's side, and the two smaller doors are always on the passenger side. As a result, the rear passenger always exits on the curb side of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The AEC Regal VI was a rear-engined single-decker {{bus chassis}} {{manufactured}} by AEC in the 1960s. It was unveiled at the 1960 Commercial Motor Show and {{was intended to}} be a purely export chassis. It was an updated version of the underfloor-engined AEC Regal IV, having an 11.3-litre AH690 engine instead of the Regal IVs 9.6-litre AH590 engine. It was available in both <b>left</b> and right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions, other options included power assisted steering and air suspension.|$|R
2500|$|The Mark I Ford Escort was {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom at the end of 1967, making its show debut at Brussels Motor Show in January 1968. It replaced the successful, long-running Anglia. The car was presented in continental Europe as a product of Ford's European operation. Escort production commenced at the Halewood plant in England during the closing months of 1967, and for <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets during September 1968 at the Ford plant in Genk. Initially the continental Escorts differed slightly from the UK built ones under the skin. The front suspension and steering gear were differently configured and the brakes were fitted with dual hydraulic circuits; also the wheels fitted on the Genk-built Escorts had wider rims. At the beginning of 1970, continental European production transferred to a [...] on the edge of Saarlouis, West Germany.|$|E

50|$|The van {{followed}} the emerging trend of having forward controls and sliding doors on each side. It {{was made in}} both <b>left</b> and right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions. As well as complete vehicles, the J-type was also supplied in chassis form to external body makers and it appeared, amongst other uses, as a pick-up, tipper truck, ice cream van and milk float. Many were bought by the British Post Office and these differed from standard in having rubber front and rear wings.|$|R

40|$|Many {{experiments}} using driving simulators or real roads {{have shown}} that using a cellular phone while driving may cause an accident because it delays visual information processing by the driver. In this research, we examined the influence on driving performance of cellular phone use on a course that simulated streets. Driving conditions were driving only, listening to the car radio, hands-free cellular phone use and using a cellular phone with the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Driving</b> performance measurements included braking response time to the brake lights of a preceding car, eye movement, distance from the vehicle in front and lane observance. The subjects were 50 drivers, including ten driving instructors. The mean glance duration when manipulating a cellular phone was longer than when manipulating a hands-free set or car stereo. Braking reaction delay time increased in the following order: driving only, car radio, hands-free and, longest of all, cellular phone. When the cellular phone was used, car speed was slowest, and {{the distance from the}} vehicle in front became the longest. Glance duration other than to the front, indicating divided attention, was shortest during the cellular phone use and there were also fewer instances of eye movement. In the case of cellular phone use, stable driving appeared to be more difficult, as there was substantial steering wheel deflection. In this experiment, it was confirmed that use of a hands-free set is effective to some extent, but driving performance was poorer than with driving only. Even though different forms of in-vehicle information apparatus were used, a delay in information processing was consistently found...|$|R
2500|$|Turn {{signals are}} {{in almost every}} case {{activated}} by a horizontal lever (or [...] "stalk") protruding {{from the side of the}} steering column, though on some vehicles it protrudes from the dashboard. The outboard end of the stalk is pushed clockwise to activate the right turn signals, or anticlockwise for the left turn signals. In most cases, the signal stalk is on the outboard, usually <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the column, in both <b>left</b> and right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> cars. Regulations do not specify a mandatory location for the turn signal control, only that it be visible and operable by the belted-in driver, and—at least in North America—that it be labelled with a specific symbol if it is not located on the left side of the steering column. The international UN Regulations do not include analogous specifications.|$|R
