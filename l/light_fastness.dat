40|$|This {{study is}} about {{environmentally}} safe pre-treatment for wool fabrics {{to improve their}} printability with acid dyes. Knitted wool fabrics treated with argon and air atmospheric plasma were evaluated in terms of printability. Printing was carried out with two different receipts under different steaming conditions. The surfaces of untreated and plasma treated wool fabrics were analyzed by SEM to compare the morphological changes. Hairiness of the fabric was investigated under light microscope. The results showed that atmospheric plasma treatment improved the hydrophility of the fiber and enhanced the adhesion and penetration of printing paste to the surface with decreasing hairiness. Increased penetration of printing paste and reduced hairiness caused higher color yield even at lower steaming durations without wetting agent. Air and argon plasma treated fabrics, especially at higher exposure durations, showed higher <b>light</b> <b>fastnesses.</b> Adversely, same samples showed a decrease in wet and dry rubbing fastnesses which were probably caused from the deeper shade of the fabric...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{low-cost}} coatings {{intended for}} ink jet printing {{have been developed}} recently. Studies on their print quality have mainly focused on the optical and geometrical properties of the image, whereas their effect on long-term print quality has been largely ignored. The objectives of this thesis were to evaluate the applicability of vibrational spectroscopic methods for studying ink jet prints and to clarify the mechanisms contributing to the permanence of small-scale ink jet prints on coated papers. <b>Light</b> and water <b>fastness</b> in the time-scale of the print's end use were of particular interest. These were studied using experimental inks and coatings with known compositions. The {{first part of the}} study concerned the applicability of vibrational spectroscopic methods for studying ink jet prints. According to the results, differences between the samples originating from changes in exposure to light could be detected with both FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The most suitable techniques were the FTIR-ATR, confocal NIR-Raman, UV resonance Raman and Kerr gated resonance Raman methods. The second part of the thesis detailed the issues related to the mechanisms contributing to print permanence. The results suggested that the <b>light</b> and water <b>fastness</b> of ink jet prints were affected by both the physical properties of the coatings and the chemical paper-ink interactions. The latter played the dominant role, whereas the significance of physical paper properties depended on the type of ink and the coating. As a rule, the stronger the chemical paper-ink interactions were, the less relevance the physical properties of the coating had. Results also indicated that <b>light</b> and water <b>fastness</b> could be markedly influenced by the type of colorant, but also by choosing the right coating ingredients. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of dyeing on cotton wool and silk fabrics with natural dye obtained from kitchen waste of dry skin extract of Allium cepa. Design/methodology/approach – The dry skin of onion produces natural dye which has been used for dyeing textiles. In the present study, innovative dyeing with onion has been shown to give good dyeing results. Pretreatment with 2 per cent metal mordant and using 5 per cent of plant extract (owf) was found to be optimum and showed very good fastness properties for cotton, wool and silk dyed fabrics. For effective natural dyeing with dry skin extract of Allium cepa, conventional method of dyeing was carried out using metal mordants. The purpose of using this source was with an idea to produce value addition dyed product from kitchen waste as the dye has very good potential of uptake, adherence to the fabric and has good wash and <b>light</b> <b>fastnesses.</b> Results show very attractive hue colours. Findings – The preference of using easily and cheaply available material for dyeing by conventional dyeing lowers the cost of natural dyeing and enhances resource productivity and as a result, reduces waste. This makes onion scale one of the easily available materials for natural dyeing industry. Research limitations/implications – Although metal mordanting with copper sulphate and potassium dichromate are not ecofriendly but we have used only 2 per cent of these metal salts to prepare different shades with dry scales of Allium cepa extract. Practical implications – The method developed for natural dyeing of cotton, silk and wool fabrics using skin extract of allium in conjunction with metal mordanting has shown very deep coloration. The stepwise dyeing of cotton fabric with metal mordant by the natural dye Allium cepa showed that the stepwise dyeing process gave very good result. The dye uptake in case of stepwise dyeing was from 65 - 68 per cent in the case of cotton, 70 - 74 per cent in silk and 78 - 82 per cent in wool with different mordants. Originality/value – The method developed for natural dyeing of cotton, silk and wool fabrics using skin extract of allium in conjunction with metal mordanting has shown marked improvement in terms of dye adherence and fastness properties and can thus be recommended for industrial application...|$|R
