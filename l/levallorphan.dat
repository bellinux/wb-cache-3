50|$|<b>Levallorphan</b> was {{formerly}} {{widely used in}} general anesthesia, mainly to reverse the respiratory depression produced by opioid analgesics and barbiturates used for induction of surgical anaesthesia whilst maintaining a degree of analgesia (via KOR agonism). It is now less commonly employed for this purpose as the newer drug naloxone tends to be used instead. <b>Levallorphan</b> was also used in combination with opioid analgesics to reduce their side effects, mainly in obstetrics, and a very small dose of <b>levallorphan</b> used alongside a full agonist of the MOR can produce greater analgesia than when the latter is used by itself. The combination of <b>levallorphan</b> with pethidine (meperidine) was indeed used so frequently, a standardized formulation was made available, known as Pethilorfan.|$|E

50|$|<b>Levallorphan</b> (INN, BAN) (brand names Lorfan, Naloxifan, Naloxiphan), {{also known}} as <b>levallorphan</b> {{tartrate}} (USAN), is an opioid modulator of the morphinan family used as an opioid analgesic and opioid antagonist/antidote. It acts as an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and as an agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), and as a result, blocks the effects of stronger agents with greater intrinsic activity such as morphine whilst simultaneously producing analgesia.|$|E
50|$|As an agonist of the KOR, <b>levallorphan</b> {{can produce}} severe mental {{reactions}} at sufficient doses including hallucinations, dissociation, and other psychotomimetic effects, dysphoria, anxiety, confusion, dizziness, disorientation, derealization, feelings of drunkenness, and bizarre, unusual, or disturbing dreams.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, dextrallorphan {{was found}} to have a half maximal {{inhibitory}} concentration (IC50) for binding to the pituitary and brain receptor of 10,000 ± 1000 nM and 10,000 ± 1500 nM, respectively. While its stereoisomer, <b>levallorphan,</b> had a 10,000 times more potent dose, thus proving that binding to these receptors is stereospecific.|$|E
50|$|IBNtxA, or 3-iodobenzoyl naltrexamine, is an {{atypical}} {{opioid analgesic}} drug derived from naltrexone. In animal studies it produces potent analgesic effects that are blocked by <b>levallorphan</b> and so {{appear to be}} μ-opioid mediated, but it fails to produce constipation or respiratory depression, and is neither rewarding or aversive in conditioned place preference protocols. These unusual properties are thought to result from agonist action at a splice variant or heterodimer of the μ-opioid receptor, {{rather than at the}} classical full length form targeted by conventional opioid drugs.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) agonists, KOR agonists are potently analgesic, {{and have}} been employed clinically {{in the treatment of}} pain. However, KOR agonists also produce side effects such as dysphoria, hallucinations, and dissociation, which has limited their clinical usefulness. Examples of KOR agonists that have been used medically as analgesics include butorphanol, nalbuphine, levorphanol, <b>levallorphan,</b> pentazocine, phenazocine, and eptazocine. Difelikefalin (CR845, FE-202845) and CR665 (FE-200665, JNJ-38488502) are peripherally restricted KOR agonists lacking the CNS side effects of centrally active KOR agonists and are currently under clinical investigation as analgesics.|$|E
50|$|Some opioid antagonists are not pure antagonists {{but in fact}} do {{produce some}} weak opioid partial agonist effects, and can produce {{analgesic}} effects when administered in high doses to opioid-naive individuals. Examples of such compounds include nalorphine and <b>levallorphan.</b> However, the analgesic effects from these specific drugs are limited and tend {{to be accompanied by}} dysphoria, most likely due to additional agonist action at the κ-opioid receptor. As they induce opioid withdrawal effects in people who are taking, or have recently used, opioid full antagonists, these drugs are considered to be antagonists for practical purposes.|$|E
50|$|Buprenorphine and {{dezocine}} are partial agonists of the MOR but antagonists of the KOR. Contrarily, eptazocine is an antagonist of the MOR but an agonist of the KOR; {{the same}} is also true for nalorphine and <b>levallorphan.</b> A variety of partial agonists or mixed agonists-antagonists of the MOR and KOR are also marketed, and include butorphanol, levorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and phenazocine. All of the aforementioned drugs may be described as opioid modulators instead of as pure antagonists. With the sole exception of nalorphine, all of the preceding are used as analgesics (by virtue {{of the fact that}} both MOR and KOR agonism independently confer pain relief). However, these opioid analgesics have atypical properties in comparison to the prototypical pure MOR full agonist opioid analgesics, such as less or no risk of respiratory depression for MOR partial agonists and antagonists, reduced or no euphoria, abuse potential, and dependence liability with MOR partial agonists/antagonists, and use- and dose-limiting side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations with KOR agonists. In addition, by virtue of its KOR antagonism, buprenorphine (as buprenorphine/samidorphan (ALKS-5461) or buprenorphine/naltrexone to block its MOR agonism) is under investigation for the treatment of depression and cocaine dependence, as are other KOR antagonists such as CERC-501 (LY-2456302) and, previously, JDTic and PF-4455242 (both discontinued due to toxicity concerns).|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Escherichia coli were {{isolated}} by their {{resistance to the}} bacteriocidal effects of the membrane-active drugs polymyxin B, <b>levallorphan,</b> and tetracaine. The mutants were examined for additional changes in cellular physiology evoked by the lesions; many polymyxin-resistant strains had a concomitant increased sensitivity to anionic detergents, and several strains of each type had concomitant alterations in generation time and morphology. Mutants of each class (polymyxin resistant, tetracaine resistant, and <b>levallorphan</b> resistant) were transduced into recipient strains. The <b>levallorphan</b> resistance site (lev) was located at approximately 9 min on the E. coli chromosome. Polymyxin (pmx) and tetracaine (tec) resistance loci were also transduced. The lev and tec strains had a slight prolongation of generation time, in contrast with their isogenic wild-type strains. The tec transductant produced long filaments {{in the absence of}} tetracaine and had an altered colonial morphology, it reverted at high frequency, with the morphological abnormalities reverting along with the tetracaine resistance. The pmx transductant had an increased sensitivity to <b>levallorphan</b> and to anionic detergents. In contrast, both lev and tec mutants were more resistant to acriflavine than was the wild type or the pmx transductant. The pmx, lev, and tec loci differed in sensitivity to mitomycin C; the lev strain was more resistant, the tec strain was more sensitive, and the pmx strain was much more sensitive than the wild type. There was no difference in sensitivity to several other dyes and detergents, colicins, or T bacteriophage between the transductant and isogenic wild-type strains. Thus, lev, tec, and pmx loci confer more subtle alterations in the permeability barrier than do lipopolysaccharide-deficient mutants previously studied...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that tibial {{pressure}} algesimetry can be used to distinguish between the action of intramuscular pethidine 100 mg and a placebo. This method has been applied to study the effect on pain response of the opiate antagonists, <b>levallorphan,</b> nalorphine and four different doses of pentazocine. The two former drugs increased the sensitivity to pain soon after administration, though this effect diminished {{towards the end of the}} first hour. Pentazocine, on the other hand, had a demonstrable analgesic action. The opiate antagonist tacrine did not appear to affect the analgesic action of morphine 10 mg. None of the antagonists when given intravenously had an analgesic action comparable to pethidine though there was a wide scatter in the results. Nalorphine and <b>levallorphan</b> partially neutralized the effect of pethidine given previously. Pentazocine had no such antagonistic effect. It appears, therefore, that it differs from the other opiate antagonists studied which are antanalgesic or neutral by all the methods of administration used. In addition to pain relief, effective doses of all potent opiate analgesics may result in undesirabl...|$|E
40|$|A re-evaluation of {{pethidine}} and Pethilorfan {{has been}} carried out using techniques previously described. In this way analgesia, respiratory depression and sedation have been studied as principal effects. Secondary effects of the two drugs such as cardio-vascular depression, nausea, vomiting and histamine-like reaction have also been assessed. It appears that the addition of <b>levallorphan</b> to pethidine reduces the analgesia produced and tends to increase the incidence of unwanted side effects. The sedation produced by each drug is poor but similar. Likewise there is a high incidence of pre-operative nausea and vomiting when no atropine was given. Blood pressure and pulse changes are similar with each drug. Both drugs, in high concentration, show local histamine-like action. Finally, the respiratory depression produced in healthy volunteers by Pethilorfan 100 mg, intravenously, is greater, not less, than that produced by pethidine 100 mg. The advantages of controlled studies of the main effect and important side effects of narcotic anal-gesic drugs have recently been discussed (Camp-bell, Masson and Norris, 1965). Before embarking on the investigation of novel compounds belong-ing to this group of drugs it was decided to re-assess some of those already in widespread clinical use. Narcotic analgesics have three principal effects, namely analgesia, sedation, and respiratory depression, and each of these has been the main subject of an individual study. The results of these studies have been integrated to give a comprehensive picture of drug action. While each group of observers concentrated on one principal effect, the incidence and severity of other acute effects were also noted and correlated. This cross-checking has been of great value. Initially, Pethi-lorfan, a mixture of pethidine and <b>levallorphan</b> in the ratio of 100 : 1. 25 mg, was compared with pethidine. The claims made for this mixture are that respiratory depression is less than with pethidine alone (Swerdlow, 1957 : Foldes et al., 1959) and that there is no reduction in analgesia (Cullen and Santos, 1955). * Pethilorfan is a proprietary mixture of pethidine and <b>levallorphan</b> in the proportions 100 : 1. 25...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of <b>levallorphan,</b> a synthetic morphinan known {{to interact with}} the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli, is seriously limited by the outer membrane. To select target-resistant mutants rather than outer membrane mutants, a two-step procedure was developed, which involved the selection by penicillin of an "intermediate" parental strain with a decreased penetration barrier and a subsequent positive selection of levallorphan-tolerant pseudo-revertant clones. Unlike the direct selection, this technique yielded various types of mutants in which the morphology, the septation ability, and the growth rate were greatly affected...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were trained}} in a three-choice {{morphine}} (3. 0 mg/kg), cyclazocine (0. 3 mg/kg) and saline discrimination using a discrete-trials avoidance procedure. Behavior {{was considered to be}} under stimulus control when an animal reliably completed at least 1 8 trials of a 20 -trial session on the correct lever after s. c. administration of either morphine, cyclazocine or saline. In tests of stimulus generalization, levorphanol produced a dose-related increase in trials completed on the morphine choice lever, whereas its optical enantiomer, dextrorphan, produced predominantly cyclazocine-appropriate responding, indicating that stimulus control of behavior was stereoselective. Ethylke-tocyclazocine, ketocyclazocine, <b>levallorphan</b> and SKF 10, 047 engendered stimulus control of behavior that was unambigu-ously cyclazocine-like. In contrast, three other opioids with mixed agonist and antagonist properties occasioned respond...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} several mixed-action oploid agonist/antagonists were {{examined}} alone and {{in combination with}} the mu-opioid agonist /-methadone and the kappa-opioid agonist, trans- 3, 4 -dichloro-N-methyl-N[2 -(1 -pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]benzeneace-tamide (U 50, 488). Effects were examined in squirrel monkeys responding under a schedule of shock titration. Under this pro-cedure shock was scheduled to increase once every 1 5 sec from 0. 01 to 3. 7 mA in 30 steps. Five responses on a lever during the 15 -sec shock period terminated the shock for 1 5 sec, after which the shock resumed at the next lower intensity. The intensity below which the monkeys maintained the shock 50 % of the time (median shock level) was determined. /-Methadone and U 50, 488 produced dose-dependent increases in median shock level.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of guanosine 5 '-diphosphate, 3 '-diphosphate (ppGpp) by the "crude" ribosomal fraction of Escherichia coli CP 78 (rel+, spoT+) was demonstrated and characterized. When the 3 '-pyrophosphoryl group of ppGpp was hydrolyzed, the primary degradation product was 5 '-GDP. Phosphorylation of ppGpp to guanosine 5 '-triphosphate, 3 '-diphosphate (pppGpp) prior to degradation was not necessary. The degradation process required Mn 2 + and was inhibited by EDTA. <b>Levallorphan,</b> an inhibitor of in vivo ppGpp degradation, also inhibited ppGpp degradation by the crude ribosome. Thiostrepton and tetracycline {{did not have}} any inhibitory effect, indicating that the reaction is not a reversal of pyrophosphorylation catalyzed by the stringent factor/ribosome complex. Crude ribosome fractions from E. coli NF 161 and NF 162, both spoT-, contained little degrading activity, but similar fractions of E. coli CP 79, a relA- and spoT+ strain, contained ppGpp degrading activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a mixture of 1 part <b>levallorphan</b> and 10 parts {{levorphanol}} taken by mouth were studied in subjects needing symptomatic control of intractable pain. Res-ponse varied according to previous treatment with potent analgesics. The effects {{were similar to those}} of the same dose of levorphanol alone in patients not already receiving drugs of addiction. The incidence of side effects was high after long-term opiate therapy. These appeared to be levallorphan-induced abstinence symptoms and were also trouble-some when the mixture was given for long periods to patients who had not previously received addicting drugs. Side effects became evident after two or three weeks and render this drug combination unsuitable for clinical use. The introduction of nalorphine into clinical medicine by Eckenhoff, Elder and King (1951) made available a drug which could antagonize many of the side effects of morphine.

40|$|There is good {{evidence}} that the respiratory depressant action of 1 - 3 -hydroxy N-methyhnorphinan (levorphan) is wholly or partially antagonized by subse quent administration of its closely related compound l- 3 -hydroxy-N-allyl morphinan (<b>levallorphan).</b> The major part of this work {{has been carried out}} in animals (Fromherz and Pellmont, 1952; Benson, O'Gara and Van Winkle, 1952), although there is one clinical report of observations on the respiratory effect in man (Hamilton and Cullen, 1953). Quantitative evaluation of the respiratory effect of these substances either alone or in combination is lacking, and it was for this reason that the present study was initiated. METHODS. Nine healthy male volunteers between the ages 21 and 33 were used as sub jects. All observations were made while the subject was in the reclining position.

40|$|The {{possible}} role of endogenous opiates in {{the regulation}} of food intake was investigated by studying their influence on body weight of rat pups. Subcutaneous injection of the opiate antagonist Mr 1452 to non-deprived 1 day old rats (1 - 4 mg/kg) and 1. 5 hr deprived 5 day old rats (2 - 8 mg/kg) inhibited feeding. Its stereoisomer Mr 1453 increased intake when injected to nondeprived 1 day old rats (1 - 4 mg/kg), but was ineffective in altering feeding behavior in 1. 5 hr deprived 5 day old rats (2 - 8 mg/kg). Subcutaneous injection of another opiate antagonist, <b>levallorphan</b> (6 and 9 mg/kg), to 3 hr deprived rats also decreased intake, while its stereoisomer dextrallorphan (3 - 9 mg/kg) was inactive in the same experimental conditions. Subcutaneous injection of the opiate agonist met 5 enkephalin (16 and 32 mg/kg) to 1. 5 hr deprived 5 day old rats increased feeding but leu 5 enkephalin (8 and 16 mg/kg) did not alter feeding behavior in the same condition.

40|$|Dextromethorphan (DEM) is {{a widely}} used probe drug for human {{cytochrome}} P 450 2 D 6 isozyme activity assessment by measuring the ratio between DEM and its N-demethylated metabolite dextrorphan (DOR). DOR is excreted in urine mainly conjugated to glucuronic acid. Prior to quantification, DOR must be deconjugated to avoid variability caused by the polymorphic glucuronosyltransferase enzyme. A chemical hydrolysis method was optimized using a chemometric approach. Three factors (acid concentration, hydrolysis time and temperature) were selected and simultaneously varied to study their effect on conjugated DOR hydrolysis. Hydrolysis conditions that maximize DOR release without significant degradation of both DEM and DOR were chosen and results were compared to those obtained by enzymatic method using beta-glucuronidase. An HPLC method with fluorescence detection was developed for the simultaneous quantitation of DEM, DOR and <b>levallorphan,</b> used as an internal standard. Separation was performed on a phenyl analytical column (150 mmx 4. 6 mm i. d., 5 microm) with a mobile phase consisting of 18 % acetonitrile and 50 mM phosphoric acid (pH 3).

40|$|Levorphanol {{inhibits}} {{the transport}} of the amino acids proline and lysine by cytoplasmic membrane vesicles derived from Escherichia coli. The degree of inhibition increases with increasing levorphanol concentration and ranges from 26 % at 10 − 6 M levorphanol to 92 % at 10 − 3 M levorphanol. The effect is independent of the energy source, since levorphanol inhibits proline uptake {{to the same extent}} in the presence of 20 mM d-lactate or 20 mM succinate {{and in the absence of}} an exogenous energy source. Levorphanol does not irreversibly alter the ability of membrane vesicles to transport proline, since incubation of membrane vesicles for 15 min in the presence of 0. 25 mM levorphanol, a concentration which inhibits proline transport by more than 75 %, has no effect on the rate of proline transport by these vesicles once the drug is removed. Both the maximum velocity and the Km of proline transport are modified by levorphanol, hence, the type of inhibition produced by levorphanol is mixed. The inhibitor constant (Ki) for levorphanol inhibition of proline transport is approximately 3 × 10 − 4 M. Membrane vesicles incubated in the presence of levorphanol accumulate much less proline at the steady state than do control vesicles. Furthermore, the addition of levorphanol to membrane vesicles preloaded to the steady state with proline produces a marked net efflux of proline. Levorphanol does not block either temperature-induced efflux or exchange of external proline with [14 C]proline present in the intravesicular pool. Dextrorphan, the enantiomorph of levorphanol, and <b>levallorphan,</b> the N-allyl analogue of levorphanol, inhibit proline and lysine transport in a similar manner.
