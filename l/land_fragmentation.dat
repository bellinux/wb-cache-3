40|$|On {{the basis}} of giving an {{overview}} of efficiency research on transformation of <b>land</b> from <b>fragmentation</b> to scale economy, by using the concept of coupling in physics, this paper expounds the behavior basis of transfer of surplus rural labor forces in China and transformation of <b>land</b> from <b>fragmentation</b> to scaling up, and analyzes behaviors of all parties and equilibrium outcomes in the three stages concerning the transformation of agricultural <b>land</b> from <b>fragmentation</b> to scaling up as follows. At {{the first stage of}} coupling after multitudinous rural surplus labor forces emerge. The farmers begin to go to city seeking jobs. In this period, the amalgamation of land management has not occurred and the single farmer's land has not yet concentrated. The total land area of single farmer has not yet increased and the total amount of farmers has not yet decreased. At the second stage of coupling, driven by living standards and income, multitudinous rural surplus labor forces begin to live in the city permanently in fact, and the scale management of rural land begins to arise. Foreign funded enterprises begin to enter agriculture, and the industrialization management of agriculture is equipped with the most fundamental conditions due to the occurrence of scaling up of land. At the third stage of coupling, the transfer of rural surplus labor forces basically ends. The properly rights of agricultural land or the management forms also, in a large measure, concentrate. The obstacles to agricultural scaling-up management are solved fundamentally, and the income gap between urban areas and rural areas is narrowed. Urban-rural population migration is no longer the main form of China's population migration. This stage has not yet been realized in China and it is the future state of villages. Finally, through the two cases researched by the predecessors, we verify the research results of the preceding two stages, which provides reliable reference for transformation of China's agricultural land management, and policy formulation of transfer of surplus labor forces.

50|$|Government {{attempts}} to implement land reform also created {{problems related to}} <b>land</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> insecurity of tenure, and shortages of farm inputs and tools. Peasant associations often were periodically compelled to redistribute land to accommodate young families or new households moving into their area. The process meant not only smaller farms but also the fragmentation of holdings, which were often scattered into small plots to give families land of comparable quality. Consequently, individual holdings were frequently far smaller than the permitted maximum allotment of ten hectares. A 1979 study showed that around Addis Ababa individual holdings ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 hectares and that about 48 percent of the parcels were less than one-fourth of a hectare in size. Another study, of Dejen awraja (subregion) in Gojjam, found that <b>land</b> <b>fragmentation</b> had been exacerbated since the revolution. For example, during the pre-reform period, sixty-one out of 200 farmer respondents owned three or four parcels of land; after the reform, the corresponding number was 135 farmers.|$|E

30|$|Rangelands are {{characterized}} by variable supply of fodder for livestock (Smith et al. 2010) which is largely attributed to low and erratic precipitation. During normal wet seasons, most of these lands support large volumes of forage which is also of relatively high quality (Mbatha and Ward 2010). The dry seasons, on the other hand, {{are characterized}} by scanty amounts forage which is mostly of poor quality (Ontitism et al. 2000). Until recently, pastoralists employed livestock mobility as the main mechanism of adapting to the feed deficits {{during the dry season}} (Orindi et al. 2007). This strategy is increasingly becoming untenable today due to a wide array of socio-economic, political and anthropogenic factors such as extension of crop farming and human settlements (cities and towns) into the Rangelands lands. These factors entail rapid <b>land</b> <b>fragmentations.</b> Consequently, in most parts, the vast tracks of Rangelands which facilitated the free movements of livestock are virtually gone. This paradigmatic shift is being compounded by the climate change phenomenon. Under these circumstances, livestock feed supply remains a major challenge and is most likely going to get worse (Kirkbride and Grahn 2008). Therefore, unless appropriate steps are urgently taken, the livelihoods of the many pastoral and agro-pastoral communities residing in these areas will continue being disrupted.|$|R

The increasing demand for rural land, especially near urban areas, is causing ownership fragmentation. Several parts of Texas are experiencing fragmentation of large rural ownerships, and many assume that landscape and ownership fragmentation are positively correlated. I evaluated the relationships between <b>land</b> ownership <b>fragmentation</b> and landscape structure in an area of rapidly changing ownerships in Central Texas (Bastrop County). Using grid overlays at multiple spatial extents, I correlated ownership size distributions in 1997 to landscape structure in 1999. For each grid cell I calculated land ownership size variables from a land parcel map and landscape metrics (McGarigal and Marks 1994) from a classified Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) image. In general, landscapes with smaller ownerships tended to have a more heterogeneous or fragmented landscape, and landscapes with larger ownerships tended to have a more homogenous landscape. These relationships remained consistent over multiple spatial extents. I also detected similar relationships from an earlier time period (1981 / 1984 ownership data/landscape data). Temporal changes indicated that increased ownership fragmentation was correlated with increased shrub/brushland patch density and increased grassland-cropland edge and was slightly correlated with increased conversion of shrub/brushland to grassland-cropland. In this region, land-use changes associated with increased ownership fragmentation may have led to <b>land</b> clearing and <b>fragmentation</b> of shrub/brushland patches. No relationships were detected between ownership fragmentation and pine-oak forestland fragmentation of the "Lost Pines" region. This might be due to several large ownerships being maintained, and the trees' aesthetic value causing landowners to keep their property forested...|$|R

40|$|Although {{relationships}} between fragmentation of urban development {{and other forms}} of administrative and <b>land</b> cover <b>fragmentation</b> are important, they are poorly understood. This research aimed to better understand these relationships in order to inform land use planning in the Roaring Fork/Colorado River Corridor of Colorado. Change in fragmentation of urban development between 1985 and 1999 was modeled as a function of other forms of administrative and <b>land</b> cover <b>fragmentation</b> using two different regression specifications. While a standard “global ” regression provided a good averaged model of change for the entire study area, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) demonstrated how the process changed locally over space. Results of the global regression showed that the intercept was close to zero and therefore the fragmentation of urban development was expected to be close to zero in the absence of other forms of fragmentation. Results of the GWR showed that the {{relationships between}} change in fragmentation of urban development and other fragmentation variables (initial edge density of urban development, edge density of public/private interface, farmland density and road density) varied significantly within the study area. By modeling this variation, GWR helped to identify ways to reduce fragmentation of urban development in two different regions of the study area. The analysis suggested that fragmentation of urban development in one area, Aspen–Basalt, was more strongly driven by amenity-related variables, while in the New Castle area fragmentation was more strongly driven by infrastructure-related variables. Ultimately, local analysis may help fine-tune “one-size-fits-all ” land use polices for specific regions...|$|R
