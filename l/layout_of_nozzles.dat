40|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on the design {{specifications}} of industrial inkjet printers. In these systems, the printing heads are mounted individually on a carriage. The in-plane print head rotation has been identified as {{one of the reasons for}} the ink dots misplacement. This study aims to work out the influence of the angles of CMYK printing heads on the print quality. Ultimately, some mechanical tolerances are given to achieve different levels of print quality. A two-step approach is used: one colour, then the four CMYK colours are considered. In the first step, a <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nozzles</b> plate is used in a computer simulation. In parallel, a prototype has been built to validate the simulations. In the second step, a CMYK virtual printer is introduced in place of a four colours experimental system. A criterion on dots superposition is introduced to asses the influence of the heads rotation on the colour reproduction. The nozzle plate layout has been added to a CMYK virtual printer to characterise the printing heads rotation. The model has been tested with XAAR 760 GS 8 print head. Experiments are in a fair agreement with simulations for the one-colour approach. A cone angle for one and four colours has been derived...|$|R

The research {{is focused on the}} influence of cleaning pressure, the diameter <b>of</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and the ratio of sectional area <b>of</b> <b>nozzles</b> to that <b>of</b> pulse jet pipe on pulse cleaning performance. The results show that the difference <b>of</b> pulse jet <b>nozzles</b> performance increases when cleaning pressure increases. The main reason leading to the difference of pulse cleaning is that the increasing rate of static pressure along cleaning direction is slow after the first large increase. The diameter <b>of</b> pulse jet <b>nozzles</b> has a significance affect on cleaning performance so that the uneven performance can be improved by decreasing the diameter <b>of</b> <b>nozzle</b> along the cleaning direction ladder likely. The ratio of sectional area <b>of</b> <b>nozzles</b> to that <b>of</b> the pulse jet pipe is a key factor in cleaning performance, and the best range of the ratio of sectional area <b>of</b> <b>nozzles</b> to that <b>of</b> the pulse jet pipe in the research is from 45 % to 55 %...|$|R

50|$|In nozzle {{governing}} the flow rate of steam is regulated by opening and shutting <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>nozzles</b> rather than regulating its pressure. In this method groups of two, {{three or more}} nozzles form a set and each set is controlled by a separate valve. The actuation of individual valve closes the corresponding set <b>of</b> <b>nozzle</b> thereby controlling the flow rate. In actual turbine, nozzle governing is applied only to the first stage whereas the subsequent stages remain unaffected. Since no regulation to the pressure is applied, the advantage of this method lies in the exploitation of full boiler pressure and temperature.
