500|$|The {{grounds of}} the Kew Asylum were {{originally}} landscaped {{in the tradition of}} an English country park. [...] This was consistent with the Victorian idea that pleasant or beautiful surroundings would help ease the mental anguish of the inmates. [...] It has been proposed that the initial plantings on the site were supplied by Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, director of the Botanic Gardens. Initially, the grounds were planted with many conifers and large growing trees, oaks, elms and Moreton Bay figs; and trees indigenous to the area, river red gum, yellow box, and <b>lightwood</b> were retained in the landscape. In 1913 the landscape gardener Hugh Linaker was employed to lay out the grounds of Mont Park Asylum. As landscape gardener for the State Lunacy Department he commenced a program of landscape improvements and tree plantings at other asylums in Victoria, including Kew.|$|E
2500|$|Mortimer <b>Lightwood</b> – is a lawyer, {{who is an}} {{acquaintance}} of the Veneerings {{and a friend of}} Eugene Wrayburn. <b>Lightwood</b> acts as the [...] "storyteller" [...] and it is through him that the reader and the other characters learn about Harmon's will. However, under the [...] "mask of irony" [...] he assumes in telling his stories, he feels true friendship for Eugene, respect for Twemlow, and concern for the issues in which he is involved. In addition, he also serves as the [...] "commentator and a voice of conscience" [...] with sarcasm sometimes covering his concern. Through Lightwood's reason and advice, the reader is better able to judge the characters' actions.|$|E

2500|$|Before Riderhood {{can claim}} {{the reward for}} his false {{allegation}} against Hexam, Hexam is found drowned himself. Lizzie Hexam becomes the lodger of a doll's dressmaker, a disabled teenager nicknamed [...] "Jenny Wren". Jenny's alcoholic father lives with them, and is treated by Jenny as a child. Lizzie has {{caught the eye of}} the work-shy barrister, Eugene Wrayburn, who noticed her when accompanying his friend, the Harmon solicitor Mortimer <b>Lightwood,</b> to question Gaffer Hexam. Wrayburn falls in love with her. However, he soon gains a violent rival in Bradley Headstone, the schoolmaster of Charley Hexam. Charley wants his sister to be under obligation to no one but him, and tries to arrange lessons for her with Headstone, only to find that Wrayburn has already engaged a teacher for both Lizzie and Jenny. Headstone quickly becomes enamoured with Lizzie, and makes an unsuccessful proposal. Angered by Wrayburn's dismissive attitude towards him, Headstone comes to see him as the source of all his misfortunes, and takes to following him around the streets of London at night. Lizzie, fearing a violent quarrel between them, and unsure of Wrayburn's intentions toward her (Wrayburn admits to <b>Lightwood</b> that he himself doesn't know either), flees both men, getting work up-river from London.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene Wrayburn – who {{is seen as}} the novel's second hero, is a barrister, and {{a gentleman}} by birth, though he is roguish and insolent.

Lizzie contrasts with Eugene's more negative traits and Headstone makes Eugene appear more virtuous. He is nearly killed by Headstone but, like Harmon/Rokesmith, [...] "reborn" [...] after his incident in the river. Though Wrayburn appears morally grey through most of the novel, by the end he is seen as a moral, sympathetic character and a true gentleman, after choosing to marry Lizzie in order to save her reputation, even though she is socially below him.|$|E
