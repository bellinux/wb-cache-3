5|$|The first updated Mk. V sets {{arrived in}} April 1942 and were fitted to the de Havilland Mosquito as they became available. A Mk. V {{equipped}} Mosquito claimed its first kill on 24/25 June, when a Mosquito NF.II from No. 151 Squadron shot down a Dornier Do 217E-4 over the North Sea. In practice {{it was found}} that pilots had considerable difficulty <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the display at the last minute, and the system was used only experimentally. By this time the microwave units had started to arrive in small numbers, so Mk. V production was repeatedly delayed pending their arrival, and eventually cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Once the Emperor, {{portrayed by}} Carter Pewterschmidt, {{contacts}} Darth Vader, he first begins by {{telling him that}} he is getting rid of all his CDs because he is [...] "downloading all his music to his new iPod", then proceeds to list several albums, including singer Natalie Merchant's 1995 album Tigerlily, Alanis Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill, and finally Richard Marx's single [...] "Hold On to the Nights", the last of which Darth Vader excitedly agrees to take. Calling upon various bounty hunters, Darth Vader reviews a lineup of auditioning hunters, including Dog the Bounty Hunter, IG-88, Zuckuss, Bossk, Boba Fett as portrayed by the Giant Chicken, and finally Raggedy Andy, who Vader angrily dismisses. During a confrontation with Han, Darth Vader deflects lasers using his gloves and sings the theme song from the Wonder Woman television series. Once Han Solo is captured by Darth Vader, he is tortured into confessing his clogging one of the bathrooms on Cloud City. Vader then forces Han to listen to Paula Cole's [...] "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?" [...] on full blast. When Luke lands on Cloud City to fight Vader, he is first subjected to appearing on the popular reality competition American Idol, with Ryan Seacrest as host of the ensuing [...] "lightsaber battle" [...] before he is quickly killed by Luke. After losing his battle against Darth Vader, Luke falls {{to the bottom of}} the floating city and calls out for Leia, along with Obi-Wan and actor Tom Selleck, the last of which is then seen briefly <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his book in a real-life cameo from the movie Her Alibi. Sensing this, Leia then orders Chewbacca to turn the ship around, prompting a parody of Vicki Sue Robinson's single [...] "Turn The Beat Around", reworded to [...] "Turn the Ship Around".|$|E

2500|$|The {{world of}} the Ascension is a three-part {{universe}} with the heavens above, a flat earth centered on Jerusalem in the middle, and the underworld below.
