500|$|Seven {{ships were}} {{originally}} planned in the class: Mackensen, Graf Spee, Prinz Eitel Friedrich, Ersatz A, {{and three other}} vessels. The last three ships were redesigned as the , leaving four ships to be built to the Mackensen design. The first two ships were ordered on 14 August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. Mackensen was funded through the 1914 budget, while funding for Graf Spee came from the war budget. Mackensen—ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Victoria Louise, {{as a replacement for}} the old protected cruiser —was named after Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) August von Mackensen. The ship was laid down on 30 January 1915 at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, under construction number 240. She was launched on 21 April 1917; at the small launching ceremony, Generaloberst (Colonel General) Josias von Heeringen gave the speech and the ship was christened by Mackensen's wife. Construction was halted about 15 months before she would have been completed. The British mistakenly believed the ship to have been completed, and so they included the ship on the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> to be interned at Scapa Flow instead of the fleet flagship [...] Mackensen was stricken from the German navy, according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, on 17 November 1919. She was sold for scrap and eventually broken up in 1922 at Kiel-Nordmole.|$|E
