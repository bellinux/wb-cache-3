50|$|Until now, {{the most}} {{critical}} problem with traditional density measurement systems {{is the effect of}} externally induced vibration and media noise superimposed on the weights signal. Designed for this purpose, the DM3 absorbs a significant amount of energy from external media noise and vibration due to <b>low</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> (known as Pink noise). It is necessary to compensate for these forces which affect the true density signal. Pink noise is interrogated by the DM3 transmitter over 110 times per second to ensure repeatability to and calculate the positive and negative values for each period to ensure accurate and repeatable measurement of the slurry within a 45 millisecond response time.|$|E
50|$|Starr {{had known}} that heart disease could precede {{congestive}} heart failure by several years, {{but at the time}} heart disease was typically diagnosed at autopsy by a pathologist. This led him, shortly after joining Penn, to participate in a cardiac output methods program by the American Physiological Society. At this program, his colleague, Yandell Henderson, demonstrated an apparatus for measuring cardiac output, a ballistocardiograph. This project, a suspended bed rigged with springs to pick up resonance frequencies and amplify them, inspired Starr to develop a practical version for use in his own research, {{with the help of the}} Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics. This new device used an optical recording system for more accurate readings, however, due to the <b>low</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of heartbeats, patients had to hold their breath while using it.|$|E

40|$|Piezoelectric {{actuation}} {{is widely}} used for the active vibration control of smart structural systems, and corresponding research has largely focused on linear electromechanical devices. This paper investigates the design and analysis of a novel piezoelectric actuator that uses a piezoelectric cantilever beam with a loading spring to produce displacement outputs. This device has a special nonlinear property relating to converting between kinetic energy and potential energy, {{and it can be}} used to increase the output displacement at a lower voltage. The system is analytically modeled with Lagrangian functional and Euler–Lagrange equations, numerically simulated with MATLAB, and experimentally realized to demonstrate its enhanced capabilities. The model is validated using an experimental device with several pretensions of the loading spring, therein representing three interesting cases: a linear system, a <b>low</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> system with a pre-buckled beam, and a system with a buckled beam. The motivating hypothesis for the current work is that nonlinear phenomena could be exploited to improve the effectiveness of the piezoelectric actuator’s displacement output.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for tuning the stiffness of machine tool supports is described {{based on a}} stiffness model using the contact stiffness approach. Using this model, the mathematical relationship between the load of the support and its stiffness is established. The relationship is separated into three regions. When the total stiffness of all supports is maximized, the load must be tuned so that the stiffness–support load relationship is in the critical region, whereby the contact stiffness is slightly larger than the bulk stiffness. Correspondingly, a placement method of supports is proposed that increases their stiffness without anchor bolts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in two experiments. In the first experiment, the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of a small machine tool prototype is compared for several placements of three supports. The <b>lowest</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of the machine tool under the proposed placement scheme is maximized. In the second experiment, the proposed method is applied to increase the <b>lowest</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of a horizontal milling machine.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{analytical}} electromechanical {{model is}} proposed {{to predict the}} deflection, voltage, and the power output of a proposed low-frequency micro-harvesting structure. The high natural frequencies of the existing designs of micro-scale vibrational energy harvesters are serious drawbacks. A zigzag design is proposed to overcome this limitation. First, the natural frequencies and the mode shapes of the zigzag structure are calculated. The piezoelectric direct and reverse effect equations, together with the electrical equations, are used to relate the voltage output of the structure to the base vibrations magnitude and frequency. The closed-form solution of the continuous electromechanical vibrations gives the power output {{as a function of}} base acceleration spectrum. The usefulness of the design is proved by the signif-icant increase of the power output from the same base accelerations, providing a method of designing a micro-scale harvester with <b>low</b> <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> The optimal mechanical and electrical conditions for power generation are investigated through the case studies.

This work examines this problem using an experimental bridge excited with many single pedestrian events, both with and without additional mass. The vertical acceleration response is measured and compared to moving force, moving mass, and moving spring-mass-damper models. The influence of the additional mass on the results is assessed.
