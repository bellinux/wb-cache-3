5|$|In Belgium, Merrick {{was robbed}} by his road manager and {{abandoned}} in Brussels. He eventually {{made his way}} back to London; unable to communicate, he was found by the police to have Dr. Treves's card on him. Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital. Although his condition was incurable, Merrick was allowed to stay at the hospital for the remainder of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> of London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen.</b> You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E
25|$|Blue Horse {{was one of}} {{the first}} Oglala Lakota to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Shows. Blue Horse {{accompanied}} Buffalo Bill Cody on the show's first international trip to London, England on March 31, 1887. The show's entourage crossed the Atlantic in the SS State of Nebraska, and included 297 passengers (97 of them Natives), 18 buffalo, 181 horses, 10 elk, 4 donkeys, 5 longhorns (Texas steers), 2 deer and 10 mules. Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show was part of the celebration during the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in England, and toured through Birmingham, Salford, and London for five months. The London Courier reported Blue Horse and companions treated to an evening of English hospitality. “Willesden was as it were taken by storm on Sunday last, being invaded by the Indian contingent of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. The fact was that Mr. T.B. Jones, of the White Hart Hotel had, as another instance of his great geniality, invited Red Shirt, Blue Horse, Little Bull, Little Chief and Flies Above and about twenty others to an outing to his well-known hostelry, whereabout they might enjoy his bounteous hospitality. In carriage and brake, provided by mine host, these celebrated chiefs, along with their swarthy companions, with faces painted gaily, bedizened and bedangled with feathers and ornaments, and clad in their picturesque garments, accompanied by their chief interpreter, Broncho Bill and other officials, reached the White Heart about half-past 12 o’clock.” In 1888, Buffalo Bill had a Dinner Party in New York City. “The Hon. Wm. F. Cody, or as he is more familiarly known, ‘Buffalo Bill’, gave a watapee at the ”Wild West” camp yesterday. The affair was graced by a distinguished party of <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen.</b> To watapee is Sioux for “good eat.” Chief Blue Horse was in attendance. “A feature of the repast was rib roast, and the menu also included roast corn, pickles and pumpkin pie.” Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show returned to Europe in 1889-1890 and performed in England, France, Italy, and Germany. Blue Horse traveled with Wild West Shows from 1886 and beyond 1904.|$|E
