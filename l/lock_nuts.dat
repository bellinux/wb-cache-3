25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and <b>lock</b> <b>nuts).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a keyway and <b>lock</b> <b>nuts.</b> Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E

50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the nut and the wrench to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of <b>nuts.</b> Only one <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> per wheel is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a left-hand self-cutting thread to grip the <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> although more advanced designs have a spinning outer ring to frustrate such techniques.|$|R

50|$|Another type of locking skewer uses {{a uniquely}} shaped nut {{that can only}} be turned using the {{matching}} socket/key, which is typically a wrench-like tool that is small enough to fit on a keychain. Though expensive, locking skewers provide additional security and convenience. Locking wheels with an additional U-Lock or removing the front wheel and locking it to the frame and rear wheel would provide the highest security. A disadvantage is that if the owner loses the special tool then {{they will not be able}} to undo the skewer, and will need to obtain a spare tool from the manufacturer. The same type of uniquely shaped nut used for the locking skewer can also be found for suspension forks, V-brakes, and solid-axle wheels in addition to regular wheels and seatposts. Manufacturers such as Pitlock and Pinhead offer services to supply additional <b>lock</b> <b>nuts</b> to an existing key number registered by the owner.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} aspects of wheel {{geometry}} {{which must be}} brought into adjustment in order to true a wheel. [...] "Lateral truing" [...] refers to elimination of local deviations of the rim {{to the left or}} right of center. [...] "Vertical truing" [...] refers to adjustments of local deviations (known as hop) of the radius, the distance from the rim {{to the center of the}} hub. [...] "Dish" [...] refers to the left-right centering of the plane of the rim between the <b>lock</b> <b>nuts</b> on the outside ends of the axle. This plane is itself determined as an average of local deviations in the lateral truing. For most rim-brake bicycles, the dish will be symmetrical on the front wheel. However, on the rear wheel, because most bicycles accommodate a rear sprocket (or group of them), the dishing will often be asymmetrical: it will be dished at a deeper angle on the non-drive side than on the drive side.|$|E

In this study, we carried out finite element modeling and analysis on the main design variables such as contraction ratio and force, and diameter increment of the fluidic muscle cylinder. On the basis of finite element analysis, the prototype fluidic muscle cylinder was fabricated and tested. Finally, we compared the test results with the finite element analysis. 1...|$|E
5000|$|Another type is a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> must be loosened using an Allen wrench to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|R

40|$|Kinematical, {{electromechanical}} energy accumulator is {{a facility}} that converts supplied electrical energy to the kinetic one, stored in the rotating inertial system. Electric driving motors can operate both as a propulsion units, providing torque to the rotor shaft, and as generators {{in the course of}} braking. The prototype is designed to operate in a vacuum; the energy accumulator is located in a sealed pressurized vessel connected to the apparatus, which can generate vacuum pressure down to 1 Pa. The accumulator is destined for storage energy of 7. 2 MJ at a speed of up to 20, 000 1 / min. The energy accumulator is equipped with inert weight in the form of metal disc, connected to a composite band. In the course of operation, the rotor assembly is suspended in non-contact manner in housing assembly while the main body is fastened to the inner ring of the pressure vessel. The rotor consists of a shaft on which are mounted: a metal disc together with a band made of carbon fibre, inset into inert weight using epoxy resin; four disc rotors of two electric motors; two disks which are magnetic armature for electromagnetic bearings operating along the shaft axis; bushings of both sleeve bearings; fixing sleeves, washers and <b>lock</b> <b>nuts</b> to fix particular elements on the shaft. During normal operation the rotor is positioned in the radial direction through two electromagnetic bearings, top and bottom, located at both ends of shaft and operating in the differential arrangement, and in the axial direction- by a system of two eight-pol...|$|E

40|$|Six Sigma is {{the concept}} of {{improving}} the quality by reducing process variations, making con-tinuous improvements, reducing defect rates and improving the processes. Initially, the concept of Six Sigma focused on defect reduction, cost reduction and value addition. Fundamentally the basic idea of Six Sigma is to improve the process-capability and making the process more relia-ble along with reducing wastes within industries. Evaluation the implication of applying Six Sigma over the small and medium-sized enterprises is the main purpose of this research work taking a particular case of automobile industries. In the present work, DMAIC methodology of Six Sigma is used to a small seat slider <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> manufacturing unit to reduce the play issue in K 2 seat slider lock in automobile units by reducing defects inherent in the process.
