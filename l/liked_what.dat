5|$|At a seminar, Aristo met {{director}} Hanung Bramantyo {{and showed}} him one of his screenplays. Bramantyo, who <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> he saw, asked Aristo to write a screenplay for a new film {{he was working on}} with Leo Sutanto of SinemArt. The resulting work, written after intensive research into the production of brownies and titled after the snack, was released in 2004. It garnered a Citra Award for Best Director at the Indonesian Film Festival for Bramantyo and a nomination for best original screenplay for Aristo. While Brownies was in production, Aristo wrote four other screenplays, for Catatan Akhir Sekolah (Notes from the End of School), Cinta Silver (Silver Love), Jomblo (Single), and Alexandria. All of these were made into films between 2005 and 2006. After these successes, at the end of 2006 Bramantyo asked Aristo and his new wife, screenwriter Ginatri S. Noer, to adapt the novel Ayat-Ayat Cinta (Verses of Love) by Habiburrahman El Shirazy, into a film. The resulting work, also entitled Ayat-Ayat Cinta, was highly successful. This was followed by Karma (2007), and Kambing Jantan: The Movie (2008).|$|E

And Lord was also having problems with Curtis, who had started to use LSD. Lord returned from a few days away with The Flowerpot Men to find the entire flat covered in aluminium foil. Everything; even the furniture and the light bulbs.|$|E

25|$|New York City producer/composer and jingle writer David Lucas saw {{the band}} perform {{and took them}} into his Warehouse Recording Studio and {{produced}} four demos, with which Pearlman {{was able to get}} the renamed band another audition with Columbia Records.

Sony Music Canada head of A Richard Zuckerman <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> he heard, {{and saw the}} potential of the band, its producer, and management. The band signed a record and publishing deal with Sony Music Canada in April 1993, and commenced writing for their debut album. Around the same time, then-17-year-old Jeremy Taggart joined the band as permanent drummer.|$|E
25|$|During 1992–93, {{his first}} season at Ajax, he played mostly in the reserves. The Ajax manager Louis van Gaal was {{apparently}} not overly impressed with him, but the team physiotherapist suggested using him as a stand-in for Dennis Bergkamp, who was injured at the time. Van Gaal <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> he saw, and knowing that Bergkamp {{was about to leave}} for Internazionale, he announced that Litmanen would be Bergkamp's successor, something that people in Litmanen's native Finland found difficult to believe. This turned out to be true, however, and he inherited from Bergkamp the famous number 10 shirt, which is often given to playmakers. He went on to score 26 goals in the 1993–94 season, becoming the league's top scorer, and leading Ajax to the title. He was also voted Footballer of the Year in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E

25|$|Frehley {{spent the}} early 1970s {{in a series}} of local bands {{including}} one called Molimo who recorded half an album for RCA Records in 1971. In late 1972, his friend, Chris Cassone, spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in The Village Voice and showed the ad to Frehley. Frehley went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar. Frehley auditioned for a band later named Kiss members Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (bass guitar) and Peter Criss (drums). Frehley, who showed up with best friend Chris Cassone, wearing one red and one orange sneaker, was less than impressive visually, but the band <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> they heard from his playing. About three weeks later, the band named Frehley as their lead guitarist. By January 1973, and they didn't have a name but later came up with the name Kiss. Frehley designed the band's double-lightning-bolt logo, which was polished up by Paul Stanley. The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances, and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes. When the group eventually decided to adopt stage personas to match their makeup and costumes, Frehley became Space Ace. Later his stage persona was also known as The Spaceman.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Alex Carr, Morrison stated that Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns was a huge influence during his development of the story. Morrison <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> Miller did with the Batman, creating a whole new different character who was a more driven and obsessed vigilante, and Morrison wanted {{to make his own}} [...] "different" [...] take on the Batman comics. Morrison also added that they tried {{to stay away from the}} original hardboiled pulp influence of the Batman and those seen in American cinema adaptations, but instead use more themes and style from European cinema.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{was less}} enthusiastic; {{he felt that}} the script could have been better and said that the film [...] "feels like it's going to be terrific", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also said that Tarantino [...] "has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot." [...] Ebert gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four and said that while he enjoyed it and that it was a very good film from a talented director, [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> I saw, but I wanted more." [...] Ebert's biggest praise was the acting in the film.|$|E

Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> he called the [...] "casual" [...] atmosphere of the opening scene and described the ending as [...] "daring".

500|$|Malcolm Jones {{was shocked}} by what he {{perceived}} as the substandard musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs, however: [...] "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind..." [...] Barrett later said of the album: [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> came out, only it was released far too long after it was done. I {{wanted it to be}} a whole thing that people would listen to all the way through with everything related and balanced, the tempos and moods offsetting each other, and I hope that's what it sounds like." [...] In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing how great the album was.|$|E

Instead, they focused on their own music and the [...] "bubble of creativity" [...] they were living in. Orbit also revealed, [...] "We <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> we're doing in this current time and space," [...] he continued. [...] "What we tended to do was watch old French films from the '60s or listen to music that was so far away that it wasn't, in any way, relevant." ...|$|E

500|$|By early 1818, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Characters of Shakespear's Plays, John Keats had acquired a copy. Fascinated by what he read, particularly by the essay on King Lear, he underlined passages and added comments in the margins. Keats especially <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> Hazlitt wrote on the play's [...] "ebb and flow of the feeling" [...] and noted, using a term he had heard Hazlitt himself apply to Shakespeare in his 27 January lecture [...] "On Shakspeare and Milton", [...] "This passage has to a great degree hieroglyphic visioning." [...] Together with what he had already read of Hazlitt's work, especially the essay [...] "On Gusto" [...] from The Round Table, which had helped him develop his celebrated idea about [...] "Negative Capability", this essay on King Lear inspired much of his own poetry and thoughts about poetry.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{wanted to}} have gospel music {{as part of the}} song, with {{virtually}} no instrumentation, only the sound of an organ and her singing. So she started experimenting using just her vocals, giving away to the bridge being composed. After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a choir around September 1988. Both of them met with musician Andraé Crouch and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to [...] "find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> we heard." [...] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them what they needed to do during the recording session.
