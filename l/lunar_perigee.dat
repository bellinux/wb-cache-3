40|$|Abstract: Sedimentary rhythmites of {{siltstone}} {{and fine}} sandstone from late Precambrian (c. 650 - 800 Ma) glaciogenic formations in South Australia are interpreted as distal ebb-tidal deposits that record {{variability in the}} velocity and range of palaeo-ebb tides. Variations in lamina thickness encode a full spectrum of palaeotidal cycles, including semidiurnal, diurnal, fortnightly and monthly tidal cycles {{as well as the}} <b>lunar</b> apsides (<b>perigee)</b> and nodal cycles. A half-yearly oscillation is attributable largely to a beat between the fortnightly tidal cycles of luni-solar conjunction and lunar declination; the lunar nodal cycle is discernible as an amplitude modulation of this beat oscillation. The data allow determination of the Earth's palaeorotation and the past dynamics of the Earth-Moon system with an accuracy previously unattainable for the Precambrian. The late Precambrian (c. 650 Ma) year contained 13. 1 (f 0. 5) lunar months and c. 400 (f 20) days, and the late Precambrian lunar month c. 30. 5 (f 1. 5) days. These values uggest an average quivalent phase lag near 3 " since late Precambrian time rather than the present value of 6 ". The period of 19. 5 (f 0. 5) years determined for the lunar nodal cycle c. 650 Ma ago indicates a lunar distance 96. 9 (f 1. 7) % of the present distance. The low rate of lunar recession since late Precambrian time revealed by the rhythmite data militates against a close approach of the Moon during the Proterozoic.

50|$|The {{approximate}} {{age of the}} moon, {{and hence}} the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating {{the number of days}} since a known new moon (such as January 1, 1900 or August 11, 1999) and reducing this modulo 29.530588853 (the length of a synodic month). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the Julian Day Number of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since December 31, 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly circular orbit and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon happened, therefore may be incorrect by several hours (it also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date); it is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing moon phase, but specialist usage taking account of <b>lunar</b> apogee and <b>perigee</b> requires a more elaborate calculation.|$|R

40|$|The moon, moonlight, {{phases of}} the moon and its {{relatively}} simple recurring cycle has been of interest since time immemorial to the human beings, navigators, astronomers and astrologers. The fact that its orbit is elliptical as well its plane is inclined with the plane of {{rotation of the earth}} gives rise to new moon to full moon and solar and lunar eclipses. During the phase of the full moon, the luminous flux and its apparent size will depend on its distance from the earth. In case it is at farthest point known as lunar apogee causes smallest full moon or micro full moon and if it is closest to us termed as <b>lunar</b> <b>perigee</b> will result in macro full moon, also known as super moon, a term coined by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979. The theoretical expressions for the lunar luminous fluxes on the earth representing the power of lunar light the earth intercepts in the direction normal to the incidence over an area of one square meter are derived for two extreme positions lunar apogee and <b>lunar</b> <b>perigee.</b> The expressions for the apparent sizes of full moons corresponding to said positions are also mentioned.

40|$|Severe {{coastal erosion}} {{occurred}} along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline between mid-May and November 2011. Analysis of this erosion event and comparison with previous coastal erosion events in 2006 / 2007 offered {{the opportunity to}} extend {{the understanding of the}} time and place of coastal erosion strikes. The swells that drove the erosion hotspots of the 2011 erosion season were relatively low (significant wave heights were between 2 m and 4. 5 m) but of long duration. Although swell height was important, swell-propagation direction and particularly swell duration played a dominant role in driving the 2011 erosion event. Two erosion hotspot types were noted: sandy beaches underlain by shallow bedrock and thick sandy beaches. The former are triggered by high swells (as in March 2007) and austral winter erosion events (such as in 2006, 2007 and 2011). The latter become evident later in the austral winter erosion cycle. Both types were associated with subtidal shore-normal channels seaward of megacusps, themselves linked to megarip current heads. This 2011 coastal erosion event occurred during a year in which the <b>lunar</b> <b>perigee</b> sub-harmonic cycle (a ± 4. 4 -year cycle) peaked, a pattern which appears to have recurred on the KwaZulu-Natal coast. If this pattern proves true, severe coastal erosion may be expected in 2015. Evidence indicates that coastal erosion is driven by the lunar nodal cycle peak but that adjacent <b>lunar</b> <b>perigee</b> sub-harmonic peaks can also cause severe coastal erosion. Knowing where and when coastal erosion may occur is vital for coastal managers and planners...|$|E
40|$|Begun as {{an effort}} to better {{delineate}} the effects of sunspots on North American polar front initiation, this study soon uncovered rather remarkable lunar-solar gravitational influences far outweighing the sunspot influences. Data used in the study included daily sunspot numbers since 1914, a daily calendar of lym phases, and departures of Chicago mean daily temperatures from the daily normal. Sharpest Chicago temperature declines occurred 10 days following new or full moon reinforced by lunar perigee; the declines were smaller in the absence of <b>lunar</b> <b>perigee,</b> and they were at a minimum at the times of quarter moons and lunar apogee. These gravitational forces were found capable of negating or accentuating the effects of rising or falling sunspot numbers.

40|$|The {{emplacement}} of retroreflectors on {{the moon}} by Apollo astronauts and the Russian Lunakhod spacecraft marked the inception of lunar laser ranging (LLR) and provided a natural laboratory {{for the study of}} general relativity. Continuing acquisition of increasingly accurate LLR data has provided enhanced sensitivity to general relativity parameters. Two relativistic effects are investigated in this paper: (1) the Nordtvedt effect, yielding a test of the strong equivalence principle, would appear as a distortion of the geocentric lunar orbit {{in the direction of the}} sun. The inclusion of recent LLR data limits the size of any such effect to 3 + or - 4 cm. The sensitivities to the various PPN quantities are also highlighted. (2) the geodetic precession of the <b>lunar</b> <b>perigee</b> is predicted by general relativity as a consequence of the motion of the earth-moon system about the sun; its theoretical magnitude is 19. 2 mas/yr.

40|$|Analysing {{independent}} 1 -yr {{data sets}} of 10 European superconducting gravimeters (SG) reveals statistically significant temporal variations of M 2 tidal parameters. Both common short-term (2  yr) features are identified in all SG time-series but one. The averaged {{variations of the}} amplitude factor are about 0. 2 ‰. The path of load vector variations equivalent to the temporal changes of tidal parameters suggests {{the presence of an}} 8. 85  yr modulation (<b>lunar</b> <b>perigee).</b> The tidal waves having the potential to modulate M 2 with this period belong to the 3 rd degree constituents. Their amplitude factors turn out to be much closer to body tide model predictions than that of the main 2 nd degree M 2, which indicates ocean loading for 3 rd degree waves to be less prominent than for 2 nd degree waves within the M 2 group. These two different responses to the loading suggest that the observed modulation is more due to insufficient frequency resolution of limited time-series rather than to time variable loading. Presently, SG gravity time-series are still too short to prove if time variable loading processes are involved too as in case of the annual M 2 modulation known to appear for analysis intervals of less than 1  yr. Whatever the variations are caused by, they provide the upper accuracy limit for earth model validation and permit estimating the temporal stability of SG scale factors and assessing the quality of gravity time-series...|$|E
40|$|Periods of high astronomically {{generated}} tides {{contribute to}} the occurrence of extreme sea levels. Over interannual time scales, two precessions associated with the orbit of the Moon cause systematic variation of high tides. A global assessment of when these tidal modulations occur allows for the prediction of periods when the enhanced risk of coastal flooding is likely {{in different parts of}} the world. This paper uses modeled tides to assess the influence of the 18. 61 year lunar nodal cycle and the 8. 85 year cycle of <b>lunar</b> <b>perigee</b> (which affects high tidal levels as a quasi 4. 4 year cycle) on high tidal levels on a global scale. Tidal constituents from the TPXO 7. 2 global tidal model are used, with satellite modulation corrections based on equilibrium tide expectations, to predict multidecadal hourly time series of tides on a one-quarter degree global grid. These time series are used to determine the amplitude and phase of tidal modulations using harmonic analysis fitted to 18. 61, 9. 305, 8. 85, and 4. 425 year sinusoidal signals. The spatial variations in the range and phase of the tidal modulations are related to the global distribution of the main tidal constituents and tidal characteristics (diurnal or semidiurnal and tidal range). Results indicate that the 18. 61 year nodal cycle has the greatest influence in diurnal regions with tidal ranges of > 4 m and that the 4. 4 year cycle is largest in semidiurnal regions where the tidal range is > 6 m. The phase of the interannual tidal modulations is shown to relate to the form of the tide...|$|E
