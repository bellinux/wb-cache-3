5|$|In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German Empire for {{military}} and political aid, in order to defeat the Finnish Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland, and expand Finnish territory to Russian/East Karelia, which held geopolitical significance, and was home to people speaking Finno-Ugric languages (Irredentist campaigns/Heimosodat). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of Greater Finland among the expansive factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed {{on the need to}} take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the Finnish Red Guards, and he <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high military skills of the Finnish Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralization of the Russian army. He co-operated with White Russian officers in Finland and Russia.|$|E
5|$|The monarchists <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Swedish regime's year 1772 monarchist constitution, belittled the Declaration of Independence 1917 and {{proposed}} a modernized monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans {{argued that the}} 1772 law, accepted by Russia in 1809, lost validity in the February Revolution, the might of the Russian Czar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917 and Finnish republic was accepted on 6 December. The republicans were able to postpone processing of the monarchists' proposal in the parliament, {{and in the end}} a new monarchist constitution was not accepted in Finland. The monarchists responded by applying directly the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country.|$|E
25|$|Dorsiflexion: In {{order to}} stretch the {{anterior}} muscles of the lower leg, crossover shin stretches work well. This motion will stretch the dorsiflexion muscles, mainly the anterior tibialis, extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, by slowly causing the muscles to lengthen as body weight is <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ankle joint by using the floor as resistance against {{the top of the}} foot. Crossover shin stretches can vary in intensity depending on the amount of body weight applied on the ankle joint as the individual bends at the knee. This stretch is typically held for 15–30 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Bennett parked her Cadillac {{convertible}} {{in the lot}} at {{the back}} of the MCA offices, at Santa Monica Boulevard and Rexford Drive, across the street from the Beverly Hills Police Department, and she and Lang drove off in his car. Meanwhile, her husband Walter Wanger drove by at about 2:30p.m. and noticed his wife's car parked there. Half an hour later, he again saw her car there and stopped to wait. Bennett and Lang drove into the parking lot a few hours later and he walked her to her convertible. As she started the engine, turned on the headlights and prepared to drive away, Lang <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> car, with both hands raised to his shoulders, and talked to her.|$|E
500|$|Living {{near the}} Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free {{climbing}} routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals {{was the most}} difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it [...] "one of the boldest leads I've ever seen... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when you see someone totally on the edge." [...] It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, [...] "In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived." [...] That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, [...] "perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time". She was arguably [...] "the best climber in the Gunks", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and [...] "no man was climbing significantly better" [...] than her.|$|E

2500|$|Penn {{was educated}} first at Chigwell School, by private tutors whilst in Ireland, and later at Christ Church, Oxford. At that time, {{there were no}} state schools and nearly all {{educational}} institutions were affiliated with the Anglican Church. Children from poor families {{had to have a}} wealthy sponsor to get an education. Penn's education heavily <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> classical authors and [...] "no novelties or conceited modern writers" [...] were allowed including William Shakespeare. Foot racing was Penn's favourite sport, and he would often run the more than three-mile (5km) distance from his home to the school. The school itself was cast in an Anglican mode– strict, humourless, and somber– and teachers had to be pillars of virtue and provide sterling examples to their charges. Though later opposing Anglicanism on religious grounds, Penn absorbed many Puritan behaviours, and was known later for his serious demeanor, strict behavior and lack of humor.|$|E
