6000|$|Flo. Why do you <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way?</b> You can't forbear leering {{after the}} {{forbidden}} fruit.--But whene'er I take a wencher's word again! ...|$|E
6000|$|Willing {{took his}} turn at smiling. [...] "Didn't <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> this morning, did it? But she's all right now--except that she's terribly wrought up over Hanscom's predicament." ...|$|E
60|$|MURRAY (his joy fleeing as he {{is confronted}} with her sorrow--slowly). It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> Eileen.|$|R
60|$|Pretty {{soon they}} came to a nice mossy green log right across the Lone Little Path. Peter Rabbit stopped and sat up very {{straight}}. He looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Johnny Chuck stopped too and he sat up very straight and looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but all he could see was the mossy green log across the Lone Little Path.|$|R
60|$|What did it mean? Had Captain Hannock smelt a {{mouse and}} thus sought to outwit Mr. Ranson? It {{certainly}} <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'What are {{you looking}} at me like that for?' she said quickly. 'Don't. You look reg'lar bad when you <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> You don't think much o' me, do you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{watching}} for the procession. Then I shall {{go to church}} with mamma. <b>Look!</b> <b>That</b> <b>way</b> we shall see it come; these two mirrors reflect everything {{up and down the}} street." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you looking}} at me like that for?" [...] she said quickly. [...] "Don"t. You look reg'lar bad when you <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> You don't think much o" [...] me, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum?" [...] said Grandfather Frog, {{and looked}} this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Then {{he gave a}} funny hop and turned about in the {{opposite}} direction and looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but all he saw was the Smiling Pool dimpling and smiling, Mrs. Redwing bringing a fat worm to her hungry little babies in their snug nest in the bulrushes, and the Merry Little Breezes hurrying over to see what the trouble might be.|$|R
60|$|Both governess and pupil {{were close}} to the summer-house before they <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and noticed Midwinter {{standing}} inside. The governess saw him first.|$|R
6000|$|Then Johnny Chuck looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to be {{sure that}} no one was listening. Finally he whispered in Jimmy Skunk's ear: ...|$|R
60|$|The craft {{was taken}} as near the water as {{possible}} without exposing her to view in case Bob should <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and then the boys settled down for the last rest before the struggle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then don't <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> Paul," [...] {{answered}} Walter. [...] "As Si said, {{life here}} isn't {{expected to be}} a picnic. We may gain lots of glory, but we'll have to work for it,--and maybe suffer, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|MARTHA--Yes. [Then pitifully.] Oh, Curt, don't <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way!</b> You seem so cold--so {{far away}} from me. [Straining her arms about him.] Why don't you hold me close to you? Why don't you say you're glad--for my sake? ...|$|E
60|$|The mask in red followed, {{and took}} his place at a little distance, where, {{whenever}} Mrs. Bowen <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> he continued to protest his passion.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to me," [...] {{answered}} Sam Rover, {{his younger}} brother. [...] "I think {{we made a}} wrong turn after we slid down the cliff." ...|$|R
60|$|When Deerfoot <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> {{it meant}} the pitcher was dangerous. Deerfoot {{made no effort}} to swing at the next ball, and was {{promptly}} called out on strikes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Days {{and nights}} they drifted on them endless waters,' said the Captain, 'until at last--No! Don't <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> pretty!--a sail bore down upon 'em, and they was, by the Lord's mercy, took aboard: two living and one dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, dear, the one {{you love}} the best and will be happiest with," [...] said Dr. Alec quickly, as a doleful sniff from Aunt Myra, and a murmur of [...] "My sainted Caroline," [...] made Rose pause and <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
60|$|But Jumper the Hare was timid, oh, very timid indeed. Every few jumps {{he sat up}} very {{straight}} to look this way and <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and to listen with his long ears. He jumped nervously at the least little noise. Yes, Sir, Jumper the Hare certainly was very timid.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} do deny it," [...] retorted Hal. [...] "I {{might have been}} <b>looking</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but I did not watch him, and I {{do not know how}} it was done." ...|$|R
60|$|Granny Fox started nervously {{and looked}} this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> There {{was no one}} in sight. Then she shook a fist at Peter Rabbit and started to limp off home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} was," [...] he said. [...] "You <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Well, I {{can tell you}} where she is. She's stuck fast in the reeds {{at the lower end}} o' Peter's Pint." ...|$|R
60|$|So Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck {{lay down}} in the grass to rest while Johnny Chuck {{recovered}} his breath. Every minute or two Peter would sit up very straight, prick up his long ears and look this way and <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> as if he expected to see something unusual. It made Johnny Chuck nervous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Snug in the Thames, I reckon," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "Soon {{after the storm}} came {{on one of the}} sailors pretended he saw the lights of recall on the admiral's ship; but I was too busy to <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> I had enough to do to look after the safety of the ship. Anyhow, I saw no more of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, he {{must have}} thought it, unless he IS the downrightest fool in the world; because if he hadn't thought it, he {{would have wanted to}} own the whole dog, knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died, he would be {{responsible}} for that half just the same as if he had killed that half instead of his own. Don't it <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to you, gents?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The man nodded. [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> now, but {{you wait}} until I've fixed things up," [...] said he. [...] "Then {{if you feel like}} walking eight miles I'll go on with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [GORDON without {{answering}} {{points with}} {{his hand to the}} [...] body of WALLENSTEIN as it is carried over the [...] back of the stage. OCTAVIO <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and [...] stands overpowered with horror.|$|R
60|$|I {{must confess}} I was frightened when Mr. Woodward {{locked the door}} of his library and caught me by the collar. Was it {{possible}} that he contemplated doing me physical harm? It <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
60|$|But if {{your name}} {{happened}} to be Daisy, and you worked in an Eighth Avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom, five feet by eight, and earned $6 per week, and ate ten-cent lunches and were nineteen years old, and got up at 6.30 and worked till 9, and never had studied philosophy, maybe things wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> {{to you from the}} top of a skyscraper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, just so," [...] {{admitted}} the Czarover. [...] "They really <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> don't they? But you must never trust to appearances, {{which have a}} way of fooling one. Perhaps you noticed that I prevented you from meeting any of my people. I protected you with my giants while you were on the way from the gates to my palace so that not a Herku got near you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't <b>look</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> at me, Joseph Dylks," [...] she answered. [...] "I don't {{want any}} book-l'arning {{to know what}} you are. You're what you always was, a lazy, good-for-nothing--Oh, I don't say you wasn't {{handsome}}; that was what done it for me when I made you my God; but I won't make you my God now, though you're as handsome as ever you was; handsomer, if that's any comfort to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Peter {{looked a}} little foolish. He hesitated, coughed, looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> hitched his {{trousers}} up, and then, why then he found his tongue and told old Mr. Toad all his troubles.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But {{you must}} not go away without giving me another chance to talk with you. Will you promise that?" [...] he demanded, abruptly, passionately. [...] "I have {{something}} to say to you." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{ringing of}} the bell had caused the {{adjoining}} bed-chamber to be lighted. It now shone brightly, {{through the door of}} communication. The Marquis <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and listened for the retreating step of his valet.|$|R
