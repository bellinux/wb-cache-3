40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{trajectory}} optimization for computing smooth collision free trajectories for nonholonomic curvature bounded vehicles among static and dynamic obstacles. One {{of the key}} novelties of our formulation is a hierarchal optimization routine which alternately operates {{in the space of}} angular accelerations and <b>linear</b> <b>velocities.</b> That is, the optimization has a two layer structure wherein angular accelerations are optimized keeping the <b>linear</b> <b>velocities</b> fixed and vice versa. If the vehicle/obstacles are modeled as circles than the velocity optimization layer can be shown to have the computationally efficient difference of convex structure commonly observed for linear systems. This leads to a less conservative approximation as compared to that obtained by approximating each polygon individually through its circumscribing circle. On the other hand, it leads to optimization problem with less number of constraints as compared to that obtained when approximating polygons as multiple overlapping circles. We use the proposed trajectory optimization as the basis for constructing a Model Predictive Control framework for navigating an autonomous car in complex scenarios like overtaking, lane changing and merging. Moreover, we also highlight the advantages provided by the alternating optimization routine. Specifically, we show it produces trajectories which have comparable arc lengths and smoothness as compared to those produced with joint simultaneous optimization in the space of angular accelerations and <b>linear</b> <b>velocities.</b> However, importantly, the alternating optimization provides some gain in computational time.

40|$|Introduction In {{recent years}} {{due to lack}} of water {{resources}} in our country, planting of bare root seedlings of onion has been welcomed by farmers. Considering the desired high dense planting of Iranian farmers, lack of proper transplanting machine has appeared as the main problem. To overcome this problem, some researchers tested a few methods, but none of them reached to complete successfully. As the one of last efforts, Taki and Asadi (2012) developed a semi-automatic transplanting machine with 9 planting units. This machine requires to 9 men to separate and single out a bunch of seedlings. Usage of this machine is very time-consuming and labor intensive. In Iran, transplanting of bare root seedlings is practically performed by hand with a density of 700 - 800 thousand plants at hectare. The main {{purpose of this study was}} designed, manufacture, and evaluation of an automatic metering device that with the separation and singulars of bare root seedlings of onion could get a high density planting. Materials and Methods Fig. 1 shows the main employed idea of this research for separation and single out a bunch of seedlings. As shown in Fig. 1, the metering device consisted of two carrying and separating belts with different teeth forms. Placing seedling bunches between the two belts, the belts move at different speeds in opposite directions and separate seedlings from their bunch. For proper design of metering device system, measurement of some physical properties were necessary. The obtained information was used to select two belts form. A belt with flexible plastic teethes with a height of 6 mm and the distance of 4 mm was selected as separator while for carrier, two types of belts were selected: the first was the same as a separator and the second was made of metal teethes. Based on the average thickness of seedling bunch and some pre-tests, the horizontal angle of separator belt determined as α= 20 degrees. Theoretical calculations were done to computatingof the needed force of the system. In this section, seedlings were modeled as some solid cylinders with a length of 200 and a diameter of 10 mm. In the mentioned system, it was necessary that the speed of separator belt is more than the speed of carrier belt. Thus, ratio of two <b>linear</b> <b>velocities</b> () of 1. 67 and 2. 32 were considered for evaluation of the system. For evaluation of manufactured metering device, the effects of three factors, i. e., carrier belt type, ratio of <b>linear</b> <b>velocities</b> of the belts, and number of seedlings in a bunch (n = 30 and n = 60), on qualitative planting parameters were studied in a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with three replications. The studied qualitative planting parameters were miss index, consumed seedlings, miss length, quality of feed index, multiple index, mean, and damaged seedlings. Results and Discussion The results of analysis of variance showed that, except of belt type, effects of the two studied factors and all interactions are statistically non-significant on consumed seedlings and miss length indexes. The results indicated significant differences between miss index (P< 0. 01), multiple index (P< 0. 05), and mean (P< 0. 05) as affected by belt type. None of the studied variable had a significant effect on damaged seedlings. Interactions of belt type and ratio of <b>linear</b> <b>velocities</b> significantly affected the quality of feed index (P < 0. 01). An increase in ratio of <b>linear</b> <b>velocities</b> in plastic toothed belt lead to decrease of mean and miss indexes, whereas in case of metal toothed belt there is no significant effect on this two indexes. The results also showed that increase of <b>linear</b> <b>velocities</b> for the two types of carrier belt lead to increase of consumed seedlings and decrease of miss length. At the two ratios of <b>linear</b> <b>velocities,</b> miss length in metal toothed is less than plastic toothed belt. Conclusions Commercial transplanting machines are not suitable for dense planting of onion. In this research an automatic metering device for separation and singularize of bare root seedlings of onion was manufactured and evaluated. The results indicated that the carrier belt with long and rigid teeth, having an angle of attack, could separate seedlings more efficiently. The results also showed a 80 percent increased in uniformity of plant seedlings distances is reachable using the metering system...|$|R
