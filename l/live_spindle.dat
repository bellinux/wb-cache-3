50|$|Rotary {{broaching}} {{is another}} common operation. The broach holder is mounted stationary while its internal <b>live</b> <b>spindle</b> and end cutting broach tool {{are driven by}} the workpiece. As the broach is fed into or around the workpiece, the broach's contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a hexagonal socket {{in the end of}} a cap screw.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) {{was investigated in}} <b>live</b> cells. Early <b>spindle</b> microtubules caused folds and invaginations in the NE up to one hour prior to NEBD, creating mechanical tension in the nuclear lamina. The first gap in the NE appeared before lamin B depolymerization, {{at the site of}} maximal tension, by a tearing mechanism. Gap formation relaxed this tension and dramatically accelerated the rate of chromosome condensation. The hole produced in the NE then rapidly expanded over the nuclear surface. NE fragments remaining on chromosomes were removed toward the centrosomes in a microtubule-dependent manner, suggesting a mechanism mediated by a minus-end-directed motor...|$|R
50|$|SFM is a {{combination}} of diameter and the velocity (RPM) of the material measured in feet-per-minute as the spindle of a milling machine or lathe. 1 SFM equals 0.00508 m/s (meter per second, the SI unit of speed). The faster the spindle turns, and/or the larger the diameter, the higher the SFM. The goal is to tool a job to run the SFM as high as possible to increase hourly part production. However some materials will run better at specific SFMs. When the SFM is known for a specific material (ex 303 annealed stainless steel = 120 SFM for high speed steel tooling), a formula can be used to determine <b>spindle</b> speed for <b>live</b> tools or <b>spindle</b> speeds for turning materials.|$|R
40|$|Errors during cell {{division}} in oocytes and early embryos {{are linked to}} birth defects in mammals. Bipolar spindle assembly in early mouse embryos is unique in that three or more acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) are initially formed and are then clustered into two spindle poles. Using a knockout mouse and <b>live</b> imaging of <b>spindles</b> in embryos, we demonstrate that MTOC clustering during the blastocyst stage requires augmin, a critical complex for MT-dependent MT nucleation within the spindle. Functional analyses in cultured cells with artificially increased numbers of centrosomes indicate {{that the lack of}} intra-spindle MT nucleation, but not loss of augmin per se or overall reduction of spindle MTs, is the cause of clustering failure. These data suggest that onset of mitosis with three or more MTOCs is turned into a typical bipolar division through augmin-dependent intra-spindle MT assembly...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDNA {{injected}} into the Caenorhabditis elegans germline forms extrachromosomal arrays that segregate during cell division [1, 2]. The mechanisms underlying array formation and segregation are not known. Here, we show that extrachromosomal arrays form de novo centromeres at high frequency, providing unique access to a process that occurs with extremely low frequency in other systems [3 – 8]. De novo centromerized arrays recruit centromeric chromatin and kinetochore proteins and autonomously segregate on the <b>spindle.</b> <b>Live</b> imaging following DNA injection revealed that arrays form after oocyte fertilization via homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining. Individual arrays gradually transition from passive inheritance to active segregation during the early embryonic divisions. The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1) family proteins HPL- 1 and HPL- 2 are dispensable for de novo centromerization even though arrays become strongly enriched for the heterochromatin-associated H 3 K 9 me 3 modification over time. Partial inhibition of HP 1 family proteins accelerates the acquisition of segregation competence. In addition to reporting the first direct visualization of new centromere formation in living cells, these findings reveal that naked DNA rapidly builds de novo centromeres in C.  elegans embryos in an HP 1 -independent manner and suggest that, rather than being a prerequisite, HP 1 -dependent heterochromatin antagonizes de novo centromerization...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{machine tool}} is {{virtually}} unrecognisable {{in terms of}} its physical appearance and technical capabilities compared to those which were in use only a few years ago. Developments such as high speed <b>spindles,</b> <b>live</b> tooling and multi-axis machining have been combined with advances in cutting tool design, materials and coatings plus enhancements in cutting fluid performance in order to achieve unprecedented improvements in productivity. However, the continual development of increasingly difficult-to-machine materials, combined with the ever present desire for further increases in productivity, continue to drive the evolution of machine tools and machining processes. This paper will consider two techniques which although they have been known about for some time, have recently matured {{to the point that they}} are demonstrating commercial potential for further improvements in conventional machining processes; cryogenic cooling and ultrasonic assisted machining. Cryogenic cooling of the cutting tool or the cutting zone has the potential to remove the heat generated during machining more efficiently that conventional cutting fluid and various researchers have investigated a range of techniques over the years. However, this presentation will describe research at WMG using a commercially available system and consider the advantages / viability of the process. Ultrasonic assisted machining is also a technique which has been known to have a positive effect on certain aspects of machining for some time with several laboratory scale set-ups being developed by researchers. However, the system which is being used at WMG is integral within a commercially available, fully functional, 5 -axis machine tool provided by DMG Mori Seiki. The application of this commercially available implementation of the technology will be reviewed along with some of the research work performed using this facility...|$|R
