5|$|Irene was Johnson's only play, and {{was first}} {{performed}} on 6 February 1749 in a production {{by his friend}} and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than anything else he had written up to that point. It was never revived during his <b>lifetime,</b> <b>and</b> there is no subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, {{making it one of}} the most unsuccessful plays ever written by a major author.|$|E
