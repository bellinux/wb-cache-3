Although Anderson wrote all the music and lyrics, he co-credited the writing to a fictional schoolboy named Gerald Bostock. The humour was subtle enough that some fans {{believed}} that Bostock was real. Reviewing the 40th anniversary reissue, Noel Murray suggested that many listeners of the original album [...] "missed the joke".|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics.

He stated that the DVD encompassed a [...] "virtual career retrospective of the band and its hits", from its [...] "ska-punk roots into the pop realm". In particular, he complimented the performances of [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Hey Baby" [...] and [...] "Just a Girl", giving the DVD 3 out of 5 stars. Allmusic reviewer Hal Horowitz, however, described the music as so [...] "radically doctored" [...] that [...] "it is nothing <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> crowd at the venue heard". He criticised the DVD for being [...] "heavily edited", the vocals for being [...] "heavily and consistently overdubbed" [...] and the editing for being [...] "breathlessly nervous". However, he complimented the band's [...] "high-energy" [...] performance, calling Gwen Stefani [...] "a whirlwind of activity, strutting, preening, pouting, and prancing". He gave the DVD 2 stars out of 5. The Age reviewer Andrew Murfett gave a positive review, calling the sound quality [...] "excellent" [...] and praising the [...] "glossy close-ups to grainy back shots" [...] of the camerawork. He described No Doubt as [...] "endurable" [...] and commented that the set list [...] "stands out [...] ".|$|E

[...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal commented on the episode [...] "Preggers", [...] "Rachel has become insufferable.

[...] Eric Goldman for IGN agreed, [...] "It's hard not to be annoyed by Rachel". James Poniewozik of Time has suggested that Rachel's negative character traits may actually be an asset, commenting on her performance of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] in the episode [...] "Sectionals", [...] "The number reminded me how much I <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show's done with Rachel: she's a lead character, yet the show allows her to be annoying—but at the same time, her dedication makes her likeable. And as we see here, as much of a pill as she can be, her ability to whip out a performance she's been working on since age four is an asset." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the Turing Test is {{the frequency of the}} confederate effect, when the confederate (tested) humans are misidentified by the interrogators as machines.

There is little if any evidence that he engaged in the racial demagoguery of many of his Southern colleagues. Some historians consider Ervin's position to be one of [...] "cognitive dissonance" [...] because he opposed federal legislation to combat race-based discrimination, but did not do so in harsh, ugly terms.

2500|$|The {{development}} of hip hop linguistics is complex. Source material include the spirituals of slaves {{arriving in the}} new world, Jamaican dub music, the laments of jazz and blues singers, patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes. Hip hop has a distinctive associated slang. It is also known by alternate names, such as [...] "Black English", or [...] "Ebonics". Academics suggest its development stems from {{a rejection of the}} racial hierarchy of language, which held [...] "White English" [...] as the superior form of educated speech. Due to hip hop's commercial success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across America and the world and even to non-hip hop fans. The word [...] for example is particularly prolific. There are also a number of words which predate hip hop, but are often associated with the culture, with homie being a notable example. Sometimes, terms <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> dilly, yo are popularized by a single song (in this case, [...] "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See" [...] by Busta Rhymes) and are only used briefly. One particular example is the rule-based slang of Snoop Dogg and E-40, who add -izzle or -izz to the end or middle of words.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{called the}} album [...] "Memorable refrains, hard beats, elegant rhymes: this album succeeds mainly by {{sticking}} {{to a simple}} but effective formula." [...] Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "Though long at 18 tracks, King's still got plenty of heavyweight hits." [...] The Village Voices Makkada B. Selah viewed that [...] "Anyone disputing T.I.'s claim to the title [...] "King of the South" [...] has been summarily silenced by the pageant King's release. The self-proclaimed Dick Cheney of rap showcases many styles, each track here is a multi-layered, highly nuanced production." [...] Sputnikmusic's Joe Schmoh noted [...] "T.I. {{has always been a}} prime example of an excellent mainstream rapper from the south. He exudes confidence with every single breath he breaths over the microphone, swinging comfortably from snare hit to snare hit like Tarzan of the beats. However, whether it’s Ludacris, Rick Ross, or T.I., the problems are all the same. T.I. has no idea at all how to balance an album together. At least he didn’t until he went towards recording King, an album whose title obviously aims towards magnum opus, a record that balances T.I.’s softer side done right with effortless gruff confidence placed on balling records. Basically, King shows T.I. ripping to his full potential. With women, he’s evolved into this sort of country gentlemen, and he shows this over swelling, swollen synthesizers that make his softer side truly something to behold. And yet, it seems <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> real shine still are the bangers. Even the weak tracks sound strong due to T.I.’s superfluous confidence. Normally, records like this just sound like wastes of good beats, but T.I. serves these beats with pure swag and rhythmic ability. He doesn’t even need to rhyme about anything important or relevant, he’s got enough fun punchlines and self-confidence to cover that up. T.I. manages to spend the entire record outshining every single guest, making every beat his own, and even being respectful to the ladies as opposed to misogynistic. Overall, a triumph." [...] The Austin Chronicle's Robert Gabriel stated [...] "Respected from East to West like he was running the Mob," [...] T.I. ascends the throne of rap regality on his fourth LP. Consistent as it is tenacious, King's effortless flow over top-grade beats comes courtesy of Mannie Fresh, Just Blaze, and DJ Toomp, and as the synth-laden [...] "What You Know" [...] has already made the job of radio programmers that much easier, T.I.'s transcends flash-in-the-pan status with a swagger unmatched in hip-hop. T.I.'s Southern drawl bends pedestrian phrases into irresistible melodies hotter than the summer streets to come." ...|$|E
