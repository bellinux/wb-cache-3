50|$|The 12/70 gun is a fully automatic, {{water-cooled}} vertical {{sliding wedge}} design mounted in an armored turret which is electrically traversed under computer control while the elevation motor is controlled manually (presumably a cost-cutting measure). It {{is fed from}} a magazine several meters below ground where the crew uses special air-cushion carts to feed cartridges onto a <b>loading</b> <b>table.</b> From the <b>loading</b> <b>table</b> the cartridge is fed through a hoist system and loaded into the gun using a pendulum loader. Spent cartridges are passed down a chute into a space {{at the bottom of}} the gun well, which is over 18 m deep on tapj 9101 and a few meters less on tapj 9102. The turret is manned by three men (gun commander, traverse operator and elevation operator) with the rest of the gun crew working in the magazine or the installation below.|$|E

50|$|While OWSJs can {{be adapted}} to suit a wide variety of {{architectural}} applications, the greatest economy will be realized when utilizing standard details, which may vary from one joist manufacturer to another. Some other shapes, in addition to the parallel top and bottom chord, are single slope, double slope, arch, gable and scissor configurations. These shapes may not be available from all joist manufactures, and are usually supplied at a premium cost that reflects the complexity required.The fabrication of OWSJ in North America is overseen by the Steel Joist Institute (SJI). The SJI has worked since 1928 to maintain sound engineering practice throughout the industry. As a non-profit organization of active manufactures, the Institute cooperates with governmental and business agencies to establish steel joist standards. Continuing research and updating are included in this work. <b>Load</b> <b>tables</b> and specifications are published by the SJI in five categories: K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series, CJ-Series, and Joist Girders. <b>Load</b> <b>tables</b> are available in both Allowable Stress Design (ASD) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD).|$|R

A dynamic load balancing (LB) algorithm relocates tasks among the nodes so that workload imbalance can be smoothed out, and thus the computing capacity of idle or lightly loaded nodes can be used.
