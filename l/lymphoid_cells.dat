5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells,</b> mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|The immune system, {{particularly}} the innate component, plays a decisive role in tissue repair after an insult. Key actors include macrophages and neutrophils, but other cellular actors, including γδ T cells, innate <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> (ILCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), are also important. The plasticity of immune cells {{and the balance}} between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient tissue repair. Immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration as well, for example in amphibians. According to one hypothesis, organisms that can regenerate could be less immunocompetent than organisms that cannot regenerate.|$|E

40|$|The genome of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV-T) {{contains}} a unique oncogene, designated v-rel, which is {{inserted into the}} env region. Employing a cloned rel DNA probe, a single 2. 9 - to 3. 0 -kilobase v-rel mRNA was identified in poly(A) + RNA from REV-T-transformed <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> lines. A 4. 0 -kilobase rel-specific transcript corresponding to the cellular homolog of the v-rel oncogene was identified in MSB- 1 <b>cells,</b> a herpesvirus-transformed <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> line. Cytodot hybridization was used to quantitate the levels of rel, c-rel, c-myc, c-myb, c-abl, c-fms, c-Ha-ras, c-Ki-ras, c-src, c-yes, c-mos, and c-sis mRNA in REV-T-transformed cells. The levels of rel transcription in REV-T-transformed cells were elevated only two to eightfold over levels found in the transformed immature avian <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> line MSB- 1. The relatively modest levels of rel transcription in REV-T-transformed cells and the {{significant differences between the}} lengths of the v-rel and c-rel mRNA suggest that REV-T transformation {{is the result of the}} production of an altered rel protein.

Finally, quiescent primary lymphocytes were as efficient as activated primary lymphocytes and a <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> line at importing the pAntp peptide.

The other dichotomy is by lineage: Myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) are {{distinguished from}} <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> (lymphocytes) by hematopoietic lineage (cellular differentiation lineage). Lymphocytes can be further classified as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.|$|E

Fusion of mouse L 929 cytoplasts with human peripheral blood lymphocytes induced lymphocyte proliferation {{that gave rise}} to <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> lines of B and T cell origin with unlimited growth potential. The immortalized cell lines were routinely grown in standard medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. Furthermore these cell lines could be propagated in chemically defined serum-free media. Each establishment of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> lines was preceded by a proliferation phase 2 wk after cytoplast/cell fusion, which appears to be a necessary step in the immortalization process. The immortalized cells have a nearly normal human karyotype, do not form colonies in soft agar medium, and are not tumorigenic in nude mice. Cloned B cel...|$|R
40|$|Cumulative work on {{glucocorticoid}} (GC) {{regulation of}} genes in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> cultures {{has revealed that}} apoptotic sensitivity to GCs depends on sufficient active GC receptors in the cells. The actions of the ligand-driven GC receptor that lead to apoptosis depend on interactions with other major cell-signaling systems, including the MAPK pathways, the cAMP/PKA pathway, the hedgehog pathway, the mTOR system and the c-myc system. The balance between these systems determines whether a given cell responds to GCs by undergoing apoptosis. A central core of networked genes may be found under GC control in many types of malignant, GC-sensitive cells. The partial core list identified should be tested in clinical cell samples from hematologic malignancies. Keywords glucocorticoid; apoptosis; <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> Early Backgroun...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImmunosuppressive pretransplantation {{conditioning}} {{is essential}} for donor cell engraftment in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The role of residual postconditioning recipient immunity in determining engraftment is poorly understood. We examined the role of recipient perforin in the kinetics of donor cell engraftment. MHC-mismatched BMT mouse models demonstrated that both the rate and proportion of donor <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> engraftment and expansion of effector memory donor T cells in both spleen and BM were significantly increased within 5 to 7 days post-BMT in perforin-deficient (pfn−/−) recipients, compared with wild-type. In wild-type recipients, depletion of natural killer (NK) cells before BMT enhanced donor <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> engraftment to that seen in pfn−/− recipients. This demonstrated that a perforin-dependent, NK-mediated, host-versus-graft (HVG) effect limits the rate of donor engraftment and T cell activation. Radiation-resistant natural killer T (NKT) cells survived in the BM of lethally irradiated mice and may drive NK cell activation, resulting in the HVG effect. Furthermore, reduced pretransplant irradiation doses in pfn−/− recipients permitted long-term donor <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> engraftment. These findings suggest that suppression of perforin activity or selective depletion of recipient NK cells before BMT {{could be used to}} improve donor stem cell engraftment, in turn allowing for the reduction of pretransplant conditioning...|$|R
