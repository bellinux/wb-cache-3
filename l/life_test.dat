High-brightness white light-emitting diodes (HBWLEDs) with high efficiency, environmental benefits, and high reliability have attracted increasing interest {{in the field of}} lighting systems. However, owing to the long lifetime of LEDs, traditional <b>life</b> <b>testing</b> methods for LEDs, which record only failure time, are time consuming and expensive. Therefore, designing an optimal <b>life</b> <b>testing</b> process for HBWLEDs is desirable for accelerating LED technology innovation and development. This paper applies the Six Sigma define-measure-Analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) approach to analyze the restrictions in the traditional <b>life</b> <b>testing</b> for HBWLEDs and optimize the <b>life</b> <b>testing</b> procedure. The goal is to shorten the testing time, reduce the testing operation cost, and maintain accurate reliability estimation. In this work, a general reliability estimation method with degradation data is developed by integrating a recursive unscented Kalman filter approach to estimate HBWLED reliability. The results show that, {{with the help of a}} recursive UKF, the accuracy of reliability estimation can be improved compared with the ordinary nonlinear least squares approach. Furthermore, the operation time and cost of LED <b>life</b> <b>testing</b> can be reduced by 57. 75 % and 71. 51 %, respectively, compared with traditional <b>life</b> <b>testing.</b> Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
