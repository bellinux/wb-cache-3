50|$|The Rohrbaugh R9 had no manual safety, <b>locking</b> <b>slide,</b> or {{magazine}} disconnect; {{the weapon}} could be fired with no magazine inserted. It had no sharp exterior edges or protrusions.|$|E
50|$|It {{features}} an integral accessory rail for mounting lasers and flashlights on Hi-Point rings. The safety {{is a combination}} lever for <b>locking</b> the <b>slide</b> and blocking the sear movement. The immediate drawback of this system is that the weapon cannot be cocked while the safety is on; the safety locks the trigger/sear, but the common misconception is that it only <b>locks</b> the <b>slide.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Secondary, {{internal}} <b>locks</b> — <b>sliding</b> bolts, {{hooks and}} speciality latches, metal blocks or bars mounted internally.|$|R
50|$|Insistent on {{fighting}} to the end, Scheckter {{continued to hold}} fourth, ahead of Fittipaldi, throwing the Tyrrell around in opposite <b>lock</b> <b>slides,</b> as the McLaren clung to his gearbox. On the 44th lap, Scheckter's engine suddenly lost fuel pressure when a feed pipe broke. He coasted to a stop as Fittipaldi slashed by, knowing that a second World Championship in three years was his.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the last}} round is fired and ejected, the <b>slide</b> will <b>lock</b> in the open position. There is no slide release on the Hi-Point [...]45 JHP, so {{releasing}} the slide is performed by pulling the <b>locked</b> <b>slide</b> further back. When another magazine is loaded into the weapon all that is necessary is a short pull back, unlike the full length pull to chamber the first round.|$|R
5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action <b>slide</b> <b>lock.</b> In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released the action <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release the action <b>slide</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Bauer [...]25 Automatic {{was made}} of {{precision}} machined 416 stainless steel investment castings and fitted by hand. The pistol features a two-position thumb safety. One position <b>locks</b> the <b>slide</b> while the other position <b>locks</b> the <b>slide</b> in the disassembly position, allowing the user to rotate the barrel clock-wise 45 degrees and remove the entire slide (rather than counterclockwise-as {{is the case with}} the FN Baby Browning pistol, to avoid copyright infringement claims from FN).|$|R
5000|$|The [...]460 Rowland {{cartridge}} sharply increases {{chamber pressure}} and gas volume {{when compared to}} [...]45 ACP cartridges, which drives projectiles to true [...]44 Magnum velocities as their specially tuned compensators momentarily <b>lock</b> <b>slide</b> action in order to vent gas pressure, allowing the slide to operate under near normal pressures. Higher chamber pressures deliver magnum level performance while the imperceptible delay in slide action allows the cartridge to be fired from many compact, lightweight, high capacity, autoloading pistols.|$|R

50|$|The {{stripping}} pin is {{retained in}} the frame when pushed to the side to strip and is separate from the <b>slide</b> <b>lock,</b> as on the Megastar. The <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> lever, magazine release and other features are reminiscent of the Megastar as well.|$|R

50|$|The various terms {{relate to}} the two {{functions}} of the component: while it automatically catches the <b>slide</b> (<b>locking</b> it back) after the magazine's last round has been fired, thereby allowing the user to easily release the slide by pulling down on the switch, it also allows the user to purposefully stop or <b>lock</b> the <b>slide</b> back by pressing up on the switch while racking the slide.|$|R

500|$|Of these improvements, the <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> is the {{one that}} made the Model 1897 into a safe firearm. This {{improved}} <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> kept the shotgun locked until actual firing occurred which prevented it from jamming {{in the case of a}} misfire. The <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> [...] "stands in such a relation to the body of the firing pin as will prevent the firing pin reaching the primer until the pin has moved forward a sufficient distance to insure locking of the breech bolt". This prevents the action sleeve [...] "from being retracted by the hand of the gunner until after firing, and hence rendering the firearm more safe".|$|R

2500|$|The Glock 17M, {{introduced}} in 2016, {{was created in}} response to an FBI solicitation for a new 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous <b>slide</b> <b>lock,</b> rounded <b>slide</b> nose profile, flared magwell with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 17M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling. As of 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. the South Carolina Highway Patrol and the Canadian Ontario Provincial Police [...] have adopted the pistol as standard.|$|R

5000|$|The gun is {{intended}} to be a single-shot weapon held in the palm of the hand with the barrel extending between the fingers. The trigger would be at the top, squeezed by the user's thumb. [...] Carmel stated, [...] "I was sitting in my workshop one day, playing around with a T-handled screwdriver. And I was thinking about the recurring problem I have with the seniors I teach, loading cartridges, <b>locking</b> <b>slides</b> and hand weakness… I was thinking minimalist. If I start with just a cartridge, what is the minimal thing I have to put around it in order to ignite the primer and send this projectile downrange?" [...] The T-handled screwdriver made Carmel realize that all he needed was a barrel, a breech, and a short butt or handle.|$|R
50|$|Field {{stripping}} {{is accomplished}} by <b>locking</b> the <b>slide</b> to the rear, rotating the takedown lever clockwise ninety degrees and releasing the slide stop while carefully allowing the slide to be pushed forward out of the frame. The barrel and recoil spring then separate from the slide to complete the disassembly procedure.|$|R

5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with <b>locking</b> <b>slides</b> and bolts—which {{could have been used}} for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|R
5000|$|Grendel P10 - {{introduced}} in 1988, the P10 is a [...]380 DAO with no levers with rudimentary sights {{and had a}} large trigger guard. It also had no detachable magazine and was loaded <b>locking</b> the <b>slide</b> back and feed ten rounds through the open chamber into the spring-loaded grip itself, usually with a stripper clip.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{to be used}} as a {{concealed}} carry self-defense weapon, the Nano has no external <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> or release. Additionally, the Nano has no external safety. The absence of these protruding controls reduces the likelihood of the weapon snagging on clothing during an occasion where a quick and clean draw is required. The <b>slide</b> <b>locks</b> in a rear position after the magazine has been emptied. A loaded magazine must then be installed, or the empty magazine withdrawn, and the slide must be pulled rearward, in order to cycle the slide completely.|$|R
50|$|The SIG Pro {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol. It uses {{a traditional}} Browning cam-operated locking system. The barrel <b>locks</b> into the <b>slide</b> via enlarged ejection port.|$|R
5000|$|Rob Curtis at GearScout {{praised the}} P320's smooth {{operation}} and good balance, calling it [...] "immensely controllable", but noted {{a problem with}} the <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> in both test units he tried.|$|R
5000|$|The FN Baby Browning {{is a small}} blowback-operated {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{designed by}} Dieudonné Saive based on a design by John Browning (among Browning's last designs) and chambered in [...]25 ACP (6.35×16mmSR). The pistol features a six-round magazine capacity and is a striker-fired, single action, blow back mechanism. The manual thumb operated safety <b>locks</b> the <b>slide</b> in the closed position when engaged using side thumb pressure.|$|R
50|$|The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with {{an exposed}} spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has an ambidextrous <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> and a fully ambidextrous {{magazine}} release {{installed in the}} trigger guard.|$|R
50|$|For example, on the {{illustration}} of a trombone, the leadpipe would be between #3 and #4, the mouthpiece and the <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> ring. In {{the illustration}} of a French horn, the leadpipe is #2.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} K100 has {{a barrel}} length of 108 mm and operates in both single- and double-action mode. The hammer must be manually decocked for carry in double-action mode with a chambered round. The safety {{can be applied}} with the hammer cocked, but can not be applied with the hammer in the forward position. The safety does not <b>lock</b> the <b>slide.</b> A decocking hammer group is available as an option on many models.|$|R
50|$|The first {{examples}} of the pistol had the safety on {{left side of the}} hammer, but later models moved the safety to {{the left side of the}} frame, where it could also <b>lock</b> the <b>slide.</b> A grip safety was provided on the military models. The pistol had dual ejectors. The slide stop was activated by the absence of a cartridge in the feedway, not by the magazine follower as in most automatics. A drift-adjustable rear sight had range-hashmarks in micrometers.|$|R
