50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{an early}} form of {{insulated}} cable, introduced in 1896, {{consisted of two}} impregnated-paper-insulated conductors in an overall lead sheath.

50|$|At {{some point}} in the 19th century the design was altered, {{probably}} by John Pinch. The pediment was moved to be above the attic storey, so that the attics of the central houses were not deprived of light. Palmer's plan had a carved tympanum in the pediment, but this was never made, probably {{due to a lack of}} funds. Pinch also added balconies with wrought iron railings on the piano nobile (first floor) of all the houses. The iron <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> over the entrances to Nos. 7 and 14 are also likely to be Pinch's work.|$|R

40|$|Heliodons {{have been}} {{developed}} to simulate the position of the sun in relation to a building model. Early heliodons (Dufton and Beckett 1931 : 509) simulated the position of the sun with a movable lamp bulb, impinging light onto a building model which had to be titled and rotated to simulate the required latitude and time. Later heliodons (Olgyay and Olgyay 1957 : 22 - 22; Phillips 1987) improved on operation convenience, allowing the building model to be placed horizontally, and stationary once the latitude is set. Other practitioners (Robbins 1986) examined annual insulation/shading on massing models by putting red, green, blue lamps (i. e. dichromatic lamps) respectively at June, September/ March, December locations of the <b>lamp</b> <b>holder</b> on the D & F heliodon (Dufton and Beckett 1931), thus improving its capability.
