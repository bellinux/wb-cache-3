25|$|In {{the final}} of the 1976 Wimbledon Championships, Evert faced off against old rival Goolagong. The first two sets were won via a break of the other {{opponent}} and Evert took the first set 63, which then Goolagong took the next set 46 in order to force a pivotal third set. During the roller-coaster decisive set there was plenty break of serves for both opponents, which the set lasted 50 minutes. Goolagong quickly ran out to a quick 02 lead in the third set, which she broke Evert in the second game of the set. Evert would break in the third and fifth games in order to take a marginal advantage in the set of 3 games to 0. Goolagong would not let the break lead stand for Evert and quickly broke back in the sixth game on Evert's serve for a tie at 3 games all. At this juncture of the set, Evert's game was <b>looking</b> <b>better</b> and more attuned to hitting better shots at the baseline and at the net. In the next two games both would hold serve to level the set at 4 games all, but in the ninth game Evert broke Goolagong to take a 5 games to 4 lead, which allowed her to serve for the match. Evert failed to maintain her nerves on serve and Googlagong forced her into three straight unforced errors that narrowed the set to 5 games all. Goolagong would hold her serve in the next service game to take a 5 to 6 games advantage, which Goolagong did not give Evert a single point during this game, and now in the next game Evert was just serving to stay in the match. Evert would show the steely-eyed determination, which she became known for, and held serve in the game to stay in the match and level it at 6 games all, and in the subsequent game Evert would again break the serve of Goolagong in order to serve for the match. In the fourteenth game, Evert would finally put away Googlagong on the only match point for the American with a lob shot, which Goolagong failed to reach the shot, and this was the second Wimbledon Singles title for her career.|$|E

2500|$|The {{show was}} almost universally {{critically}} panned. [...] Matt Roush {{wrote in his}} USA Today review that Curry [...] "gives it his maul", and that the show's leads seemed [...] "lost in the TV equivalent of summer stock". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly went one step further, likening it to a variation of The Odd Couple that possessed [...] "neither romantic spark nor crisp verbal byplay". [...] The Los Angeles Daily News claimed {{it was the worst}} new show of the season, and that if you tuned in to the show at 8:30, you would [...] "probably be watching something else by 8:38". TeeVee's Peter Ko wrote a lengthy review (which itself got some publicity nine years later) in which he heavily bashed Curry, then he went on to state, [...] "I have stood in a freezer full of dead people at the morgue. I have seen a man's scalp pulled back over his nose. I've even seen 35 minutes of Ellen DeGeneres's Mr. Wrong. But I can now honestly say that until Steve Carell's turn in the premiere of Over the Top, I have never known true horror." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales, on the other hand, was substantially kinder than most critics, saying [...] "the show seemed merely okay at first encounter," [...] but after seeing the season's other new shows, [...] "Over the Top is <b>looking</b> <b>better</b> and better. [...] I could almost kiss it right on the lips." ...|$|E
