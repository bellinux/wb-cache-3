500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan (English: As <b>Long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Live,</b> {{literally}} [...] "as long, or as far, {{as there}} is life") is a 2012 Indian romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra and written and produced by Aditya Chopra under their production banner, Yash Raj Films. The movie is the first collaboration between Khan and Kaif, and the second between Khan and Sharma (they previously featured in the 2008 film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi). Yash Chopra returned to directing eight years after Veer-Zaara. This was to be his final film {{before his death in}} October 2012, at age 80. The background score and soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics from Gulzar. The Film is loosely inspired on The end of the Affair by Graham Greene.|$|E

The most permanent lessons in morals are those which come, not of booky teaching, but of experience.|$|R
2500|$|Hoste's signal had a {{profound}} effect on his men. It was universally greeted with loud cheers and Captain Hornby of the Volage wrote of it later: [...] "Never again so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> shall I see so interesting or so glorious moment".|$|E
2500|$|How {{many more}} years I shall {{be able to work}} on the problem, I do not know; I hope, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live.</b> There can be no thought of finishing, for [...] "aiming at the stars", both {{literally}} and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, {{there were}} no {{mitigating}} factors in Shadrake's favour. The Court of Appeal stated that Shadrake had not shown any remorse, but had continued to stand by the statements he made. Following the High Court's ruling on liability but before it had sentenced him, Shadrake had also given an interview to the UK newspaper The Guardian, in which he described his book as [...] "devastatingly accurate" [...] and declared that [...] "his story is never going away. I'll keep it on the boil for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live.</b> They're going to regret they ever started this." [...] Furthermore, Shadrake had expressed an intention to produce a second edition of the book.|$|E
2500|$|After giving birth, while resting {{near the}} trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke [...] "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, {{wherever}} I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> and likewise to cherish my mother" [...] in order to dispel rumours of conception. This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and Arabic Infancy Gospel.|$|E
2500|$|The notion was {{initially}} ill-received due to {{concerns for the}} boys' safety. [...] A mother has been quoted saying, [...] "Camp! My children {{have always had a}} roof over their heads, and as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live,</b> always will!". They did have a roof over their heads because William Smith proceeded with the idea and 1st Glasgow Company held its inaugural one-week camp beginning on Friday, 16 July 1886, at Auchinlochan Hall, Tighnabruaich in a hall. In later years they took to canvas camping on a site at Portavadie in the Kyles of Bute. The First Glasgow continued to attend summer camp at the same location until the summer of 1974 when Portavadie was selected as the location of a proposed yard for the construction of oil production platforms. However the new camp is located only 100 yards away at Stilliag farm. This camp site is now used by many companies of the BB every summer for their camping trip.|$|E
6000|$|Only {{five years}} before, when {{listening}} to poor Professor Jameson's lectures on the effete Wernerianism, which {{at that time}} did duty for geological teaching, Darwin had found them [...] "incredibly dull," [...] and he declared that [...] "the sole effect they produced on me was a determination never so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> {{to read a book}} on Geology, or in any way to study the science." ...|$|R

2500|$|On {{his return}} to the House of Commons (17 December), he slipped into the Chamber largely {{unacknowledged}} by his own party. One Conservative MP rose to wave his Order Paper, only to have to sit down in embarrassment whilst Labour MPs laughed. On 18 December he addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers), declaring “as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>live,</b> I shall never apologise for what we did”, but was unable to answer a question about the validity of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 (which he had in fact reaffirmed in April 1955, two days before becoming Prime Minister). In his final statement to the House of Commons as Prime Minister (20 December 1956) he performed well in a difficult debate, but told MPs that [...] "there was not foreknowledge that Israel would attack Egypt". Victor Rothwell writes that the knowledge of his having misled the House of Commons on this way must have hung over him thereafter, as was the concern that the US Administration might demand that Britain pay reparations to Egypt. Papers released in January 1987 showed the entire Cabinet had been informed of the plan on 23 October 1956.|$|E

Everybody knows and respects you, and we can't do without your advice and counsel. But I won't put it on that ground.

60|$|He stood {{a little}} while hesitating, as if {{doubtful}} whether to take it or no; but I pressed it on him, and made him accept it, {{and it was not}} much less worth than his leather pouch full of Spanish gold; no, though it were to be reckoned as if at London, whereas it was worth twice as much there, where I gave it him. At length he took it, kissed it, told me the watch should be a debt upon him that he would be paying <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived.</b>|$|R
60|$|Let me say {{for myself}} that I was really {{touched by the}} {{kindness}} of my mother-in-law's letter, though I was not shaken by it in the smallest degree.

5000|$|I urged Mr. Johnson {{to accept}} my resignation. He refused and I was then {{elected to the}} office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors. I also urged Mr. Johnson to stop my salary of $25,000.00 per year, which they had kept up all during my illness, but Mr. Johnson replied that if the Victor Co. paid me that amount <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> they could not pay for what I had done for them. Twice, in the early days, by my action alone, I had saved the Victor Co. from going out of business.|$|R
