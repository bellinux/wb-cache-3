Considering the intercalation of the electron donors, some pure metals, several metallic alloys and even electronegative elements associated with electropositive metal lead to binary or ternary graphite intercalation compounds.

With globular grey cast iron Mg-Fe-O-C depositions dominated. At the beginning the layers may cover the whole tool-work piece contact area. But, with increasing wear, cutting forces and temperature the layers tend to move towards regions with lower cutting pressure. According to the brutto composition of the layers compounds with a relatively low melting point or with good deformability at cutting temperature may form which might reduce (up to a critical load) friction between tool and work piece or chip. The formation of a continuous "lubrication film" is more likely on smooth surfaces than on rough ones. But, the film does not necessarily protect the tool.

The methodology uses transient temperature fields as thermal loads for the non-linear structural finite-element analysis (FEA).

40|$|The narrow {{production}} {{window for}} compacted graphite iron material (CGI) drastically reduces {{the possibilities to}} produce it in small batches outside an industrial environment. This fact hinders laboratory-scale investigations on CGI solidiï¬cation. This work presents a solution to that issue by introducing an experimental technique to produce graphitic cast iron of the main three families. Samples of a base hypereutectic spheroidal graphite iron (SGI) were re-melted in a resistance furnace under Ar atmosphere. Varying the holding time at 1723 K (1450 Â°C), graphitic irons ranging from spheroidal to lamellar were produced. Characterization of the graphite morphology evolution, in terms of nodularity {{as a function of}} holding time, is presented. The nodularity decay for the SGI region suggests a linear correlation with the holding time. In the CGI region, nodularity deterioration shows a slower rate, concluding with the sudden appearance of <b>lamellar</b> <b>graphite.</b> The fading process of magnesium, showing agreement with previous researchers, is described by means of empirical relations as a function of holding time and nodularity. The results on nodularity fade and number of nodules per unit area fade suggest that both phenomena occur simultaneously during the fading process of magnesium.

The ductile iron has already {{been the subject of}} many studies especially since the literature is rich on them, and sources of information are different. The fact is that the mechanical properties of nodular cast iron (FGS) depend on the number of graphitegrains, their roundness, the solidification rate and nature of the matrix [3]. Many studies of nodular cast irons showed that the morespherical particles of graphite, the higher the mechanical properties are high. In gray cast irons, the graphite spheroids have anticrackingand give the ductile iron ductility. Note in this connection that the higher the number of graphite grains, the higher theductile iron has better mechanical properties. In cast iron, the nature of the matrix is depending on several parameters including thecooling rate of molten metal, the thickness, shape and dimensions of parts. The faster cooling is slow over rate of ferrite is important[3, 4].

Light and scanning electron microscopic investigations were done to characterise the individual microstructure, e. g. different graphite precipitates, in particular <b>lamellar</b> <b>graphite</b> (EN-GJL- 250), nodular graphite (EN-GJS- 600) and compacted graphite (EN-GJV- 400).

This data represent the actual fatigue state. The cyclic deformation behaviour is dominated by cyclic hardening processes and graphite-matrix debonding. The physically based fatigue life calculation method âPHYBALâ was modified to the specific requirements of more inhomogeneous materials like cast irons. On the basis of fatigue data determined in only nine fatigue tests, the enhanced method âPHYBALSBâ allows the calculation of Woehler (S-N) curves for different probabilities of failure (Scatter-Bands).

40|$|Cast iron {{materials}} {{are used as}} materials for cylinder heads for heavy duty internal combustion engines. These components must withstand severe cyclic mechanical and thermal loads throughout their service life. While high-cycle fatigue (HCF) is dominant for the material in the water jacket region, the combination of thermal transients with mechanical load cycles results in thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) of the material in the fire deck region, even including superimposed TMF and HCF loads. Increasing {{the efficiency of the}} engines directly leads to increasing combustion pressure and temperature and, thus, lower safety margins for the currently used cast iron materials or alternatively the need for superior cast iron materials. In this paper (Part I), the TMF properties of the <b>lamellar</b> <b>graphite</b> cast iron GJL 250 and the vermicular graphite cast iron GJV 450 are characterized in uniaxial tests and a mechanism-based model for TMF life prediction is developed for both materials.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} pinholes in castings by reaction between cast iron with compacted graphite and green sand mould. Methodology: Experiments were done on bar castings moulded in green bentonite mixtures without carbonaceous matters. Moulding sand moisture and aluminium content in the melt were purposely changed. Metal was melted in a 100 kg furnace by remelting the uniform charge of return material. Metal was inoculated all at once in a ladle and modified in a reaction chamber in a mould or as sandwich method in a pouring ladle. Findings: The formation of pinholes was not caused by high moisture of the mould but this defect was sensible to aluminium content in metal. In castings with high aluminium content > 0. 2 % the pinholes occurred in high numbers, and namely under low and also high moistures (> 4 %). In previous melts with aluminium contents < 0. 02 % defects occurred in small range. Practical implications: Thus the conclusions known from literature {{about the influence of}} Al on pinholes occurrence in cast irons were confirmed. Oxygen activity in metal during its flowing and cooling in the mould was also measured but this quantity was not changed too in dependence on pinholes content. Morphological analyses near the defect have indicated that it is a physical type of pinholes caused by hydrogen. Originality: A number of works were aimed at explanation of causes of pinholes formation in <b>lamellar</b> <b>graphite</b> iron castings and spheroidal graphite ones. But this defect is formed in castings from compacted graphite cast iron too and the research was aimed just to this material. The contribution is in such a way an exceptional one...|$|E
