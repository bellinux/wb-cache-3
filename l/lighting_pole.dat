40|$|Abstract. Street {{lighting}} system {{is an essential}} structure {{for the safety of}} traffic. Most of the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is made of steel and it is vulnerable to corrosion due to its hazardous surrounding environment. To mitigate such corrosion problems, stainless steel and iron steel are usually adopted, but they are also usually manufactured by hand, so it is not economical. Therefore, to overcome such problems new type FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is proposed. In recent years, FRP materials in the construction market are popularly utilized as an alternative for conventional construction materials. FRP material is known to have many advantages such as high chemical resistance, electro-magnetic transparency, high specific strength and stiffness, etc. In this paper, structural behavior of FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is compared with that of conventional <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> structures and we proposed the cross-section configuration of the FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> with details on the manufacturing procedure...|$|E

Previous study of these vibrations and the consequent fatigue and failure of the structures was primarily based on analytical formulation and laboratory tests, and the effort {{has been focused on}} some specific perceived types of oscillations. The prototype aerodynamic behavior of <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> structures still need to be further investigated. This paper presents an interpretation of the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> vibrations observed through a long-term full-scale measurement project. Based on this interpretation, the excitation mechanisms that induced the vibrations were identified. ...|$|E

Active and passive safety deals with different concepts, the first to prevent an accident, the second to reduce the risks of occupant injury during an accident, but both lead to the same objective: safety. In this work, the role of a crashworthy <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is discussed in order to assure a higher level of safety. Crash tests on an existing aluminium alloy <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> have been carried out, at the LAST Laboratory of the Aerospace Engineering Department of the Politecnico di Milano, to get sufficient data to create a numerical model of both the car and the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole.</b> Modifications to the pole have been investigated {{with the use of a}} multi-body program called VeDyAC, to verify the possibility of successfully fulfilling the European standard EN 12767 “Passive safety of support structures for road equipment – Requirements and test methods”. First results appear encouraging but further analysis has to be carried out, particularly on the base of the pole, which is the major part involved in the contact with the vehicle during the crash event. Results of experimental tests and numerical simulations with different solutions are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{cracking}} {{reported in}} a <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> on an elevated bridge structure near Wellington {{raised the question of}} how to better design for and predict the fatigue life of lighting poles subject to wind induced fatigue. There have been concerns as to the reliability and currency of the methods commonly used in New Zealand. The paper therefore reviews current international design methods and describes the development of an improved fatigue design method for lighting poles in New Zealand. The new method uses fracture mechanics based crack growth formulations in conjunction with a modified J. D. Holmes Method for wind response analysis of the pole to varying wind speeds. Cumulative crack growth is calculated iteratively rather than using an S-N curve based Palmegran-Miner summation. Wind spectra used in the method are developed from long term meteorological records at representative locations. Software has been prepared to enable quick assessment of the expected fatigue life of lighting poles, and associated gear openings and holding down bolts The method and software has been calibrated with reference to full scale laboratory fatigue proof testing of representative base stubs and natural wind response testing of a 12 m high <b>lighting</b> <b>pole...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} under taken to {{understand}} the failures of slender flexible street pole structures under dynamic excitation due to wind loads. It also focuses on the most plausible collapse cause {{for the failure of}} the poles. Highway lighting poles as slender flexible structures with low-level of inherent damping undergo wind-induced vibrations. Two different types of steel pole sections have been considered in this study, viz. one with a single horizontal arm and luminaire, called the single luminaire and the other with two horizontal arms and luminaires known as the double luminaire both with a tapering hollow circular section. The models have been analyzed using SAP 2000 by adopting the finite element method. The poles have been analyzed for equivalent static force considering the gust effect factor and wind load has been calculated based on three codes of reference namely AASHTO CODE, UBC CODE and IS 875 CODE. Wind gusts are the extremes of the turbulent, stochastic wind field. Most of the lighting poles sway under gust and are subjected to fatigue cracking due to wind induced harmonic resonance of the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole.</b> This causes failure at the junction between base plate and the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole.</b> In order to better understand the interaction of the pole structures with wind forces, it is beneficial to have a graphical representation of the problem. The deflection at the tip of poles has been compared with different codes to gauge the performance of the poles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the fatigue {{analysis}} of slender structures subjected to the wind action. A 50 -year conditioned Monte Carlo simulation of the bending moment {{at the base of}} a steel <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is performed. Long-term simulations of the static part of the bending moment, related to the mean wind speed, are combined with short-term fluctuations due to the turbulence. Multiple time series of the stress at the base of the pole, with length ranging between 10 min and 3 days, are generated and processed by means of the Rainflow counting algorithm. The resulting large size data set of the fatigue damage is analyzed in order to clarify some cloudy issues related to the fatigue analysis: the contribution to the damage of the low-frequency, large-amplitude cycles in the stress-time series; the contribution of the transition cycles between consecutive wind states; the length of the stress-time series necessary to get a reliable stress cycle histogram in the framework of the classical state approach; the variability of the damage resulting from a given mean wind speed; the variability of the annual damage...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} the forward application of TRIZ to generate new inventive ideas for the solution of difficult problems, and to explain how TRIZ builds a creative momentum in its reasoning approach. A systematic application of various TRIZ tools can rapidly generate workable solutions for almost any systemic, chronic, evolutionary or inventive challenge. The survival of a business in today's highly competitive environment is largely determined by the ability of its key personnel to quickly analyse and solve often intractable problems. How quickly this is done is an indication of the vitality of the enterprise. The underlying framework of TRIZ enables complex problems to be rapidly processed in manageable portions. We consider a collision between a speeding vehicle and a large timber utility or <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> as one such chronic problem that has remained unsolved for a long time.

40|$|Abstract: The {{technology}} of mobile laser scanning (MLS) has developed rapidly in recent years. This speedy development {{is evidenced by}} the emergence of a variety of MLS systems in commercial market and academic institutions. However, the producers tend to supply the specifications of the individual sensors in a generic sense, and this is not enough for guiding the choice of a MLS system for a specific application case. So far, the research efforts comparing the efficacy ranges of the existing MLS systems have been little reported. To fill this gap, this study examined the performance of three typical MLS systems (Riegl VMX- 250, Roamer and Sensei) in terms of target representation. Retrievals of window areas and <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> radiuses served as representative cases, as these parameters correspond to the spatial scales from meter to centimeter. The evaluations showed that the VMX- 250 with highest sampling density did best, and thus, it was preferred in the scenario of this study. If both the cost and efficacy were regarded, Roamer was a choice of compromise. Therefore, an application-oriented scheme was suggested for selecting MLS systems to acquire the desired performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{pedestrian}} crossing lights, finding a safe moment to cross the road is often hazardous and challenging, especially for people with visual impairments. We present a reliable low-cost solution, an Android device attached to a traffic sign or <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> near the crossing, indicating whether {{it is safe to}} cross the road. The indication can be by sound, display, vibration, and various communication modalities provided by the Android device. The integral system camera is aimed at approaching traffic. Optical flow is computed from the incoming video stream, and projected onto an influx map, automatically acquired during a brief training period. The crossing safety is determined based on a 1 -dimensional temporal signal derived from the projection. We implemented the complete system on a Samsung Galaxy K-Zoom Android smartphone, and obtained real-time operation. The system achieves promising experimental results, providing pedestrians with sufficiently early warning of approaching vehicles. The system can serve as a stand-alone safety device, that can be installed where pedestrian crossing lights are ruled out. Requiring no dedicated infrastructure, it can be powered by a solar panel and remotely maintained via the cellular network. Comment: Planned submission to "Pattern Recognition Letters...|$|E

Automatic detection and extraction of street <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> are a challenging task in road scenes. This is {{mainly because of}} complex road scenes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a full-scale crash test into an energy absorbing <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> situated on an unlevel or sloped roadside. With poles representing approximately one third of single vehicle accidents involving roadside objects it is important to ascertain the performance of luminaire supports in the Australian road environment. Operational performance of some pole types in unlevel road environments seriously diminishes the safe and predictable performance of lighting poles. This research utilises a full-scale crash test with an instrumented vehicle and dummy to determine performance of the pole. Analysis of the data acquired during the test was conducted to determine the performance of the appurtenance and effect of an unlevel roadside on the test outcome. The test results suggest that the test article is suitable for use on Australian roadsides, particularly sloped roadsides, pending some minor changes to the design. The study is limited to one full-scale test due to the inherently high cost of full-scale destructive testing. It is recommended that further testing of Australian poles be conducted to allow the refinement of Australian appurtenances making Australian roads more forgiving, reducing the number of lives lost each year in Australia due to road crashes...|$|E

The flat and bent LSC-PV elements were also simulated using optical modeling and the resulting performance parameters from simulations and experiments were compared. From simulations for a flat LSC-PV, the optical collection efficiency, concentration and electrical conversion efficiencies were found to be 18 %, 1. 8 % and 2. 8 %, respectively, for a geometric gain of 10. For a bent LSC-PV shape, the respective values are 21 %, 1. 4 % and 3. 4 % for a geometric gain of 6. 7.
