5|$|The massive Islamic {{invasions of}} the mid-7th century began a long {{struggle}} between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost {{the lands of}} the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople, the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean, the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages. The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed Siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for a civil power to protect it. In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States. Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticised the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I. Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division.|$|E

25|$|While {{continuing}} {{attacks on}} the Narva front, the Stavka had begun to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for their breakthrough. A new offensive, codenamed Bagration after the Napoleonic-era Russian field marshal, was launched on 22 June against Army Group Centre.|$|E
25|$|Jim Pennycook {{was invited}} {{back to the}} Arena in a playing {{capacity}} but Arena management were to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for a coach this season. An experienced Scotsman came to the helm; brother of former Hawk John, Bobby Haig, was the man charged with bringing back the teams' former glory.|$|E
25|$|After the Chinese Exclusion Act {{was passed}} in 1882, American {{industrialists}} began to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for reliable sources of cheap labor. The Japanese government had forbidden emigration since 1868, but in the 1880s it relaxed some of its restrictions. In 1884, the government of Hawaii offered to subsidize the transport of Japanese labourers to its territory, and advertised a set of conditions under which the migrants would be employed on its sugar plantations.|$|E

25|$|Allaire had {{up until}} {{this point in his}} career been able to borrow to meet cash shortfalls, but with the {{recession}} affecting demand for his products, he was obliged to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for working capital. In 1842, he sold shares in the Allaire Iron Works, which was incorporated for the sum of $300,000. Shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt and Allaire's brother-in-law John Haggerty were thus able to eventually gain a controlling interest in the company.|$|E
25|$|Genesis {{explains}} circumcision as {{a covenant}} with God given to Abraham, but some scholars reject the historicity of these accounts and <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for {{the origin of}} Jewish circumcision. One explanation, dating from Herodotus, is that the custom was acquired from the Egyptians, possibly {{during the period of}} enslavement. A competing hypothesis, based on linguistic/ethnographic work begun in the 19th century, suggests circumcision was a common tribal custom among many Semitic tribes, including Jews, Arabs and Phoenicians.|$|E
25|$|With the {{government}} of Australia declining to provide direct military support and advocating a political solution to the conflict, Chan began to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> The Sandline affair began in March 1996, when {{the government}} of Papua New Guinea attempted to hire mercenaries from Sandline International, a London-based private military company, that in turn employed the South African military contractor Executive Outcomes. As negotiations with Sandline continued, in July the PNGDF launched a new offensive on Bougainville. However, the attack failed, suffering from poor logistical planning, a lack of intelligence on BRA locations and mounting casualties.|$|E

25|$|American Honda Motor Company {{is based}} in Torrance, California. Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) is Honda's {{motorcycle}} racing division. Honda Canada Inc. is headquartered in Markham, Ontario, it was originally planned to be located in Richmond Hill, Ontario, but delays led them to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Their manufacturing division, Honda of Canada Manufacturing, {{is based in}} Alliston, Ontario. Honda has also created joint ventures around the world, such as Honda Siel Cars and Hero Honda Motorcycles in India, Guangzhou Honda and Dongfeng Honda in China, Boon Siew Honda in Malaysia and Honda Atlas in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy the Gaza Strip until 1967. Egypt never annexed the Gaza Strip, but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor. The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine, roughly a quarter of those who fled or were expelled from their homes during, and in the aftermath of, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War into Gaza resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living. Because the Egyptian government restricted movement to and from the Gaza Strip, its inhabitants could not <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for gainful employment.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantity}} and quality of jobs in the cigar industry would continue to fall as Tampa's manufacturers underwent a near-universal shift to mechanization. Replacing traditional hand-rolled cigars with machine-made varieties allowed cigar firms to employ fewer workers and pay them less. Even when demand quickly increased to record levels during American's post-war boom, the number of workers employed in Ybor City's factories continued to decrease due to more efficient machines. By then, Tampa's economy was buoyed by other industries such as shipping and tourism. However, little new activity had replaced cigar manufacturing in Ybor City, and job seekers often had to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for employment.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Melling {{switched}} the car's number and manufacture to 92 and Dodge {{and had a}} new crew chief with Chad Knaus. Compton started the season by qualifying on the outside pole next to Bill Elliott in the Daytona 500 {{and went on to}} score a 10th-place finish. At the next restrictor-plate race at Talladega Superspeedway, he won his first career Cup pole position, but finished last due to mechanical issues. After winning a second career pole at Talladega, he was only able to improve his points position by five spots. At the end of the year, sponsorship problems at Melling forced him to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for a job.|$|E
25|$|According to Lewis, this {{reduction}} {{resulted in}} Arabs who wanted slaves having to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> {{to avoid the}} restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands, primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll. Patrick Manning states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in Arabian Peninsula {{and to a lesser}} degree for the whole area of the whole Umayyad Caliphate where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that {{with the passage of time}} and the extension of Islam, Islam by recognizing and codifying slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.|$|E
25|$|Campbell {{continued}} to play for England after Euro 2004, although {{his place in the}} international team had become less secure since the emergence of the central defensive partnership of Terry and Ferdinand, which blossomed during Campbell's period of absence with injury in 2005. He was named in England's squad for the 2006 World Cup, but was third-choice centre back, with coach Sven-Göran Eriksson preferring the partnership of Ferdinand and Terry. However, after a knock to Ferdinand, Campbell came on as a substitute in England's group match against Sweden, which made him the first player to represent England on the pitch at six consecutive international tournaments. After Eriksson's resignation, new coach Steve McClaren choose to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for central defensive strength and Campbell was dropped for his first match in charge against Greece in August 2006.|$|E
5|$|Following failed {{negotiations}} with the Dallas Mavericks to re-sign with the franchise, Barea started <b>looking</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> {{but because of the}} NBA lockout, he was unable to sign anywhere. On December 14, 2011, following the conclusion of the lockout, Barea signed a four-year, $19 million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves.|$|R
50|$|Performers became {{dissatisfied}} with their position within the Joint Promotions and soon <b>looked</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for exposure mainly outside the UK as a whole. As a result, there was a rise in New Japan and Calgary's junior-heavyweight divisions, both of which had their roots in British wrestling of the time.|$|R
50|$|United's other summer signing was 18-year-old Bradford City striker Graeme Tomlinson, who had {{impressed}} {{after six}} goals in 17 {{games for the}} Division Two club and cost United a £500,000 fee as Ferguson took {{the unusual step of}} <b>looking</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for squad depth in the shape of younger players.|$|R
25|$|When the Great Smoky Mountains National Park {{was opened}} in 1934, the Tennessee Valley Authority {{reported}} {{that there were no}} tourism-oriented businesses in Pigeon Forge. By the 1950s, improvements to US-441 led to the establishment of a few campgrounds and lodges, but little that would generate major revenue. During this period, however, two factors in nearby Gatlinburg would lead to the commercial boom Pigeon Forge would experience {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century. First, Gatlinburg, itself surrounded by high mountain ridges, had limited land resources. Second, the land resources it did have were largely controlled by a few local families who thwarted attempts by outside businesses to take advantage of the town's prime location. Thus, outside entrepreneurs were forced to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Pigeon Forge, being just north of Gatlinburg along US-441, was a target.|$|E
25|$|After losing Brian Conklin to Puerto Rico, the Sharks {{were forced}} to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere</b> to rebuild their roster for the 2015 season. Having {{retained}} guard Kevin Braswell as their import for another season, the Sharks looked to the Townsville Crocodiles again {{as a source for}} their second import. 2014–15 Australian NBL Most Improved Player Todd Blanchfield, a teammate of Conklin's, was signed by the Sharks as the team's second import for the 2015 season. A strong starting line-up for the Sharks was built with the additions of Duane Bailey and Adrian Majstrovich, and the re-signing of forward Tai Wesley. Shea Ili was also retained by the Sharks after being given a life line by the team following his incident in New Plymouth the year before. With Ili playing a sixth man role, the Sharks now had a number of scoring options and depth.|$|E
25|$|Lucasfilm hired Charles Lippincott as {{marketing}} director for Star Wars. As 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to <b>look</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation, and with Del Rey Books for a novelization. A fan of science fiction, he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic-Con and elsewhere within science fiction fandom. Worried that Star Wars would be beaten out by other summer films, such as Smokey and the Bandit, 20th Century Fox moved the release date to May 25, the Wednesday before Memorial Day. However, fewer than 40 theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, the studio demanded that theaters order Star Wars if they wanted the eagerly anticipated The Other Side of Midnight {{based on the novel}} by the same name.|$|E
50|$|When these {{original}} donors {{began to}} pull funding from Gaviotas in the 1990s, the villagers <b>looked</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for their income. They realized that the impressive pine forest was a sustainable source of pine resin used {{in the production of}} a wide variety of products like turpentine and violins.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Lever was using palm oil {{produced}} in the British West African colonies. When he found difficulties in obtaining more palm plantation concessions, he started <b>looking</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in other colonies. In 1911, Lever visited the Belgian Congo {{to take advantage of}} cheap labour and palm oil concessions in that country.|$|R
