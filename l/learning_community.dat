40|$|The {{beginning}} {{of the twenty-first century}} heralds a shift in emphasis from learning with the focus on the individual to learning as part of a community. The concept of “learning communities” is currently one that is to the fore of much educational and organisational literature and discussion. In the literature, however, the term “learning communities” is being defined and used in diverse and flexible ways. As well as <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> that are geographically defined, there has been growth in accessing learning through participation in “communities of common purpose”. Information and communication technologies have facilitated the emergence and rapid growth of <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> whose members interact from remote corners of the globe to form online <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> This paper explores the ways in which <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> are defined, and the commonalities, blurred boundaries and close associations that are apparent between <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> and other contemporary areas of interest, such as lifelong <b>learning,</b> social capital, <b>communities</b> of practice and distributed cognition. The Faculty of Education at the University of Tasmania has acknowledged the potential that <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> offer for the new century, and the benefits that can flow from an improved understanding of the concept, by adopting <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> as the key metaphor of its research.

40|$|Background: Because <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> of {{community}} care nurses and nursing lectures {{are a new}} phenomenon, it is of interest to evaluate en monitor the <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research, NIVEL, was commissioned to monitor {{the realization of the}} <b>learning</b> <b>communities,</b> on behalf of ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. Materials and methods: This introductory presentation is based on the first steps of the process evaluation of the <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> Information about the realization of the <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> was extracted from documents (project plans, progress and final reports, reports of the consultation rounds among project leaders). Results: The nursing schools and home care organizations had some requirements, but also much liberty in shaping the <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> This resulted in a lot of similarities, but also some differences between the <b>learning</b> <b>communities.</b> Important similarities are the focus on promoting the competences regarding self-reliance and self-management support. Other similarities concern the fact that many nursing lecturers have internships in home care organizations. Furthermore, community care nurses are in general involved in nursing education by guest lecturing. Moreover, community care nurses are also often trained in coaching nurse student interns. A final similarity is that <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> aim to share products of learning activities with others via, for instance, symposia. Important differences concern the number of targeted competences, number of learning activities and also the number of home care organizations involved. In addition, there are also differences in the extent the <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> use digital platforms and other ICT. Knowledge is being digitally shared via newsletters, factsheets, webinars and video presentations. Conclusion: In 2015 / 2016 ten <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> for community care nursing were launched. This has been an important step to enhance collaboration between community care nurses and nursing lecturers. It is expected that <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> will contribute to new competences that are needed to support that elderly and chronically ill people can remain at home as long as possible...|$|R

Themes around which the courses are structured are broad concepts usually selected by the participating faculty of the linked courses. Some <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> have implemented peer advisors and incorporated some kind of social activity combined with learning. Some have a seminar for the students involved in the community. Promoting a basic course as an important component in the <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> especially when team teaching is utilized is also a way of breaking the isolation experienced by many faculty members. <b>Learning</b> <b>communities</b> have the potential to decrease communication apprehension.
