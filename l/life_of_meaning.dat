5000|$|With the Scientific Revolution, and {{subsequent}} secularization of Europe, the overwhelming success {{of science and}} technology eroded belief in the existence of the transcendent god. Eventually, mankind became disenchanted with and alienated from the world. 20th century man tended to find spirituality in modern psychology rather than in traditional religion. Finally, in postmodern thought, meaning is seen as projected onto or constructed in an empty, meaningless world.Thus the modern condition begins as a Promethean movement toward human freedom, toward autonomy from the encompassing matrix of nature, toward individuation from the collective, yet gradually and ineluctably the Cartesian-Kantian condition evolves into a Kafka-Beckett-like state of existential isolation and absurdity--an intolerable double bind leading to a kind of deconstructive frenzy.The contemporary world of postmodern thought, according to Tarnas, is caught [...] "between the inner craving for a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> and the relentless attrition of existence in a cosmos that our rational scientific world view has assured us is empty, dead, devoid of all purpose." ...|$|E

This study examines {{the relationships among}} these character strengths, including Happiness, Life Purpose and Life Satisfaction as valued by Singapore Chinese, Malays, Indians and Other Asians and Caucasians. A sample of Singapore adults (N = 304) completed an online survey in English comprising four measures, the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, the Orientations to Happiness Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Life Engagement Test. Results show that Zest, Hope, Curiosity, Capacity to Love and Gratitude are the top five character strengths of the sampled Singaporeans. Happiness orientation through pursuing a <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> <b>Meaning</b> is preferred by all four ethnic groups. Ethnic differences are found for character strengths of Kindness, Humour, Gratitude, and Religiousness and Spirituality. <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> <b>Meaning</b> and Life of Engagement, Happiness orientations and character strengths of Curiosity and Perseverance are direct predictors of Life Purpose. In turn, Life Purpose and character strengths of Capacity to Love and Gratitude {{are found to be}} direct predictors of Life Satisfaction.

40|$|Peterson, Park, and Seligman (2005) {{developed}} the Orientations to Happiness (OTH) questionnaire to measure three routes to happiness: life of pleasure (hedonism), life of engagement (flow) and <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> (eudemonia). The questionnaire {{was translated into}} German in several steps (independent translations by five experts, creation of the initial version by committee approach, retranslation, modification, and final version). Data were collected in paper-pencil (N = 1, 152) and Internet samples (N = 4, 174). The OTH scales showed satisfactory internal consistencies (. 63 ≤ α ≤. 76) and stability across 6 months (all ≥. 63). The factorial structure of the German OTH was analyzed (RMSEA ≤. 074 and SRMR ≤. 043 for the 3 -factor solution) in both samples.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to adapt the Scale of Happiness Orientations, which was developed by Peterson, Park, and Seligman (2005), into Turkish and examine the psychometric properties of the scale. The participants of the research consist of 489 students. The psychometric properties of the scale was examined with test methods; linguistic equivalence, descriptive factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, criterion-related validity, internal consistency, and test-retest. For criterion-related validity (concurrent validity), the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire-Short Form is used. Articles resulting from the descriptive factor analysis for structural validity of scale were summed into three factors (<b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> life of pleasure, life of engagement) in accordance with the original form. Confirmatory factor analysis conducted yielded the value of three-factor fit indexes of 18 items: (χ 2 /df= 1. 94, RMSEA=. 059, CFI=. 96, GFI=. 95, IFI=. 95, NFI=. 96, RFI=. 95 and SRMR=. 044). Factor load of the scale ranges from. 36 to. 59. During criterion-validity analysis, between Scale of Happiness Orientations and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, positive strong relations were seen at the level of p<. 01 significance level.

40|$|There {{are deep}} {{connections}} between {{education and the}} question <b>of</b> <b>life's</b> <b>meaning,</b> which derive, ultimately, from the fact that, for human beings, how to live—and therefore, how to raise one's children—is not a given but a question. One might see the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> as constitutive <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> education, and answers to the question <b>of</b> <b>life's</b> <b>meaning</b> {{might be seen as}} justifying (a particular form of) education. Our focus, however, lies on the contributory relation: our primary purpose is to investigate whether and how education might contribute to children's ability to find meaning in life or at least deal with the question. This issue is not only theoretically interesting (though relatively neglected) —it also has practical urgency. For people have a need for meaning that, if unfulfilled, leads to personal and potentially social crises—a need that often expresses itself first and strongly in adolescence; and there are reasons to have doubts about the contribution of today's traditional formal education system to the meaningfulness of children's (and future adults’) lives. We argue for the importance of frameworks of values, as well as for a greater emphasis on the affective dimension <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> though we reject pure subjectivism. The underlying purpose of this article, however, is not to argue for a particular comprehensive position, but to persuade philosophers of education {{of the importance of the}} issue <b>of</b> <b>life's</b> <b>meaning</b> in thinking about education today...|$|R

40|$|Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) {{infection}} is highly prevalent in South Africa and inevitably {{leads to an}} acute stage of the disease referred to as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Individual variations {{in the rate of}} HIV-disease progression are, amongst others, a function of the psychological reactions to an HIV-positive diagnosis and the prevalence of psychosocial stressors. This study was conducted {{in the context of the}} salutogenic paradigm and the existential psychological theory of Viktor Frankl. Sense of coherence is a key salutogenic concept and previous studies have suggested a positive correlation between the sense of coherence and the wellbeing of HIV-positive individuals. The objectives of this research were to explore and describe the search for meaning in <b>life,</b> the presence <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> in <b>life,</b> the sense <b>of</b> coherence and the potential relationships among these concepts in HIV-positive adults. The research sample consisted of 62 participants recruited from an HIV wellness clinic in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan area.
