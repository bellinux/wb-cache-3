5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
