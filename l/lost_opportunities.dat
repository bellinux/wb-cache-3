5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Alonso moved back into the lead of the Drivers' Championship on 231 points. Webber's failure to score meant he fell to second, eleven points behind Alonso. Hamilton's second-place finish resulted in him moving ahead of Vettel, with Button remaining in fifth. Red Bull still led the Constructors' Championship despite not getting both cars to the finish. McLaren remained in second with 399 points; Ferrari had caught up to McLaren, the gap between the two teams reduced to 25 points with two races of the season remaining. Given Alonso's new lead, Vettel acknowledged his team had the fastest car in the season's two remaining races and remained confident of winning the Drivers' Championship. After the conclusion of the championship in Vettel's favour by four points, Webber's manager Flavio Briatore highlighted the Korean Grand Prix as one of Webber's most obvious <b>lost</b> <b>opportunities</b> in his bid to win the title.|$|E

The Indian {{international}} Sourav Ganguly was the only Glamorga bowler to come out with some credit, as he got one wicket for 19 in his five overs. Worcestershire started creditably, snaring the wicket of Robert Croft in the second over, but Glamorgan sent out another pinch-hitter in Alex Wharf who made 38 before he was bowled bu David Leatherdale who took two for 35. However, Sourav Ganguly with 53, Michael Powell with 82, and David Hemp with an unbeaten 51 off 36 balls chased down the target. The Glamorgan batsman took a particular liking to England Test spinner Gareth Batty who finished wicketless for 69 runs.|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to the <b>opportunity</b> principle, the <b>lost</b> <b>opportunity</b> principle directly opposes its views. The <b>lost</b> <b>opportunity</b> principle states that regret should intensify, not diminish, when people feel {{that they could have}} made better choices in the past but now perceive limited opportunities to take corrective action in the future. [...] "People who habitually consider future consequences (and how they may avoid future negative outcomes) experience less, rather than more, intense regret after a negative outcome." [...] This principle offers another reason as to why education is the most regretted aspect in life. Education becomes a more limited opportunity as time passes. Aspects such as making friends, becoming more spiritual, and community involvement tend to be less regrettable which makes sense because these are also aspects in life that do not become limited opportunities. As the opportunity to remedy a situation passes, feelings of hopelessness may increase. An explanation of the <b>Lost</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Principle {{can be seen as a}} lack of closure. Low closure makes past occurrences feel unresolved. Low closure is associated with [...] "reductions in state self-esteem and persistent negative affect over time". Because high closure is associated with acceptance of <b>lost</b> <b>opportunity,</b> low closure is then associated with the realization and regret of <b>lost</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|R
25|$|Labour Party historians see {{his years}} in office as <b>lost</b> <b>opportunities</b> for major reforms. However, {{in keeping with the}} mood of the 1960s his {{government}} sponsored liberal changes in a number of social areas; they were generally not his initiatives. These included the liberalisation of laws on censorship, divorce, homosexuality, immigration, and abortion; as well as the abolition of capital punishment, which was {{due in part to the}} initiatives of backbench MPs who had the support of Roy Jenkins during his time as Home Secretary. Overall, Wilson is seen to have managed a number of difficult political issues with considerable tactical skill, including such potentially divisive issues for his party as the role of public ownership, British membership of the European Community, and the Vietnam War, while continuing to maintain a costly military presence East of Suez. His stated ambition of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance remained largely unfulfilled. He lost his energy and drive in his second government, and accomplished little as the leadership split over Europe and trade union issues began tearing Labour apart.|$|E
