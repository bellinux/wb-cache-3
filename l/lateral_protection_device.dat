To understand the physical characteristics and ESD robustness of <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> a transmission line pulsing generator (TLPG) system had been set up in several companies to measure the secondary breakdown characteristics of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> The ESD level of ESD <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in CMOS IC’s is linearly dependent on the secondary breakdown current (It 2) of the ESD <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> The TLPG system is therefore used to measure and analyze the secondary breakdown characteristics of ESD <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> Based on the understanding on the secondary breakdown characteristics of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> some circuit techniques can be developed to improve the protection efficiency of the on-chip ESD protection circuits in the deep-submicron CMOS technologies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Since we {{reported}} about a landmark technique to reopen an occluded subclavian artery, we have faced difficulty in using <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in the vertebral artery {{to protect against}} thromboembolism from the reversed steal phenomenon after angioplasty and stenting. Therefore, we are presenting an optimal solution in using a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> while recanalizing the occluded subclavian artery. Materials and Methods: Among 21 cases of stenting for subclavian artery steno-occlusion, we applied the landmark technique {{at the opposite end}} of an occluded segment in 4 patients and used a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> in two patients. Because the embolic <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was placed in the vertebral artery via the brachial artery, optimal angioplasty and stenting via the brachial route were limited. Therefore, angioplasty via the trans-brachial approach was needed to be followed by stenting through a trans-femoral approach. We estimated the safe and optimal steps for placement and retrieval of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in addition to stenting. Results: The procedure was safely performed when a stent was introduced via the femoral artery and a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was used via the brachial artery. However, in cases when a guidewire wasn’t passed via the transfemoral route, simultaneous use of two systems via the brachial route coul...|$|R
40|$|For three {{fundamental}} input-protection schemes {{suitable for}} high-frequency CMOS ICs, which utilize <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> such as NMOS transistors, thyristors, and diodes, we attempt an in-depth comparison on HBM ESD robustness {{in terms of}} lattice heating inside <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> and peak voltages developed across gate oxides in input buffers, based on DC, mixed-mode transient, and AC analyses utilizing a 2 -dimensional device simulator. For this purpose, we construct an equivalent circuit model of input HBM test environments for CMOS chips equipped with input ESD protection circuits, which allows mixed-mode transient simulations for various HBM test modes. By executing mixed-mode simulations including up to six active <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in a circuit, we attempt a detailed analysis on the problems, which can occur in real tests.

40|$|Background and Objectives：Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is {{emerging}} as a reasonable alternative to carotid endartere-ctomy, and especially for those patients with comorbidities. However, this endovascular approach has acute complications related to distal embolization. Therefore, the use of <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> is expected {{to reduce the risk}} of embolic strokes during this procedure and to deliver more favorable outcomes. We report here on our early experiences with balloon occlusion and filter type distal <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> that were used for CAS. Subjects and Methods：CAS was performed on 92 lesions of 73 patients (age： 61. 0 ± 12. 7 years, males： 71. 2 %). Of these patients, 16 patients with 17 carotid lesions underwent CAS using distal <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> A balloon occlusion type <b>protection</b> <b>device,</b> PercuSurge GuardWire system, was used for 8 lesions and a filter type, FilterWire EX system, was used for 9 lesions. Procedural and early clinical outcomes including complications were compared between the two groups of patients who underwent CAS with the distal protection (group I) and without the distal protection (group II). Results：Carotid angioplasty and stenting was performed successfully in all the patients. Successful deployment of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> was possible in all 17 carotid lesions. Among the 75 carotid lesions treated without <b>protection</b> <b>device,</b> there were two fatal strokes, one non-fatal major stroke, one minor stroke and five transient ischemic attacks (TIA), whereas one TIA and one non-neurologic death occurred among the 17 lesions treated with the <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (p=ns).

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Surgery {{is known to}} have fewer adverse events in {{patients}} aged> 75 years with carotid stenosis, but some are not candidates due to comorbidity. Stenting using <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> is the most accepted endovascular technique. Our aim is to show the safety and efficacy of carotid stenting without any <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> in these patients. Material and methods All patients older than 75 years with carotid stenosis treated in our center between January 2002 and December 2012 were included in this prospective study. All were treated by carotid stenting without <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> Angiographic results, neurologic complications and Doppler ultrasound were collected during the procedure and within 30 days. Results 49 patients were included (mean age 78. 2 years, range 75 – 86). The average degree of stenosis was 88. 2 %. During the procedure there were two cases of transient ischemic attack and one intraparenchymal hemorrhage. At 30 days there was a non-disabling stroke. The combined rate of disabling stroke plus myocardial infarction plus death was 6 % at 30 days and the rate of any stroke was 4 % during the procedure and 2 % at 30 days.

30|$|Classification {{based on}} the dynamic and static {{characteristics}} of relay <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> It divides hidden failures of <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> into dynamic hidden failures and static hidden failures. The static characteristic of <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> {{is that if the}} <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> doesn’t fulfill the starting conditions, it will only do electric-parameter measurement and calculation or do data collection and start judgment; while the logic comparison and tripping output are not in consideration, mainly with the hardware devices, mutual-inductor measurement circuit, connecting cables, terminals, pre-process circuit of relay protection, sampling and sampling-value calculation. The hidden failures in these links are called static hidden failures. Dynamic characteristic of protection is that when the protection meets with the starting conditions, the fault parameters will be measured and logic comparison will be done, mainly with links of measurement, calculation, and blocking-signal inspection. The hidden failures in these links are called dynamic hidden failures.|$|R

40|$|AbstractConclusionIn {{a series}} of 442 {{patients}} undergoing carotid angioplasty or stenting the overall neurologic complication rate was 2. 5 %, and complications related to the cerebral <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> occurred in 4 of 442 patients (0. 9 %). SummaryThe authors studied complications related to cerebral <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> during angioplasty or stenting of the extracranial carotid artery in 442 patients who underwent percutaneous angioplasty or stenting of the extracranial carotid artery. Fifty-seven {{percent of the patients}} had no symptoms. Six different cerebral <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> were used during this study. The three most commonly used devices were the Johnson & Johnson-Cordis Angioguard Filter (37. 8 %), the Boston Scientific FilterWire EX (25. 1 %), and the EV 3 Microvena Trap Filter (18. 9 %). The procedure was successfully performed in 440 of 442 patients, with no periprocedural deaths. In 342 patients stents were placed. Three hundred thirty-nine of the stents were self-expanding. Predilation was performed with coronary balloons in 167 patients. The in-hospital stroke and death rate and 30 -day ipsilateral stroke and death rate was 1. 1 %. Neurologic complications included four intracranial hemorrhages, one major stroke, four minor strokes, four transient ischemic attacks, and six instances of transient neurologic symptoms resulting from intolerance of occlusive <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> for a total neurologic complication rate of 2. 5 %. The overall procedure-related complication rate was 3. 4 %. There were four cerebral protection device–related complications, including one carotid dissection resulting in occlusion, one trapped guide wire requiring operative removal, and two instances of limited dissection. In the retrieved <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> 69 % demonstrated visible plaque debris captured by the device.
