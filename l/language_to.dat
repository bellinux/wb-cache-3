In their interactions with peers, children have the opportunity to learn about unique conversational roles. Through pragmatic directions, adults often offer children cues for understanding the meaning of words.|$|E

5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second <b>language</b> <b>to</b> pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} two problems: 1) what makes <b>languages</b> <b>to</b> be learnable in the limit by natural {{strategies}} of varying hardness; 2) what makes classes of <b>languages</b> <b>to</b> {{be the hardest}} ones to learn. To quantify hardness of learning, we use intrinsic complexity based on reductions between learning problems. Two types of reductions are considered: weak reductions mapping texts (representations of <b>languages)</b> <b>to</b> texts, and strong reductions mapping <b>languages</b> <b>to</b> <b>languages.</b> For both types of reductions, characterizations of complete (hardest) classes {{in terms of their}} algorithmic and topological potentials have been obtained. To characterize the strong complete degree, we discovered a new and natural complete class capable of "coding" any learning problem using density of the set of rational numbers. We have also discovered and characterized rich hierarchies of degrees of complexity based on "core" natural learning problems. The classes in these hierarchies contain "mul [...] ...|$|R

The school offers French, Spanish and German as foreign languages and, in Year 8, pupils take a second <b>language</b> <b>to</b> supplement the one studied in Year 7. The use of ICT is central to all teaching and is taught as a subject in Key Stage 3.|$|E
5|$|From {{the classic}} <b>language</b> <b>to</b> the present day, {{a body of}} {{literature}} has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages {{of time and the}} campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries {{published}} a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named 'Thambiraan Vanakkam,' thus making Tamil the first Indian <b>language</b> <b>to</b> be printed and published.

According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, {{the missionary}} {{established}} a mission among the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations, where he repeated his Baie-Saint-Paul design: a log chapel at the centre surrounded by small cabins {{for the local}} population, with outlying farms. The mission closed ten years later; Belcourt blamed this on mismanagement by oblates he had entrusted with its management. In 1845, Belcourt served as the chaplain to some buffalo hunters, but returned to his first mission at Baie-Saint-Paul to teach the Chippewa <b>language</b> <b>to</b> a group of oblates.|$|E

Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E

5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of <b>language</b> <b>to</b> all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands <b>language</b> <b>to</b> be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, Madagascar has had {{different}} language policies under different influences of authority. The indigenous language of Madagascar, Malagasy, was the predominant language {{on the island}} until the French colonization in 1897. Malagasy has developed throughout the decades from an oral <b>language</b> <b>to</b> a language that has a written system (Latin orthography), a change that was enforced by King Radama I, in 1823.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the birth}} of ASL, sign {{language}} had been used by various communities in the United States. In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad-hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation. As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Plains Indians had developed a sign <b>language</b> <b>to</b> communicate between tribes of different languages.|$|E
