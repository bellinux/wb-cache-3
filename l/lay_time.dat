After the race Soumillon said [...] "The pace wasn't that quick, I wouldn't say I wasn't happy but a quicker pace would have been better as she was a bit keen When I asked her to go at the two-furlong marker she was going very well and I knew I just had Frankie to beat."

Birds, in temperate zones, present marked breeding seasonality {{as well as}} marked daily organization of reproductive behavior, especially laying. Intra-specific variability and determinants of this pattern have been investigated mainly in domestic non-passerine birds. The present study analyzed the daily temporal organization of laying in a free-living species, the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris. Breeding in a starling colony was monitored for five consecutive years using a non-invasive method (infrared video camera) to precisely estimate <b>laying</b> <b>times.</b> European starlings present a marked daily laying rhythm, ovipositions occurring only during a morning species-specific temporal window. Inside this <b>laying</b> window, <b>time</b> intervals between successive eggs varied greatly among females.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel high-speed BCH decoder that corrects double-adjacent and single-bit errors in parallel and serially corrects multiple-bit errors other than double-adjacent errors. Its operation {{is based on}} extending an existing parallel BCH decoder that can only correct single-bit errors and serially corrects double-adjacent errors at low speed. The proposed de- coder is constructed by a novel design and is suitable for nanoscale memory systems, in which multiple-bit errors occur at a probability comparable to single-bit errors and double-adjacent errors occur at a higher probability (nearly two orders of magnitude) than other multiple-bit errors. Extensive simulation results are reported.

A long source-process time (~ 463. 0 sec) and large rupture length (~ 1164. 0 km) are de rived from this analysis of rupture directivity. The source-process time for this earth quake is larger than for either the 1960 Chile or 1964 Alaska earth quakes. This {{might be due to}} the length of the rupture that occurred during earth quake faulting. The estimated rise time for the 2004 Sumatra earthquake, 92. 0 sec, is approximately 20 % of the whole source duration and also larger than those for the 1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska earth quakes. This likely reflects a fundamental difference between the frictional properties of these earth quakes. When the rise time is taken into ac count, an estimated rupture velocity of approximately 3. 1 km sec- 1 is obtained. This value is higher than that found in previous studies carried out on the basis of hydro acoustic data and regional seismic net works. In this study, we obtain additional evidence from analysis of the surface-wave phase-de <b>lay</b> <b>time</b> which con firms the basic features of the rupturing of the 2004 Sumatra earth quake.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to bring fresh {{insights}} to current understandings of cinematic space and the relationship between film, architecture, and the city. That attempt is situated in relation to recent work by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Saskia Sassen, and others on the importance of the city in the current global framework, along with the growing body of literature on film, architecture, and urban space. Michel De Certeau's threefold critique of the city, set forth in The practices of Everyday Life, structures a comparative analysis of six primary films, aired as follows, with one air for each of three chapters-Jacques Tati's <b>lay</b> <b>Time</b> and Edward Yang's Yi Yi, Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves and Wang Xiaoshuai's Beijing Bicycle, and Franqois Truffaut's The 400 Blows and Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay!. Along with De Certeau's notions of satial ractice, walking rhetorics, and the pedestrian speech act, the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze-including work from the Cinema texts and A Thousand plateaus-is developed in relation to existent film theory on movement, time, and space. (cont.) The analysis operates as a kind of mediation between an active set of spatial theories-a mediation which uses traditional techniques of film analysis and critical theory to instigate a negotiation around the topic of (cinematic) space. That negotiation implies a common ground on which the film texts and theories are read against and in addition to one another, allowing each to contribute in its own right to the setting u of a series of terms-what I refer to as a "spatial grammar"-proper to both film and theory. The spatial grammar thus comprises a more abstract theoretical lane-a palimpsest on which resides a classic body of work on cinematic space (including Andre Bazin, Stephen Heath, and Kristin Thomson), and on which I layer the work of De Certeau, Deleuze, Fredric Jameson, and others. by Brian R.

The experimental results are compared with the calculated fatigue life to the nominal strain concept and the local strain concept. For the calculation of the stress concentration factor the FE-programme ANSYS has been applied. Also single edge cracks made of steel D 36 have been investigated under the above mentioned loadings.

Connection of transverse bulkhead longitudinal stiffeners with one- side- and double connection have been investigated under static loads and random loading. The linear and nonlinear computation of stress distribution and the calculation of the concentration factor the FE-programme ANSYS has been applied. The experimental results under static loads show that the computation of the linear stress distribution can be predicted with sufficient accuracy. Results under random loading show that the crack initiation life is comparable with the calculated fatigue life according to the nominal strain concept and the local strain concept. The nonlinear calculated crack lengths are comparable with the experimental crack lengths for these complex structures.

During loading and unloading the smooth water strains are varying. These variations of strains induce in certain ship's hull structural elements tension or compressive mean stress. While the influence of tension mean stress on fatigue strength is well researched, {{the knowledge of the}} influence of compressive mean stress on fatigue strength has to be completed. Expected is a favourable influence of compressive mean stress, which until now is not or not sufficient considered in the classification rules. So welded cruciform specimen with K-joints made of steel St E 355 have been investigated under - unchanged random loading, - random loading with tension and compressive mean stress, - random loading with tension and compressive mean stress and single peak loads by experiments and by calculation. During the experiments the number of life cycles until complete crack of specimens were counted and the krack growth was measured by registrating the variations of a potential of direct current, which was laid on each specimen by means of probes. The experimental results have been compared with the calculated fatigue life according to the nominal strain concept, to the effective notch concept and to the crack propagation concept. For the calculation of the stress distribution of the specimens and of the notches the FE-programm ANSYS has been applied. The experimental results show the expected influence of tension and compressive mean stress and of single peak loads on fatigue life, whereas the results of the calculation according to the above mentioned concepts only correspond to experimental results for tension mean stress and mean stress 'zero' including single peak loads. For random loading with compressive mean stress and single peak loads with tension the application of the mean stress concept and the effective notch concept give useful but very conservative results. Only the results of application of the crack propagation concept with linear statements of damage show a sufficient agreement in the test results for random loading with compressive mean stress and single peak loads with tension.
