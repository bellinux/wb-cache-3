5|$|Several {{important}} formulas, {{sometimes called}} <b>logarithmic</b> identities or <b>logarithmic</b> laws, relate logarithms to one another.|$|E
5|$|For more, see list of <b>logarithmic</b> identities.|$|E
5|$|For {{constant}} load factors, with high probability, the longest probe sequence (among the probe sequences for all keys {{stored in the}} table) has <b>logarithmic</b> length.|$|E
5|$|<b>Logarithmic</b> scales reduce wide-ranging {{quantities}} to tiny scopes. For example, the decibel is a unit quantifying signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which {{sound pressure}} {{is a common}} example). In chemistry, pH is a <b>logarithmic</b> measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements {{of the complexity of}} algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{saturation}} {{follows a}} <b>logarithmic</b> curve and is approximately complete in 3 hours in goats, and 5 hours in humans.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{analyses}} diverse {{forms of}} minute spiral shells of the foraminifera, {{many of which}} are <b>logarithmic,</b> others irregular, {{in a manner similar to}} the previous chapter.|$|E
5|$|A {{binary search}} tree is a binary tree data {{structure}} that works {{based on the principle}} of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average <b>logarithmic</b> time. Insertion and deletion also require on average <b>logarithmic</b> time in {{binary search tree}}s. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E
5|$|Leavitt also {{developed}} {{and continued to}} refine the Harvard Standard for photographic measurements, a <b>logarithmic</b> scale that orders stars by brightness over 17 magnitudes. She initially analyzed 299 plates from 13 telescopes to construct her scale, which was accepted by the International Committee of Photographic Magnitudes in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding <b>logarithmic</b> scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred {{enhanced}} it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of <b>logarithmic</b> scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{patterns}} in nature find explanations in chaos theory, fractals, <b>logarithmic</b> spirals, topology and other mathematical patterns. For example, L-systems form convincing models of different patterns of tree growth.|$|E
5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a <b>logarithmic</b> amount of writable memory, is easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|About 5hours {{after the}} burst the {{apparent}} {{magnitude of the}} object—a <b>logarithmic</b> measure of its brightness with a higher number indicating a fainter object—was 20.3±0.3 in the U-band (the ultraviolet region of the spectrum) and 21.2±0.1 in the R-band (the red region of the spectrum). The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2days after the burst was first detected—19.6±0.3 in the U-band at 02:13UTC on May11, and 19.8±0.2 in the R-band at 20:55UTC on May 10.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are <b>logarithmic</b> units: one whole number difference in magnitude {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars {{visible to the naked}} eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, <b>logarithmic</b> search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across {{the spine of the}} book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a <b>logarithmic</b> number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E
5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a <b>logarithmic</b> spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral {{can be seen as}} a special case of self-similarity.|$|E
5|$|The book covers many topics {{including}} {{the effects of}} scale on the shape of animals and plants, large ones necessarily being relatively thick in shape; the effects of surface tension in shaping soap films and similar structures such as cells; the <b>logarithmic</b> spiral as seen in mollusc shells and ruminant horns; the arrangement of leaves and other plant parts (phyllotaxis); and Thompson's own method of transformations, showing the changes in shape of animal skulls and other structures on a Cartesian grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} explosivity index (commonly shortened to VEI) is a scale, from 0 to 8, {{for measuring}} the strength of eruptions. It {{is used by the}} Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program in assessing the impact of historic and prehistoric lava flows. It operates in a way similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes, in that each interval in value represents a tenfold increasing in magnitude (it is <b>logarithmic).</b> The vast majority of volcanic eruptions are of VEIs between 0 and 2.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the <b>logarithmic</b> (or log) map.|$|E
25|$|<b>Logarithmic</b> time: if {{the time}} is a <b>logarithmic</b> {{function}} of the input size. E.g. binary search algorithm.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{rounding}}, {{which is}} also named rounding to a <b>logarithmic</b> scale, is a variant of Rounding to a specified increment. Rounding on a <b>logarithmic</b> scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} growth of Dirichlet's kernel is <b>logarithmic,</b> i.e.|$|E
25|$|This is the <b>logarithmic</b> {{derivative}} of the accumulation function.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{they have}} {{traditionally}} been transformed to a <b>logarithmic</b> scale.|$|E
25|$|The stress has a <b>logarithmic</b> {{singularity}} {{at the tip}} of the cone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Logarithmic</b> transformations cannot {{properly}} handle negative values, {{and poorly}} display normally distributed cell types.|$|E
25|$|For algorithms, this {{primarily}} {{consists of}} ensuring that algorithms are constant O(1), <b>logarithmic</b> O(log n), linear O(n), {{or in some cases}} log-linear O(n log n) in the input (both in space and time). Algorithms with quadratic complexity O(n2) fail to scale, and even linear algorithms cause problems if repeatedly called, and are typically replaced with constant or <b>logarithmic</b> if possible.|$|E
25|$|The <b>logarithmic</b> {{derivative}} of the gamma function {{is called the}} digamma function; higher derivatives are the polygamma functions.|$|E
25|$|The semitone {{scale used}} in Western musical {{notation}} {{is not a}} linear frequency scale but <b>logarithmic.</b> Other scales have been derived directly from experiments on human hearing perception, such as the mel scale and Bark scale (these are used in studying perception, but not usually in musical composition), and these are approximately <b>logarithmic</b> in frequency at the high-frequency end, but nearly linear at the low-frequency end.|$|E
25|$|Algorithms taking <b>logarithmic</b> {{time are}} {{commonly}} found in operations on binary trees or when using binary search.|$|E
25|$|Numbers {{produced}} {{when doing}} any multiplicative calculations with an Oughtred slide rule, since the answers naturally {{fall into the}} right <b>logarithmic</b> distribution.|$|E
25|$|The aging {{follows a}} <b>logarithmic</b> law. This law defines the {{decrease}} of capacitance {{as a percentage}} for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a defined temperature, for example, in the period from 1 to 10 hours at 20°C. As the law is <b>logarithmic,</b> the percentage loss of capacitance will twice between 1h and 100h and 3 times between 1h and 1000h and so on. So aging is fastest near the beginning, and the capacitance value effectively stabilizes over time.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulae}} in {{this article}} are exact if <b>logarithmic</b> units are used for relative changes, or equivalently if logarithms of indices are used in place of rates, and hold even for large relative changes. Most elegantly, if the natural logarithm is used, yielding the neper as <b>logarithmic</b> units, scaling by 100 to obtain the centineper yields units that are infinitesimally equal to percentage change (hence approximately equal for small values), and for which the linear equations hold for all values.|$|E
25|$|The {{values are}} then plotted on a graph with {{cumulative}} percent {{passing on the}} y axis and <b>logarithmic</b> sieve size on the x axis.|$|E
25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is said to}} take <b>logarithmic</b> time if T(n) = O(log n). Due {{to the use of}} the binary numeral system by computers, the logarithm is frequently base 2 (that is, log2 n, sometimes written lg n). However, by the change of base for logarithms, loga n and logb n differ only by a constant multiplier, which in big-O notation is discarded; thus O(log n) is the standard notation for <b>logarithmic</b> time algorithms regardless of the base of the logarithm.|$|E
25|$|However {{by restricting}} the guards {{to lie on}} a fine grid, a more {{complicated}} <b>logarithmic</b> approximation algorithm can be derived, under some mild extra assumptions.|$|E
