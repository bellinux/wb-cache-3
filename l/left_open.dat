5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted {{in the ground and}} connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be <b>left</b> <b>open</b> in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the writing}} of unit names is language-specific, {{the writing of}} unit symbols and the values of {{quantities}} is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and <b>left</b> <b>open</b> until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|In Week 2, the Terrapins {{played the}} inaugural {{game at the}} newly {{completed}} Byrd Stadium. It was the first game against the Naval Academy in 16 years. The series had been canceled in 1934 after Maryland accused Navy of an illegal game-winning play. In 1950, Maryland agreed to fill a vacancy in the Navy schedule <b>left</b> <b>open</b> by a Georgetown cancellation. The high-scoring game was the 12th meeting of the intense in-state rivalry and resulted in just the second-ever Maryland win.|$|E

The Italian peninsula was <b>left</b> <b>open</b> to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East. To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Octavia Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40BC. During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as Antonia the Elder and Antonia Minor).|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Cottingley Fairies {{gradually}} declined after 1921.

Rowland refused and the eight directors prepared to pass a motion at the first full board meeting, set for 18 April 1973, forcing Rowland to relinquish all of his executive appointments. Rowland, aware of the possibility, had obtained an interlocutory injunction from the High Court of Justice preventing the board from voting on his removal.|$|E

The portholes had been <b>left</b> <b>open,</b> and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The Rose Pink had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low—by now captaining a captured schooner, the Squirrel—and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint (around 275ml) per man, per day.|$|E
5|$|The West Group {{consists}} of 21 structures on Terrace6, {{which was also}} artificially levelled. The structures are arranged around plazas that were <b>left</b> <b>open</b> on the east side. Seven monuments {{have been found in}} this group. The West Group is bordered by the rivers Nima on the west and the San Isidro on the east. A notable find in the West Group was the discovery of some jade masks there. The West Group was occupied from the Late Preclassic through to at least the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} chess {{rules do}} not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is <b>left</b> <b>open</b> to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E

50|$|In 1815, {{during the}} Congress of Vienna, Ouren {{became a part}} of the Prussian kingdom {{together}} with Eupen and Malmedy. In 1844 and 1845 the unoccupied castle was auctioned and <b>left</b> <b>opened</b> to demolition. Nowadays, only a few remains of the wall are present.

5|$|The {{west side}} (numbers 14–18 and 18A, 19 and 20) was {{designed}} by John Pinch the younger in 1830 and differs from Wood's original design as the central block is in Neo-Grecian style. The Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI) now occupies 16–18. The south side (numbers 5–13) was originally <b>left</b> <b>open,</b> but is now occupied by a hotel. The obelisk in {{the centre of the}} square was erected by Beau Nash in 1738.|$|E
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was <b>left</b> <b>open</b> {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was <b>left</b> <b>open</b> behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
