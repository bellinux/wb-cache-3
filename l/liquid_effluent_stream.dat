40|$|Odour {{nuisance}} presents one of {{the most}} difficult technical problems in the field of pollution control, requiring complete removal of very low levels of contaminant. Measurement of odour invariably involves a considerable degree of human judgement. Where appropriate, a chemical assay technique may be combined with a method of concen-trating odour, to give a comparison of odour sources. However, a subjective method of odour assessment may well be necessary, in which case dynamic dilution sampling is the most reliable. Technical methods of odour control are still in the course of development, although a wide range of methods is already available for consideration. Many control techniques bring further environmental problems of their own, such as the generation of a <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> <b>stream.</b> However, a number of methods, such as ozone treatment, present the possibility of odour control without undesirable side effects...|$|E

Miscellaneous streams also occur through the use of these source waters for maintenance and construction activities such as draining, flushing, and washing. Miscellaneous streams discharging to the soil column on the Hanford Site were subject to the requirements of several milestones identified in the Consent Order (DE 91 NM- 177). The Plan and Schedule for Disposition and Regulatory Compliance for Miscellaneous Streams (DOE/RL- 93 - 94) provides for the disposition of miscellaneous streams to satisfy one of the Consent Order Section 6 requirements.

40|$|This Quality Assurance Program Plan (QAPP) {{describes}} the quality assurance and management controls {{used by the}} 200 Area <b>Liquid</b> <b>Effluent</b> Facilities (LEF) to perform its activities in accordance with DOE Order 5700. 6 C. The 200 Area LEF consists of the following facilities: Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF); Treated Effluent Disposal Facility (TEDF); <b>Liquid</b> <b>Effluent</b> Retention facility (LERF); and Truck Loading Facility [...] (Project W 291). The intent {{is to ensure that}} all activities such as collection of effluents, treatment, concentration of secondary wastes, verification, sampling and disposal of treated effluents and solids related with the LEF operations, conform to established requirements...|$|R
40|$|This {{survey of}} {{environmental}} {{conditions in the}} neighbourhood of the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories during 1981 indicates no significant radiological hazard to the general public. This result {{is consistent with the}} fact that controlled airborne and <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> releases throughout the year were maintained within the authorised limits and also indicates that there were no significant accidental releases. Residual cobalt- 60 and zinc- 65 activity in the Woronora River has decreased since the cessation of controlled <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> discharges in 1980. No trends are obvious in any of the data which could lead to future problems from continued operation on the present scale...|$|R
40|$|The DOE-RL is {{pursuing}} a new business strategy of hiring private contractors for treatment of Hanford tank waste. This `privatization` initiative includes design, permitting, construction, operations, deactivation and decommissioning of tank waste treatment facilities. The TWRS Privatization Infrastructure Project {{is part of the}} first phase of the initiative and includes several sub-projects to provide key physical interfaces and services needed to support the mission. One sub-project is to provide transfer systems integrated with 200 Area <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> facilities to service the private contractors. This document presents the applicable <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> transfer systems` design requirements to be used as a basis for conceptual design...|$|R
50|$|The process {{produces}} primary treated blackwater, {{with much}} of the solid organic material removed from the <b>effluent.</b> Because <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> is discharged almost immediately on entering the digester, little dissolved oxygen is consumed by the wastewater through the filtration stage. However, oxygen demand is leached into the wastewater flow through the filter as worms digest retained solids. This oxygen demand can be removed with secondary treatment vermifilter reactors. Primary treatment vermifilters provide a similar level of <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> treatment to a septic tank, but in less time because digestion of solids by worms takes place rapidly in the aerobic environment.|$|R
25|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> is {{disposed}} of via a 5km long pipeline to the Solway Firth. All environmental discharges {{are subject to}} an annual discharge authorisation which is regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).|$|R
