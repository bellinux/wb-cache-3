5|$|A {{prominent}} {{tradition is}} that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a boat, or a stone ship, and given grave offerings in accordance with his earthly status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> top of the remains {{in order to create a}} tumulus.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|Rammed {{earth is}} {{generally}} made without much water, {{and so does}} not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must be <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E

5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> the fire.|$|E

The video features a spoilt child being showered with Christmas presents while poorer children are shown in tears due to their lack of gifts.

5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} ship that would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E
5|$|A new mineral venture was {{attempted}} in 1907, {{for which}} {{much of the}} line was re-opened and a -gauge extension was added, but this failed and the line closed again in 1910. A section of the track {{was used to test}} and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device in 1911 and occasionally used in that connection up to 1914. The tracks were lifted for scrap in 1917, after which a light railway was <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> part of the trackbed in 1918 to carry timber. This ended in 1920 and the company was wound up in 1925.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Hipper {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Blohm & Voss {{shipyard}} in Hamburg. Her keel was <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> 6 July 1935, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 6 February 1937, and was completed on 29 April 1939, {{the day she was}} commissioned into the German fleet. The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder, who had been Franz von Hipper's chief of staff during World War I, gave the christening speech and his wife Erika Raeder performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow. A raked funnel cap was also installed.|$|E
5|$|After Morocco's {{independence}} in 1956, {{a strong emphasis}} was <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> the country's Arab identity, and a national Arabic language educational system was instituted, in which Berber languages, including Middle Atlas Tamazight, had no place. However, in 1994 the government responded to Berber demands for recognition by decreeing that Berber should be taught and establishing television broadcasts in three Berber languages, including Central Atlas Tamazight. For the promotion of Tamazight and other Berber languages and cultures, the government created the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|After {{the two new}} dreadnoughts {{were awarded}} to Fore River, Moreno was {{subcontracted}} out to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey as {{called for in the}} final contract. Morenos keel was <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> 9 July 1910, and construction was overseen by the Argentine Naval Commission. After the completion of the hull, it was launched on 23 September 1911. Isabel Betbeder, wife to the chief of the Argentine Naval Commission, sponsored Moreno. The ship was then moored to a dock to commence fitting-out, which was finished on 15 February 1915. It was commissioned into the Argentine Navy nine days later.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E
5|$|Architects were HRTB and {{the main}} {{contractor}} was NCC Construction. While domed stadiums have been common in North America, no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007. However, because of the building boom, concrete elements needed for construction to start meant {{that the rest of}} the construction was delayed. The cornerstone was <b>laid</b> <b>on</b> 5 September.|$|E
