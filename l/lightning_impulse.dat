The first part is a program for calculating the parameters of unit step responses which are verified an ability of the measuring system by a comparison with the values given in IEC 60060 - 2. The second part is a program for computing frequency response of HV measuring system compared to magnitude of frequency contents of the standard waveforms by using FFT. The third part is a program for calculating the output voltage waveform by time convolutions between standard testing waveforms and unit step responses. The standard waveforms under investigation are full <b>lightning</b> <b>impulse</b> voltage waveforms, tail-chopped <b>lightning</b> <b>impulse</b> voltage waveforms, front-chopped <b>lightning</b> <b>impulse</b> voltage waveforms and steep-front voltage waveforms according to IEC standards 60060 - 2 [2] and 61211 [3].

Streamer inception characteristics under DC voltage have been studied by many researchers, but the inception characteristics under impulse voltage, and particularly under <b>lightning</b> <b>impulse</b> voltage with a high voltage rise rate have rarely been studied. A measurement system based on integrated optoelectronic technology has been proposed in this paper, and the streamer inception characteristics in a 1 -m-long rod-plane air gap that was energized by a positive <b>lightning</b> <b>impulse</b> voltage have been researched. We have also measured the streamer inception electric field using electrodes with different radii of curvature and different voltage rise rates. As a result, a modified empirical criterion for the streamer inception electric field that considers the voltage rise rate has been proposed, and the wide applicability of this criterion has been proved. Based on the streamer inception time-lag obtained, we determined that the field distribution obeys a Rayleigh distribution, which explains the change law of the streamer inception time-lag.
