5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While the {{importance}} of viewing <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation is gradually recognized (Paavola, Lipponen, and Hakkarainen, 2002; 2004), an important question remains to be answered- what represents an effective instructional design to support collaborative creative learning? This paper argues for a need {{to move away from}} efficiency-oriented instructional design to innovation-oriented instructional design if <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation is to be pursued as an important instructional goal. The rationale in support of this argument is discussed from four different theoretical perspectives and an idea-centered, principle-based design approach as an example is proposed for discussion. In her work, Sfard (1998) distinguishes two metaphors of learning, which are <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> acquisition and <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation. Building on this work, Paavola, Lipponen, and Hakkarainen (2002; 2004) suggest a third metaphor—learning as knowledge creation. They identify Carl Bereiter’s (2002; Scardamalia & Bereiter, in press) knowledge building theory, Nonaka and Takeuchi’s (1995) knowledge-creating theory, and Yrjo Engestrom’s (1999) expansive <b>learning</b> theory <b>as</b> three prominent models in support of the knowledge creating community conceptualization. While the argument for “learning as knowledge creation ” as a new pedagogical approach to schooling and education is well justified in their articles, an important issue remains to be explored-what represents an effective instructional design to support <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss two general types of instructional design approaches—efficiency-oriented and innovationoriented. It is posited that if <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation is to be pursued as a new pedagogical approach, instructional design will need to move away from an efficiency-oriented to an innovation-oriented approach. We discuss some design differences between the three learning metaphors in relation to these two types of instructional approaches from four theoretical perspectives to support this argument, and then propose an ideacentered, principle-based design approach as an example to support <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation...|$|R

40|$|The {{introductory}} chapter {{outlines the}} book&# 039;s central workplace learning themes from a socio-cultural perspective and situates them {{within the context}} of an Asia-Europe dialogue. Within this framework it problematises the idea of arguing that learning is not just acquisition, not just participation, but transformative of the self and circumstances, suggesting we need to consider <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> both acquisition and participation. However the acquisition metaphor or what Paulo Freire refers to as the banking concept of learning renders the learner(s) as passive, as having no agency, no will, no intent and that learners do not make their own meaning. Whereas <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation, deriving from the community of practice literature, places the emphasis on <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> being fundamentally social, as a matter of engagement, of the ability to negotiate new meaning, &# 039;as a process of changing understanding in practice&# 039; Unlike <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> acquisition, <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation recognises that learning is inherent in social relationships and that these relationships are embedded in practice, in the social setting of the practices and the activity of individuals and collectives. This is the strength of conceptualising <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation; however it does not account for the embeddedness of the wider social relations and conditions. Nor does <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation address the reality that we each bring our own understanding, our own mental image to what it is we are learning for. Our mental image, our understanding of an &# 039;object&# 039; is coloured by our individual and collective past experiences, our epistemological stance, our ethics and morals, our knowing.
