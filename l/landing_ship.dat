5|$|In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in {{accordance}} with a new war establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type <b>landing</b> <b>ship</b> and one unit in the 'Dutch' type <b>landing</b> <b>ship.</b> The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 hundredweight (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.|$|E
5|$|The cross-channel {{invasion}} of France finally came on June 6, 1944, D-Day, {{otherwise known as}} Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied {{invasion of}} Normandy. The 29th Infantry Division sent the 116th Infantry to support the western flank of the veteran 1st Infantry Division's 16th Infantry at Omaha Beach. Omaha {{was known to be}} the most difficult of the five landing beaches, due to its rough terrain and bluffs overlooking the beach, which had been well fortified by its German defenders of the 352nd Infantry Division. The 116th Infantry was assigned four sectors of the beach; Easy Green, Dog Red, Dog White, and Dog Green. Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division boarded a large number of attack transports for the D-Day invasion, among them Landing craft, <b>Landing</b> <b>Ship,</b> Tank and <b>Landing</b> <b>Ship,</b> Infantry ships and other vessels such as the , , and USS Buncombe County.|$|E
5|$|While {{all this}} was going on, a {{decision}} was made to concentrate the commandos and Independent Companies into five large 1,000 man battalions, each of two companies. No. 4 Commando was renamed the No. 1 Company of the 3rd Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Lister. No. 2 Company was formed by the re-designation of No. 7 Commando. This new formation proved to be too large and unwieldy in practice. Within three months, the Special Service Battalions were disbanded and the original commando units reformed but on a smaller scale with six troops instead of the original ten. Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type <b>landing</b> <b>ship</b> and one unit in the 'Dutch' type <b>landing</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E

50|$|During World War II, E-boats sank 101 {{merchant}} ships totalling 214,728 tons. In addition, they sank 12 destroyers, 11 minesweepers, eight <b>landing</b> <b>ships,</b> six MTBs, a torpedo boat, a minelayer, one submarine and {{a number}} of small merchant craft. They also damaged two cruisers, five destroyers, three <b>landing</b> <b>ships,</b> a repair ship, a naval tug and numerous merchant vessels.

5|$|No. 4 Commando {{remained}} at Weymouth until 13 October 1940, when it boarded trains for Scotland. Arriving on the River Clyde at 06:00 the next day, {{they were sent}} on board HMS Glengyle, an Infantry <b>landing</b> <b>ship.</b> Glengyle sailed on 18 October for Inveraray, to conduct training {{for the first time}} with Assault Landing Craft. The move to Scotland became permanent and No. 4 Commando were based at Ayr.|$|E
5|$|The Rangers {{arrived in}} Korea on 24 March. They disembarked from the Army Transport Ship at Pusan. After {{spending}} {{a night or}} two there, all three companies continued on to Inchon on an LST <b>Landing</b> <b>Ship,</b> Tank, arriving at Inchon on 31 March. There, 3rd Airborne Ranger Company separated from its sister companies and {{was attached to the}} US 3rd Infantry Division near the Imjin River, where the division was engaged in an intense battle with Chinese forces, attempting to push them further north.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry <b>landing</b> <b>ship,</b> but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E

5|$|As {{invasion}} neared in mid-1944, the two battalions {{moved from}} their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard troopships and <b>landing</b> <b>ship</b> tanks. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the Ulster Monarch, a passenger ship that had {{served on the}} Belfast-Liverpool line before the war. Having been delayed, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. Both King's battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at Sword with the 3rd British Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at Juno with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1941, No. 6 Commando, {{along with}} a {{detachment}} from No. 12 Commando and some Norwegian soldiers, took part in Operation Kitbag, a raid on the town of Florø in Norway. Embarking on the HMS Prince Charles, an infantry <b>landing</b> <b>ship,</b> they set out from Scapa Flow. During the voyage an incident occurred {{while some of the}} men were priming grenades for the raid which resulted in six men being killed and another 11 seriously wounded. Nevertheless, {{the decision was made to}} continue with the raid, although it was eventually called off when the naval commander was unable to locate the fjord upon which Florø was located due to navigational difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{casualties}} at the landings {{were very}} light, with only 95killed and 385 wounded. 40 of those casualties {{were caused by}} a rocket-boosted Henschel Hs 293 guided gliding bomb launched from a Do-217 bomber aircraft by a rare appearance of the bomber wing KG 100, which sank the tank <b>landing</b> <b>ship</b> USS LST-282. In conjunction with the sea landing, airborne and glider landings (Mission Albatross followed by Mission Dove, Mission Bluebird, and Mission Canary) around the area of Le Muy were carried out. They were as successful as the beach landings, with only 104 dead, 24 of which were caused by glider accidents and 18 by parachute accidents.|$|E

5|$|On 15 January 1991, 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait; {{three were}} damaged {{in the attack}} but all {{returned}} to base. On 26January, RAF Jaguars and Tornadoes raided several Silkworm missile batteries in Kuwait to encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country. On the 30th, two RAF Jaguars destroyed a Polnochny-class <b>landing</b> <b>ship</b> with rockets and cannon. The Iraqi Republican Guard, entrenched on the Kuwait-Saudi border, were subjected to a continuous intensive bombing campaign for weeks to demoralise them, allied Jaguars forming {{a portion of the}} delivering aircraft. The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces. Both nations' Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991, at the end of Desert Storm.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a <b>landing</b> <b>ship</b> two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
5|$|The Special Boat Section {{was founded}} in July 1940 by a Commando officer, Roger Courtney. Courtney became a {{commando}} recruit in mid-1940, and {{was sent to the}} Combined Training Centre in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a <b>Landing</b> <b>Ship,</b> Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials on the door to the captain's cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Service/Special Boat Section.|$|E

5|$|With two <b>Landing</b> <b>Ship</b> Docks, Boxer was {{dispatched}} to Hispaniola on 29 August 1964 on a humanitarian mission to aid Haiti and the Dominican Republic whose infrastructure had {{been damaged by}} Hurricane Cleo. The ships provided medical aid and helped to evacuate civilians displaced by the storm. On 27 April 1965 Boxer returned to the Dominican Republic with Helicopter Squadron 264 and a complement of Marines. They evacuated about 1,000 US nationals from {{the country in the}} wake of a revolution in the country. It was a part of Operation Powerpack which would eventually see the US occupation of that country. Later in 1965, she was used as a transport vessel for the Vietnam War. The carrier transported 200 helicopters of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division to South Vietnam. She made a second trip to Vietnam in early 1966 when she transported Marine Corps aircraft to South Vietnam. However, she did not participate in combat operations during that war.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Norway, training started for Operation Puma, {{the occupation of}} the Canary Islands. The operation was planned following intelligence that Spain was going to join the war {{on the side of}} the Axis forces. The intention was to prevent Germany using the islands as a U-Boat base. The force assembled included five commando units, an army brigade, two Royal Marine brigades and supporting arms. Training for Operation Puma culminated in landing exercises in the Hebrides from the <b>Landing</b> <b>Ship,</b> Infantry HMS Royal Scotsman. The operation was renamed Operation Pilgrim and after a number of delays was put on hold by the Chiefs-of-Staff. On 13 September a token force including a troop from No. 4 Commando was dispatched to West Africa. The troop was based in Sierra Leone and Nigeria until returning to Britain in February 1942, after the cancellation of the operation. While this was happening a new second in command (2IC) was appointed, Major Charles Vaughan, and a Captain Lord Lovat joined the unit as the training officer. Lovat had been attached to the Lofoten raid as an observer and had applied for a posting to the commandos.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese {{force was}} too small to cut off all traffic between Australia and New Guinea, the Squadron {{commander}} widely dispersed his submarines between the Torres Strait and Wilson's Promontory with the goal of tying down as many Allied ships and aircraft as possible. This offensive continued until June and the five Japanese submarines sank nine ships and damaged several others. In contrast to 1942, five of the ships sunk off the Australian east coast were travelling in escorted convoys at the time they were attacked. The convoy escorts were not successful in detecting any submarines before they launched their attacks or counter-attacking these submarines. The last attack by a Japanese submarine off the east coast of Australia was made by I-174 on 16 June 1943 when she sank the merchant ship Portmar and damaged U.S. <b>Landing</b> <b>Ship</b> Tank LST-469 as they were travelling in Convoy GP55 off the New South Wales north coast. Some historians believe that RAAF aircraft searching for I-174 may have sunk I-178 during the early hours of 18 June, but the cause of this submarine's loss during a patrol off eastern Australia has not been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away. Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families.
