25|$|Although {{prepared}} to grant formal independence to Southern Rhodesia (now Rhodesia), the British government had adopted {{a policy of}} no independence before majority rule, dictating that colonies with a substantial population of European settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule.

The authorities were also disturbed by the post-independence chaos which was plaguing other African nations at the time.

25|$|The Byzantine–Fatimid treaty {{weakened}} Nasr's {{strategic position}} and {{forced him to}} improve relations with the Fatimids.

Nasr's envoy remained in Cairo for several years and likely did not return to Aleppo until after the accession of Caliph al-Mustansir.

25|$|Since shared {{libraries}} on most {{systems do}} not change often, systems can compute a likely load address for each shared library on the system before it is needed, and store that information in the libraries and executables. If every shared library that is loaded has undergone this process, then each will load at its predetermined address, which speeds up the process of dynamic linking. This optimization is known as prebinding in macOS and prelinking in Linux. Disadvantages of this technique include {{the time required to}} precompute these addresses every time the shared libraries change, the inability to use address space layout randomization, and the requirement of sufficient virtual address space for use (a problem that will be alleviated by the adoption of 64-bit architectures, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being).|$|E

The junior partner in the Pan-Green Coalition, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, won no seats. The election for the 12th-term President and Vice-President of the Republic of China was held in the Republic of China (Taiwan) on Saturday, March 22, 2008. Kuomintang nominee Ma Ying-jeou won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential power.

40|$|During the 1960 s, {{it seemed}} like {{everything}} changed. The youth culture shook up the status quo of the United States with its inves-titure in the counterculture, drugs, and rock and roll. Students turned their universities upside-down {{with the spirit of}} protest as they fought for free speech and equality and against the Vietnam War. Many previously ignored groups, such as African Americans and women, stood up for their rights. Radical politics began to challenge the primacy of the staid old national parties. “The Kids” were now in charge, and the traditional social and cultural roles were being challenged. Everything old was old-fashioned, and the future had never seemed more unknown. Nowhere was this spirit of youthful metamorphosis more ob-vious than in the transformation of views of sexuality. In the 1960 s sexuality was finally removed from its private closet and cele-brated in the public sphere. Much of the nation latched onto this new feeling of openness and freedom toward sexual expression. In the era of “free love ” that characterized {{the latter part of the}} decade, many individuals began to explore their own sexuality as well as what it meant to be a traditional man or woman. It is from this historical context that the Hollywood B-movie The Gay Deceivers (1969) emerged. This small exploitation film, directed by Bruce Kessler and written by Jerome Wish, capitalizes on the new view of sexuality in the 1960 s with its novel (at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>times)</b> comedic exploration of homosexu-ality.

Amis, Larkin and other university friends formed a group they dubbed [...] "The Seven", meeting to discuss each other's poetry, listen to jazz, and drink enthusiastically. During this time he had his first real social interaction with the opposite sex, but made no romantic headway. In 1943 he sat his finals, and, having dedicated much of his time to his own writing, was greatly surprised at being awarded a first-class honours degree.|$|E

Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity. [...] A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the Association Medical Journal. [...] Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those {{that were supposed to}} produce instant results (a typical course of electrotherapy at the time could last several months). [...] He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering [...] "too feeble" [...] a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte).
