40|$|Sixty paired cadaver upper {{extremities}} were dissected {{to study}} the anatomy of the flexor pollicis longus in the forearm {{and its relation to}} the median and anterior interosseous nerves. An accessory head was noted in 33 (55 %) of 60 specimens. The accessory head was noted to pass anterior to the anterior interosseous nerve in all specimens. The accessory head was noted to pass posterior to the median nerve in 57 specimens, and anterior to the nerve in three. Tendon or muscle anomalies were noted in eight specimens (13 %), seven of which involved an anomalous attachment between the FPL and the flexor digitorum profundus of the index. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1998) 23 B: 2. " 170 172 The variability of the origin of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) and its tendon have been described in the anatom-ical literature (Mangini, 1960). Several variations of the FPL muscle have been implicated as a cause of anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) compression in the forearm (<b>Listel,</b> 1984). Among these are an accessory head of the FPL and anomalous tendon insertions or slips. Thes...|$|E
