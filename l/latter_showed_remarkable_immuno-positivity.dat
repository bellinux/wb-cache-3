40|$|Four {{positively}} charged compounds, previously shown to produce analgesic activity by interacting with prokinecitin receptor or T-type calcium channels, were tested {{for their ability}} to inhibit capsaicin-induced elevation of intracellular Ca(2 +) elevation in HEK- 293 cells stably transfected with the human recombinant TRPV 1, with the goal of identifying novel TRPV 1 open-pore inhibitors. KYS- 05090 showed the highest potency as a TRPV 1 antagonist, even higher than that of the open-pore triazine 8 aA inhibitor. The <b>latter</b> <b>showed</b> quite <b>remarkable</b> agonist/desensitizer activity at the rat recombinant TRPM 8 channel. The activity of KYS- 05090 and the other compounds was selective because none of these compounds was able to modulate the rat TRPA 1 channel. Open-pore inhibitors of TRPV 1 may be a new class of multi-target analgesics with lesser side effects, such as loss of acute pain sensitivity and hyperthermia, than most TRPV 1 antagonists developed so far...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the band gap of titania is critically important to fully utilize its photocatalytic properties. Two main strategies, i. e. doping and partial {{reduction of}} Ti(IV), are the main alternatives available to date. Herein, we report a new synthesis strategy based on one-pot co-condensation of in situ prepared polymetallic titanium-alkoxide complexes with titanium tetrabutoxide. Using this direct reaction, {{it is possible to}} introduce organic compounds in the anatase phase, causing site distortions in the crystalline structure of the network. By using this strategy, a yellow and a black titania have been produced, with the <b>latter</b> <b>showing</b> a <b>remarkable</b> photocatalytic activity under visible-light.

40|$|AbstractMany {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} ease with which two spatially adjacent textures can be segmented. Our goal is to examine the representational system that determines the appearance of isolated patches of visual texture. To this end, similarity judgments from three subjects were obtained for 20 artificial textures comprising filtered noise. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed that three perceptual dimensions explain most of the variance in subjects’ similarity judgments. In addition, the three subjects’ similarity judgments and MDS solutions were highly correlated. A computational model utilizing the energy responses in seven bandpass filters explains an average of 80 % of the variability in the original similarity scores of individual subjects. In the model, energy responses are mapped to the perceptual space through a linear transformation that can be decomposed into two components. The first component decorrelates initial filter responses and the second component maps the decorrelated filter responses to a perceptual space. These <b>latter</b> transformations <b>show</b> <b>remarkable</b> agreement between the three subjects...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the situation with early artificial turf pitches, little information has previously been published on the characterisation of third-generation artificial surfaces. The spatial variation of ball rebound resilience and rotational resistance were measured here under dry conditions, late in the season, for two natural turf football pitches and a recently laid third-generation artificial turf pitch. Data for the natural turf pitches show a wider variation with position on the pitch than for the artificial pitch. The <b>latter</b> surface <b>showed</b> <b>remarkable</b> consistency in both quantities measured. Surprisingly, all ball rebound resilience data {{and some of the}} rotational resistance values were found to lie outside current FIFA specifications, possibly due to the level of wear in natural turf {{at this stage of the}} season. For the artificial turf, the deterioration in properties over a period of 6 months is significant and suggests more frequent testing is needed. Taking data from various pitch positions, the two measured quantities were shown for the first time, as far as we are aware, to be inversely related for both natural turf pitches. This correlation may be largely attributed to differences in the extent of grass cover and/or soil compaction. For artificial turf, the lack of variation in measured quantities with pitch position precluded the determination of any correlation...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{forces can}} {{regulate}} various functions in living cells. The cytoskeleton {{is a crucial}} element for the transduction of forces in cell-internal signals and subsequent biological responses. Accordingly, many studies in cellular biomechanics have {{been focused on the}} role of the contractile acto-myosin system in such processes. A widely used method to observe the dynamic actin network in living cells is the transgenic expression of fluorescent proteins fused to actin. However, adverse effects of GFP-actin fusion proteins on cell spreading, migration and cell adhesion strength have been reported. These shortcomings were shown to be partly overcome by fusions of actin binding peptides to fluorescent proteins. Nevertheless, it is not understood whether direct labeling by actin fusion proteins or indirect labeling via these chimaeras alters biomechanical responses of cells and the cytoskeleton to forces. We investigated the dynamic reorganization of actin stress fibers in cells under cyclic mechanical loading by transiently expressing either egfp-Lifeact or eyfp-actin in rat embryonic fibroblasts and observing them by means of live cell microscopy. Our results demonstrate that mechanically-induced actin stress fiber reorganization exhibits very different kinetics in EYFP-actin cells and EGFP-Lifeact cells, the <b>latter</b> <b>showing</b> a <b>remarkable</b> agreement with the reorganization kinetics of non-transfected cells under the same experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Neural Networks {{have shown}} to be a very {{attractive}} alternative to classic adaptation methods for identification and control of non-linear dynamic systems. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show the improvements in neural network applications achievable through the use of a learning algorithm more efficient than the classic Back-Propagation and through the implementation of the neural schemes in parallel hardware. In addition, applications to failure detection and identification of control loop components will be addressed. The paper illustrates dynamic simulations relative to examples of identification and control of non-linear unknown systems with on-line learning for the hardware-based neural architectures performed with both the classic and the Extended Back-Propagation algorithm. The <b>latter</b> algorithm has <b>shown</b> <b>remarkable</b> improvements with respect to the classic algorithm in terms of learning speed accuracy, and local minimum problems. The nelural schemes are implemented in a set of parallel transputer modules with appealing flexibility for on-line applicauons. 2...|$|R
40|$|Two graphene-like carbide derived carbons (CDC-Gs) were {{produced}} by chlorination of SiC nanosheets obtained by magnesio-thermal reduction at moderate temperature of silica/graphene oxide nanocomposites. These CDC-Gs were evaluated as supercapacitor electrode materials in an organic electrolyte. Starting {{from a low}} SiO 2 /GO ratio in the precursor, the resulting CDC-G nanosheets are composed of a few layers of graphite, partially coated with microporous CDC. In contrast, a high SiO 2 /GO ratio leads to micropores generated on the basal plane of individual carbon nanosheets. The <b>latter</b> CDC-G <b>shows</b> a <b>remarkable</b> high power capability with 76 % of retention of the initial capacity at scan rates up to 3 V s- 1. Notably, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and time constant of the cell {{were found to be}} extremely low at 0. 45 Ω cm 2 and 0. 4 s, respectively, thanks to the unique 2 D open surface and enhanced access to micropores. These features were attributed to the unique nanostructure of the microporous graphene...|$|R

Moreover, clinical trials demonstrated an improved collateralization after injection of bone marrow cells. In the present study, {{the expression of}} arteriogenic factors in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was measured to verify the potential of these cells to influence collateral artery growth. GM-CSF induced in BMDM the expression of monocyte chemoattractive protein (MCP) - 1, matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP) - 12, and arginase- 1 -the <b>latter</b> also <b>showing</b> a <b>remarkable</b> increase in activity. During in vivo induced arteriogenesis, the accumulation rate of macrophages around proliferating collaterals was significantly increased. We also show that MCP- 1 {{is found to be}} mainly expressed in the media of the vessel wall, MMP- 12 in macrophages of the adventitia, and arginase at both locations. This study provides {{for the first time a}} comprehensive analysis of GM-CSF/TGFbeta 1 -regulated arteriogenic factors in BMDM and supports the hypothesis that arteriogenesis is a multistage mechanism, including monocyte/macrophage adhesion and transmigration, pro-arteriogenic cytokine expression, degradation of connective tissue, and collagen synthesis regulation. Selective modulation of these mechanisms as well as cell-based therapies supplying arteriogenic factors in vivo point toward new strategies to influence collateral artery growt...|$|R

40|$|Aim:  To {{quantify}} how mammal community structure {{relates to}} heterogeneity of vegetation for palaeoecological reconstructions, and {{to test whether}} historical or environmental factors are more important in structuring communities. Location:  Sixty-three natural protected areas in Asia, Africa and South and Central America. Methods:  We defined faunal communities by allocating species to ecological guilds and calculating proportional representation within each guild. Vegetation heterogeneity for each natural protected area was calculated from satellite images. The relationship between these ecospaces was calculated using canonical correlations analysis, redundancy analysis and principal components analysis. We expected that large, herbivorous mammals would be most strongly correlated with open areas. Convergence was tested by independently eliminating the effects of geography and vegetation heterogeneity {{on the structure of}} the mammal communities. We expected that vegetation would more strongly structure communities than geographical position. Results:  We show that the guild structure of communities across habitats is significantly correlated with vegetation heterogeneity. The highest correlation was between small, scansorial-arboreal secondary consumers and heavy tree cover. The first convergence analysis shows American communities distinguished from Asian and African communities; these <b>latter</b> communities <b>show</b> a <b>remarkable</b> convergence in structure. Historical factors only affected the continent whose mammals had experienced a long period of isolation. The second convergence analysis shows that almost all biomes have the same or very similar community structure regardless of continent. Main conclusions:  Communities from the same environments in different continents <b>showed</b> <b>remarkable</b> convergence. Communities from the same continents only converged when those continents shared a recent geological and biological history. These results suggest that historical and environmental factors are operating over different timescales. This study confirms that environmental reconstructions {{made on the basis of}} whole communities will accurately reflect the environment that the community lived in. However, reconstructions made for fossil sites in deep time need to take historical factors into consideration. Small, arboreal and scansorial secondary consumers show the strongest correlation with vegetation, correlating with continuous tree canopy cover. This relationship allows simple reconstructions of the amount of tree cover occurring in a landscape from the proportion of species from the community falling in this ecological guild.
