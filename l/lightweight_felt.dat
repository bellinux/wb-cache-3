5000|$|Nuno felting is {{a fabric}} felting {{technique}} developed by Polly Stirling, a fiber artist from New South Wales, Australia, around 1992. The name {{is derived from}} the Japanese word [...] "nuno" [...] meaning cloth. The technique bonds loose fibre, usually wool, into a sheer fabric such as silk gauze, creating a <b>lightweight</b> <b>felt.</b> The fibres can completely cover the background fabric, or they may be used as a decorative design that allows the backing fabric to show. Nuno felting often incorporates several layers of loose fibres combined to build up colour, texture, and/or design elements in the finished fabric.|$|E
30|$|Our aim {{is here to}} use our {{experimental}} setup {{to characterize}} {{the properties of the}} frictional contact by directly measuring the friction force and to observe the resulting trajectories of the slider. In order to achieve a friction force which exhibits a rather large, 2 -fold, anisotropy, the table is covered with a sheet of corrugated cardboard (wavelength 3.5 mm, amplitude 1 mm) whereas the lower surface of the slider is covered with a disk of <b>lightweight</b> <b>felt</b> (thickness about 1 mm). Note that the corrugation of the surface is here only used a trick to introduce anisotropy of the frictional properties [18 – 20]. There is a vast literature concerning the relation between the physical properties of the surfaces in regard and the frictional properties, from both experimental and theoretical points of view [21]. As the question is out of the scope of the present study, we did not characterize further the corrugated surface. However, in Section “Force measurements”, we thoroughly characterize the friction force, whereas the associated trajectory is discussed in Section “F-plot and associated trajectory”.|$|E
5000|$|Being {{slightly}} {{shorter than}} most full-caliber rifles increases the muzzle blast from a scout rifle, and being <b>lightweight</b> increases the <b>felt</b> recoil (to a significant {{level in the}} Steyr Dragoon Scout due to its [...]376 Steyr cartridge). Even the recoil of the [...]308 Win. in a scout was described as feeling like a [...]300 Win. Mag. by Gun Tests.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} device to aid elderly lower-limb amputees who find {{conventional}} prostheses so uncomfortable and cumbersome that they prefer to stay in bed or use a wheelchair rather than wear the prosthesis, but who must remain ambulatory to maintain their health. The primary design requirements were comfort, lightness, simplicity and security. A combination axillary crutch - conventional prosthesis was designed and built which provides a comfortable socket for the residual limb and is simple to put on and remove. It is not <b>lightweight</b> but <b>felt</b> lighter to this user than an imitation conventional prosthesis constructed for testing purposes. The safety of the device was not tested, but it is stable under normal operating conditions. The device described in the following report is not an unqualified success but future research along these lines promises a useful, marketable aid for debilitated elderly lower-limb amputees...|$|R
50|$|Later in the year, Katsidis was {{scheduled}} to fight then-undefeated Darleys Pérez on 10 August at the Morongo Casino, but later withdrew on 25 July due to a knee injury. At one point during October, Katsidis was in the running for a high-profile welterweight bout against then-returning British star Ricky Hatton, but Hatton instead chose Vyacheslav Senchenko as his opponent. Katsidis later stated that from thereon he would stay at <b>lightweight,</b> which he <b>felt</b> was his natural weight class. In another in-depth December interview, Katsidis revealed that he had moved back to Sydney and hired veteran trainer Johnny Lewis for future bouts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The vectors {{involved}} in the spread of whirling disease, which is caused by Myxobolus cerebralis, are only partly understood. However, the parasite has rapidly become established in many regions, suggesting that it is easily disseminated. We gained insight into transport vectors by examining the surface porosity of common wading equipment materials and the adherence of M. cerebralis myxospores to them. Interstitial spaces within rubber, <b>felt,</b> <b>lightweight</b> nylon, and neoprene were measured on scanning electron microscope images. Myxospores were applied to each material, the material was rinsed, and the myxospores recovered to assess adherence. The mean interstitial space size of rubber was the smallest (2. 0 lm), whereas that of felt was the largest (31. 3 lm). The highest recovery rates were from rubber and the glass control. Percent myxospore recovery varied by material...|$|R
500|$|Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times {{hailed the}} novel as a [...] "puzzle palace of bewitching {{proportions}} and stubborn echoes", noting the fact that antihero Hubertus Bigend was the most prominent link to Pattern Recognition as [...] "deliciously sinister". Tim Martin thought that the plot lacked direction at times. Although he conceded that the novel's main Henry/Bigend storyline <b>felt</b> <b>lightweight,</b> Matt Thorne writing in The Independent conjectured that {{it was part of}} Gibson's conscious design that that thread [...] "plays out against a backdrop of hidden machinations that have a much darker, wider resonance". Thorne declared Spook Country a more substantial novel than its predecessor on this basis. John Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald concurred, writing that despite the similarity in the plots of the novels, the narrative foundation of the later novel was firmer, its structure [...] "more sophisticated" [...] and its [...] "seams less visible".|$|R
