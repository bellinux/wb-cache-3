40|$|Recent {{economic}} {{events have}} revived {{interest in the}} economic <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> or Kondratiev cycle, a cycle of economic expansion and depression lasting about fifty years. Since 1975 the System Dynamics National Model has provided an increasingly rich theory of the <b>long</b> <b>wave.</b> The theory revolves around "self-ordering" of capital, the dependence of the capital-producing sectors of the economy, in the aggregate, on their own output. The long-wave theory growing out of the National Model relates capital investment, employment and workforce participation, monetary and fiscal policy, inflation, productivity and innovation, and even political values. The advantage of the National Model is the rich detail in which economic behavior is represented. However, {{the complexity of the}} model makes it difficult to explain the dynamic hypothesis underlying the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> in a concise manner. This paper presents a simple model of the economic <b>long</b> <b>wave.</b> The structure of the model is shown to be consistent with the principles of bounded rationality. The behavior of the model is analyzed, and the role of self-ordering in generating the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> is determined. The model complements the National Model by providing a representation of the dynamic hypothesis that is amenable to formal analysis and is easily extended to include other important mechanisms that may influence the nature of the <b>long</b> <b>wave...</b>|$|R
25|$|Stokes' wave theory — a perturbation-series {{approach}} to the description of weakly nonlinear and dispersive waves, especially successful in deeper water for relative short wavelengths, {{as compared to the}} water depth. However, for <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> the Boussinesq approach—as also applied in the KdV equation—is often preferred. This is because in shallow water the Stokes' perturbation series needs many terms before convergence towards the solution, due to the peaked crests and long flat troughs of the nonlinear waves. While the KdV or Boussinesq models give good approximations for these long nonlinear waves.|$|E
25|$|Bending wave {{transducers}} use {{a diaphragm}} that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity {{of the material}} increases from the center to the outside. Short wavelengths radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach {{the edge of the}} speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range (80Hz to 35,000Hz) and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source. This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' wave {{theory is}} of direct {{practical}} use for waves on intermediate and deep water. It {{is used in}} the design of coastal and offshore structures, {{in order to determine the}} wave kinematics (free surface elevation and flow velocities). The wave kinematics are subsequently needed in the design process to determine the wave loads on a structure. For <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> (as compared to depth) – and using only a few terms in the Stokes expansion – its applicability is limited to waves of small amplitude. In such shallow water, a cnoidal wave theory often provides better periodic-wave approximations.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{off with}} {{pioneering}} work by Ernest Mandel from 1964, various {{attempts have been}} made to link the <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> of capitalist development to long-term fluctuations in average profitability. Mandel's influential Phd thesis Late Capitalism (in German 1972, English version 1975) was a critical response to Henryk Grossman's theory. Like Henryk Grossman, Mandel was convinced of the centrality of profitability in the trajectory of capitalist development, but Mandel did not believe that Marx's reproduction models could be used to create a theory of capitalist crises. In Grossman's profitability model, there was only a series of business cycles and, sometime after the 34th cycle, a general breakdown of capitalism, because insufficient surplus value was being generated. Leaving aside the issue of the validity of Grossman's model, his picture of capitalist development did not explain historical phases of faster and slower economic growth lasting about 25 years or so. After World War 2, a long boom occurred, instead of a deepening capitalist crisis which many Marxists had expected. That was what Mandel wanted to explain (Mandel's and Grossman's growth models both ignore the accumulation of non-productive capital assets and profits not arising from new surplus-value).|$|E
