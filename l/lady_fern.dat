5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. Silver birch is dominant, with a few crack willow, goat willow, {{some wild}} cherry and {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common <b>lady</b> <b>fern.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main {{difference}} between the spruce-fir forests of Southern Appalachia and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former. [...] The spruce-fir understories of the Smokies are home to catawba rhododendron, mountain ash, pin cherry, thornless blackberry, and hobblebush. [...] The herbaceous and litter layers of the spruce-fir forests are poorly lit year-round, and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as ferns, namely mountain wood fern and northern <b>lady</b> <b>fern,</b> and over 280 species of mosses.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{northern}} hardwoods {{manage to}} survive amidst the spruce–fir ecosystem, namely yellow birch, American mountain ash, and pin cherry, {{the latter being}} especially common in areas damaged by fire. [...] A typical southern spruce–fir understory is home to shrubs such as Catawba rhododendron, thornless blackberry, mountain cranberry, and witch-hobble. [...] The spruce–fir herbaceous layer contains ferns such as the mountain wood fern, northern <b>lady</b> <b>fern,</b> and clubmoss, and over 280 species of mosses. [...] Wildflowers include Canada mayflower, blue-bead lily, and mountain wood-sorrel. [...] The Rugels ragwort is found only in the spruce–fir forest of the Great Smoky Mountains, {{and is one of}} eight plant species endemic to the southern Appalachian spruce–fir ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|The {{park and}} environs were still rural when {{the park was}} established; further, most of the park is in a steep little canyon, so the park was spared all but minimal rural {{development}} {{as well as the}} surrounding boom of urban development. The full old growth forest (1,000 - 2,000 years old) was all clearcut relatively early (around the early 20th century); the predominantly maple-alder successional stage forest is today mature. Evergreens will gradually predominate. Typical trees include deciduous maple, alder, ash, and willow, with madrona, cascere, and evergreen Western Red Cedar, Western Hemlock, Douglas fir, pine, and spruce. Sedges, cattails, and other common indigenous flora fill out the understory and wetland areas, with particularly huge <b>Lady</b> <b>Ferns</b> along the ravine between 105th and 110th streets.|$|R
60|$|At last, at {{the bottom}} of a hill, they came to a spring; not such a spring as you see here, which soaks up out of a white gravel in the bog, among red fly-catchers, and pink bottle-heath, and sweet white orchis; nor such a one as you may see, too, here, which bubbles up under the warm {{sandbank}} in the hollow lane by the great tuft of <b>lady</b> <b>ferns,</b> and makes the sand dance reels {{at the bottom}}, day and night, all the year round; not such a spring as either of those; but a real North country limestone fountain, like one of those in Sicily or Greece, where the old heathen fancied the nymphs sat cooling themselves the hot summer's day, while the shepherds peeped at them from behind the bushes. Out of a low cave of rock, at the foot of a limestone crag, the great fountain rose, quelling, and bubbling, and gurgling, so clear that you could not tell where the water ended and the air began; and ran away under the road, a stream large enough to turn a mill; among blue geranium, and golden globe-flower, and wild raspberry, and the bird-cherry with its tassels of snow.|$|R
50|$|Some common {{native plants}} {{on the island}} are common rushes, reeds and sedges, cattails and mud disks. Other native plants on-site include: yarrow, Queen Anne’s lace(Anthriscus sylvestris), <b>lady</b> and sword <b>ferns,</b> blue aster, thistles, sweet pea, clovers, rose hips, fireweed, plantain, a stand of dead cottonwoods Populus sect.

2500|$|The Pacific {{silver fir}} (Abies amabilis) is {{extremely}} tolerant of shade {{and does not}} fare as well in drought or warmer temperatures. [...] It can grow as high as [...] and reach [...] in diameter. The understory communities of the Pacific silver fir can vary depending on moisture availability. Common understory shrubs include the vine maple, salal, Cascade Oregon grape, blueberry, mountain huckleberry, devil's club, and fool's huckleberry. Common understory herbs are bear grass, twin flower, pipsissewa, dwarf dogwood or bunchberry, bead lily, trailing blackberry, low false Solomon’s seal, foam flower, trillium, oak fern, and <b>lady</b> <b>fern.</b> The microclimate of the understory is moderated by the forest canopy causing the conditions to be cooler and moister {{in the summer and}} warmer in the winter. Pacific silver fir seedlings and saplings are often found growing under their own canopies or those of a mixed canopy forest. Along streams in this ecoregion, breaks in the forest are replaced by mountain alder, willow and vine maple and herbs such as saxifrage, yellow willow-herb, monkey flowers, and bluebells can be found. Mountain alder and vine maple can also be found around lake edges and in areas of flat or gentle slopes, bogs, or marsh habitat. Examples of Pacific silver fir forests {{can be found in the}} Commonwealth Basin and the Snow Lake areas of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.|$|E

60|$|That {{was full}} permission. Ever since Honora {{had been able}} to combine a narration, Humfrey had been the recipient, though she seldom knew whether he attended, and from her {{babyhood}} upwards had been quite contented with trotting {{in the wake of his}} long strides, pouring out her ardent fancies, now and then getting an answer, but more often going on like a little singing bird, through the midst of his avocations, and quite complacent under his interruptions of calls to his dogs, directions to his labourers, and warnings to her to mind her feet and not her chatter. In the full stream of crusaders, he led her down one of the multitude of by-paths cleared out in the hazel coppice for sporting; here leading up a rising ground whence the tops of the trees might be overlooked, some flecked with gold, some blushing into crimson, and beyond them the needle point of the village spire, the vane flashing back the sun; there bending into a ravine, marshy at the bottom, and nourishing the <b>lady</b> <b>fern,</b> then again crossing glades, where the rabbits darted across the path, and the battle of Damietta was broken into by stern orders to Fly to come to heel, and the eating of the nuts which Humfrey pulled down from the branches, and held up to his cousin with superior good nature.|$|E
60|$|In {{this manner}} Saunders discoursed {{all the while}} she was putting Marian to bed. Both she and her young lady wore doing what had much better have been let alone. Saunders had no {{business}} to carry complaints and gossip, Marian ought not to have listened to them; {{but the truth was}} that Saunders was an old attached confidential servant, who had come to Oakworthy, more because she could not bear to let her young master and mistress go entirely alone and unfriended among strangers, than because it would be prudent to save a little more before becoming Mrs. David Chapple. Fern Torr was absolute perfection in her eyes; and had the household at Oakworthy been of superior excellence, she would have found fault with everything in which it differed from the Manor House. Her heart was full; and to Miss Marian, her young <b>lady,</b> a <b>Fern</b> Torrite, a Devonian like herself, she must needs pour it out, where she had no other friend. On the other hand, Saunders was still in Marian's eyes a superior person--an authority--one whom she could never dream of keeping in order, or restraining; and here a friend, a counsellor, the only person, except Gerald, who had known the dear home.|$|R

The water quality is much improved since the Stewarton cloth mills closed and the river no longer carries their dyes and other pollutants as shown by the presence of freshwater limpets and shrimps, together with leeches, caddis fly larvae and water snail species.|$|R
6000|$|... 19.[12] Although {{there are}} few districts of Northern Europe, however {{apparently}} dull or tame, in which I cannot find pleasure; though the whole of Northern France (except Champagne), dull {{as it seems to}} most travellers, is to me a perpetual paradise; and, putting Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, and one or two such other perfectly flat districts aside, there is not an English county which I should not find entertainment in exploring the cross-roads of, foot by foot,--yet all my best enjoyment would be owing to the imagination of the hills, colouring with their far-away memories every lowland stone and herb. The pleasant French coteau, green in the sunshine, delights me either by what real mountain character it has in itself, (for in extent and succession of promontory, the flanks of the French valleys have quite the sublimity of true mountain distances,) or by its broken ground and rugged steps among the vines, and rise of the leafage above against the blue sky, as it might rise at Vevay or Como. There is not a wave of the Seine, but is associated in my mind with the first rise of the sandstones and forest pines of Fontainebleau; and with the hope of the Alps, as one leaves Paris, with the horses' heads to the southwest, the morning sun flashing on the bright waves at Charenton. If there be no hope or association of this kind, and if I cannot deceive myself into fancying that perhaps at the next rise of the road there may be the film of a blue hill in the gleam of sky at the horizon, the landscape, however beautiful, produces in me even a kind of sickness and pain; and the whole view from Richmond Hill or Windsor Terrace,--nay, the gardens of Alcinous, with their perpetual summer--or of the Hesperides, (if they were flat, and not close to Atlas,) golden apples and all, I would give away in an instant, for one mossy granite stone a foot broad, and two leaves of <b>lady</b> <b>fern.</b>|$|E
