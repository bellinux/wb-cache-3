The firm was first called the Electro-Alkaline Company. The name of its original bleach product, Clorox, was coined as a portmanteau of chlorine and sodium hydroxide, the two main ingredients. The original Clorox packaging featured a diamond-shaped logo, and the diamond shape has persisted in one form or another in Clorox branding to the present.The public, however, didn't know very much about <b>liquid</b> <b>bleach</b> when Clorox bleach debuted. Although the Electro-Alkaline Company started slowly and was about to collapse quickly, it would not be until 1916 when investor William Murray took over the company as general manager. His wife, Annie Murray, prompted the creation of a less-concentrated <b>liquid</b> <b>bleach</b> for home use, she built customer demand by giving away 15-ounce sample bottles at the family's grocery store in downtown Oakland.

METHODS: The study included 206 children who underwent EGD because of ingestion of caustic substances between January 2005 and August 2010. Retrospective analysis of data of the patients was performed. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1. 6 and mean age was 38. 1 1; 28. 8 mo. The caustic substances were acidic in 72 (34. 9 %) cases, alkaline in 56 (27. 2 %), <b>liquid</b> household <b>bleach</b> in 62 (30. 1 %), and unknown in 16 (7. 8 %). Fifty-seven (27. 7 %) patients were symptom-free. Significant clinical findings were observed in 149 (72. 3 %) patients. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings of esophageal injury were grade 0 in 86 (41. 7 %) patients, grade 1 in 49 (23. 8 %), grade 2 a in 42 (20. 4 %), grade 2 b in 28 (13. 6 %), and grade 3 a in 1 (0. 5 %) patient. 35 patients with grade 2 a, 2 b, and 3 a injuries underwent esophageal dilation at second week of ingestion. Esophageal stricture, which necessitated a regular dilation program developed in 13 of the aforementioned 35 patients. There is {{no statistically significant difference}} in the rate of development of esophageal stricture between the patients who ingested acidic (15. 3 %) and alkaline (8. 9 %) substances (P = 0. 32). Severe gastric injury was detected in 38 (18. 5 %) patients. The rate of development of gastric injury was significantly higher in the acidic group (14 %) than in the alkaline group (2. 9 %) (P = 0. 001). Out of 149 patients with clinical findings, 49 (32. 9 %) patients had no esophageal injury and 117 (78. 5 %) patients had no gastric lesion. Esophageal and severe gastric injuries were detected in 20 (35. 1 %) and 8 (14 %) of patients with no clinical findings respectively. Pyloric stenosis developed in 6 patients.

Measurement and evaluation of the samples from the occupational areas were performed during the two working shifts (morning and the afternoon) at the ground floor and {{the first floor of}} the building.     Results   The average concentrations for sulphur dioxides at the ground floor over the working   time of both shifts (in the morning and in the afternoon) were 0. 011 PPM and 0. 015 PPM,  respectively. In addition, the average concentrations for the same shifts at {{the first floor of the}}   building were 0. 019 PPM and 0. 014 PPM, respectively. The average concentrations of sulphuric acid mists at the ground floor for the morning and afternoon shifts were 0. 36 mg/m 3 and 1. 47 mg/m 3 and at the first floor they were 0. 66 mg/m 3 and 1. 35 mg/m 3,respectively. The results of measurements for sulphur dioxides gas revealed that contact with this gas in the Units of 300 and 600 was less than the permitted limit from NIOSH for the exposed workers to permissible exposure limit contacts (PEL TWA= 2 PPM). Further, the rate of working contact had a significant correlation with each of the indicators of both shifts and the place where this contact accured (P< 0. 001). The measurement results of sulphoric acid mists also revealed that the rate of contact with the mists for the workers being exposed to the gas in the Units of 300 and 600 in the morning shift was less and in the afternoon shift was more than the permissible limit from NIOSH (PEL TWA= 1 mg/m 3). In addition, the rate of working contact with sulphoric acid mists in terms of the working time and place showed a significant correlation (P< 0. 001).     Conclusion   It is concluded that the assumption " the amount of sulphur dioxides is beyond PEL in the breathing zone of workers "is disproved; and also the assumption that" the rate of sulphuric acid mist concentration is more than the permissible limit in the workers breathing zone in the afternoon shift is confirmed while in the morning shift is disprove...|$|R
40|$|Project Abstract for “Steam Cycle Washer for Unbleached Pulp” When completed, the {{patented}} SC Washer {{will provide}} an innovative, energy efficient demonstration project to wash unbleached pulp using a pressure vessel charged with steam. The Port Townsend Paper Corporation’s pulp mill in Port Townsend, WA was initially selected as the host site for conducting the demonstration of the SCW. Due to 2006 and 2007 delays in the project caused by issues with 21 st Century Pulp & Paper, the developer of the SCW, and the 2007 bankruptcy proceedings and subsequent restructuring at Port Townsend Paper, the mill can no longer serve as a host site. An alternate host site is now being sought to complete the commercial demonstration of the Steam Cycle Washer for Unbleached Pulp. Additionally, estimated costs to complete the project {{have more than doubled}} since the initial estimates for the project were completed in 2002. Additional grant funding from DOE was sought and in July, 2008 the additional DOE funds were procured under a new DOE award, DE-PS 36 - 08 GO 98014 issued to INL. Once the new host site is secured the completion of the project will begin under the management of INL. Future progress reports and milestone tracking will be completed under requirements of new DOE Award Number DE-PS 36 - 08 GO 98014. The following are excerpts from the project Peer Review completed in 2006. They describe the project in some detail. Additional information can be found by reviewing DOE Award Number: DE-PS 36 - 08 GO 98014. 5. Statement of Problem and Technical Barriers: The chemical pulping industry {{is one of the major}} users of fresh water in the United States. On average the industry uses over 80 tons of water to produce one ton of pulp, some states use up to 50 % more (Washington 120 and Wisconsin 140). In order to process one ton of pulp using 80 tons of process water, a large amount of: • energy is used in process heat and • power is required for pumping the large volume of pulp slurries through the pulping phases. Most water used in the pulping process ends up as warm waste water in the mill’s effluent discharge, which subsequently pollutes receiving waterways and carries an enormous amount of energy with it. Wash water reduction in brown stock washing with the Steam Cycle Washers (SCW) will save energy, up to 1 + million BTUs per ton of pulp in the evaporators alone. Reduction of <b>liquid</b> volume through <b>bleaching</b> stages will save process heat energy in the amount of 2 + million BTUs per ton of pulp, and as much as 80 – 100 kWhrs of electrical power per ton of pulp due to reduced pumping costs. Currently, the technical barriers to water reduction in chemical pulping are basically as follows: • conventional pulp washers wash the pulp at 10 - 14 % consistency, • conventional pulp washers use 12 – 16 tons of wash water per ton of pulp, and • they leave 30 – 70 lbs of soda (Na 2 SO 4) per ton of pulp as soda loss into the washed pulp. The amount of wash water in excess of the amount of process liquid in the pulp is called Dilution Factor (DF), even though it is not a factor in the mathematical sense but an addition. Modern pulp washing lines can wash efficiently with a DF of 3 but most pulp mills in the United States are washing with a DF of 5 - 7. Therefore, at 10 % washing consistency 14 - 16 tons of wash water is required and 14 % consistency requires 11 - 13 tons of wash water...|$|R
