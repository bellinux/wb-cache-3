Dressed in a sparkly pale-pink, [...] "princess-like" [...] dress and wearing glittery make-up, Perry {{sat on a}} swing that continued to rise high above the stage as she sang the lyrics to [...] "Not Like the Movies". MTV News reporter Mawuse Ziegbe called it a [...] "heartfelt tribute". Claire Suddath of Time magazine said the [...] "Valentine's Day–themed performance coupled with Perry's wedding footage made-up [...] for the swing that looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school–yearbook photo backdrop". She gave it a Suddath [...] "B+" [...] rating. Jon Bream of Star Tribune gave it a B grade.|$|E
500|$|Achieving Darla's {{look was}} a {{struggle}} for Benz. She said: [...] "Taking that makeup off, {{it was like having}} six layers of skin ripped off your face every time. It was miserable and the contact lenses were terrible. I don’t wear contacts and I don’t know how people do it, sticking things in their eyeballs all the time." [...] The character's sense of fashion is vital to understanding her past. Benz says Darla is [...] "dressed to the nines" [...] in every time period in which she lives, and [...] "she fully goes after a certain look. If she’s going to be living during the Boxer Rebellion time, she’s got the big Gibson Girl hair style and the beautiful kimono-style clothes." [...] Benz points out that in the Buffy pilot episode, Darla—attempting to dress <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school student—exaggerates it with a [...] "little twist", wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform instead. [...] "I think I influenced Darla fashion-wise in the second season of Angel where she was a little more classic-looking and tailored," [...] Benz says, explaining she collaborated with the costume designer to transition Darla into a [...] "hipper look" [...] when she became a vampire again. Darla shockingly becomes pregnant in the third season of Angel. In an interview with the BBC, Benz admitted: ...|$|E
500|$|Joss Whedon {{created the}} idea of [...] "vamp faces," [...] which was to have vampires' human {{features}} distort to become more demonic. Whedon wanted normal high school students that the other characters could interact with normally, only to have them turn out be vampires, therefore creating a sense of paranoia. He also wanted the vampires to be [...] "clearly monsters," [...] as to not make it seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school girl was killing normal (looking) people. The vampires originally appeared [...] "very white-faced, very creepy, very ghoulish". This was toned down in later episodes as the makeup was too time-consuming. Whedon claims that people thought the white faces to be [...] "funny looking" [...] but personally found it creepier, comparing it to the monsters in zombie movies such as Day of the Dead and The Evil Dead. The character of the Master {{was designed to be}} in vamp face permanently to highlight his age and make him appear more animalistic; make-up artist John Vulich based the Master's appearance on a bat, reasoning that the character has devolved to a more primal, demonic state over the years. It was decided that vampires and their clothes would turn to dust after they died. This was done for practical storytelling reasons, so the characters would not have to spend time cleaning up bodies. This episode introduced the idea that vampires' clothes would resemble the era in which they died, with Buffy identifying one by his dated outfit. Joss Whedon felt this concept was a [...] "charming notion" [...] but ultimately rejected it for the most part because he believed that, if every vampire in the show was dressed in old-fashioned clothes, they would cease to be scary.|$|E

Maybe Todd loves her in certain moments. Maybe in other moments, Todd just says he does. I played it <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school crush," [...] he said. [...] "I thought it would be more fascinating if Todd was walking around as a contradiction in terms of his feelings for Marty. Sometimes it was put-on, and other times, it was Todd thinking."

This means that for every complete revolution of the wheel, the car travels 82.1 in. If the Corvette had larger tires, it would travel farther with each revolution of the wheel, which would be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> gear.

Implicit effects are more relevant for purchase decisions and therefore more valuable than explicit reactions.|$|R

While Opel could match the speed of most Mercedes in the 2000 season, the hastily developed Abt-Audis were mainly outclassed. As the TT shape had rather poor aerodynamic properties, Abt was allowed to use a stretched form later.

50|$|Gallium {{phosphate}} (GaPO4 or gallium orthophosphate) is a colorless trigonal crystal with a hardness of 5.5 on the Mohs scale. GaPO4 is isotypic with quartz, possessing {{very similar}} properties, but the silicon atoms are alternately substituted with gallium and phosphorus, thereby doubling the piezoelectric effect. GaPO4 has many advantages over quartz for technical applications, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> {{electromechanical coupling coefficient}} in resonators, due to this doubling.Contrary to quartz, GaPO4 is not found in nature. Therefore, a hydrothermal process must be used to synthesize the crystal.|$|R

50|$|Seeps {{are usually}} not of {{sufficient}} volume to be flowing beyond their above-ground location.

Seeps mostly occur in lower elevation areas because water runs downhill, but can happen higher up if the groundwater present is abundant enough. Along with natural seeps, man made seeps can occur by digging anywhere where there is wet ground. This method can be useful for survival purposes and helps the local wildlife by adding another water source to the area.|$|R

Then Kit, pulling out the mast, held her off with the hook and the steamer rolled her bilge out of the water.
