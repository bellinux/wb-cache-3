Pairs of distant participants with specific roles (a guide and a manipulator) had to collaboratively move a virtual object in a plane factory mock-up. The displays allowed the participants to be immersed together in the virtual environment. We analyzed the dialogs that took place according to the frames of reference and the mental transformations required to produce the spatial statements. We also measured the associated mental workload. Results showed that when participants took a perspective, the manipulator’s point of view was preferred. Perspective-taking only yielded a moderate increase in mental rotations, which may explain a specifically high mental demand score for the guides’ NASA-TLX. Overall, this is in accordance with the <b>least</b> collaborative <b>effort</b> <b>principle.</b> This study reinforces the idea that, in collaboration, operators do not need the same aids as each other. Thus, {{it is not necessary to}} develop symmetrical tools, i. e., the same tools for all co-workers; instead, the needs of each operator should be taken into account, according to the task he has to perform.

It is the specific purpose to illustrate the journey to worship of households in the City of Waterloo, Ontario and to explain the spatial pattern utilizing the Principle of Least Effort. It is discovered that if historical tension and dimensional tension are considered, one is able to predict the actual pattern of the journey to worship with seventy per cent accuracy. The fact that a large per cent of the sample attend the closest church of their particular denomination {{at the time of}} entry into the earliest address in the Twin Cities appears to indicate that the distance to church is an important attraction factor. The travel patterns of all denominations are influenced similarly by the principle of least effort. This effect of the principle of least effort can be described mathematically using the Pareto function. An analysis of the socio-economic factors that could effect the space preference of households indicates that income, age, trip frequency, the number of programs utilized and family size do not significantly explain the travel patterns of the journey to worship to any great degree. In a final chapter the perception of households is analyzed as to which factors are considered most important in attracting the household to church.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} the {{statistical}} regularities observed {{in the field of}} information production and use has confirmed the exis-tence of important similarities. Thus, the existence of regu-larities and measurable ratios allow the prevision and the concept of laws. In the 1950 s, Shannon and Weaver [13] modelled the information circulation theory. The entropy hypothesis of this theory is that the more ranked a system is, the less information it produces. Theoretical studies have tried to formalise the connection between the bibliometric distribution and the entropy. In this paper, we try to extend previous results linked with ‘the <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> <b>principle</b> ’ and the analytical slope of a bibliometric distribution. In the first and second parts, we recall some statements about entropy and bibliometric distributions and, after that, we describe different links between them. 1. Entropy recalled Let a source of information produce n random events of respective probabilities p 1, p 2 …., pn where: We call entropy of such a source the following function H [4]: As well as in the systems studied in physical science, the higher the entropy source is, the less organised the system is (foreseeable here). Shannon and Weaver [13] suppose that the more ranked a system is, the less infor-mation it produces. Thus, the entropy H is at a maximum if all the events are equiprobable, i. e. if we have: i: pi and in this case H Log 2 (n). The logarithm function of base two is often used because it is coherent with the electronic information binary digit code (the bit being defined as the maximum entropy of the random binary source). It is possible to spread and generalise the entropy’s definition for a continuous law of probability. In this case, we will not talk about distribution, but density function (noted v) of a random phenomenon. We will define its entropy by the function: In bibliometrics, the events normally studied are the papers ’ or keywords ’ output, the books being borrowed, the author citing, etc. The sources taken into account will then be the authors, the bibliographical references H(v) v(t) Log(v(t)) d...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Today iron {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} metals in our daily life. The first iron objects resulting from smelting iron ores was dated to the 3 rd millennium BC. Iron smelting was developed in Anatolia (Turkey) and spread fast across the Mediterranean. Initially iron was considered a valuable metal, but by the 13 th century BC, it had evolved to a metal for daily use, in tools and weaponry. Iron slag, the metallurgical waste product of smelting and smithing activities, are often found on sites dating already from the Neolithic. Studying slag over metal object has the advantage that the record of slag is more complete (slag are rusty lumps not worth plundering), destructive analysis can be performed (since no one really cares about slag, except a select group of archaeometallurgist) and corrosion has little effect on the texture of the slag. Slag are one of the most underestimated find on archaeological sites, often classify in boxes as production waste material and discarded for decades. Slag found during almost three decades of excavations in Sagalassos, a Hellenistic to Early-Byzanine site in the SW of Turkey, underwent the same faith. The iron slag found in Sagalassos, were first described by Kucha et al. (1995). These authors attempted a first technological reconstruction of the iron production. Afterwards, slag were used for several smaller, mostly provenance studies. This thesis fills the gaps in the first studies and has two main aims, employing the framework of “chaîne opératoire”. Firstly, the local iron technology is reconstructed using chemical, mineralogical and statistical techniques. This includes among others the determination of the used raw materials as well as deducing the thermochemical history of the slag. Secondly, the “chaîne opératoire” offers a framework to put this technology in a broader, archaeological context. This includes determining the potential exchange of knowledge and goods based on provenance and spatial analysis, as well as determining the scale of the production, potential trade and the sustainability employing mass balance models. Iron slag are a complex amalgam of iron silicates, iron oxides and amorphous phases. This makes standard chemical and mineralogical analysis need adaptation specific to slag material [...] The chemical composition of the iron slag is determined by ICP-OES, applying an adapted LiBO 2 -fusion. Due to a change in legislation, sampling was unfortunately no longer allowed in Sagalassos during the course of this thesis. A new methodology, using HH-pXRF was developed to characterize iron slag in the field. For this study, a calibration was developed in cooperation with dr. R. Scott (KU Leuven), to obtain semi-quantitative results. Mineralogical characterization of the slag is acquired by optical microscopy and XRD-analysis. The minerals are quantified using the Rietveld method. Also here, adjustments specific for iron slag needed to be made. SEM was further used to refine the Rietveld implementation code for magnetite and ulvöspinel quantification in XRD. Interpretation of the chemical and mineralogical data is aided by applying statistical analysis, such as box- and kernel density plots, PCA, correlation tests, regression analysis and ANOVA. To obtain insight in the used raw materials and yield of the iron production process, mass balance calculations are necessary. Different models are tested and compared. It could be concluded that none of the model are applicable for the Sagalassos iron slag. The models require a thorough knowledge of the used raw materials, which is not the case for the Sagalassos sites. To estimate the scale of the production and ecological impact, this thesis needed to rely on ratio’s obtained from experimental archaeometallurgy. Three, potentially four smelting sites are identified in the Sagalassos territory: Bereket (dating inconclusive), Tekkeli Tepe (6 th- 7 th century AD), Dereköy (6 th- 7 th century AD) and potentially Düzen Tepe (5 th- 2 nd century BC). There are remarkable differences between the different sites in the use of raw material and the applied technology. At Bereket, a site 25 km SW of the administrative centre, a limonite ore in a chert matrix was exploitated for iron smelting. A clear ore dressing site, with chopped off chert, could be recognized. A slag heap of around 110 m² is found next to the ore dressing site. The main type of slag found at this site are tap slag, indicating the use of tap slagging furnace. The slag (and ore) are characterized by elevated Cr-values. CaO is clearly used as a flux. The iron smelting process must have been very efficient, since no free iron oxides are present and the main mineralogical constituent is hedenbergite and tephroite. At Tekkeli Tepe, iron slag are spread across a hill site. Magnetic images reveal the presence of two, maybe more, furnaces. A potential magnetite-spinel vein was exploitated at this site. The slag here are furnaced cooled slag, implying that the slag solidify at the bottom of the furnace. The slag are rich in Ti, V and Zr. CaO was clearly used as flux. The furnace efficiency is remarkable lower than that of Bereket. Euhedral magnetite, interpreted as unreacted magnetite ore, is the main constituent in the iron slag. Also other free iron oxides, such as wüstite, are present in the slag. At Dereköy, a similar slag type is recognized. Here, a magnetite-spinel placer deposit is the most likely candididate to be exploitated as iron ore. The slag are also rich in Ti, V and Zr and also here CaO was used as a flux. Also in the case of Dereköy the furnace efficiency is lower than that of Bereket, though a slight improvement compared to Tekkeli Tepe could be noticed. Magnetite is still present as remnant of the ore, but it has clearly reacted since hopper-shapes are the dominant texture in the slag. The reason for the efficiency difference between Bereket on the one hand and Tekkeli Tepe and Dereköy on the other, is related to the used ore. Ti will elevate the smelting temperature, making it more difficult to tap. Moreover, magnetite is more difficult to reduce than limonite. There are also some resemblances between the three sites. They are all three build on a hill site, probably exploiting the wind for their furnaces. The sites are also build in the proximities of their ores (<b>least</b> <b>effort</b> <b>principle),</b> away from the settlements. Finally, the applied furnace temperature falls in the same range of 900 - 1250 °C. It is unclear whether Düzen Tepe is a smelting or smithing site. Primary and secondary smiting slag are identified on the site. The presence of a valuable iron ore source, namely a magnetite placer deposit, and the possible identification of an ore dressing site, suggest however that also smelting activities occurred at Düzen Tepe. This implies, in comparison to Bereket, Tekkeli Tepe and Dereköy, that both smelting and smithing occurred within the city walls. The thermomechanical characteristics of the smithing slag indicate the use of a single, mechanically handled forging technique. This means that the smithed object is heated at constant temperature, after which it is hammered (mechanically deformed). This process is repeated over and over again and will result in a simple utility object. At the administrative centre of Sagalassos, the main activity is smithing. Three potential workshop dating Early Roman to Early Byzantine, are recognized, though most iron slag are found in secondary contexts (dump fill, road leveler). Based on the textural analysis of the slag, two main smithing techniques can be recognized. The dominant technique is the mechanically handled technique similar to Düzen Tepe. The second technique that emerges, is a temperature handled technique. Here different temperature regimes are recognized in the slag, indicating the forging of complex objects. Moreover, CaO is used as a protective agent, which can be indicative of the forging of cutting-edge objects. After the technological reconstruction, the data are further used to unravel the “chaîne opératore” of the site. The archaeological implications, mainly economical and politically, are further described. First of all, there does not seem to be an exchange of knowledge between the smelting sites. This can be related to a potential time lag or the distance between sites, but is most likely related to the different use of ores. Based on the provenance analysis, there does not seem to be an exchange of goods. The scale of the iron smelting sites is estimated based on literature of experimental archaeology. Though the sites of Bereket and Tekkeli Tepe are, in comparison to Düzen Tepe, considered industrial scaled iron production sites, compared to other Roman sites worldwide, the production is small. This implies that the Sagalassos sites are mainly self-sufficient, answering to local the local market and no export occurred. This however also implies that the ecological impact of the iron production was minor, surely compared to other wood consuming activities in the territory. The main demand of iron comes from civil demand, opposed to military demand. There does not seem to be a link between the type of smithing techniques and periods of conflict or supply to the Roman army. In general, this thesis showed that the iron production in the Sagalassos territory is small, mainly focusing on local civil (urban and rural) demand. There was no or limited trade. The impact on the local environment would have been minor. This thesis whipped off the dust that covered the iron slag of Sagalassos after being stored as production waste for almost 20 years and reconstructs the technology and associated “chaîne opératoire” of the iron production in the territory. It offered the opportunity to estimate the importance of Sagalassos as an iron production centre. Moreover, this thesis offers future archaeometallurgist a workflow applicable to smithing and smelting slag. This thesis contributes to the field of archaeometallurgy in general by offering a methodology and showing the importance of studying smithing slag, which are often discarded in literature. By studying SHB, the researcher obtains insight in the applied smithing techniques and thus the forged objects. Finally, this thesis also stresses the importance of mineralogical analysis, more important the use of simple optical microscopy to study the thermomechanical history of smelting and smithing slag. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> (Zipf 1949 [1972]). The principle is simple (all <b>effort</b> should be <b>least)</b> and universal (it governs the totality of human behavior). Since the principle is also functional, the thesis adopts a functional theory of language as its theoretical framework, i. e. Natural Linguistics. The explanatory system of Natural Linguistics posits that higher principles govern preferences, which, in turn, manifest themselves as concrete, specific processes in a given language. Therefore, the thesis’ aim is to investigate the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> on the basis of external evidence from English. The investigation falls into the three following strands: the investigation of the principle itself, the investigation of its application in articulatory effort and the investigation of its application in phonological processes. The structure of the thesis reflects the division of its broad aims. The first part of the thesis presents its theoretical background (Chapter One and Chapter Two), {{the second part of the}} thesis deals with application of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> in articulatory effort (Chapter Three and Chapter Four), whereas the third part discusses the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> in phonological processes (Chapter Five and Chapter Six). Chapter One serves as an introduction, examining various aspects of the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> such as its history, literature, operation and motivation. It overviews various names which denote <b>least</b> <b>effort,</b> explains the origins of the principle and reviews the literature devoted to the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> in a chronological order. The chapter also discusses the nature and operation of the principle, providing numerous examples of the principle at work. It emphasizes the universal character of the principle from the linguistic field (low-level phonetic processes and language universals) and the non-linguistic ones (physics, biology, psychology and cognitive sciences), proving that the principle governs human behavior and choices. Chapter Two provides the theoretical background of the thesis in terms of its theoretical framework and discusses the terms used in the thesis’ title, i. e. hierarchy and preference. It justifies the selection of Natural Linguistics as the thesis’ theoretical framework by outlining its major assumptions and demonstrating its explanatory power. As far as the concepts of hierarchy and preference are concerned, the chapter provides their definitions and reviews their various understandings via decision theories and linguistic preference-based theories. 	Since the thesis investigates the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> in language and speech, Chapter Three considers the articulatory aspect of effort. It reviews the notion of easy and difficult sounds and discusses the concept of articulatory effort, overviewing its literature as well as various understandings in a chronological fashion. The chapter also presents the concept of articulatory gestures within the framework of Articulatory Phonology. 	The thesis’ aim is to investigate the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> on the basis of external evidence, therefore Chapters Four and Six provide evidence in terms of three experiments, text message studies (Chapter Four) and phonological processes in English (Chapter Six). 	Chapter Four contains evidence for the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> in articulation on the basis of experiments. It describes the experiments in terms of their predictions and methodology. In particular, it discusses the adopted measure of effort established by means of the effort parameters as well as their status. The statistical methods of the experiments are also clarified. The chapter reports on the results of the experiments, presenting them in a graphical way and discusses their relation to the tested predictions. Chapter Four establishes a hierarchy of speakers’ preferences with reference to articulatory effort (Figures 30, 31). 	The thesis investigates the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> in phonological processes, thus Chapter Five is devoted to the discussion of phonological processes in Natural Phonology. The chapter explains the general nature and motivation of processes as well as the development of processes in child language. It also discusses the organization of processes in terms of their typology as well as the order in which processes apply. The chapter characterizes the semantic properties of processes and overviews Luschützky’s (1997) contribution to NP with respect to processes in terms of their typology and incorporation of articulatory gestures in the concept of a process. 	Chapter Six investigates phonological processes. In particular, it identifies the issues of lenition/fortition definition and process typology by presenting the current approaches to process definitions and their typology. Since the chapter concludes that no coherent definition of lenition/fortition exists, it develops alternative lenition/fortition definitions. The chapter also revises the typology of phonological processes under effort management, which is an extended version of the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort.</b> Chapter Seven concludes the thesis with a list of the concepts discussed in the thesis, enumerates the proposals made by the thesis in discussing the concepts and presents some questions for future research which have emerged in the course of investigation. The chapter also specifies the extent to which the investigation of the <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> is a meaningful contribution to phonology...|$|R

This study aimed to generally explain e-learning systems usage behavior in any country and region. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, two important evolved psychological traits (i. e., <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> and social interaction) were explored for their impacts on students’ decision making towards e-learning systems. Based on these two psychological traits, a new theoretical framework was developed to propose two relationships linking e-learning system usage and both <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> and social interaction. Propositions were further interpreted with qualitative data collected by the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique within an e-learning context. Both propositions are supported with collect data from research participants...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> {{is a broad}} {{theory that}} covers diverse fields from {{evolutionary}} biology to webpage design. It postulates that animals, people, even well-designed machines will naturally choose {{the path of least}} resistance or [...] "effort". It is closely related to many other similar principles: see Principle of least action or other articles listed below. This is perhaps best known or at least documented among researchers in the field of library and information science. Their principle states that an information-seeking client will tend to use the most convenient search method, in the least exacting mode available. Information seeking behavior stops as soon as minimally acceptable results are found. This theory holds true regardless of the user's proficiency as a searcher, or their level of subject expertise. Also, this theory takes into account the user’s previous information-seeking experience. The user will use the tools that are most familiar and easy to use that find results. The <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> is known as a “deterministic description of human behavior”. The <b>principle</b> of <b>least</b> <b>effort</b> applies not only in the library context, but also to any information-seeking activity. For example, one might consult a generalist co-worker down the hall rather than a specialist in another building, so long as the generalist's answers were within the threshold of acceptability.|$|R
