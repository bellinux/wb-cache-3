5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E

She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.|$|E

She recreated the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of Manipur in Dharamshala and Manali.|$|E

5|$|Nima Nourizadeh had {{previously}} only worked directing music videos and commercials, {{but he came}} to the producers' attention for his directing work on a series of party-themed Adidas commercials. Nourizadeh explained to the producers how he would want to develop the script and how he would want the film to <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel,</b> and he was eventually brought from London to Los Angeles, for what he believed would be two weeks, but stretched to two years. Phillips believed that Nourizadeh's interpretation of the film was compatible with his vision, influencing the decision to hire Nourizadeh in his feature film debut.|$|E

Nintendo further mentioned that the game would be played in 2D but use 3D models to create a 2.5D <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel.</b> The May 7 release was later delayed towards May 21, but the game's release date was eventually pushed back slightly to May 15; Nintendo also planned to release it {{around the same time}} that the Nintendo DS Lite launched, on June 11, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{introduction}} to the United States, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire has been credited with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it. The series revolutionized the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also {{became one of the}} highest-rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history, and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} several alumni owned {{vehicles}} that are painted {{to resemble the}} Wreck. These vehicles mimic the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of the Reck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One {{of the most famous}} instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|Though Disney gave Nomura {{freedom in}} the {{characters}} and worlds used for the games, {{he and his staff}} tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds. Nomura has stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics. He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic. When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of each world.|$|E

5|$|A playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII was {{included}} in the Japanese version of , released on April 16, 2009. Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the original development schedule, helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed {{for the remainder of the}} project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English localization began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases. The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Willamette University {{purchased}} the old building from the YWCA. The $1.35 million purchase included the main YWCA building {{adjacent to the}} former library {{for a total of}} , with the YWCA continuing their operations in the building for three years after the sale. After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor. Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of the original 1912 building.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} on Sonic the Hedgehog in 2004, {{after the completion}} of Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003). The team was considering working on an original non-Sonic project, with a realistic <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> and an advanced physics engine. When they were reassigned to work on the new Sonic game, they decided to retain the realistic approach for the new game. Series co-creator and team lead Yuji Naka envisioned the next-generation Sonic game as a reboot of the franchise, and wanted to mimic the success of superhero films such as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Batman Begins (2005). It was decided to use the same title as the original 1991 game that had launched the franchise to indicate {{that it would be a}} major advance from the previous games. The Havok physics engine, previously used in their PlayStation 2 game Astro Boy (2004), allowed them to create expansive levels previously impossible on earlier sixth generation consoles, and experiment with multiple play-styles. Game director Shun Nakamura demonstrated the engine during their stage shows at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
5|$|When {{the shuffle}} format was introduced, the Hot Seats and {{corresponding}} monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium, and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>feel,</b> in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E
