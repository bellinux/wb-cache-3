In later years, elderly motorists who had never acquired a more conventional drivers’ licence were happy to spell out that [...] "vehicles" [...] in this case included cars as evidence that they were indeed licensed to drive cars and did not need to take the additional test normally necessary for driving passenger cars (<b>Licence</b> <b>Category</b> 3).|$|E

To obtain the full, unlimited, driving licence after these three years, the candidate must not commit a serious traffic offence and attend two days of further driving training.|$|E

This expectation is supported by the experiences in Germany, where the minimum age for light motorcycles was lowered in the 1990 s.

40|$|Colombo Port City Development Project’ aims at {{reclaiming}} {{a minimum}} of 269 hectares of waterfront sheltered by Colombo South Harbour Breakwater for mixed development activities. It {{has been estimated that}} a total requirement of 26. 6 million m 3 of dredged sand and 3. 45 million m 3 of quarry materials for the reclamation and construction of coastal structures. The main objective of the present study is to assess and characterize the capability of identified quarry sites to provide different categories of rock for the project. The quarry site assessment of eleven quarries were carried out by incorporating factors such as rock quality parameters, mineable rock volume, type of rock, jointing or racturing in the rock mass, <b>licence</b> <b>category,</b> mining, hydrogeological and socio economic aspects. The data were gathered using numerous sources. Having combined geographic information systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE), the present study sought to locate the most suitable areas for rock quarrying to supply rock materials to Port City Project. The findings of the research indicate that four quarry sites are most capable of supplying all categories of rock and rest are more suitable for supplying rock products below 500 kg. Further findings of the research include suitable transportation routes and capacities for rock materials, potential adverse impacts on supplying materials and corresponding mitigatory measures to be adopted...|$|E
40|$|The {{study shows}} that a driving licence tuition system should be {{produced}} which would ensure that all those who obtain a driving licence have practised all items included as test items in the driving test. This can (apart from the awaited changes in the introductory tuition, new curriculum B and enhanced skid training) mean changing the existing driving test. One {{reason for this is}} that analyses of tuition patterns and driving test results show that those who have a larger proportion of their tuition covering certain items (for example, hard braking during private tuition and overtaking on 70 km/h roads and 90 km/h roads during driving school lessons) have a greater chance of not passing instead of passing the driving test. Another reason is that several of the items which the greatest proportion of those who have recently passed the test have never practised, either privately or with a driving school, also belong to the items that are included only to a small extent in the driving test. Examples of this are the items efficient braking, overtaking and driving in a roadwork's area. This should indicate that learner drivers and/or lay instructors, and also driving instructors/driving schools, in some way are aware of this fact, for which reason they conduct less tuition covering these items. The study was carried out with three aims; to describe how people aged 18 - 24 who have recently got their driving <b>licence</b> (<b>category</b> B driving licence) went through their driving instruction; to investigate, whether it can be explained why certain 18 - 24 -year-olds passed the category B driving licence test, or did not pass it, respectively; and to describe what deficiencies of competence there are with 18 - 24 -yearolds who did not pass the category B driving licence test...|$|E

5000|$|Cuba ( [...] ITU Region 2 [...] ): Faithful {{to their}} {{promise of a}} new {{universal}} 60m amateur band at WRC12, the Ministry of Communications of Cuba approved access to this new band for Cuban amateurs, reports CO7WT and CO2KK. The law, approved on January 20, 2014, allows {{the use of the}} 5 MHz spectrum from 5418 to 5430 kHz, a continuous 12 kHz-wide segment. The allocation is as a secondary user as per ITU RR 4.4 regulations, with the emphasis on its use in nets during emergencies - as Cuba is {{in the path of the}} Caribbean Hurricanes every year, this band provides a stable communication path for the island. The new law allows for everyday use, but once an Official Emergency is declared by the Cuban State then purely emergency traffic is permitted. Modes allowed are SSB, CW and Digital, the latter being limited to PSK31 and PSK63. All three Cuban <b>licence</b> <b>categories</b> can access the band based on Maximum Powers of 10W for Novices and 50W for all Other Licensees with a relaxation of this power limitation of up to 100W for all users in emergency conditions as needed for a reliable link establishment.

Access to this band is by individual operators requesting and obtaining approval from the authority which results in the modification of the amateur's licence.|$|R
