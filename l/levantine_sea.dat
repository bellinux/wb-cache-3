40|$|A well {{developed}} sapropel (S 5) was {{deposited in the}} eastern Mediterranean during the Last Interglacial (Eemian), 124 - 119 ka. Freshwater contributions to the basin at this time can be traced using the isotopic composition of Nd in planktonic foraminifera. This enables differentiation between radiogenic sources to the south, {{under the influence of}} the African monsoon, and unradiogenic sources to the north, relating to the mid-latitude westerlies. Here we compare new Nd data, from a core in the southeast Aegean Sea, with published data from the Ionian and <b>Levantine</b> <b>Seas.</b> Shifts towards more radiogenic Nd in the lower and middle parts of sapropel S 5 are most pronounced in the Ionian Sea record, with epsioln-Nd and d 18 O G. ruber co-varying more closely here than in the <b>Levantine</b> and Aegean <b>Seas.</b> This is consistent with a freshwater source proximal to the Ionian Sea site, likely indicating a substantial reactivation of rivers flowing northward from the central Saharan watershed. The lack, during S 5 deposition, of a noticeable shift towards more unradiogenic Nd in the Aegean record would exclude a large influx of water from the northern borders of the eastern Mediterranean during sapropel deposition. These findings support a scenario whereby the Last Interglacial eastern Mediterranean was influenced strongly by the remote effects of an intensified African monsoon, with more local precipitation in the northern borders contributing relatively little to the sea surface composition...|$|R

40|$|The {{drivers of}} {{population}} differentiation in oceanic high dispersal organisms, have been crucial {{for research in}} evolutionary biology. Adaptation to different environments is commonly invoked as a driver of differentiation in the oceans, in alternative to geographic isolation. In this study, we investigate the population structure and phylogeography of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in the Mediterranean Sea, using microsatellite loci and the entire mtDNA control region. By further comparing the Mediterranean populations with the well described Atlantic populations, we addressed the following hypotheses: (1) bottlenose dolphins show population structure within the environmentally complex Eastern Mediterranean Sea; (2) population structure was gained locally or otherwise results from chance distribution of preexisting genetic structure; (3) strong demographic variations within the Mediterranean basin have affected genetic variation sufficiently to bias detected patterns of population structure. Our results suggest that bottlenose dolphin exhibits population structures that correspond well to the main Mediterranean oceanographic basins. Furthermore, we found evidence for fine scale population division within the Adriatic and the <b>Levantine</b> <b>seas.</b> We further describe for the first time, a distinction between populations inhabiting pelagic and coastal regions within the Mediterranean. Phylogeographic analysis suggests that current genetic structure, results mostly from stochastic distribution of Atlantic genetic variation, during a recent postglacial expansion.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} study of benthic foraminiferal abundances in 4 cores {{from the central}} Aegean and NE <b>Levantine</b> <b>Seas,</b> spanning the interval from 30  ka BP to the present. The benthic foraminiferal faunas indicate that during LGM times, bottom waters were well ventilated, while organic flux to the sea floor {{was significantly higher than}} today. From 30 to 10. 2  ka BP, faunal density and composition suggest a gradual decrease in organic flux to the sea floor. This trend is interrupted by a short return to higher organic flux levels during the Younger Dryas (12. 8 – 11. 5  ka BP). The faunas immediately preceding the early to middle Holocene organic-rich layer (sapropel) S 1 are very similar to Late Holocene faunas, indicating oligotrophic conditions. The transition from well ventilated bottom waters to anoxic (Levantine Basin) or strongly dysoxic (Aegean Sea) bottom waters appears to take place within a time-span of only 600  years, from ∼ 10. 8 to 10. 2  ka BP. Sapropel S 1 (10. 2 – 6. 4  ka BP) is characterized by extended periods of bottom-water anoxia in the Levantine Basin, and by strongly dysoxic conditions punctuated by episodic re-ventilation events in the Aegean Sea. Re-establishment of fully oxygenated bottom-water conditions after sapropel S 1 was extremely rapid. The ensuing Late Holocene faunas are very similar to recent faunas found in the Aegean Sea, suggesting much lower fluxes of organic matter to the sea floor than during glacial times...|$|R

40|$|AimConservation {{priorities}} need to {{take the}} feasibility of protection measures into account. In times of economic pressure it is essential to identify the low-hanging fruit' for conservation: areas where human impacts are lower and biological diversity is still high, and thus conservation is more feasible. LocationWe used the Mediterranean large marine ecosystem (LME) as a case study to identify the overlapping areas of low threats and high diversity of vertebrate species at risk. MethodsThis LME is the first in the world to have a complete regional IUCN Red List assessment of the native marine fish. We augmented these data with distributions of marine mammals, marine turtles and seabirds at risk, and we calculated the spatial distributions of species at risk (IUCN densities). Using cumulative threats we identified priority areas for conservation of species at risk' (PACS), where IUCN diversities are high and threats are low. We assessed whether IUCN diversities and PACS were spatially congruent among taxa and we quantified whether PACS corresponded to current and proposed protected areas. ResultsIUCN densities and PACS were not highly correlated spatially among taxa. Continental shelves and deep-sea slopes of the Alboran Sea, western Mediterranean and Tunisian Plateau/Gulf of Sidra are identified as relevant for fish species at risk. The eastern side of the western Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea are identified as most relevant for endemic fish, and shelf and open sea areas distributed through the LME are most important for marine mammals and turtles at risk, while specific locations of the western Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean and <b>Levantine</b> <b>seas</b> are highlighted for seabirds.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to produce future {{scenarios}} on the river inputs of water and nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. They are based on the four contrasting scenarios that were developed by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) for the years 2030 and 2050 and implemented in a spatially explicit manner into the IMAGE model. We first identified the major drivers of the river fluxes by regression analyses, then tested the retained models against the past evolutions between 1970 and 2000, and finally applied the models to the MEA scenarios. For nutrients, the considered river data mainly refer to the large rivers for which long‐term time series exist (Rhone, Po, Ebro, and Danube). Here, recent trends were principally driven by fertilizer spreads (NO 3, PO 4), together with urban wastewater releases (PO 4). Future trends remain in the envelope of the observed variability during the last 40 years, both for the large rivers and, when extrapolated to the basin scales, also for the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea. At regional scales, however, the budgets considerably change. In the northern parts of the Mediterranean drainage basin, they uniformly tend to decrease, but they may strongly increase in the south and east. Water discharge is examined on a basis of 37 rivers, showing that this parameter is clearly linked to the evolution of climate. Because of the ongoing evolution toward dryer and warmer conditions, we predict a significant trend of decreasing freshwater fluxes for the future, which already started in the past. Regional hot spots for this decrease are the drainage basin of the Alboran Sea and, when also considering the inhabitant specific water fluxes, the basins of the Aegean and north <b>Levantine</b> <b>seas...</b>|$|R

An aim was to enable comparison with its congener Calanus finmarchicus, which has been studied intensively as a key component of European and north east Atlantic marine ecosystems. C finmarchicus is known to over-winter at depth, whereas the life-cycle of C helgolandicus is less well understood. Overwintering populations of C helgolandicus have been observed off the Atlantic coast between 400 and 800 m, while in the Mediterranean there is evidence of significant deep-water populations at depths as great as 4200 m. The biogeographical distribution of C helgolandicus in European coastal waters covers a wide range of habitats, from open ocean to coastal environments, and its contribution to mesozooplankton biomass ranges from 6 % to 93 %. Highest abundances were recorded in the Adriatic and off the west coast of Spain. C helgolandicus is generally found in 9 - 20 degrees C water, with maximum abundances from 13 - 17 degrees C. In contrast, C finmarchicus is found in cooler water between 0 and 15 degrees C, with peak abundances from 0 to 9 degrees C. As water has warmed in the North Atlantic over recent decades, the range of C. helgolandicus and its abundance on the fringes of its expanding range have increased. This review will facilitate development of population models of C. helgolandicus. This will not only help answer remaining questions but will improve our ability to forecast future changes, in response to a warming climate, in the abundance and distribution of this important species.

40|$|Lateglacial and Holocene faunal and stable-Isotope {{records from}} benthic foraminifers {{in the eastern}} Mediterranean Sea (EMS) suggest a high spatiotemporal {{variability}} of deep-water oxygenation and biogeochemical processes at the sea floor during that time Changes in the oxygenation and food availability of the deep-sea ecosystems are {{closely linked to the}} hydrology of the EMS borderlands; they reflect orbital and suborbital climate variations of the high northern latitudes and the African monsoon system During the last glacial maximum, cool surface waters and high evaporation resulted in maximum convection and oxic deep-waters in all sub-basins Strong wind-induced mixing fostered surface-water production with seasonal phytodetritus fluxes During the glacial termination and the Holocene, oxygenation and food availability of deep-sea benthic ecosystems were characterized by a pronounced regional differentiation Local deep-water formation and trophic conditions were particularly variable in the northern Aegean Sea as a response to changes in riverine runoff and Black Sea outflow During the interval of sapropel Si formation in the early Holocene, average oxygen levels decreased exponentially with increasing water depth, suggesting a basin-wide shallowing of vertical convection superimposed by local signals. In the northernmost Aegean Sea, deep-water ventilation persisted during the early period of Si formation, owing to temperature-driven local convection and the absence of low-salinity Black Sea outflow. At the same time, severe temporary anoxia occurred in the eastern Levantine basin at water depths as shallow as 900 m This area was likely influenced by enhanced nutrient Input of the Nile river that resulted in high organic matter fluxes and related high oxygen-consumption rates in the water column In the southern Aegean and <b>Levantine</b> <b>Seas,</b> we observe a gradual increase in deep-water residence times, preceding Si formation by approximately 1 - 1. 5 kyr Once oxygen levels fell below a critical threshold, the benthic ecosystems collapsed almost synchronously with the onset of Si deposition The recovery of benthic ecosystems during the terminal phase of SI formation is controlled by subsequently deeper convection and re-ventilation over a period of approximately 1500 years. After the re-ventilation of the various sub-basins had been completed during the middle and late Holocene, deep-water renewal was more or less similar to recent rates. During that time, deep-sea ecosystem variability was driven by short-term changes in food quantity and quality as well as in seasonality, all of which are linked to millennial-scale changes in riverine runoff and associated nutrient input.
