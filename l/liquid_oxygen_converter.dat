50|$|Piccard was the {{co-pilot}} for {{his wife}} Jeannette on {{the third and final}} voyage of the Century of Progress. The largest balloon in the world was conceived for him to fly at the World's Fair in 1933 but was flown there by US Navy pilots who were licensed. After this flight he created the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>converter</b> when the liquid failed to vaporize on descent after the cabin doors were open. Piccard developed a frost-free window, that was used on this flight and later by the Navy and Air Force in the B-24 Liberator or B-26 Marauder. He used blasting caps and TNT for releasing the balloon at launch and for remote release of external ballast from inside the sealed cabin. This was the first use of pyrotechnics for remote-controlled actuating devices in aircraft, an unpopular, revolutionary idea at the time. Later his student Robert R. Gilruth, who became the director of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, approved and used them in spacecraft.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> is {{a common}} {{cryogenic}} liquid oxidizer propellant for spacecraft rocket applications, usually in combination with liquid hydrogen, kerosene or methane. [...] <b>Liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> is useful in this role because it creates a high specific impulse.

Many modern rockets use <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen,</b> including the main engines on the now-retired Space Shuttle.|$|R

In addition, the influence of the injector geometry on the combustion roughness and stability has been investigated during steady-state operating points. An increased flame expansion was observed with a recessed injector element. At low momentum flux ratio, the pressure drop accross the injector increases with a recessed <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> tube compared with a flush tube. Furthermore, a recessed <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> tube led to be a smoother combustion in general; however, this configuration also led to additional resonant frequencies in the chamber acoustics...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> is {{available}} for portable use and may have advantages over gas cylinders. METHODS: The use and acceptability of <b>liquid</b> and gaseous <b>oxygen</b> was compared in 15 patients with chronic lung disease who had shown an improvement of at least 10 % in assessments of exercise tolerance and breathlessness with standard portable <b>oxygen.</b> Gaseous and <b>liquid</b> portable <b>oxygen</b> were provided in random order for two eight week periods, and assessments consisted of six minute walking tests, lung function tests, chronic respiratory disease index questionnaires, and diary cards. RESULTS: The walking distance was not significantly affected {{by the weight of}} the equipment with either system. Patients used the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> for significantly longer (23. 5 hours a week) than the gas cylinder (10 hours a week). When using <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> patients went out of the house on average for 19. 5 hours a week, compared with 15. 5 hours a week with gaseous <b>oxygen.</b> The <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> system was preferred because the oxygen lasted longer, filling was easier, and the canister was easier to carry.

40|$|AbstractLong-term {{oxygen therapy}} (LTOT) in {{patients}} with chronic hypoxaemia is an expanding field. Traditional stationary oxygen, with and without portable compressed gas cylinders, and portable <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> equipment is available today. No official guidelines exist for the prescription of <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> vs traditional oxygen supply in LTOT, although it is generally thought that patients receiving <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> are younger and less seriously affected. The authors tested this hypothesis by comparing register data from two national Scandinavian registers of patients on LTOT {{in the same time}} period; one including all the patients on traditional oxygen treatment alone, e. g. concentrators and compressed gas cylinders (n= 1039), the other including all the patients using portable <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> alone (n= 117). About 80 % of the patients in both groups suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Younger patients were found in the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> group (P< 0 · 004), but with clinically slightly worse blood gas derangement (mostly statistically significant). They had higher frequency of previous or present oedema (P< 0 · 0001), and there were more smokers in this group (P< 0 · 0001). No significant differences were seen with respect to sex distribution or oxygen delivery systems. Higher oxygen dose and longer daily oxygen treatment (P< 0 · 0001) were prescribed for the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> patients compared with the patients on traditional oxygen with statistically higher oxygen tension during the prescribed treatment. A slight further increase in PaCO 2 was seen in both groups during oxygen treatment, of doubtful significance.
