40|$|We {{determine}} local Hamiltonians, Poisson {{structures and}} conserved measures for the <b>linear</b> <b>flows</b> on ! 2. We study flows around critical points as deformations of the harmonic oscillator (HO) {{and the free}} particle. In particular the damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) is Hamiltonian with respect to non-standard Poisson structures for all non-zero values of the damping constant. Treating the DHO as a deformation of the HO, its qualitative phases {{can be related to}} the geometry of the corresponding deformed Poisson structures. 1 Introduction Although linear dynamical systems are mathematically trivial, we know from the Hartman-Grobman theorem that they are homeomorphic to generic flows in finite but sufficiently small neighbourhoods of hyperbolic fixed points. In this sense the properties of local Hamiltonians and Poisson structures associated with the <b>linear</b> <b>flows</b> are representative of a much larger category of dynamical system.

50|$|For a <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> on the torus either all orbits are {{periodic}} or all orbits are dense on {{a subset}} of the n-torus which is a k-torus. When the components of ω are rationally independent all the orbits are dense on the whole space. This can be easily seen in the two dimensional case: if the two components of ω are rationally independent then the Poincaré section of the flow on an edge of the unit square is an irrational rotation on a circle and therefore its orbits are dense on the circle, as a consequence the orbits of the flow must be dense on the torus.|$|E

5000|$|Albert Einsteins 1905 special {{relativity}} challenged {{the notion of}} absolute time, and could only formulate a definition of synchronization for clocks that mark a <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> of time: If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can determine the time values {{of events in the}} immediate proximity of A by finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood of B.But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in respect of time, an event at A with an event at B. We have so far defined only an [...] "A time" [...] and a [...] "B time."We have not defined a common [...] "time" [...] for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish by definition that the [...] "time" [...] required by light to travel from A to B equals the [...] "time" [...] it requires to travel from B to A.

The set H of all hyperbolic matrices is generic, {{in the sense that}} it is an open and dense subset of the set M of all d by d matrices. It is not difficult to see the density of H. In fact, λ is an eigenvalue of an arbitrary matrix A if and only if λ + ε is an eigenvalue of the matrix A + εI. Hence, for any positive ε lower than the modulus of the real part of each eigenvalue of A with nonzero real part, the matrix A + εI is hyperbolic and thus can be set arbitrarily closed to A. On the other hand, the proof of the openness of H is not so immediate, since it involves some kind of continuity of the real part of the eigenvalues...|$|R
