This potential corresponds to the magnetic-monopole-like field (Berry curvature), which causes the topological spin (polarization) transport of photons. The deviations of waves of right-hand and <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> occur in the opposite directions and orthogonally to the principal direction of motion.

But there seemed to be some seasonal variations in the ratio of right-hand polarization waves to left-hand ones. A pronounced example is that the emission at 25 kHz was linearly polarized in winter (July and August). The oscillographic patterns obtained with a direction finder seem to indicate that the emission at 12 kHz arrived simultaneously from various directions, and that the emission was almost elliptically polarized.

Although the azimuthal wave number estimated from an ion finite Larmor radius effect, is generally large (about 50), there is a marked difference between the events observed in the dawn and dusk sectors. In the dawn sector the waves have low frequencies (1 - 5 mHz), indicate <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> with respect to the ambient magnetic field, and propagate eastward with respect to the spacecraft. In the dusk sector the waves have high frequencies (5 - 15 mHz), indicate right-hand polarization, and propagate westward.

40|$|International audienceThe {{occurrence}} {{probability of}} the Io-controlled Jovian decameter radio emissions {{depends on the}} central meridian longitude and the orbital phase of the satellite Io. Investigations by Galopeau et al. (2004, 2007) have shown that some specific Jovian “active” longitudes favor the radiation. The authors proposed a model which involves the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) as the mechanism at {{the origin of the}} Jovian radio emissions produced near the local gyrofrequency, along an active magnetic field line carried away by Io through its revolution around Jupiter. Those studies brought out the existence of an active longitude anchored in Jupiter's magnetic field and directly related to the efficiency of the CMI. In the present analysis, we model the four occurrence regions associated to Io-controlled sources. This approach is in a reverse way of the parametric method developed by Galopeau et al. (2007). The properties of the propagation and polarization of the radio wave, derived from the CMI, are the key ingredients {{for the study of the}} beaming cone. It is shown that the lead angle of the active magnetic field line relative to Io has a significant effect on both the selection of the propagation conditions and the limit between the right- and <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> states. The modeled and observed occurrence regions are found to be similar for a lead angle of about 20 °.

40|$|Simultaneous {{records of}} VLF (very low frequencies) {{emissions}} {{have been carried}} out at two ground-based stations located at similar geomagnetic latitudes near L ~ 5. 5 and spaced in the longitude by ~ 400 km, Kannuslehto (KAN) in Finland and Lovozero (LOZ) in Russia, using quite similar VLF receivers with two calibrated orthogonal air-core loop antennas. We found that the general spectral properties of the VLF chorus emissions at these two stations were similar and typically have right-hand polarization. Contrary to VLF chorus, the short-period VLF emissions (periodic emissions, PE) in which separated spectral elements are repeated with the periodicity of 3 – 4 s were mostly left-hand polarized. Usually, these waves propagated in the north–south direction. We suppose that PEs are generated inside of the plasmasphere by the cyclotron instability under a quasi-linear relaxation of the energetic electron distribution function. However, sometimes PE occurred only at an individual station. We speculated that this could be due to the influence of the local inhomogeneities to the VLF waves during the propagation through the ionospheric trough to the ground. Unusual series of short-duration (10 – 100 s) bursts of VLF emissions, lasting several hours, were also found in the morning under very quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp ~ 0 – 1). Generally, these emissions were observed simultaneously at KAN and LOZ showing both right-hand and <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarization,</b> and different arrival directions provided the rather extended ionospheric exit area...|$|E

The wave properties match the usual properties of the Pc 1  2 mantle waves: small angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field line, <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarization,</b> and propagation toward the ionosphere. We report here the first direct wave vector measurement of these waves (about 1. 2 &# 8201;×&# 8201; 10 &# 8722;&# 8201; 2 &# 8201;rad/km) through multi spacecraft analysis using the three magnetic components and, at the same time, through single spacecraft analysis based on the refractive index analysis using the three magnetic components and two electric components. The refractive index analysis offers {{a simple way to}} estimate wave numbers in this frequency range. Numerical calculations are performed under the observed plasma conditions. The obtained results show that the ion distribution functions are unstable to ion cyclotron instability at the observed wave vector value, due to the large ion temperature anisotropy. We thus show that these electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are amplified in the distant cusp region. The Poynting flux of the waves is counterstreaming with respect to the plasma flow. This sense of propagation is consistent with the time necessary to amplify the emissions to the observed level.

40|$|Recently Breneman et al. {{reported}} {{observations of}} large amplitude lightning and transmitter whistler mode waves from two STEREO {{passes through the}} inner radiation belt (L< 2). Hodograms of the electric field in the plane transverse to the magnetic field showed that the transmitter waves underwent periodic polarization reversals. Specifically, their polarization would cycle through a pattern of right-hand to linear to <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> {{at a rate of}} roughly 200 Hz. The lightning whistlers were observed to be left-hand polarized at frequencies greater than the lower hybrid frequency and less than the transmitter frequency (21. 4 kHz) and right-hand polarized otherwise. Only righthand polarized waves in the inner radiation belt should exist in the frequency range of the whistler mode and these reversals were not explained in the previous paper. We show, with a combination of observations and simulated wave superposition, that these polarization reversals are due to the beating of an incident electromagnetic whistler mode wave at 21. 4 kHz and linearly polarized, symmetric lower hybrid sidebands Doppler-shifted from the incident wave by +/- 200 Hz. The existence of the lower hybrid waves is consistent with the parametric decay mechanism of Lee and Kuo whereby an incident whistler mode wave decays into symmetric, short wavelength lower hybrid waves and a purely growing (zero-frequency) mode. Like the lower hybrid waves, the purely growing mode is Doppler-shifted by 200 Hz as observed on STEREO. This decay mechanism in the upper ionosphere has been previously reported at equatorial latitudes and is thought to have a direct connection with explosive spread F enhancements. As such it may represent another dissipation mechanism of VLF wave energy in the ionosphere and may help to explain a deficit of observed lightning and transmitter energy in the inner radiation belts as reported by Starks et al...|$|E
