50|$|Deadfalls are a {{primitive}} type of trap where one uses a rock or a log to catch an animal. Deadfalls {{have a long}} history among Native Americans. The flat rock or log must weigh five times more than the target animal. The rock or log is elevated with a <b>lever</b> <b>type</b> of action, using sticks. Sometimes string or wire is used with the lever. The rock or log was elevated 1 to 3 feet above the ground. There are several methods for making a trigger, which is placed under the deadfall. When the animal approaches the bait and touches the trigger, the rock or log falls, crushing the animal. These traps cost nothing to make but are time consuming to construct. These type of traps can be made before the season but just not set. When steel traps were invented in the late 1600s, trappers were able to make sets faster without having to construct deadfalls or snares.|$|E

50|$|Nail {{clippers}} {{are usually}} made {{of stainless steel}} but can also be made of plastic and aluminium. Two common varieties are the plier type and the compound <b>lever</b> <b>type.</b> Most nail clippers usually come with another tool attached, {{which is used to}} clean dirt out from under nails. A nail clipper often has a miniature file fixed to it to allow rough edges of nails to be manicured. A nail file allows for removal of any excess nail that is jagged or has been missed. Nail clippers occasionally come with a pocket knife or a nail catcher; the multi-purpose nail clipper was invented by Hungarian inventor David Gestetner. The nail clipper consists of a head which may be concave or convex. Specialized nail clippers which have convex clipping ends are intended for trimming toenails, while concave clipping ends are for fingernails. The cutting head may be manufactured to be parallel or perpendicular to the principal axis of the cutter. Cutting heads which are parallel to the principal axis are made to address accessibility issues involved with cutting toenails.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Currently, {{many types}} of string hopper {{machines}} are available in Sri Lanka. One is a rotary type {{and the other one}} is the <b>lever</b> <b>type</b> string hopper machine. Rotary type machine which is available in the local market has a main drawback of having to remove the cylinder for each batch of 100 string hoppers [1]. For this task handle should be rotated until the rack comes to its uppermost position which makes the operator fatigued and consumes more time. Another one is the <b>lever</b> <b>type</b> string hopper machine which is operated by a lever mechanism connected to a piston. Disadvantage of this machine is for each 15 hoppers, the cylinder should be refilled. This paper discusses the design of an automated low cost string hopper machine to be used in medium scale industry. The designed new machine has an ability to stop the string hopper mold rotator at the required position, ease of feeding, and better accessibility for cleaning. The proposed machine is also is affordable in price, particularly for the small and medium scale string hopper manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|Research on bimanual {{coordination}} of hand movements has identified several loci of bimanual interference, including interference because of programming different movement parameters or selecting different {{targets for the}} two hands. This study investigates the extent and origin of interference when participants execute bimanual actions with tools. In the experiments, participants moved two tools, one with each hand, to two directly cued target locations. One type of tool transformed the body movement into a spatially compatible movement of the effective part of the tool, whereas the other transformed it into a spatially incompatible movement. Tool transformations for the two hands were either the same or different. Furthermore, target locations were either in the same or in different spatial directions. Results indicated significantly shorter reaction times (RTs) and less errors when tool transformations were the same for both hands. In addition, movements were initiated more quickly and less error-prone when targets {{were in the same}} direction, but this effect was modulated by the congruency of the two lever transformations. Investigations of the time course of the effects revealed that they were not because of early perceptual processing (Experiment 2). Furthermore, the general pattern of results occurred for different grip positions (Experiment 3) and different <b>lever</b> <b>types</b> (Experiment 4), suggesting that it reflects rather general constraints in bimanual {{coordination of}} tool-use actions...|$|R

40|$|The cranial {{osteology}} of C. venustus, L. dimidiatus and S. fasciatus is described. C. venustus and L. dimidiatus possess three features {{characteristic of}} the family Labridae: protrusible upper jaws, the ascending process of the maxilla longer than the alveolar process, and the alveolar process of the premaxilla attached by fibrous tissue to the distal end of the maxilla {{which in turn is}} fastened to the ascending process of the dentary. The neurocranium of C. venustus shows several features involved in strengthening the skull to withstand the strong forces applied during feeding when crushing molluscs, barnacles and crabs as well as turning over slabs of coral. The forward movement of jaws and eyes have permitted L. dimidiatus to feed by picking small organisms off the general body surface, pharynx, gills and buccal cavity of host fish. S. fasciatus has at least three features characteristic of scarids: fused teeth on the premaxillae and dentary, a premaxilla firmly attached to the maxilla, and a secondary joint between the dentary and articular producing a compound <b>lever</b> <b>type</b> of articulation for the lower jaw.

40|$|The {{key element}} of robot is its gripper system, which can {{accommodate}} a variety of work pieces. Two finger grippers sometimes of <b>lever</b> <b>type,</b> cam type, gear type or mixed type are very common for many industrial applications. The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and tendons. Various hardware elements have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with electric tendon actuation system. As a first step towards achieving pretension, optimal flexibility, high performance and well-behaved characteristics of the gripper, a multiple degree-of-freedom dextrous hand has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Various tactile and non-tactile sensors have been designed and mounted on the fingers with necessary control. During the execution of tasks, slip sensors provide information for grasping and manipulating the objects with certainty. The force sensors provide the magnitude of optimum force during grasping without slip. Thus the prototype gripper {{has been found to}} be capable of grasping the objects of different shapes with an optimal force...|$|E
40|$|In {{the simple}} plastic theory {{commonly}} used for mild steel {{it is assumed}} that after yielding has occurred in either tension or compression, straining can continue indefinitely at constant stress. Such au assumption has been found satisfactory for low carbon steels having a plastic range corresponding to eight to ten times the strain a t yield, but for steels of greater strength th is range is often considerably shorter, and it becomes necessary {{to take into account the}} strain-hardening range beyond. To obtain experimental data, four steels were selected, varying in carbon content from 0. 28 to 0. 89 per cent, and having widely different stress-strain relations. For each steel a number of simply supported beams of square section were subjected to a symmetrical two-point loading; tension specimens were prepared from the unyielded ends of these beams and tested in a spring-loaded autographic testing machine to determine upper and lower yield stresses. In addition, two tension specimens from each steel were tested in a <b>lever</b> <b>type</b> of machine, and the strt%ss-strain relations through the plastic range and the initial stages of the strain-hardening range were obtained with the aid of a “Gerard ” extensometer.
