25|$|In 1928 the Governatorato of Rome asked {{architect}} Adolfo Pernier {{to restore}} the building, which for the holy year of 1925 had been painted in yellow. The architect after an accurate survey brought the palace back to its original early 16th century pristine condition, removing all the later additions, including the balcony along Via del Sant'Uffizio. Only three years later, after {{the signing of the}} <b>Lateran</b> <b>treaties,</b> the edifice had to be pulled down {{in the wake of the}} definition of the border between Italy and the newly established state of Vatican City.|$|E
25|$|To bolster his own new regime, Benito Mussolini {{was also}} eager for an agreement. After years of negotiation, in 1929, the Pope {{supervised}} {{the signing of}} the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaties</b> with the Italian government. According to the terms of the treaty {{that was one of the}} agreed documents, Vatican City was given sovereignty as an independent nation in return for the Vatican relinquishing its claim to the former territories of the Papal States. Pius XI thus became a head of state (albeit the smallest state in the world), the first Pope who could be termed a head of state since the Papal States fell after the unification of Italy in the 19th century. The concordat that was another of the agreed documents of 1929 recognised Catholicism as the sole religion of the state (as it already was under Italian law, while other religions were tolerated), paid salaries to priests and bishops, gave civil recognition to church marriages (previously couples had to have a civil ceremony), and brought religious instruction into the public schools. In turn, the bishops swore allegiance to the Italian state, which had a veto power over their selection. The Church was not officially obligated its support the Fascist regime; the strong differences remained, but the seething hostility ended. The Church especially endorsed foreign policies, such as support for the anti-Communist side in the Spanish Civil War, and support for the conquest of Ethiopia. Friction continued over the Catholic Action youth network, which Mussolini wanted to merge into his Fascist youth group.|$|E

5000|$|In 1929, Mussolini, {{on behalf}} of the King, signed the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaty.</b> The treaty was one of the three {{agreements}} made that year between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See.

500|$|Italian {{unification}} of the 1860s incorporated the Papal States, including Rome itself from 1870, into the Kingdom of Italy, thus ending the papacy's millennial temporal power. The pope rejected the Italian Law of Guarantees, which granted him special privileges, {{and to avoid}} placing himself in visible subjection to the Italian authorities remained a [...] "prisoner in the Vatican". This stand-off, which was spoken of as the Roman Question, was resolved by the 1929 <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaties,</b> whereby the Holy See acknowledged Italian sovereignty over the former Papal States and Italy recognised papal sovereignty over Vatican City as a new sovereign and independent state.|$|E
500|$|The {{location}} of the conclaves became fixed only in the fourteenth century. Since {{the end of the}} Western Schism in 1417, however, elections have always taken place in Rome (except in 1800, when French troops occupying Rome forced the election to be held in Venice), and normally in what, since the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaties</b> of 1929, has become the independent Vatican City State. Since 1846, when the Quirinal Palace was used, the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has always served as the {{location of}} the election. Popes have often fine-tuned the rules for the election of their successors: Pope Pius XII's Vacantis Apostolicae Sedis of 1945 governed the conclave of 1958, Pope John XXIII's Summi Pontificis Electio of 1962 that of 1963, Pope Paul VI's Romano Pontifici Eligendo of 1975 those of 1978, and John Paul II's Universi Dominici Gregis of 1996 that of 2005.

2500|$|For {{a further}} group, the legal {{personality}} of the Holy See in international law arises from the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaty,</b> which, in their view, conferred international standing to the central government of the Catholic Church. In this sense, Oppenheim argued that [...] "the previously controversial international position of the Holy See was clarified {{as the result of}} the Treaty of 11 February 1929, between the Holy See and Italy - the so called <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaty.</b> (...) The <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaty</b> marks the resumption of the formal membership, interrupted in 1871, of the Holy See in the society of states." ...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{important}} constituent of the Fascist {{cultural policy}} was Roman Catholicism. In 1929, a concordat with the Vatican was signed, ending decades of {{struggle between the}} Italian state and the Papacy that dated back to the 1870 takeover of the Papal States by the House of Savoy during the unification of Italy. The <b>Lateran</b> <b>treaties,</b> by which the Italian state was at last recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, and the independence of Vatican City was recognized by the Italian state, were so much appreciated by the ecclesiastic hierarchy that Pope Pius XI acclaimed Mussolini as [...] "the Man of Providence".|$|E
2500|$|A {{separate}} {{question is}} whether the Holy See was a subject of international law between 1870, when the Kingdom of Italy annexed the Papal States, and 1929, when the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaties</b> were signed. [...] The United States, for instance, suspended diplomatic relations with the Holy See when it lost the Papal States. Similarly Oppenheim believed that the legal personality of the Papal States became extinct in 1870. For him, between 1870 and 1929, the [...] "Holy See was not an international person," [...] although, [...] "it had by custom and tacit consent of most states acquired a quasi-international position" [...] The United Nations International Law Commission noted, nonetheless, that: ...|$|E

[...] The obelisk and Maderno's fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the Via della Conciliazione, built by Mussolini after {{the conclusion of the}} <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaties,</b> leads from the River Tiber to the piazza and gives distant views of St. Peter's as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a terminating vista.|$|E

The <b>Lateran</b> <b>treaties</b> with Italy (1929) were {{concluded}} before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Roman Catholicism {{had become}} the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic Catholic Popular Party, in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged Catholic Action, 'an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing.' It was permitted only {{so long as it}} developed [...] "its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles.' Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of nullity in the area of marriage).|$|E
2500|$|Speaking very generally, Italian {{coats of}} arms {{may be said}} to be {{familial}} rather than personal. A formal system for indicating cadency is unknown outside the House of Savoy. In Italy there has been no official regulation of familial coats of arms or titles of nobility since abolition of the Consulta Araldica in 1948, and that body addressed itself primarily to state recognition of titles of nobility rather than the heraldry of untitled armigers such as nobili (untitled nobles) and patrizi (of the patriciates in the former city-states). Until the unification of the country in the decade leading to 1870, the issuance and use of familial coats of arms was exercised rather loosely in the various Italian states, with each region applying its own laws, and the principal focus was titles of nobility or (before circa 1800) feudal rights. Indeed, upon ennoblement, a count or baron not from an armigerous family might actually assume his own, original coat of arms without recourse to any authority. [...] For this reason, actual grants of arms were very rare. There is no complete armory of Italian coats of arms, though certain authors, most importantly [...] Giambattista Crollalanza, compiled references which appear to be nearly complete. Until the establishment of the republic (1946) and its constitution two years later, most coats of arms in Italy appertained to noble families, whether titled or not, although a number of blazons were identified with cittadini (burghers) whose families had used these for a century or more. [...] The Blasonario contemplated by the Consulta Araldica would have been an official compilation of blazons (i.e. an armory) but, unfortunately, it was still in a very early draft stage when the monarchy fell in 1946. In 1967 the Constitutional Court ruled that nobiliary and heraldic matters were [...] "outside the scope of the law". Italy's concordat with the Vatican in 1984, revising the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Treaties,</b> abrogated the article whereby Italy recognises Papal titles.|$|E
