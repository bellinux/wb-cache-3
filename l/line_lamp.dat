50|$|Both types use the {{following}} scheme: {{the light from}} an excitation source passes through a filter or monochromator, and strikes the sample. A proportion of the incident light is absorbed by the sample, {{and some of the}} molecules in the sample fluoresce. The fluorescent light is emitted in all directions. Some of this fluorescent light passes through a second filter or monochromator and reaches a detector, which is usually placed at 90° to the incident light beam to minimize the risk of transmitted or reflected incident light reaching the detector.Various light sources may be used as excitation sources, including lasers, LED, and lamps; xenon arcs and mercury-vapor lamps in particular. A laser only emits light of high irradiance at a very narrow wavelength interval, typically under 0.01 nm, which makes an excitation monochromator or filter unnecessary. The disadvantage of this method is that the wavelength of a laser cannot be changed by much. A mercury vapor lamp is a <b>line</b> <b>lamp,</b> meaning it emits light near peak wavelengths. By contrast, a xenon arc has a continuous emission spectrum with nearly constant intensity in the range from 300-800 nm and a sufficient irradiance for measurements down to just above 200 nm.|$|E
40|$|Photoionization ion {{cyclotron}} resonance (pi-icr) spectroscopy is described in detail. The construction and use of rare gas resonance line lamps employing LiF windows is described, with principle emphasis on the argon resonance <b>line</b> <b>lamp</b> that produces photons of 11. 62 and 11. 83 eV. Calculations of the number density and single resonance signal intensity are made for primary, secondary, and tertiary ions, and the low pressure lineshape calculated for an unreactive primary ion. The ion chemistry of propanal, acetone, and propylene oxide (empirical formula C_ 3 H_ 6 O) is investigated using pi-icr with the argon resonance <b>line</b> <b>lamp.</b> The major reaction sequence in propanal and acetone is parent ion producing protonated parent ion, which condenses with the parent neutral to produce the proton bound dimer. This is also the reaction sequence in ethylene oxide. In propylene oxide, however, the parent ion relative abundance is esentially constant from 10 ^(- 6) to 10 ^(- 4) torr.

40|$|A {{calibration}} {{program was}} carried out to determine {{the quality of the}} wavelength calibration for the rst-order CCD spectroscopic modes at the E 1 pseudo-aperture locations. These apertures have been used since Cycle 10 to mitigate the effects of CCD charge transfer inefciency. Emission line spectra from the HITM 1 wavelength calibration lamp were obtained. This lamp illuminates the CCD near row 900; where the E 1 apertures are located, far better than does the <b>LINE</b> <b>lamp.</b> These data les were reduced using the wavelength calibration les used in the standard CALSTIS pipeline, and the magnitude of the errors was determined. It was found that, within measurement errors, all modes except G 750 L c = 7751 are within the limits given in the STIS Instrument Handbook, although the calibration is often not as good as in the nominal case using the standard apertures, and it quickly degrades at row numbers greater than 900...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, construction, {{and performance of}} a variable angle photoelectron spectrometer. The experiment consists of a stationary resonance <b>line</b> <b>lamp,</b> a sample chamber, and a rotatable electrostatic electron energy analyzer. Experiment operation is extensively automated through several interfaces to a small on-line digital computer. Results are presented {{for a variety of}} atomic, diatomic, and polyatomic sample gases. In the case of Ar, Ne, N 2, and CO, higher order lines in the resonance <b>line</b> <b>lamp</b> produce many peaks which do not overlap extensively with those of the principal vacuum-ultraviolet output. The additional lamp output lines allow for measurement of the variation of the photoelectron angular distribution asymmetry parameter, β, with photoelectron energy. Results for Ar and Ne are in good agreement with previous theoretical calculations. For N 2, we find a discontinuity in the variation of β near 5 eV photoelectron energy for the v' = 0 peak of the X 2 Σ + g ionic state. The result is interpreted in terms of the possible mechanisms: autoionization, variation of the electric dipole transition moment with internuclear distance, and resonance phenomena. For peaks of the A 2 ∏ u ionic state, the variation of β with ionic vibrational level matches the variation with photoelectron energy. For CO, anomalous structure is assigned to higher peaks of the X 2 Σ + vibrational progression. The dominant mechanism is probably autoionization. Photoelectron angular distributions were measured for the series of olefins: ethylene, isobutylene, 2 -methyl, 2 -butene, and 2, 3 -dimethyl, 2 -butene. The variation of β with electron energy was inferred by a comparison of data for the four structurally similar molecules. In the σ 2 p orbital ionization region of the spectrum, we find a similar variation of β with electron energy over bands corresponding to widely varying orbital symmetries. In the π orbital ionization region of the spectrum, β increases with increasing electron energy, taken from the variation of β across the vibrational envelopes. Accompanying the drop in β for π ionization with increasing methyl substitution is an anomalous drop in β at the high ionization potential end of the σ 2 p region which may indicate the presence of a σ/π orbital mixing. Photoelectron angular distributions were measured for a series of di-olefins. In the case of allene, we propose the ordering 2 e, 3 b 2, 1 e for the three lowest-lying orbitals {{on the basis of a}} deconvolution of the band in the ionization potential range 14 - 16. 5 eV. A re-examination of 1, 3 -butadiene supports the π, π, σ energy ordering of low-lying molecular orbitals. The variation of β across the σ 2 p region in the photoelectron spectra of 1, 4 -pentadiene and 1, 5 -hexadiene supports an earlier notion that through-space interaction of the π-bonds dominates through-bond interaction. Spectra of the π region suggest that the interaction between π moieties decreases in going from 1, 4 -pentadiene to 1, 5 -hexadiene. In an examination of low-lying structure of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene, the anomalously low β value for the lowest π-ionization band probably arises from σ/π mixing. In an examination of the two low-lying photoelectron bands of pyridine below 11 eV IP, the sharp rise of β across the 9 - 10 eV band is interpreted in terms of the orbital ordering n, π, π. </p...|$|E
