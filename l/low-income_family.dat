25|$|The {{impact of}} the FairTax on the {{distribution}} of the tax burden is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that it would decrease tax burdens, broaden the tax base, be progressive, increase purchasing power, and tax wealth, while opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. Sales taxes are normally considered regressive; however, the FairTax provides a rebate that supporters argue would create a progressive effective rate on consumption. Under the FairTax, a <b>low-income</b> <b>family</b> may spend $25,000 on goods and services consuming 100% of their income. A higher income family making $100,000 may spend $80,000 on goods and services and save $20,000. The higher income family is consuming only 80% of their income on taxable goods and services. According to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive (using a cross-section time frame). However, when presented with an estimated effective tax rate, the <b>low-income</b> <b>family</b> above would pay a tax rate of 0% on the 100% of consumption and the higher income family would pay a tax rate of 15% on the 80% of consumption. The effective tax rate is progressive on consumption. Using a larger time frame, the other 20% would be consumed and taxed {{at some point in the}} future.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} America's {{children}} {{who live in}} <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> is growing. In addition, where they live is changing. Children in <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> {{are twice as likely}} to have faced moving in the previous year, compared to children in higher-income families. Two-thirds of children in <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> live in the West or the South—a substantial increase in those regions from a decade ago. Immigration has fueled some of the change in the West— 37 percent of children of recent immigrants lived there. While the vast majority of the children in <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> move within regions, the majority who move inter-regionally settle in the South. Forty-five percent of children in <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> who moved to different regions did so for the parents' jobs. Children in <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> who moved within regions usually did so for housing-related reasons—the most commonly sited was "wanted better housing. " In the South and West, children in <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> are more concentrated in rural areas, but they are more likely to live in urban areas in the Midwest and Northeast. Poverty is growing in suburban areas, although they are substantially less likely to be home to the children of <b>low-income</b> <b>families.</b> This report looks at where children in <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> live, where and why their families move, and the implications for public policy...|$|R

This study examined the effectiveness of expanding child care assistance for <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> (capping expenses at 10 % of income and raising eligibility to 200 % of the federal poverty line) to purchase quality care. Mixed methods documented families' experiences (N = 181) and capitalized on a natural experiment when families lost assistance. Results pointed to improved access to quality care for children from <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> by: 1) helping <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> continue utilizing quality providers when incomes dropped, and 2) enabling others to begin utilizing quality providers. Perceived impacts were greatest for families with higher incomes (within the eligibility range), and for those with children ages five and younger. Additionally, parents were able to pay providers the full rate that they charge for care, which may help quality providers continue serving <b>low-income</b> <b>families...</b>|$|R
