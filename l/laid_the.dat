5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> groundwork for underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre {{is considered to be}} rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
