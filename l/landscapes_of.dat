40|$|This {{paper is}} a report on {{statistical}} characteristics of the composition <b>of</b> Urban <b>Landscape</b> Paintings by Bernardo Bellotto. This research method on quantitative survey by field work is quantification theory III. The results of analyses are as followings: 1) Various compositions were divided into six types; <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> overlooking the built-up areas, <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> symbolic architectures, <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> palace with garden, <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> roads and buildings, <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> riverside and buildings, <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> square surrounded by buildings. 2) Basic <b>landscape</b> elements <b>of</b> his paintings are built-up area, road, river, and palace.

5000|$|Prior to the film's final {{incarnation}} as A <b>Landscape</b> <b>of</b> Lies, it {{was initially}} titled A <b>Landscape</b> <b>Of</b> Lives. The projected script followed a [...] "crooked property developer", [...] "SAS bodyguards that got {{killed by a}} gay brother", and was described by Knight as being [...] "a crime thriller had no real thrills". Knight was brought on to finish the script for A <b>Landscape</b> <b>Of</b> Lives after answering a job offer to re-write the script for an animated Robin Hood film. Unaware of Al-Issa, Madden, Hassan, and Al Baghdady's intent, the group asked Knight to also look at the script for A <b>Landscape</b> <b>of</b> Lives, to which Knight agreed. The film was {{to be part of}} a film contract that would have the group's film company funding Knight's next five film projects along with the A <b>Landscape</b> <b>of</b> Lives and Robin Hood films. Over the next few days Knight was asked to re-write and then film the completed script, which would become A <b>Landscape</b> <b>of</b> Lies.|$|R

5|$|Bridges over {{waterways}} {{had been}} known in China since the ancient Zhou dynasty. During the Song dynasty, large trestle bridges were constructed, such as that built by Zhang Zhongyan in 1158. There were also large bridges made entirely of stone, like the Ba Zi Bridge of Shaoxing, built in 1256 and still standing today. Bridges with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> Xia Gui (1195–1224). Long, covered corridor bridges, like the 12th-century Rainbow Bridge in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, which has wide stone-based piers and a wooden superstructure, were also built.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 the BBC {{broadcast}} {{an episode}} of the television programme Horizon on The Making of the English Landscape produced by Peter Jones, and featuring Hoskins as presenter. Although the programme {{was inspired by the}} original book, Hoskins wrote an 84-page illustrated BBC book, English Landscapes, to accompany the programme. Later in the 1970s, Jones went on to produce a series of 12 TV programmes for BBC2, <b>Landscapes</b> <b>of</b> England, in which additional areas of the country were studied, leading to a further title, One Man's England to accompany the series.|$|E
40|$|Recently we {{introduced}} an inflationary setup {{in which the}} inflaton fields are matrix valued scalar fields with a generic quartic potential, M-flation. In this work we study the <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> various inflationary models arising from M-flation. The <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> the inflationary potential arises from the dynamics of concentric multiple branes in appropriate flux compactifications of string theory. After discussing the classical <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> the theory we study the possibility of transition among various inflationary models appearing at different points on the landscape, mapping the quantum <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> M-flation. As specific examples, we study some two-field inflationary models arising from this theory in the landscape.

5|$|Notable post-war artists {{included}} Robin Philipson (1916–92), who {{was influenced}} by the Colourists, but also Pop Art and neo-Romanticism. Robert MacBryde (1913–66), Robert Colquhoun (1914–64) and Joan Eardley (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets. Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the St Ives School were Wilhelmina Barns-Graham (1912–2004) and Margaret Mellis (1914–2009).|$|E
5|$|On {{a single}} day in 1825, 23 ships were left {{stranded}} off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> Skagen, {{almost half a century}} before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months later}} Jacobus and Johanna sold their {{belongings}} and {{moved back to}} Padang, where the Meessens established a photography studio. In their biography of the photographer, Mattie Boom and Steven Wachlin suggest that this was likely a commercial necessity, as Meessen may {{have been unable to}} compete with the Batavia-based Woodbury and Page. By November 1868 Jacobus was advertising his first album, titled Sumatra's Westkust (Sumatra's West Coast). Bound in Moroccan leather, the album contained more than sixty <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> Padang and surrounding cities (including Padang Panjang and Fort de Kock). By June 1869, his studio at the Sumatra Hotel was offering workshops, as well as images from northern Sumatra and Nias.|$|E

5|$|Felice Beato (1832 – 29 January 1909), {{also known}} as Felix Beato, was an Italian–British photographer. He {{was one of the}} first people to take {{photographs}} in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, and views and panoramas of the architecture and <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. He had an impact on other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the architecture of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the architecture of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> death.|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} artists {{connected}} with Edinburgh, {{most of whom}} had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, {{became known as the}} Edinburgh School, many of whom belonged to the informal 1922 Group. They were influenced by French painters and the St. Ives School. Their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form. Members included William Gillies (1898–1973), who focused on landscapes and still life, John Maxwell (1905–62) who created both landscapes and studies of imaginative subjects, William Geissler (1894-1963), watercolourist of landscapes in Perthshire, East Lothian and Hampshire, William Crozier (1893–1930), whose landscapes were created with glowing colours, William MacTaggart (1903–81), noted for his <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> East Lothian, France and Norway and Anne Redpath (1895–1965), best known for her two dimensional depictions of everyday objects.|$|E
