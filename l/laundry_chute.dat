5|$|Sabrina (Chaplin) {{walks down}} the stairs, and Ray puts the {{painting}} back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch EastEnders. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on the canvas. Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket, which is sent up a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute.</b> He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.|$|E
50|$|While at Purcell and Elmslie, Fournier {{served as}} the firm's expert in the latest {{domestic}} engineering gadgetry of the period. He used this knowledge in his own home, designing a central vacuum cleaner, <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> galley kitchen, and rainwater filtration system.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, a 3-alarm fire {{originating}} in the linen room caused smoke to travel up a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> and fill the top three floors. Although 70 patients were evacuated, there were no injuries reported and only $50,000 damage done to the facility thanks to the fire being brought under control within approximately 15 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Laundry</b> <b>chutes</b> {{in hotels}} {{are placed on}} each floor to allow the {{expedient}} transfer and collection of dirty laundry to the hotel's laundry facility without having to use elevators or stairs. In stories, <b>laundry</b> <b>chutes</b> are commonly used as means for the protagonist to quickly escape, the <b>laundry</b> at the <b>chute's</b> base often serving to cushion the hero's fall. These chutes are generally aluminized steel and welded together to avoid any extruding parts that may rip or damage the materials.|$|R
5000|$|Home <b>laundry</b> <b>chutes</b> {{are placed}} on each floor of {{multistory}} homes allow the collection of all household members' dirty laundry to one location, conveniently next to the laundry facilities, without the constant transport of laundry bins from story-to-story or room-to-room or up and down stairs. Home <b>laundry</b> <b>chutes</b> may be less common than previously due to building codes or concern regarding fireblocking, the prevention of fire from spreading from floor-to-floor, as well as child safety. However, construction including cabinets, doors, lids, and locks may make both risks significantly less than with simple stairwells.|$|R
50|$|Industrial {{laundries}} {{were developed}} in the Middle Ages, when large convents and monasteries used their own facilities. Hospitals and boarding schools followed this example. Today, there are several types of industrial laundries. Hospitals often use <b>laundry</b> <b>chutes</b> to collect used linens. These are transported to an industrial laundry, where they are sorted into three categories: regularly soiled, infected, or staff uniforms. They are laundered as appropriate, usually at high temperatures, to ensure that viruses, bacteria, and soil are cleaned and that the linens are hygienic before being returned to the hospital.|$|R
50|$|Lavoie's career {{came to an}} {{end when}} he overheard a {{conversation}} between Claude Dubois and another gang member planning to shoot him. He was able to hide safely from the other gang members, by sliding down a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> and waiting patiently. Lavoie now needed police protection and decided to testify against the Dubois Gang.|$|E
50|$|The Krites in {{the third}} film are shown {{launching}} themselves straight up into the air, as seen {{when one of the}} Krites launches itself up a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> in an attempt to attack Rosalie. A variation is shown {{at the end of the}} film, when a Krite tucks itself into a ball and revvs up as a means of attack.|$|E
5000|$|Elizabeth [...] "Liz" [...] Collins (voiced by Kath Soucie): Sam's [...] "unseen" [...] kid {{sister who}} {{communicates}} {{with her brother}} off screen through a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> connected from the upstairs. She always plays pranks on her older brother, usually dropping things {{on top of him}} through the chute. Liz has shown she does care for Sam and drops a ton of cookies to share with him.|$|E
5000|$|Cliffside was {{equipped}} with all modern conveniences including built-in furniture, dining nooks and serverys, electric refrigerators, electric hot water, water softening and incinerator and <b>laundry</b> <b>chutes.</b> The design of the building maximised privacy, views, light and the flow of air. Each of the eight flats had their own private entrance and floors were sound-proofed. The slope of the site was used to advantage so that {{no more than one}} and a half flights of stairs had to be scaled to gain access to any one of them. Plumbing connections were housed in a special duct with access from outside the building so that maintenance and repairs could take place without bothering the tenants. A caretaker's quarters was part of the original design, as was the provision of lock-up garages. The building was designed in the popular interwar style of English Revival or Tudor Revival with elements such as eaves and bay windows having a half-timbered appearance. As the promotional literature stated, Cliffside was [...] "the newest, the best and the most attractive offering in Brisbane".|$|R
50|$|The second floor's dining area, {{kitchen and}} {{bedrooms}} can be uncomfortable {{for older adults}} to reach. (To be fair, it was designed for young families.) Groceries had to be carried upstairs. A dumbwaiter, <b>laundry</b> and garbage <b>chutes</b> would help. The needed space might be had by using circular stairs.|$|R
5000|$|Fire spread was {{initially}} {{hampered by the}} stair arrangement. While the stairs were not closed off by doors, the configuration placed ascending and descending runs {{around the corner from}} each other, keeping fire and hot gas from quickly ascending the stair. Fire did not spread through the enclosed elevator shafts, nor through the <b>laundry</b> or mail <b>chutes.</b> [...] Open transoms between the rooms and the corridors admitted fresh air for combustion, eventually creating a flue-like effect with the fire climbing to all but the two top floors. Once established in the corridors, the fire fed on the burlap wallcoverings and ignited room doors and transoms. Doors and transoms were burned through on all but the fourteenth and fifteenth floors. Guests opened windows seeking fresh air and rescue, further enabling the draft of fresh air to the fire. The fire investigation revealed that an open transom was closely associated with the ignition of a given guest room and its contents.|$|R
50|$|Unable {{to find a}} small Victorian {{house like}} the Myers House in Halloween, the filmmakers chose a bigger, more mansion-like house because they needed a house that could provide wide rooms, hallways, an attic, a basement, and a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute.</b> Donald Pleasence accidentally broke Don Shanks's nose on the set when they were filming the scene where Dr. Loomis beats The Shape with a 2×4 block of wood.|$|E
50|$|In {{the scene}} in which Jamie climbs up the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> she was {{originally}} supposed to be stabbed in the leg, sending a splash of blood into the camera. The aftermath can be seen when Jamie {{gets out of the}} chute: a bloody stab wound is clearly visible on her right leg, and she walks with a noticeable limp. Danielle Harris wore a prosthetic leg for the filming, which she still owns.|$|E
50|$|Bart and Lisa {{track the}} puppies to Mr. Burns' mansion, where they {{discover}} {{he plans to}} make a tuxedo out of them. Bart and Lisa sneak in and attempt to escape with the puppies down a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute.</b> However, Mr. Burns is waiting for them. He intends to kill the puppies, but is unable to and instead, buys all of the puppies from the Simpsons. He successfully raises all of them into world-class championship racing dogs, winning him millions, much to Homer's dismay.|$|E
50|$|Buffy {{goes to the}} Sunnydale Arms building, beats Blair {{unconscious}} and then is chased by Kralik until his need for pills becomes unbearable. Buffy steals them away, and slides down a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> where she finds her mother. Kralik breaks {{through the door and}} grabs his pills back, washing them down with a nearby glass of water. Buffy had filled the glass with holy water, causing Kralik to burn from within. Buffy frees her mother as Giles arrives and stakes Blair.|$|E
50|$|Senior Operative Amanda (Anne Bancroft) {{transforms}} {{her into}} a refined, beautiful woman. She is taken on a dinner date with Bob, who informs her about the first job: an assassination of a VIP eating at the same restaurant. Maggie kills the VIP and his bodyguard and then is pursued {{by a team of}} the VIP's bodyguards. She shoots several of the bodyguards and then escapes from the kitchen by jumping down a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute.</b> This task was her final test and she has now completed her training.|$|E
50|$|The attack {{causes the}} frightened {{children}} {{to reveal the}} existence of a hidden room, which Linda finds and secretly photographs Dietrich's top-secret papers. When Dietrich invites her to the opera, her cover is blown by Margrete's mother, who believes her to be a friend of her daughter's from college. She flees from the Dietrich home and seeks sanctuary with Margrete, only to find that she is a double agent who betrayed Linda's cousins. Margrete shoots her, wounding her, but she overpowers Margrete and kills her. She slips down the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> escaping the German officers raiding Margrete's apartment.|$|E
50|$|Joan {{attempts}} {{to use the}} garden project run by Sonia Stevens as an alternative way to bring in drugs. Sonia initially refuses but after Joan convinces her that they are similar, Sonia agrees. Will Jackson has become suspicious of Jake's drug activities and Joan tells him to plant drugs in Will's locker, which Will manages to get rid of. After catching Franky and Allie in the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> the two kiss to cover up their attempt to escape via the chute. Joan relays this incident to Bridget, who has been struggling with Franky being in prison, causing Bridget to leave.|$|E
50|$|The lnian Islands {{are even}} further west and are nearest the Pacific Ocean. They receive the high energy seas {{on the west}} side, {{characteristic}} of the outer coast. This grouping {{of half a dozen}} small islands offers refuge to boats from the swells, winds, and tides between the open ocean and Icy Strait. Caution should be used in traveling through the narrow openings between islands. The notorious <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> is an appropriate name as your boat can be swiftly drawn through this pass at certain tides. There are also two small private parcels of land on the main island.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Jerry pushes an {{ink stamp}} pad onto Tom's feet and hands, {{and when the}} cat wakes up, he shuts the pad on Tom's nose before the cat can process what he sees; accordingly, Tom forgets about the stamp pad and chases the mouse. Jerry leads Tom on an {{off-screen}} chase through the entire house, and when the duo finally pulls back into view, Jerry stops the chase and points, prompting the cat {{to look at the}} disgraceful, gigantic mess of paw prints he now has to clean up. Looking at his now ink-covered paws, Tom makes the connection and picks up the mouse, hurls him down the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> and races to clean the house before Mammy returns.|$|E
50|$|Next to {{the visitor}} center is the large John N. Janes ranch house, which was {{purchased}} in 1915 for $2,763.53 as an Aladdin mail order (or kit house) and shipped to Muleshoe via rail. The house, which has a full basement and two complete stories, was built for Janes’ bride, Anna, whom he met in Kansas City, Missouri. The house had steam heat, electricity, the previously unknown luxury of two bathrooms, and running water provided by a windmill. On the second floor is a ballroom, presumably to permit Anna to hold grand parties for distant ranch families. The basement housed Janes’ office, a game room, steam boiler, coal bin, fireplace, and even a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During his escape, {{the protagonist}} stumbles upon a room {{containing}} a monkey and an unconscious human both {{hooked up to}} a machine. The monkey's face then becomes more human in appearance. The protagonist, now horrified, sees a diagram on the wall showcasing pictures of a human brain pointing towards several monkey brains. It turns out the [...] "latest thing in pop music" [...] is actually an experiment where musicians' brains are being transferred to monkeys, and he's planned to be the next victim. The video ends with him escaping down a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> to a room with men who have monkey-like faces, only to be cornered by the scientist and a dog, who also has the face of the scientist.|$|E
5000|$|Legionnaire Buddy, {{having found}} the fortress, steps {{through the same}} threshold, but the Amazon's fist misses him, as he is quite a bit shorter than the other soldiers. Our Hero runs about, {{avoiding}} swords, and causing the warrior-women to chase him. One Amazon finds herself trapped {{in what may be}} a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> and several others are knocked clear into the sky by a water vessel spinning atop a well. Then, another Amazon emerges from the same well, shaking Buddy from behind. Buddy awakens, and it turns that his new adversary is none other than his boss, who has returned to her shop. Dragged by the collar, Buddy is, unceremoniously but obligingly, ejected from the store: [...] "Okey-dokey!" [...] he calls back.|$|E

50|$|When {{constructed}} {{the house was}} rectangular in plan with a central projecting open front porch containing the entry steps and door to the south. The porch was flanked by bay windows and the house contained an entry hall, two bedrooms, kitchen, dining nook, living room, bathroom, sleepout verandah to the south east and laundry under. The kitchen had built-in cupboards; the bathroom had a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> connecting to a cupboard in the laundry beneath the house; the lounge opened onto the entry hall through 4 large glass paneled doors; the lounge and main bedroom were wallpapered; other walls throughout the house were lined with vertical tongue and groove boards; and the living room had a plate rail. The house was originally painted cream with dark green to the bay windows.|$|E
50|$|She {{discovers that}} all of the windows and doors have been boarded up, and she is trapped. She is horrified to find that Tom is missing from his bed, but she is unable to use the house phone to call for help, as the {{hurricane}} has brought down the phone lines. After discovering her phone is not on the charger where it is supposed to be, she realizes that she might have dropped it down the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> with her clothes. She sneaks into the laundry room to retrieve it, and makes another attempt to contact emergency services; due to the high volume of calls, however, she is unable to do so. She tries calling John, but his cell phone is in his car, which is parked outside of a bar. John is inside drinking beer and gambling.|$|E
5000|$|During the trial, Laura {{claims that}} Quill tore off her panties while raping her; these panties {{were not found}} in the crime scene, where she alleges the rape took place. Pilant, unaware of any details of the case, voluntarily returns to the {{courtroom}} to testify that she found the panties in the inn's laundry room. Biegler suggests Quill may have dropped the panties down the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> located next to his room, to avoid suspicion. Dancer tries to establish that Pilant's answers are founded on her jealousy. When Dancer asserts forcibly that Quill was Pilant's lover and that Pilant lied to cover this fact, Pilant shocks everyone by stating that Quill was her father. Manion is found [...] "not guilty by reason of insanity". After the trial, Biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober McCarthy as his partner.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the show}} mostly {{featured}} serious emergencies, it occasionally featured humorous stories of non life-threatening situations and false alarms. Examples included a burglar who got stuck upside-down {{when he tried}} to enter a house through the chimney, a young boy who got stuck in a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> while playing hide-and-seek, a young boy whose tongue froze to the inside of a freezer while he attempted to get ice cream, a man who got a plaster mask stuck on his face, a dog that stepped on the 911 speed dial button after getting tangled in the phone cord (although it was in danger of being strangled), a woman who called 911 when she mistook her parents' new mannequin for an intruder, a boy who got his tongue stuck in a canteen, and a man who woke up to a break-in at his house, only to discover the burglar was a bobcat.|$|E
50|$|The Game Boy {{version of}} the game, similar to the SNES and NES versions, require for the player to evade {{confrontation}} with the Wet Bandits. Similar to the SNES version, the player has to gather up various items {{in the game and}} then dump them into a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> to deposit them into a safe. Sometimes, the player might resort to using the items the bandits planned to steal against them by having them dropped on their heads, as well as instigate certain traps à la the movie (e.g. dropping a paint can on their heads). There are four levels in all, each taking place in a different area of the house, as well as each having a different item that the player must recover: The first level is stuff pertaining to jewelry/gold/silver items, the second level has toys, the third level has various Electronics, and the fourth level has various exotic pets that are both rare and expensive.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{kitchen is}} located in the north-west corner of the house, is lined vertical timber v-j boarding and contains some of the original joinery, including a set of tall cupboards. There is a set of three casement windows over the sink and a small timber sash window next to the back door. A toilet is located on the landing outside the backdoor of the kitchen next to a set of timber steps. The second kitchen {{is located in}} the north-east corner in the former sleep-out. This room has a door and stairs to the back garden. On the exterior of this room there are several timber decorative details including timber capitals and panels of early, painted timber slatted blinds. The two bathrooms are located between the kitchens. Both have terrazzo floors, baths and small cabinets. The top of the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> remains in one of the bathrooms, however, the chute itself and cupboard in the laundry on the ground floor have been removed.|$|E
50|$|The building's anchor tenant is the five-star 555-room Grand Hyatt Shanghai hotel which {{occupies}} floors 53 to 87. It {{is one of}} {{the highest}} hotels in the world, second in Shanghai only to its sister property, the Shanghai Park Hyatt, occupying the 79th to 93rd floors of the immediately adjacent Shanghai World Financial Center. These have since been surpassed by The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, which occupies floors 102 to 118 of the International Commerce Centre. However, the tallest building to be used exclusively as a hotel is the JW Marriott Marquis Dubai. Additionally, the world's longest <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> runs down the full length of the tower to the basement, incorporating buffers to slow the laundry during its descent.The Hyatt's famous barrel-vaulted atrium starts at the 56th floor and extends upwards to the 87th. Lined with 28 annular corridors and staircases arrayed in a spiral, it is 27 m in diameter with a clear height of approximately 115 m. It {{is one of the}} tallest atria in the world, the tallest being the Burj Al Arab's.|$|E
50|$|Jamie hides {{in an old}} <b>laundry</b> <b>chute,</b> but she {{is forced}} to abandon it after Michael finds her and {{repeatedly}} stabs the chute. She races upstairs to the attic where she finds a coffin that was stolen from the cemetery earlier, and the bodies of Rachel, Mike, and Rachel's dog Max. Michael finds Jamie, but before he can kill her, she tries to appeal her uncle's humanity. At Jamie's request, Michael takes off his mask. However, Jamie touches Michael's face, sending him into a fit of rage. Loomis appears, using Jamie as bait, and lures Michael into a trap to weaken him with a tranquilizer gun.

However, a mysterious stranger in black arrives and attacks the police station, killing the officers, including Sheriff Meeker. Jamie walks through the station, and discovers her uncle's cell empty, prompting her to begin sobbing in terror.|$|E
50|$|The {{movie was}} widely {{screened}} {{around the world}} and won a number of prizes. Trenchard Smith says {{it is one of the}} movies of which he is most proud:It won all sorts of industrial safety awards all over the world, and was Australia's highest-selling industrial film for 25 years, used all over the world. We staged a fire, cutting a multi-story hospital in half, bursting from the <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> out onto one floor. And the film was designed to have a whole series of lessons to be learned in a lecture afterwards. There were alarming incidents of smoking-related fires in their hospitals. It actually became a fire-safety film worldwide. It's actually a film I’m proud to have made, and I made it for very little money, but I’m very pleased that I spent the four months that I did making that. I was told that one hospital changed their arrangements after seeing the film, and moved the non-ambulatory patients from the fourth floor to the ground floor, and several months later, the fourth floor caught fire.|$|E
5000|$|... "No, {{but some}} {{people have said that}} to me. They thought that I was the last of a {{particular}} group of people, or I was independent or something. Maybe I am a bit, but I doubt that. The song actually came about when I had the title and then wrote the song. Half way through it I realized that I had read the review of the picture Charley Varrick with Walter Matthau. Did you see that? The old-time crook who turned over the bank. And basically that's the story. The Charley Varrick movie was subtitled “The Last of the Independents.” I loved the story, but I never saw the movie. Not having seen the picture, I can only guess what it was about. But the story is a bit like another picture Joseph Losey made with Stanley Baker, The Criminal. It's about a guy who {{is the only one who}} knows where the money is stashed X years ago, who does his time in jail and gets out, and they are all ghosting after him trying to find it. The song is about what the guy is doing. They are after him on a jumbo jet. He gets out on a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> in Chicago. It is just a comic gangster-type song that has a good Bo Didley sound to it. ” ...|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the Limestone Castle, the {{limestone}} came from Mr. Norton's quarry. He enjoyed {{a large amount of}} success due to the limestone in his quarry having a light blue hue to it. Over the last 40 years, not much has changed about the property. One large evergreen tree was taken down that was located {{at the beginning of the}} driveway. The only visible improvements or updating that has been done in that time is the carpet (unknown date) and the tar shingle roof in 1983. The fencing around the rear of the property was built by a family who rented the home from 1982 to 1984. The front limestone facade at the sidewalk has been repaired to keep it from toppling over. The red building at the rear of the property was living quarters for the builders. It still has a wood burning stove inside and is a two-story building with stairs. There is a full size attic with interior stairs for access. The basement covers about 3/4 of the house. The home is heated by a boiler in the basement that circulates the hot water through radiators throughout the home. There is still an intercom system to all of the upstairs bedroom from the kitchen. There is a <b>laundry</b> <b>chute</b> from the second story to the laundry/pantry room. This room is behind the kitchen and accessible to the dining room. The property is located across the street from Bedford Junior High School.|$|E
