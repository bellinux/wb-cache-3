40|$|The man domesticated many legumes {{from the}} wild species of the Family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) during about 10, 000 years of the {{agricultural}} history. About 80 species are known as edible, but only about 30 of them are most popular among the Leguminosae (ca. 700 genera, 20, 000 species), {{which is one of}} the most prosperous groups in the flowering plant families. More commonly, legumes belong to the Subfamily Papilionoideae which is herbaceous, annual, and dominant in temperate regions and shows the most evolutionary trends in the Leguminosae. As dry seeds contain high protein, grain legumes are called "poor man's meat", and their young shoots and pods are also important as vegetables. Two other Subfamilies, Caesalpinioideae and Mimosoideae are primarily, woody, perennial, and tropical and subtropical, and have a potential economic importance as resources. Most of legumes are cosmopolitan and are growing under different environmental conditions by the advanced and traditional farming systems in the world. Soybean in United States occupies big share more than 60 % in world production, and this is attributed to the socio economic factors that soybean is the most suitable as a component in rotation system with maize, and also important as industrial materials. And, the reason of the same concentration of production of chickpea, pegionpea and lentil in India is high consumption of grain legumes as protein source instead of the animal foodstuffs, which are restricted to eat by religious laws and poverty. Parallel development of legumes accompanying with cereals, which is shown by the archaeo logical evidences of early agriculture in Old and New World, suggests us that the ancient peoples were the inventors of the principles of mixed-cropping of legumes and cereal crops, and also of mutual supplementation of <b>limiting</b> <b>amino-acids</b> between legumes and cereals, by simultaneous intake of them. The role of legumes to enrich the soil fertility had been well-known by the ancient farmers. In the present, the most attractive nature of legumes, the nitrogen fixation-ability by symbiosis in association with nodule bacteria, Rhizobium spp, should be evaluated again by its significance of the saving of consumption of fossil energy resources by the fertilizer manufacturing industries in the developed countries. Dry seeds of legumes have many merits as diets, i. e., containing of "condensed protein", which is rich about 3 - 4 times than the cereals, and as well as in oil content with excellent fatty-acids composition in some species, and suitability for long storage and transportation. But, at the same time, they have demerits, i. e; stone-like hardness, culinary problems and lesser digestability and palatability due to thick seed testa and properties of their protein, and containing of flatulence factors and various toxic or anti-nutritional substances. However, traditional and recent development of technology of processing and pre-treatment or cooking procedures had greatly improved the above-mentioned demerits and enlarged a potentiality of legumes as human food, and made them the important foodstuffs equal to cereals. Grain legumes are contributing to improving the protein mal-nutrition in developing countries, and are increasing the significance of their supplemental role in the global deficiency of animal protein foods. The author emphasized the needs of efforts to develop, not only annual species, but also tree species as new resources, i. e., tuberous root species storing fermentable carbohydrates, species to be grown as "shelter" to prevent the progress of desertification, "nitrogen-supplier tree" species, species as feeds for wild animals for meat production, and as firewoods, etc. Finally, the author introduced the work of collection, evaluation, registration, documentation, storage, and distribution of genetic resources of legumes by the international agricultural in stitutions, supported by IBPGR (International Board for the Plant Genetic Resources) /U.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} the {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) to synthesise a cDNA encoding part of human cardiac troponin I. Amplification was achieved using fully degenerate sets of oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved regions of amino acid sequence identified in other troponin I isoforms. The cloned PCR fragment was subsequently used to isolate full-length cDNAs from a cardiac cDNA library. We describe the approach, as a general cloning strategy starting from <b>limited</b> <b>amino-acid</b> sequence data and report the cloning, and complete amino acid sequence of human cardiac troponin I. Analysis of human development using these clones demonstrates early expression of this gene in the heart...|$|R
40|$|Central {{dopamine}} {{function is}} reduced by decreasing {{the availability of the}} catecholamine precursor, tyrosine, using a tyrosine-free amino acid mixture containing multiple large neutral as well as branched chain amino-acids, which compete with tyrosine for uptake into the brain. Current mixtures are cumbersome to make and administer, and unpalatable to patients and volunteers. Here, we investigate whether individual or <b>limited</b> <b>amino-acid</b> combinations could reduce brain tyrosine levels and hence dopamine function. Measurements of regional brain tyrosine levels, catecholamine and indoleamine synthesis (L-DOPA and 5 -HTP accumulation, respectively) were used to identify an effective paradigm to test in neurochemical, behavioral and fos immunocytochemical models. Administration of leucine or isoleucine, or a mixture of leucine, isoleucine, and valine reduced tyrosine and 5 -HTP, but not L-DOPA accumulation. A mixture of leucine, valine, and isoleucine supplemented with tryptophan reduced brain tyrosine and L-DOPA, but not 5 -HTP. In microdialysis experiments this amino-acid mixture reduced basal and amphetamine-evoked striatal dopamine release, as well as amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. This mixture also reduced amphetamine-induced fos expression in striatal areas. In conclusion, the present study identified a small combination of amino acids that reduces brain tyrosine and dopamine function {{in a manner similar to}} mixtures of multiple amino acids. This minimal mixture may have use as a dopamine reducing paradigm in patient and volunteer studies...|$|R
40|$|Late Middle Pleistocene Thames-Medway {{deposits}} in eastern Essex comprise both large expanses of Palaeolithic artefact-bearing river sands/gravels and deep channels infilled with thick sequences of fossiliferous fine-grained estuarine sediments that yield valuable palaeoenvironmental information. Until recently, chronological control on these deposits {{was limited to}} terrace stratigraphy and <b>limited</b> <b>amino-acid</b> racemisation (AAR) determinations. Recent developments in both this and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating make them potentially powerful tools for improving the chronological control on such sequences. This paper reports new AAR analyses and initial OSL dating from the {{deposits in}} this region. These results will help with ongoing investigation of patterns of early human settlement. Using AAR, the attribution by previous workers of the interglacial channel deposits to both MIS 11 (Tillingham Clay) and MIS 9 (Rochford and Shoeburyness Clays) is reinforced. Where there are direct stratigraphic relationships between AAR and OSL as with the Cudmore Grove and Rochford Clays and associated gravels, they agree well. Where OSL dating is the only technique available, it seems to replicate well, but must be treated with caution since there are relatively few aliquots. It is suggested {{on the basis of}} this initial OSL dating that the gravel deposits date from MIS 8 (Rochford and Cudmore Grove Gravels) and potentially also MIS 6 (Dammer Wick and Barling Gravels). However, the archaeological evidence from the Barling Gravel and the suggested correlations between this sequence and upstream Thames terraces conflict with this latter age estimate and suggest that it may need more investigation...|$|R
40|$|Secretory {{proteins}} {{enter the}} secretory pathway by translocation across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a channel formed {{primarily by the}} Sec 61 protein. Protein translocation is highly temperature dependent in mesophilic organisms. We asked whether the protein translocation machinery of organisms from extremely cold habitats was adapted to function at low temperature and found that post-translational protein import into ER-derived microsomes from Antarctic yeast at low temperature was indeed more efficient than into mesophilic yeast microsomes. Analysis of the amino-acid sequences of the core component of the protein translocation channel, Sec 61 p, from Antarctic yeast species did not reveal amino-acid changes potentially adaptive for function in the cold, because the sequences were too divergent. We therefore analyzed Sec 61 alpha (vertebrate Sec 61 p) sequences and protein translocation into the ER of Antarctic and Arctic fishes and compared them to Sec 61 alpha and protein translocation into the ER of temperate-water fishes and mammals. Overall, Sec 61 alpha is highly conserved amongst these divergent taxa; a number of amino-acid changes specific to fishes are evident throughout the protein, and, in addition, changes specific to cold-water fishes cluster in the lumenal loop between transmembrane domains 7 and 8 of Sec 61 alpha, which {{is known to be}} important for protein translocation across the ER membrane. Secretory proteins translocated more efficiently into fish microsomes than into mammalian microsomes at 10 degrees C and 0 degrees C. The efficiency of protein translocation at 0 degrees C was highest for microsomes from a cold-water fish. Despite substantial differences in ER membrane lipid composition, ER membrane fluidity was identical in Antarctic fishes, mesophilic fishes and warm-blooded vertebrates, suggesting that membrane fluidity, although typically important for the function of the transmembrane proteins, is not limiting for protein translocation across the ER membrane in the cold. Collectively, our data suggest that the <b>limited</b> <b>amino-acid</b> changes in Sec 61 alpha from fishes may be functionally significant and represent adaptive changes that enhance channel function in the col...|$|R
40|$|Techniques for {{the amino}} acid {{sequence}} analysis of subnanomole quantities of polypeptides have been applied to characterize beta 2 -microglobulin and transplantation antigens of the mouse isolated from spleen cells by indirect immunoprecipitation. Eleven residues were identified throughout the NH 2 -terminal 27 residues of the beta 2 -microglobulin; all were identical to residues seen at the corresponding positions of beta 2 -microglobulins from other species. Two K and two D transplantation antigens were examined and the following generalizations emerged from the <b>limited</b> partial <b>amino-acid</b> sequence data: (1) the K and D molecules are homologous to one another; (2) they do not show {{amino acid sequence}} homology with immunoglobulins; (3) the two K and two D molecules differ from one another by multiple amino acid substitutions; and (4) the K molecules as a class cannot be distinguished from the D molecules as a class. The genetic and evolutionary implications of these observations are discussed...|$|R
