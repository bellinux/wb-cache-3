40|$|Photosynthetic rate is an {{indicator}} of vegetation performance as a carbon sequestration element on earth. At the same time, primary productivity is also function of photosynthetic rate and canopy cover. The photosynthetic capacity of an ecosystem {{is limited by the}} foliage pigment content due to the active participation of pigmentation in photon capture. Hence, the quantitative assessment of foliage pigment content is of high importance in order to monitor forest primary productivity and ecosystem performance in carbon sequestration. Pigment content estimation over large areas can be assessed using remote sensing data using empirical algorithms or by inverting radiative transfer models. Both techniques need accurate <b>leaf</b> <b>pigment</b> measurement for parameterisation and validation. Leaf sampling field protocols are then needed in order to collect and store leaf tissue without altering <b>leaf</b> <b>pigment</b> composition before its analysis in the laboratory.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{vertical}} canopy gradients and varying sky conditions influence photosynthesis (Pn), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf thickness (LT) and <b>leaf</b> <b>pigments</b> (lutein, â-carotene and chlorophyll). In contrast, little is known about these effects on monoterpenoid (MT) emissions. Our study examines simultaneously measured Pn, MT emissions and the MT/Pn ratio along the canopy of an adult European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica L.) in natural forest conditions. Dynamic branch enclosure systems were used at four heights in the canopy (7, 14, 21 and 25 m) in order to establish relationships and better understand the interaction between Pn and MT emissions under both sunny and cloudy sky conditions. Clear differences in Pn, MT emissions and the MT/Pn ratio were detected within the canopy. The highest Pn rates were observed in the sun leaves at 25 m due to the higher intercepted light levels, whereas MT emissions (and the MT/Pn ratio) were unexpectedly highest in the semi-shaded leaves at 21 m. The higher Pn rates and, apparently contradictory, lower MT emissions in the sun leaves may be explained by the hypothesis of Owen and Peñuelas (2005), stating synthesis of more photo-protective carotenoids may decrease the emissions of volatile isoprenoids (including MTs) because they both share the same biochemical precursors. In addition, leaf traits like SLA, LT and <b>leaf</b> <b>pigments</b> clearly differed with height in the canopy, suggesting that the leaf’s physiological status cannot be neglected in future research on biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) when aiming at developing new and/or improved emission algorithms.

40|$|Leaf {{chlorophyll}} {{content is}} {{positively associated with}} photosynthetic capacity and nutrient status, but its functional ecology has seldom been examined thus far. In the present study, we measured leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, determined chlorophyll a:chlorophyll b (Chl a:Chl b) and carotenoids:chlorophyll ratios and measured leaf mass per area (LMA) for 63 woody dicot species, including 24 evergreen species and 39 deciduous species, at two altitudes (1800 - 2400 and 2400 - 2800 m a. s. l.) of Gongga Mountain, south-west China. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether evergreen and deciduous species differ in terms of leaf pigment concentrations and LMA in response to environmental differences associated with changes in elevation. In both life forms, the altitude effect was not significant for chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations. However, the Chl a:Chl b ratio was significantly higher in evergreen species, whereas LMA was significantly higher in deciduous species, at the high versus low altitude. These observations suggest that evergreen and deciduous species may have different strategies to protect <b>leaf</b> <b>pigments.</b> Mass-based leaf pigment concentrations were lower in evergreen compared with deciduous species, especially at high altitude. LMA was higher in evergreen than deciduous species at both altitudes. Pigment concentrations were negatively correlated with LMA in both life forms at both altitudes. The slope of LMA vs mass-based leaf pigment concentrations was significantly more negative for deciduous than evergreen species, and at low versus high altitude for deciduous species. The findings suggest that deciduous species may invest less photosynthate in <b>leaf</b> <b>pigments</b> but more in inactive components in stressful environments than do evergreens. Thus, the same magnitude of variation in LMA may have different consequences on leaf carbon balance between evergreen and deciduous species, which helps explain why evergreen species are often more likely to occupy more stressful environments than deciduous species...|$|E

Multiangular variability of Hemispherical Directional Reflectance Factor (HDRF) is a prime factor determining the indices´ angular response. Two contrasting structural vegetation types, pine forest and meadow, were selected to study the effect of reflectance anisotropy on the angular response. Calculated indices were standardized and statistically evaluated for their varying HDRF. Additionally we employ a coupled radiative transfer model (PROSPECT/FLIGHT) to quantify and substantiate the findings beyond an incidental case study. Nearly all tested indices manifested a prominent anisotropic behaviour. Apart from the conventional broadband greenness indices [e. g.

Leaf discs from just fully expanded leaves were exposed to an irradiance of 1000 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) at 5 degrees C for 48 h. The effect of growth temperature on the susceptibility to photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII) and its recovery, degradation of <b>leaf</b> <b>pigments,</b> chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence quenching and xanthophyll cycle activity were examined. Leaves of L. esculentum and L. peruvianum plants grown at optimal temperature, were similarly susceptible to photodamage. Suboptimal-grown leaves of both species showed a higher tolerance to photoinhibition than optimal-grown leaves. In both species, recovery of photoinhibited PSII was more complete in leaves grown at suboptimal than at optimal temperature. In contrast to L. esculentum, suboptimal-grown leaves of L. peruvianum exhibited faster kinetics of recovery from photoinhibition than optimal-grown leaves. Light-induced degradation of <b>leaf</b> <b>pigments</b> in leaves grown at 16 / 14 degrees C was 2. 3 - and 2. 7 -times slower in L. esculentum and L. peruvianum, respectively, when compared with leaves grown at 25 / 20 degrees C. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of Chl fluorescence developed faster in leaves of suboptimal-grown plants. and steady-slate levels were similar to 20 % higher than in leaves of optimal-grown plants of both species. An increased pool size of xanthophyll cycle pigments together with a slightly higher conversion state, resulted in a 1. 5 - (L. esculentum) or 3 -fold (L. peruvianum) higher maximal zeaxanthin content in suboptimal-, as compared with optimal-grown leaves. These results demonstrate that acclimation to suboptimal temperature increased the capacity to resist chilling-induced photodamage in both the domestic and the high-altitude wild Lycopersicon species. However. the acclimatory response was more pronounced in L. peruvianum than in L. esculentum, indicating a greater ability of the high-altitude wild species to acclimate its photosynthetic apparatus to suboptimal temperatures.

Twelve weeks of exposure to NH 3 increased the activity of GS and the concentrations of soluble protein, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and N, compared to FA. Our results indicate that elevated atmospheric NH 3 can be metabolized by the needles of Scots pine. Exposure to SO 2 resulted in a decreased activity of GS, lower concentrations of soluble protein, <b>leaf</b> <b>pigments</b> and P and K, and an increased activity of GDH. Simultaneous exposure to NH 3 + SO 2 did not cause significant interactive effects on any of the parameters studied. The positive effect of NH 3 on the needle concentrations of N and CHl a and on the activity of GS in the needles, counteracted the negative effects of SO 2. The nutrient balance in the needles was affected by both gases, since NH 3 increased the concentration of N and SO 2 decreased the concentrations of P and K.

From one to two days after Fe resupply, there was a gradual increase in the leaf concentrations of Chl and other photosynthetic pigments, accompanied by a further conversion of zeaxanthin into violaxanthin, increases in actual PS II efficiency and photosynthetic rates and decreases in NPQ and the amount of thermally dissipated energy. At 72 - 96 h after Fe resupply, <b>leaf</b> <b>pigment</b> concentrations, photosynthetic rates and actual PS II efficiency had increased further, although both photosynthetic rate and <b>leaf</b> <b>pigment</b> concentrations were still lower than those found in Fe-sufficient leaves. Good correlations were observed between the amount of light thermally dissipated by the PS II antenna, NPQ and the antheraxanthin + zeaxanthin concentration after Fe resupply, confirming the photoprotective role of the xanthophyll cycle in Fe-deficient sugar beet leaves. Similar correlations were observed for lutein, suggesting a possible role of this pigment in photoprotection. This work was supported by grants from the Spanish MCYT BOS 2001 - 2343 to J.

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>pigment</b> {{content and}} {{composition}} provide important information about plant physiological status. Reflectance measurements offer a rapid, nondestructive technique to estimate pigment content. This paper describes a recently developed three-band conceptual model capable of remotely estimating total of chlorophylls, carotenoids and anthocyanins contents in leaves from many tree and crop species. We tuned the spectral regions {{used in the}} model in accord with pigment of interest and the optical characteristics of the leaves studied, and showed that the developed technique allowed accurate estimation of total chlorophylls, carotenoids and anthocyanins, explaining more than 91 %, 70 % and 93 % of pigment variation, respectively. This new technique shows a great potential for noninvasive tracking of the physiological status of vegetation {{and the impact of}} environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|Salt stress {{conditions}} {{lead to increased}} production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells. Halophytes {{have the ability to}} reduce these toxic ROS by means of a powerful antioxidant system that includes enzymatic and non-enzymatic components. In this research, we used the halophytic shrub Prosopis strombulifera to investigate whether the ability of this species to grow under increasing salt concentrations and mixtures was related to the synthesis of polyphenolic compounds and to the maintenance of <b>leaf</b> <b>pigment</b> contents for an adequate photosynthetic activity. Seedlings of P. strombulifera were grown hydroponically in Hoagland’s solution, gradually adding Na 2 SO 4 and NaCl separately or in mixtures until reaching final osmotic potentials of 21, 21. 9 and 22. 6 MPa. Control plants were allowed to develop in Hoagland’s solution without salt. Oxidative damage in tissues was determined by H 2 O 2 and malondialdehyde content. <b>Leaf</b> <b>pigment</b> analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet, and total phenols, total flavonoids, total flavan- 3 -ols, condensed tannins, tartaric acid esters and flavonolswere spectrophotometrically assayed. Treatment with Na 2 SO 4 increased H 2 O 2 production and lipid peroxidation in tissues and induced a sharp increase in flavonoid compounds (mainly flavan- 3 -ols) and consequently in the antioxidant activity. Also, Na 2 SO 4 treatment induced an increased carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio, which may represent a strategy to protect photosystems against photooxidation. NaCl treatment, however, did not affect H 2 O 2 content, lipid peroxidation, pigments or polyphenols synthesis. The significant accumulation of flavonoids in tissues under Na 2 SO 4 treatment and their powerful antioxidant activity indicates a role for these compounds in counteracting the oxidative damage induced by severe salt stress, particularly, ionic stress. We demonstrate that ionic interactions between different salts in salinized soils modify the biochemical and morpho-physiological responses of P. strombulifera plants to salinity...|$|R
