Two main limitations of oral fluid were 1. the amount of matrix collected is smaller when compared to urine and 2. the levels of drugs in urine are higher than in oral fluid. A current limitation of the use of this specimen for roadside testing is the absence of a suitable immunoassay that detects the parent compound in sufficiently low concentrations." ...|$|E

Therefore, an assay to measure bevacizumab serum concentrations is needed. Methods: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed using microtiter plates sensitised with vascular endothelial growth factor(165), a recombinant form of vascular endothelial growth factor. Lower and upper <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantitation</b> as well as <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection were determined. Eight calibrators and three quality controls, with concentrations of 5 mg/L, 30 mg/L, and 75 mg/L, were tested on five occasions initially and on five subsequent occasions. Trough and peak serum concentrations of bevacizumab were measured in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Bevacizumab concentrations were described using a two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model with first-order constants. Results: Imprecision and accuracy of calibrators and quality controls were 20 % or less, except for the zero calibrator. The <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection was 0. 033 mg/L.

RESULTS: Nevirapine concentrations were measured in 109 cord blood samples and 149 predose samples. Cord blood nevirapine concentrations were below the target concentration of 100 ng/mL (10 -times the in vitro IC(50) of nevirapine against wild-type HIV) in eight (7 %) of 109 infants (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3 %- 14 %); the concentrations in six of these infants were below the assay <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantitation.</b> Predose infant nevirapine concentrations were below 100 ng/mL in 23 (15 %) of 149 infants (95 % CI, 10 %- 22 %); the concentrations in 13 of these infants were below the assay <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantitation.</b> Lower predose nevirapine concentrations were associated with lower cord blood concentrations and a shorter interval between maternal dosing and delivery.

The current High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method of analysis can determine the TPB concentration at 5 mg/L and higher. The <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantitation</b> was lowered by modification of the sample preparation steps. The HPLC sample preparation method currently used requires neutralization of the tank waste sample followed by extraction with acetonitrile. This method dilutes the tank waste sample 6. 5 to 1 increasing the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantitation.</b> The method described in this report concentrates the sample two-fold lowering the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantitation</b> from 5 mg/L to 0. 25 mg/L. Researchers used solvent extraction of undiluted tank waste to isolate, and concentrate (two-fold) samples of tank supernate and Plant Inhibited Water (PIW) that simulated tank supernate at the cesium level of approximately 0. 3 Ci/gal. The 137 Cs content in the tank supernate measured 0. 65 Ci/gal prior to a two-fold dilution with PIW. The concentration of the TPB was determined by HPLC on a reversed-phase HPLC column using methanol, acetonitrile, and buffered water as the mobile phase. Important Findings: The 0. 8 mg/L quantitation limit was met in the presence of radioactive cesium. A 93 per cent reduction in activity in the acetonitrile layer was achieved. A five-mL acetonitrile aliquot from the extraction of a tank waste sample containing 0. 378 Ci/gal of Cs- 137 could be handled in a radiological hood and comply with the less than 5 mR/hr hood limit. This method is applicable to tank waste solutions of high ionic strength (greater than 2. 0 M Na). The ionic strength of tank waste solutions of low ionic strength will need to be adjusted by the addition of NaOH or 5. 6 M average salt solution to facilitate the formation of two layers (organic and aqueous).
