500|$|Onions {{are best}} {{cultivated}} in fertile soils that are well-drained. Sandy loams are {{good as they}} are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require {{a high level of}} nutrients in the soil. Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> in cold soils. Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting. Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European onions are referred to as [...] "long-day" [...] onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as [...] "intermediate-day" [...] types, requiring only 12–13 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, [...] "short-day" [...] onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11–12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3to9. Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to [...] "bolt", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.|$|E

Existing theoretical approaches to guns and crime are integrated with opportunity theory to provide a richer understanding of the dynamic between guns and crime. Data for this analysis are drawn from a sample of 45, 913 individuals nested in 39 cities in developing nations. Results of a multi-level, cross-national examination using hierarchical linear modeling indicate that city <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> gun <b>availability</b> influence individual odds of gun crime victimization, but not individual odds of overall crime victimization. This suggests that individuals who live in cities with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> gun <b>availability</b> have higher odds of being the victim of gun assault or gun robbery than individuals who live in cities with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> gun <b>availability.</b> The results, however, find little support for the proposition that city-level gun availability interacts with individual behavior to influence individual odds of assault or robbery victimization...|$|R

40|$|Telecommunications {{networks}} need {{to guarantee}} that all node pairs involved in critical service communications are highly available.

The basic idea is to embed at the physical layer a high <b>availability</b> set <b>of</b> links and nodes (termed the spine) in the network topology to support protection and routing in providing end-to-end availability. We first explore the spine concept through simple topologies illustrating the potential benefits of the approach in improving the overall network availability and the capability to support quality of resilience classes. Then, we study how the structural properties of a network topology can be used to determine heuristics to select a suitable spine and compare this with the case where all network components have the same availability. This is followed by a numerical based study comparing the heuristics with all possible spanning tree based spines for sample topologies. Our results demonstrate how to best design a physical network to support protection methods in achieving high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> efficiently...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} the nutritional quality of meat fatty acids (FA) of pasture-fed lambs reared organically or conventionally and offered two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> herbage <b>availability.</b> Forty eight castrated male lambs of Limousine breed {{were used in}} a 2 x 2 experimental design, i. e. production system (Organic –O- vs. Conventional –C-) x <b>level</b> <b>of</b> herbage <b>availability</b> (High vs. Low). The O and C pastures differed in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> on-pasture mineral N fertilization (0 vs. 100 U. ha- 1. year- 1) since 10 years. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> pasture <b>availability</b> was managed to obtain a mean lamb age at slaughter of 5 vs. 6 months in the High and the Low level respectively. GLC analysis of fatty acids from the Longissimus thoracis muscle showed that organic farming system improved the health value of lamb meat by decreasing the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> saturated FA and especially 16 : 0, thus leading to a higher value of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) to saturated FA ratio (+ 15 %, P< 0. 03) and increasing the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> CLA (+ 18. 2 %, P< 0. 002). The high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> herbage <b>availability</b> led to a better nutritional and health value of meat FA by increasing significantly deposition of n- 6 PUFA (+ 16. 3 %), n- 3 PUFA (+ 15 %) and CLA (+ 20. 2 %) in LT muscle {{to the detriment of}} saturated FA (- 3. 4 %). In conclusion, the present study confirmed the general interest of pasturefeeding on the nutritional quality of the lamb meat. It showed, for the first time, the beneficial impact of organic farming on the health value of lamb meat FA by favouring deposition of PUFA (compared to saturated FA) and CLA, this effect being reinforced by a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> pasture <b>availability...</b>|$|R
