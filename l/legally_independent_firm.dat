40|$|What is {{the impact}} of firm entry {{regulation}} on sustained entry into self-employment? How does firm entry regulation influence the performance of long-living entrants? In this paper, I address these questions by exploiting a natural experiment in firm entry regulation. After German reunification, East and West Germany faced different economic conditions, but fell under the same law that imposes a substantial mandatory standard on entrepreneurs who want to start a <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firm</b> in one of the regulated occupations. The empirical results suggest that the entry regulation suppresses long-living entrants, not only entrants in general or transient, short-lived entrants. This effect on the number of long-living entrants is not accompanied by a counteracting effect on the performance of long-living entrants, as measured by firm size several years after entry. Firm entry regulation, sustained entry, self-employment, firm size...|$|E
30|$|Fourth, {{the results}} offer {{a base for}} {{continuing}} research about business groups. The focal firm is a chaebol in a major market. The firm in the study shares some characteristics with other chaebol in Korea {{as well as with}} business groups in many emerging markets. Such common characteristics include affiliations among <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firms</b> that influence the strategies of the affiliates, analogous to multi-business firms. It would be useful to examine whether the chaebol’s unique characteristics dominate the choice of evaluation methods or, instead, whether this range of M&A techniques is common in other business groups.|$|R
50|$|Design for {{logistics}} covers issues along {{supply chain}} partners (i.e., <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firms)</b> but is by its means {{closely related to}} the design for assembly guidelines. In academic research, design for logistics is tangent to the strategic alliances, supply chain management, and the engineering part of new product development. For example, Sanchez and Mahoney (1996) argued that product modularity (i.e., how physical sub-systems of a product are sub-divided through interfaces; also called product or system architecture), and organizational modularity (i.e., how organisational entities are structured), depend on each other, and Fixson et al. (2005) found that the relationship between product architecture and organisational structure is reciprocal in context of early supplier involvement during the system design or respectively concept phase of the Product development process.|$|R
40|$|Diversified {{business}} groups, {{consisting of}} <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firms</b> operating across diverse industries, are ubiquitous in emerging markets. Groups {{around the world}} share certain attributes but also vary substantially in structure, ownership, and other dimensions. This paper proposes a business group taxonomy, {{which is used to}} formulate hypotheses and present evidence about the reasons for the formation, prevalence, and evolution of groups in different environments. In interpreting the evidence, the authors pay particular attention to two aspects neglected in much of the literature: the circumstances under which groups emerge and the historical evidence on some of the questions addressed by recent studies. They argue that business groups are responses to different economic conditions and that, from a welfare standpoint, they can sometimes be "paragons" and, at other times, "parasites. " The authors conclude with an agenda for future research. ...|$|R

40|$|Business groups – <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firms</b> tied {{together}} in various {{formal and informal}} ways – are omnipresent in emerging economies. Research on the economic performance of business groups has so far paid only limited attention to their technological capabilities and absorptive capacity, and mostly presented studies for individual economies rather than cross-country comparative analyses. This thesis presents a cross-country empirical analysis of the economic performance of group affiliated firms, investigating in particular the importance of firm capabilities and absorptive capacity – e. g. human capital, ICT usage, access to finance, international trade, technology and innovation – for the productivity performance of firms in developing countries. The empirical analysis {{is based on a}} large dataset, the World Bank Enterprise Survey, and the econometric analysis focuses on a sample of around 30 000 manufacturing firms in 85 developing economies. The results reveal that group affiliation enhances economic performance, and that the superior performance of group-affiliated <b>firms</b> vis-à-vis <b>independent</b> enterprises is related to their greater capabilities in terms of human capital, access to finance, as well as technology and innovation...|$|R
40|$|This Draft: August 19, 2005 Diversified {{business}} (or corporate) groups, {{consisting of}} <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firms</b> operating in multiple markets, are ubiquitous in emerging markets {{and even in}} some developed economies. The study of groups, a hybrid organizational form between firm and market, is of relevance to industrial organization, corporate finance, development, economic growth and other domains of economic inquiry. This survey begins with stylized facts on groups around the world, and proceeds to a critical review the existing literature, which has focused almost entirely on groups as diversified entities and on conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders. Other schools of thought on {{the political economy of}} corporate groups, on groups and monopoly power, and on groups as networks are discussed next. We then proceed to promising, yet virtually unexplored, alternative lenses for viewing groups, for example, as quasi venture-capitalists or as family-based structures. The analysis points out important biases in the literature including the avoidance of a serious discussion of the origins of business groups, and the unfounded assumption that rent-seeking is the only feasible political economy equilibrium in an interaction between groups and the government. We note that the empirical tendency to use recent data implies {{that the vast majority of}} studies exploit cross-sectional variation; the absence of (long) time-series data ensures that some conceptually important issues, such as how groups shape the environment in which they operate, receive relatively little attention. Lastly, we outline an agenda for future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{firm was}} evicted from {{economic}} analysis {{for a long}} time. It appeared as a particular and substantial "scope" thanks to the economist R. H. Coase {{at the end of}} the 1930 'S but sunk into oblivion for three decades. This paper deals with the 1970 's renewal of interest in the theory of the firm, particularly from the development of new institutional economics. But we argue that these contractual approaches need to be refined by considering – as Rajan and Zingales argue – the impacts of "financial revolution" and of the valuation of human capital on firm performance. Some alternative theories – based on critical resources or competences – become more and more evident to analyze the nature and the boundaries of the firm. This one conceals – beyond the metaphor of the “nexus of contracts” – the features of a real "organizational entity". In this article, we want to shed light on the crossed-fertilization effects between these theories in order to raise the issue of the boundaries of the firm and to dissociate the legal and economic nature of the firm. It is hence suitable to deal with the theoretical analysis of the network-firm. The characterization of this complex organizational form, which is coordinated by a "hub-firm" that has a power over other <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firms</b> without recourse to equity ownership, allows us to reveal both the nature of interfirm cooperation and its implications on the theory of the firm. Finally, we propose a conception of the firm based on power...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} role of particularistic {{relationships}} (such as family and prior social ties) in business groups during institutional transition and test how particularistic ties between top leaders affect business group performance in Taiwan, where such ties have been central to the func-tioning of business groups. We propose that during mar-ket-oriented transition, family and prior social ties could improve group performance by providing informal norms that strengthen the intermediation within business groups and that family relationships could reduce strate-gic restructuring and generate performance benefits. Results of a longitudinal study over 24 years show that market transition enhanced the contribution of family and prior social relationships but not that of common-identity relationships, such as being from the same hometown, which do not involve prior direct personal contact. We also found that during transition, the positive contribution of family members would rise up to a threshold, after which additional family members tended to derail group performance, possibly due to informational disadvan-tages and a legitimacy discount {{in the eyes of}} foreign investors. The study helps to make sense of different pre-dictions about {{the role of}} particularistic ties in business group performance and makes an initial attempt at revealing how social structure affects performance. Our findings have implications for research on the value of business groups in institutional transition, interorganiza-tional relationships, and the contingencies of social rela-tionships. • Business groups, defined as “sets of <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> <b>firms</b> bound together in persistent formal and/or informal ways ” (Granovetter, 1995 : 95), dominate most emerging economies. Most researchers agree that the persistent rela-tionship among group affiliates is unique to this organizationa...|$|R
40|$|We study an {{industry}} with a monopolistic bottleneck (e. g. a transmission network) supplying an essential input to several downstream firms. Under legal unbundling the bottleneck must be {{operated by a}} <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> upstream <b>firm,</b> which may be partly or fully owned by an incumbent active in downstream markets. Access prices are regulated but the upstream firm can perform non-tariff discrimination. Under perfect legal unbundling the upstream firm maximizes only own profits; with imperfections it considers to some extend also the profits of its downstream mother. We find that reducing imperfections in legal unbundling (keeping ownership fixed) generally increases total output. Increasing the incumbent's ownership share increases total output if imperfections are sufficiently small, otherwise the effects are ambiguous. Surprisingly, higher ownership shares of the downstream incumbent may sometimes lead to lower degrees of imperfections. Our analysis suggests that consumers may benefit most from legal unbundling with strong regulation and parts of ownership given to a minority outside shareholder. Network industries, regulation, vertical relations, ownership, corruption, sabotage...|$|R
40|$|Most {{existing}} empirical evidences on {{the impact}} of profit taxation on multinational firm activity are based on cross-country data. One major drawback of such data is that countries differ not only with regard to taxes but also with other dimensions which might be hard to capture by means of observable characteristics. We compile a database of more than 11, 000 municipalities in Germany to analyze the sensitivity of location decisions of foreign MNEs in Germany with respect to business tax rates which are levied directly by the municipalities. We find that higher business tax rates {{have a negative effect on}} three alternative measures of MNE activity, after controlling for other determinants of firm location decisions: the number of foreign MNEs, MNE employment, and MNE fixed assets. Our results suggest that tax competition among regional entities for foreign investors is a game of a few. In cross-section instrumental-variable regressions, a one-percent reduction of the municipal business tax rate (equivalent to a decline by about 0. 14 percentage points) leads to an increase in the number of <b>legally</b> <b>independent</b> foreign-owned <b>firms</b> by about 0. 45. The average municipality would have to reduce its business tax rate by about 2. 2 percentage points (or 15 %) from its average level to attract one foreign MNE. Hence, municipalities need to be attractive in other dimensions to be able to use tax instruments to attract foreign firms at the margin...|$|R
