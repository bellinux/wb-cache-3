This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath <b>Lake</b> <b>basins.</b> Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions.

Cressman found some inconclusive evidence that humans could have begun occupation of the area around 11,000years ago.

25|$|In {{the central}} region {{volcanic}} eruptions, which have {{taken part in}} the formation of the plateau during the Cenozoic, cover a large part of the land with basaltic lava-caps; and in the western third, more recent glacial deposits appear above the lava. There, erosion which is caused principally by the sudden melting and retreat of ice aided by tectonic changes, has scooped out a deep longitudinal depression. Best in evidence where in contact with folded Cretaceous rocks which are uplifted by the Cenozoic granite. It generally separates the plateau from the first lofty hills, the ridges generally called the pre-Cordillera. To the west of these, a similar longitudinal depression extends all along the foot of the snowy Andean Cordillera. This latter depression contains the richest and most fertile land of Patagonia. <b>Lake</b> <b>basins</b> along the Cordillera were also excavated by ice-streams, including Lake Argentino and Lake Fagnano, as well as coastal bays such as Bahía Inútil.|$|E

25|$|The area east of {{the divide}} in the state' north-central portion is known for the Missouri Breaks and other {{significant}} rock formations. Three buttes south of Great Falls are major landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw and Buttes. Known as laccoliths, they formed when igneous rock protruded through cracks in the sedimentary rock. The underlying surface consists of sandstone and shale. Surface soils {{in the area are}} highly diverse, and greatly affected by the local geology, whether glaciated plain, intermountain basin, mountain foothills, or tableland. Foothill regions are often covered in weathered stone or broken slate, or consist of uncovered bare rock (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone, or shale). The soil of intermountain basins usually consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt, and volcanic ash, much of it laid down by lakes which covered the region during the Oligocene 33 to 23 million years ago. Tablelands are often topped with argillite gravel and weathered quartzite, occasionally underlain by shale. The glaciated plains are generally covered in clay, gravel, sand, and silt left by the proglacial Lake Great Falls or by moraines or gravel-covered former <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> left by the Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago.

2500|$|The Pleistocene <b>Lake</b> <b>Basins</b> {{ecoregion}} is {{a nearly}} level to undulating lake plain that contained vast temporary Pleistocene lakes that {{were created by}} flood waters from glacial lakes Missoula and Columbia. In Oregon, the flood waters accumulated from the eastern entrance of the Columbia River Gorge upstream to the Wallula Gap to form ancient Lake Condon. Elevation varies from 300to1,200feet (90to370m). Today, the region is the driest and warmest part of the Columbia Plateau, with mean annual precipitation varying from 7to10inches (180to250mm). Major irrigation projects provide Columbia River water to the region, allowing the conversion of large areas into agriculture. Where present, native vegetation consists of needle-and-thread, Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and basin big sagebrush. Alien cheatgrass covers broad areas.

It was found that Malawi lacks focus on lakes in its strategies and the existing management of the lake is on a sector-to-sector basis with little coordination. Furthermore, the capacity of lake-related sector institutions is hampered by inadequate resources and unstable flow of funds. It was concluded that the current management of the <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> is unsustainable and there is need to comprehensively monitor the <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> as well as formulate and implement management plans and strategies that are based on the knowledge obtained from targeted monitoring.

2500|$|The Pluvial <b>Lake</b> <b>Basins</b> {{ecoregion}} contained vast lakes {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch that have now mostly disappeared. It {{is characterized by}} gently sloping, internally drained basins with lake terraces, playas, beach plains, stream terraces, intermittent lakes, fan skirts, and cool springs. Elevation varies from 4,200to6,200feet (1,280to1,890m). Some basin floor playas collect and evaporate water seasonally, but not as extensively as the High Desert Wetlands. Dry lake beds near the Cascade Mountains have a significant layer of volcanic ash. Greasewood, inland saltgrass, and seepweed grow in alkaline soils. Better drained, less alkaline soils are dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush and basin big sagebrush, with rubber rabbitbrush, Great Basin wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and cheatgrass.

2500|$|The Umatilla Plateau ecoregion, {{named for}} the Umatilla who {{originally}} inhabited the area, {{is characterized by a}} nearly level to rolling, treeless plateau, underlain by basalt and veneered with loess deposits. Elevation varies from 1,000to3,200feet (300to980m). Glacial features such as patterned ground are common. Areas with thick loess deposits are farmed for dryland winter wheat or irrigated alfalfa and barley. Rangeland dominates more rugged areas where loess deposits are thinner or nonexistent. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 15inches (230 to 380mm) and increases with elevation. In uncultivated areas, moisture levels are generally high enough to support grasslands of bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and Idaho fescue, without associated sagebrush, which is more common in the Pleistocene <b>Lake</b> <b>Basins.</b> Stiff sagebrush may be found on very shallow soils.

60|$|However, {{we are not}} {{permitted}} humbly to imitate the prudent reticence of the Indian philosophers. In these days of evolution hypotheses, and nebular theories, and kinetic energy, {{and all the rest}} of it, the question why the sea is salt rises up irrepressible and imperatively demands to get itself answered. There was a sapient inquirer, recently deceased, who had a short way out of this difficulty. He held that the sea was only salt because of all the salt rivers that run into it. Considering that the salt rivers are themselves salted by passing through salt regions, or being fed by saline springs, all of which derive their saltness from deposits laid down long ago by evaporation from earlier seas or <b>lake</b> <b>basins,</b> this explanation savours somewhat of circularity. It amounts in effect to saying that the sea is salt because of the large amount of saline matter which it holds in solution.

60|$|In the {{occurrence}} of these annual inundations lies one of several resemblances between {{the valley of the}} Euphrates and that of the Nile. But there are important differences. The time of the annual flood is reversed, the Nile being highest in autumn and winter, and lowest in spring and early summer. The periodical overflows of the Nile, regulated by the great <b>lake</b> <b>basins</b> in the south, are usually punctual in arrival, gradual in growth, and beneficial in operation. No lakes are interposed between the mountain torrents of the upper basis of the Tigris and the Euphrates and their lower courses. Hence, heavy rain, or an unusually rapid thaw in the uplands, gives rise to the sudden irruption of a vast volume of water which not even the rapid Tigris, still less its more sluggish companion, can carry off in time to prevent violent and dangerous overflows. Without an elaborate system of canalisation, providing an escape for such sudden excesses of the supply of water, the annual floods of the Euphrates, and especially of the Tigris, must always be attended with risk, and often prove harmful.|$|E
