5|$|After {{his return}} to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief <b>Labour</b> {{government}} of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the <b>Labour</b> government of 1929–31. After {{the political and economic}} crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the <b>Labour</b> Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of <b>Labour</b> MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the <b>Labour</b> Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 <b>Labour</b> Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{rises in}} opinion polls {{following}} Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined {{with the onset}} of a recession in 2008, leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. A year later, <b>Labour</b> lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931, making the Conservatives the largest party in a hung parliament. Brown remained in office as <b>Labour</b> negotiated to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. On 10 May 2010, Brown announced he would stand down as leader of the <b>Labour</b> Party, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. Labour's attempts to retain power failed and on 11 May, he officially resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the <b>Labour</b> Party. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, and as Leader of the <b>Labour</b> Party by Ed Miliband.|$|E

She {{was elected to the}} TUC Council in 1918, and became its chairman in 1923, the year she was first elected to parliament. In the short-lived minority <b>Labour</b> government of 1924 she served as parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of <b>Labour.</b> Her term of cabinet office in 1929–31 was marked by the economic crises that beset the second <b>Labour</b> government. Her willingness to contemplate cuts in unemployment benefits alienated her from much of the <b>Labour</b> movement, although she did not follow Ramsay MacDonald into the National Government that assumed office when the <b>Labour</b> government fell in August 1931.|$|E

5|$|Child <b>labour</b> in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child <b>Labour</b> project estimated child <b>labour</b> in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child <b>labour</b> belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap <b>labour.</b> Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child <b>labour.</b> The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of <b>labour</b> unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child <b>labour</b> came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child <b>labour</b> would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child <b>labour</b> was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union <b>labour</b> ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child <b>labour</b> like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child <b>labour</b> Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child <b>labour</b> have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child <b>labour</b> in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E

50|$|In {{by-election}} held on 15 November 2012, <b>Labour's</b> decline {{was reversed}} coupled with very low turnout (down 38.2% {{on the previous}} election). <b>Labour's</b> Stephen Doughty succeeded Alun Michael winning 47.3% of the overall vote. This was an increase (in share-of-the-vote terms) on Michael's 2010 performance. However, in terms of actual votes cast (9,193 compared with 17,262 in 2010), it was <b>Labour's</b> lowest in this constituency. The 2015 result gave the seat the 83rd-smallest majority of <b>Labour's</b> 232 seats by percentage of majority. <b>Labour's</b> result in 2017 saw them secure their largest ever margin in the constituency in terms of raw votes.|$|R

5|$|Clarke was {{a critic}} of migrant <b>labour</b> schemes, which were {{designed}} to attract foreign <b>labour</b> to Rhodesia, and in 1900 he defended the rights of indigenous <b>labour</b> against infringement by foreign Africans from Mozambique, Nyasaland, Zambia and South Africa. As early as 1900, the BSAC came to the Colonial Office with a proposal regarding Chinese <b>labour.</b> In London, the Land and Mine Owners Association was formed in 1902 to lobby the Colonial Office and continued to press throughout 1903. The Colonial Office postponed its decision saying that the question concerned not only Rhodesia but all of southern Africa. Milner was lobbied by the BSAC and he promised his support. Clarke, however, dismissed the demands, arguing that 'the introduction {{of large numbers of}} Asiatics... will subject the aboriginal natives to unfair competition'. He forecast that the <b>labour</b> shortage was temporary and that the new bureau would satisfy demand. Clarke also argued that most Rhodesians were opposed to the introduction of Chinese <b>labour.</b> The Duke of Marlborough, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, recorded that he found Clarke's argument more convincing than Milner's, and the Colonial Office refused the proposal.|$|E

In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced <b>labour.</b> The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract <b>labour</b> and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D.

5|$|From {{the outset}} of his posting, Clarke {{had to deal with}} issues {{regarding}} land and <b>labour.</b> The latter was of major significance at this time in Southern Rhodesia. In response to questioning by the African Association and the Manchester Society for the Protection of Native Races, Chamberlain in 1898 responded that forced <b>labour</b> was not permitted. A year later, Chamberlain was concerned by a chief native commissioner instructing chiefs at an indaba that it was their duty to supply <b>labour.</b> Clarke's subsequent report accused officials of the administration of requisitioning <b>labour</b> by 'pressure only short of force', causing 'discontent amongst the natives'. Clarke's view was that a mutually beneficial relationship between capital and <b>labour</b> was possible through market forces alone, without additional pressure. Chamberlain agreed, although Milner was in favour of compulsory <b>labour</b> even to the extent of 'recommending the corvée'.|$|E
