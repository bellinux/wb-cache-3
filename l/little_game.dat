5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had <b>little</b> <b>game</b> experience.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} Most-produced singles {{were further}} unsuccessful attempts {{to reach the}} pop market. <b>Little</b> <b>Games</b> soon went out of print, but after Led Zeppelin rose to stardom and Page became a focus of attention, fans and collectors sought out copies of the album and drove up prices, resulting in counterfeit copies being introduced (see Printing errors below). The scarcity of the last singles also led to the 1975 bootleg collection Golden Eggs, which was widely circulated and successful for its time. However, <b>Little</b> <b>Games,</b> along with singles, outtakes, alternate mixes was released by EMI as the two-CD expanded edition <b>Little</b> <b>Games</b> Sessions & More in 1992.|$|R
2500|$|More recent reviews have {{generally}} found fault with <b>Little</b> <b>Games.</b> AllMusic's Bruce Eder gave it {{three out of}} five stars and wrote [...] "If almost any group other than the Yardbirds had released <b>Little</b> <b>Games,</b> it {{would be considered a}} flawed but prime late-'60s psychedelic/hard rock artifact instead of a serious step backward, and even a disappointment". An AllMusic review by Dave Thompson of the expanded edition <b>Little</b> <b>Games</b> Sessions & More began [...] "the day producer Mickie Most moved in on the Yardbirds was the day the Yardbirds' own values moved out. The union was a lousy idea from the start". The New Rolling Stone Album Guide writer also gave the album three out of five stars, calling it [...] "a disastrous attempt at conventional pop". The Yardbirds themselves were just as critical – Page reportedly regarded <b>Little</b> <b>Games</b> as [...] "horrible" [...] and Jim McCarty described Mickie Most as [...] "a protagonist in our downfall".|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to securing gold and other precious minerals to send {{back to the}} waiting investors in England, the survival plan for the Jamestown colonists depended upon regular supplies from England and trade with the Native Americans. The location they selected was largely {{cut off from the}} mainland and offered <b>little</b> <b>game</b> for hunting, no fresh drinking water, and very limited ground for farming. Captain Newport returned to England twice, delivering the First Supply and the Second Supply missions during 1608, and leaving the Discovery {{for the use of the}} colonists. However, death from disease and conflicts with the Natives Americans took a fearsome toll of the colonists. Despite attempts at mining minerals, growing silk, and exporting the native Virginia tobacco, no profitable exports had been identified, and it was unclear whether the settlement would survive financially.|$|E

He represented the UAE under-19s at the 2003 Youth Asia Cup, aged only 15, and later also at the 2005 ACC Under-19 Cup and the 2007 ACC Under-19 Elite Cup. Hameed made his senior debut for the UAE at the 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup in Kuwait. He featured in five of his team's six matches, and took three wickets, with a best of 2/11 from four overs against Saudi Arabia. Later in 2007, Hameed made two appearances for the UAE in the 2007 World Cricket League Division Two tournament, where matches held List A status. Early the following year, he was selected for an Intercontinental Cup game against Namibia, which held first-class status. At the 2009 World Cup Qualifier, Hameed was selected for nine of his team's ten matches. He was given <b>little</b> <b>game</b> time, batting only four times and bowling a total of 9.4 overs across three innings. His sole wicket came against Denmark, where he took 1/40 from 4.4 overs.

"Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really funny how <b>little</b> <b>game</b> (Leslie) has with guys.

Despite speculation that the game {{would be based on}} Super Metroid, Ken Lobb, Nintendo of America's Director of Game Development, quelled rumors by stating, [...] "One of the things I wanted to get across in today's meeting is that Metroid is not Super Metroid. It's something new. [...] And that's something that will hopefully be seen at E3 for our sweet <b>little</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Advance."

At the E3 convention the following year, IGN awarded the game, titled Metroid Fusion, their Best of Show and Best Action Game awards. The game was scheduled for a North American release date of November 18, 2002. On August 22, 2002, Nintendo announced that the game can connect to Metroid Prime for the GameCube, a Metroid game that was released on the same day as Fusion.

2500|$|Jasikevičius's father Linas {{always was}} a sports lover {{and along with}} him, he {{followed}} practically everything, together they cheered for USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad {{took him to the}} first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and not once was chasing Šarūnas when he was trying to run away from the workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was so sick of basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated {{that it would be a}} huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had a strong conversation with Šarūnas and forbade to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with the future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with which he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player in his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen as the guy who was [...] "talented but lazy" [...] as he was no devotee of the gym; all he did was joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, once his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of kind which happens only once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: [...] "No school? So no basketball". Though, his parents were happy to see him venting his hyperactivity in basketball, and this made them urge him on towards the sport, as it also helped him avoid bad company in the area. They played in the gym, and also in the street using scrap metal instead of real baskets, and their favorite pastime was called minus, a kind of forerunner of <b>little</b> <b>game</b> that can be seen today during the NBA All-Star Game called [...] "horse". It was far from ideal, but his parents preferred to see him play with the scrap metal hoops in front of their home rather than down at the pitch, where it would have taken him less than five minutes to pick a fight with the wrong person. His childhood dream was to become a Žalgiris Kaunas player about which he was so crazy that he knew everything about every player, even the players’ shoe sizes. Following the Žalgiris' victory in 1986 Intercontinental Cup, he begged his father to take him to the airport to welcome home the players, where hundreds of people were waiting in the freezing cold. His father knew some of the players, and managed to get signed posters and photos that he used to decorate all the walls of his room.|$|E
