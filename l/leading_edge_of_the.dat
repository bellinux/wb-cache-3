5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooler air mass.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{phenomena}} experienced on British Airways Flight 9 on 24 June 1982 were glowing light flashes along <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, which were seen by both passengers and crew. While it shared similarities with St Elmo's fire, the glow experienced was from <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> ash particles on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, {{similar to that}} seen by operators of sandblasting equipment.|$|R

5|$|Downbursts. When an outflow {{boundary}} forms due to {{a shallow}} layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional wind shear can result at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three dimensional boundary. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence collected from Frank's body, there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located {{on the right side}} of the aircraft near the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing. These samples contained sodium carbonate, sodium nitrate, and mixtures of sodium-sulfur compounds.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{were able}} to {{identify}} the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's right wing. The material recovered from Kure Beach, including a portion of the wing fillet, was from this general area. Investigators were unable to recover material from an irregular, triangularly shaped area positioned above the leading edge and extending forward ahead of the wing.|$|E
5|$|Other {{designs of}} the mid-H series {{included}} the He 111 H-7 and H-8. The airframes {{were to be}} rebuilds of the H-3/H-5 variant. Both were designed as night bombers and were to have two Jumo 211F-1s installed. The intention was for the H-8 to be fitted with cable-cutting equipment and barrage ballon deflectors on the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings. The H-7 was never built.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{behind the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing the engine intake had wing {{boundary}} layer ahead of it. Two thirds was diverted {{and the remaining}} third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging. Extensive wind tunnel testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> hottest areas <b>of</b> all, <b>the</b> nose-cap and <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fins, {{were made}} of {{reinforced}} carbon-carbon, as {{they were on the}} Shuttle.|$|R

5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe on the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E
50|$|The OIAV {{would not}} have to achieve {{supersonic}} speeds while ascending. This would minimize drag and put less stress on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft.. also having <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> minimizing vibrations. All present launch platforms severely vibrate the payload.|$|R
50|$|En {{route to}} the ISS, the 50 ft-long Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) tipped with two types of lasers and a {{high-resolution}} television camera was used to inspect <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shuttle for damage. Particular {{attention was paid to}} <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shuttle's wings.|$|R
50|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Falcons {{had a small}} 7.6 lb (3.4 kg) warhead, {{limiting}} their lethal radius. Also limiting them tactically {{was the fact that}} Falcon lacked a proximity fuze: the fuzing for the missile was in <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings, requiring a direct hit to detonate.|$|R
5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing {{formed a}} strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led {{to the adoption of}} a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first dorsal fin and the trailing edge of the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
5|$|The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and {{sections of the}} fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown {{that this type of}} panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
30|$|Magnus effect In an {{alternative}} design, a rotating cylinder wing providing lift by the Magnus effect {{has been studied}} [7]. A rotating cylinder in <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airfoil [8] has also been developed. However, very few devices using the Magnus effect have been operated successfully [9].|$|R
50|$|Eventually some 2,000 barrage {{balloons}} were deployed, in {{the hope}} that V-1s would be destroyed when they struck the balloons' tethering cables. <b>The</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> V-1's wings were fitted with cable cutters, and fewer than 300 V-1s are known to have been brought down by barrage balloons.|$|R
50|$|Fuel: <b>The</b> {{standard}} location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fuel tank}} is forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument panel. Some builders have moved it to <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings. By creating a sealed <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> tank, the fuel is {{moved away from}} the pilot for better crash survivability with <b>the</b> added benefit <b>of</b> more than doubling the fuel capacity.|$|R
5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on {{the nose of the}} aircraft. This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E
5|$|The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas {{generally}} lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E
5|$|The main {{veins and}} the crossveins form the wing venation pattern. The venation {{patterns}} {{are different in}} different species. There may be very numerous crossveins or rather few. The Australian Flatwing Damselfly's wings {{are one of the}} few veins patterns. The venation pattern is useful for species identification. Almost all Anisoptera settle with the wings held out sideways or slightly downward, however most Zygoptera settle with the wings held together, dorsal surfaces apposed. The thorax of Zygoptera is so oblique that when held in this way the wings fit neatly along the top of the abdomen. They do not appear to be held straight up as in butterflies or mayflies. In a few zygopteran families the wings are held horizontally at rest, and in one anisopteran genus (e.g. Cordulephya, Corduliidae) the wings are held in the typical damselfly resting position. Adult species possess two pairs of equal or subequal wings. There appear to be only five main vein stems. A nodus is formed where the second main vein (subcosta) meets the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing. In most families a conspicuous pterostigma is carried near the wing tip. Identification as Odonata can be based on the venation. The only likely confusion is with some lacewings (order Neuroptera) which have many crossveins in the wings. Until the early years of the 20th century Odonata were often regarded as being related to lacewings and were given the ordinal name Paraneuroptera, but any resemblance between these two orders is entirely superficial. In Anisoptera the hindwing is broader than the forewing and in both wings a crossvein divides the discoidal cell into a Triangle and Supertriangle.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> on <b>the</b> viscous flow field around a hypersonic vehicle such as the proposed National Aero-Space Plane. Attention is focused on two specific regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow field. In the first region, effects of nose bluntness on the forebody flow field are investigated. <b>The</b> second region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow considered is around <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scramjet inlet. In this region, <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forebody shock with the shock produced by <b>the</b> blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inlet compression surfaces is analyzed. Analysis of these flow regions is required to accurately predict the overall flow field as well as to get necessary information on localized zones of high pressure and intense heating. The results for the forebody flow field are discussed first, followed by the results for the shock interaction in the inlet <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> region...|$|R
50|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were incorporated}} into the SZD-12A Mucha 100A, which had the external mass balances replaced by weights in <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ailerons, forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hinges. Another modification which was also applied retrospectively to earlier units was a re-located mainwheel, moved rearwards to reduce the weight on the tailwheel during ground handling.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{craft that}} {{experience}} the greatest heating, such as <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings, have about [...] of ablative thermal protection material applied. <b>The</b> main ingredient <b>of</b> this material was accidentally leaked to Air and Space. If it flew with no thermal protection, the spacecraft would survive reentry {{but would be}} damaged.|$|R
