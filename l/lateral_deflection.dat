If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a <b>lateral</b> <b>deflection</b> of the compression flange. The <b>lateral</b> <b>deflection</b> of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

60|$|Two {{plants of}} each form were {{protected}} from the access of insects during two successive years, and in the autumn they yielded very few capsules and presented a remarkable contrast with the adjoining uncovered plants, which were densely covered with capsules. In 1863 a protected long-styled plant produced only five poor capsules; two mid-styled plants produced together the same number; and two short-styled plants only a single one. These capsules contained very few seeds; yet the plants were fully productive when artificially fertilised under the net. In a state of nature the flowers are incessantly visited for their nectar by hive- and other bees, various Diptera and Lepidoptera. (4/3. H. Muller gives {{a list of the}} species 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' page 196. It appears that one bee, the Cilissa melanura, almost confines its visits to this plant.) The nectar is secreted all round the base of the ovarium; but a passage is formed along the upper and inner side of the flower by the <b>lateral</b> <b>deflection</b> (not represented in the diagram) of the basal portions of the filaments; so that insects invariably alight on the projecting stamens and pistil, and insert their proboscides along the upper and inner margin of the corolla. We can now see why the ends of the stamens with their anthers, and the ends of the pistils with their stigmas, are a little upturned, so that they may be brushed by the lower hairy surfaces of the insects' bodies. The shortest stamens which lie enclosed within the calyx of the long- and mid-styled forms can be touched only by the proboscis and narrow chin of a bee; hence they have their ends more upturned, and they are graduated in length, so as to fall into a narrow file, sure to be raked by the thin intruding proboscis. The anthers of the longer stamens stand laterally farther apart and are more nearly on the same level, for they have to brush against the whole breadth of the insect's body. In very many other flowers the pistil, or the stamens, or both, are rectangularly bent {{to one side of the}} flower. This bending may be permanent, as with Lythrum and many others, or may be effected, as in Dictamnus fraxinella and others, by a temporary movement, which occurs in the case of the stamens when the anthers dehisce, and in the case of the pistil when the stigma is mature; but these two movements do not always take place simultaneously in the same flower. Now I have found no exception to the rule, that when the stamens and pistil are bent, they bend to that side of the flower which secretes nectar, even though there be a rudimentary nectary of large size on the opposite side, as in some species of Corydalis. When nectar is secreted on all sides, they bend to that side where the structure of the flower allows the easiest access to it, as in Lythrum, various Papilionaceae, and others. The rule consequently is, that when the pistils and stamens are curved or bent, the stigma and anthers are thus brought into the pathway leading to the nectary. There are a few cases which seem to be exceptions to this rule, but they are not so in truth; for instance, in the Gloriosa lily, the stigma of the grotesque and rectangularly bent pistil is brought, not into any pathway from the outside towards the nectar-secreting recesses of the flower, but into the circular route which insects follow in proceeding from one nectary to the other. In Scrophularia aquatica the pistil is bent downwards from the mouth of the corolla, but it thus strikes the pollen-dusted breast of the wasps which habitually visit these ill-scented flowers. In all these cases we see the supreme dominating power of insects on the structure of flowers, especially of those which have irregular corollas. Flowers which are fertilised by the wind must of course be excepted; but I do not know of a single instance of an irregular flower which is thus fertilised.|$|E

This control law provides good damping when applied to a (theoretical) two-dimensional system.

50|$|A basic {{interpretation}} of PFM (which is generally accepted) identifies that two modes of imaging are possible, {{one that is}} sensitive to out-of-plane and one to in-plane piezoresponse, termed, vertical and lateral PFM (VPFM and LPFM) respectively. The separation of these components is possible {{through the use of}} a split photodiode detector, standard to all optical detection AFM systems. In this setup the detector is split into quadrants, nominally A, B, C and D. The centre of the entire detector outputs 0 V but as the laser spot moves a radial distance from this centre point, the magnitude of the voltage in output will increase linearly. A vertical deflection can be defined as {(A+B)-(C+D)}/(ABCD) so that now positive and negative voltages are ascribed to positive and negative cantilever vertical displacements. Similarly a <b>lateral</b> <b>deflection</b> is defined as {(B+D)-(A+C)}/(ABCD) to describe positive and negative torsional movements of the cantilever.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{investigating}} potential bending or torsional failure modes in axially loaded pile groups caused by defective piles and on investigating {{the effect of}} short piles on the response of vertically loaded bored pile groups socketed into rocks. A hypothetical group of six bored piles, 2. 0 m in diameter and 25. 5 m in length, was analyzed and six cases with different numbers and configurations of short piles in the pile group were considered using a three-dimensional pile foundation analysis program FB-Pier. It is found that the number and configuration of short piles {{have a significant effect}} on behavior of the pile group. The presence of short piles forces "intact" piles to carry larger loads. An important aspect of the group response is that the presence of short piles can result in induced <b>lateral</b> <b>deflections</b> of the pile group and additional bending moments in piles even under "concentric" axial loads at the pile cap. The <b>lateral</b> <b>deflections</b> and bending moments can cause lateral failures of the pile group in terms of both ultimate limits and serviceability limits.

The load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or buckling load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{concrete-filled}} steel tubes (CFST) {{in engineering}} structures has become popular {{because of their}} excellent seismic resistance structural properties such as high strength, high ductility and large energy absorption capacity. In CFSTs the surrounding steel tube provides effective confinement to the filled-in concrete and in turn the concrete helps to reduce the potential local buckling of the steel tube resulting improved seismic resistant performance. This study aimed at investigating the benefit of CFST members in railway steel truss bridges susceptible to earthquake loads. Since the end frames of truss bridges are mainly subjected to compressive loads CFST is a good alternative for end raker. The steel weight of the rib can be reduced with CFST and hence the method is economically sound. The seismic behaviour of steel truss bridges with steel and CFST end rakers is discussed {{based on the results}} of nonlinear time history analyses. Five truss bridges were designed with different types of end rakers namely existing HEB end raker, square hollow end raker, three square hollow CFST end raker bridges with varying concrete grades. Time history analyses were performed for transverse direction using selected past earthquakes and natural frequencies, maximum vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>deflections,</b> residual vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>deflections</b> and member stresses were checked.
