5|$|The {{mother of}} the two McCaig {{brothers}} visited the site of their deaths in May 1972. She expressed a wish to leave a monument to her sons but was advised that it might well be damaged by vandals.

5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
5|$|A large {{army was}} {{assembled}} slowly and marched into Scotland. Not only was no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king {{did not try}} and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. Henry's army <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the summer}} after only a brief stay, mostly camped near Leith (near Edinburgh) where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet. The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E

5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Mason got a job with the {{district}} bank while he attended night school in his spare time. He worked there until 1838, when he <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 21 to join the family's cotton business. He became {{the driving force behind the}} business. The business thrived: by the early 1850s the Mason family had built two state-of-the-art cotton mills in the Ryecroft area of Ashton-under-Lyne, known as the Oxford Mills. He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} the latest McBain film, Grampa suffers a mild heart attack. Thinking he might die, he is prompted to confess a long-hidden secret: Homer has a half-brother. Grampa {{explains that he}} met a carnival prostitute before marrying Mona, Homer's mother, {{and they had a}} son that they <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Shelbyville Orphanage. Determined to find his brother, Homer and his family go to the orphanage and find out that Grampa's love child was adopted by a Mr. and Mrs. Powell and named Herbert.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{the man and}} {{one woman}} walk into the woods {{together}} and masturbate each other while standing. The other woman, <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> car, becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E

Before landing his own show, Browngardt {{had worked at}} Augenblick Studios and MTV, {{as well as on}} individual programs, such as Futurama, The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and Chowder.

5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water that had been <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E

5|$|Halliday and Hamilton <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of that}} championship-winning season, and Halliday was {{replaced}} by Davie Shaw. Aberdeen won the League Cup under his guidance, beating St Mirren in 1955–56, and reached another Scottish Cup final in 1959. However, Shaw stepped aside for another former favourite player, Tommy Pearson, in 1959. Pearson's time in charge coincided with a high turnover of players, and yielded no trophies. He retired in 1965, making way for Eddie Turnbull.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 a hoard of 24 late Bronze Age {{weapons and}} tools was {{discovered}} during construction {{work at the}} Llyn Fawr reservoir, at {{the source of the}} Rhondda Fawr. The items did not originate from the Rhondda and are thought to have been <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site as a votive offering. Of particular interest were fragments of an iron sword which is the earliest iron object to be found in Wales and the only 'C-type' Hallstatt sword recorded in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Keith Floyd (1943–2009) was an English broadcaster, restaurateur {{and food}} writer. He {{was brought up}} in Somerset, England, where his mother taught him to cook. He was educated at Wellington, a local public school, {{although}} he <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of sixteen. He joined the Bristol Evening Post as a cub reporter—where he worked alongside the future playwright Tom Stoppard. He was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment in 1963 as a second lieutenant, but his career there only lasted until 1966; he left military service and moved to London and then France, where he worked in several restaurants in various roles.|$|E

5|$|Sabrina {{was born}} in 1757 in Clerkenwell, London, and was <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (more {{commonly}} known as the Foundling Hospital) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's baptismal name was Manima Butler and that she had been baptised in St James's Church, Clerkenwell. Her name was likely a misspelling of Monimia but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish.|$|E
5|$|Stroma is now abandoned, {{with the}} houses of its former {{inhabitants}} unoccupied and falling into ruin. Its population fell gradually through {{the first half of}} the 20th century as inhabitants drifted away to seek opportunities elsewhere, as economic problems and Stroma's isolation made life on the island increasingly unsupportable. From an all-time peak of 375 people in 1901, the population fell to just 12 by 1961 and the last islanders <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the following year. Stroma's final abandonment came in 1997 when the lighthouse keepers and their families departed. The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants, who uses it to graze cattle and sheep.|$|E

5|$|The Oubangui {{people of}} west Africa plant a tree {{when a child}} is born. As the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is {{considered}} at risk. When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.|$|E
5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was <b>left</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
