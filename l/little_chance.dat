The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War, the Battle of Evesham, on 4August 1265.

5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> a second interception could be arranged.|$|E
5|$|Such {{an order}} ignored {{the fact that}} the Belgian Army could not {{withdraw}} to the Yser, and there was <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> of any Belgian Cavalry joining in the attack. The plan for the Belgian withdrawal was sound; the Yser river covered Dunkirk to the east and south, while the La Bassée Canal covered it from the west. The ring of the Yser also dramatically shorted the Belgian Army's area of operations. Such a move would have abandoned Passchendaele and Ypres and would have certainly meant the capture of Ostend while further reducing the amount of Belgian territory still free by a few square miles.|$|E

5|$|The Persians had now {{captured}} most of Greece, but Xerxes had {{perhaps not}} expected such defiance from the Greeks; his priority was now {{to complete the}} war as quickly as possible; the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely, and probably Xerxes {{did not wish to}} be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> of success; with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus, there was therefore <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> of the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, if the isthmus's defensive line could be outflanked, the Allies could be defeated. Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the neutralisation of the Allied navy. In summary, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Greeks could avoid conquest. In the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.|$|E

Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E

5|$|After {{making the}} playoffs in 1989, the Giants entered the 1990 season as a Super Bowl favorite, though most {{believed}} they stood <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> of stopping the 49ers.

The Giants also lost close games to the 49ers on the road and to the Bills at home in the regular season before defeating both teams in playoff rematches. In the Week 15 game against Buffalo, starting quarterback Phil Simms was injured and ultimately lost for the season with a broken foot. He was replaced by Hostetler, who did not lose a game. The Giants' defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed (211), and the team set an NFL record by committing only 14 turnovers in the regular season.

Sigismund Vasa was elected king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania on 19 August 1587. However, his opponents proclaimed Maximilian of Habsburg the ruler of the Commonwealth. Maximilian laid siege to Kraków and pillaged Miechów. Andrew persuaded Sigismund Báthory's advisors to send Transylvanian reinforcements to fight the invaders. Andrew was chosen to receive Sigismund Vasa in Kraków. He also attended the new king's coronation on 27 December 1587. The Sejm (or general assembly) granted citizenship to both Andrew and Balthasar Báthory.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of Stevenage {{finishing}} sixth in the league, they faced third placed Sheffield United over two legs in the League One play-off semi-finals. Due to Sheffield United's higher standing in the league table, Stevenage had home advantage in the first leg, with the game being played on 11 May 2012, televised live on Sky Sports. The game was a tight affair with very <b>little</b> <b>chances,</b> ending in a 0-0 draw. The only chance of note during the game was Craig Reid's looping effort that beat Steve Simonsen in the Sheffield United goal, but rebounded off the crossbar. The second leg, played at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane, took place on 14 May, and was again a televised match. Similarly to the first leg, the game was a close encounter, with very <b>little</b> <b>chances</b> in the first-half. Sheffield United took the lead with just five minutes remaining, Chris Porter heading in Matthew Lowton's right wing cross to give the home side a 1-0 lead. Stevenage had little time to reply, and they ultimately bowed out at the semi-final stage of the play-offs in their first ever League One campaign.* Note: Stevenage goals come first.|$|R
