5|$|Bellows, hydraulic-powered: Although it {{is unknown}} if metallurgic bellows (i.e. air-blowing device) in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) were of the <b>leather</b> <b>bag</b> type or the wooden fan type found in the later Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368), the Eastern Han {{politician}} Du Shi (d. 38 AD) applied the use of rotating waterwheels to power the bellows of his blast furnace smelting iron, a method which continued in use in China thereafter, as evidenced by subsequent records; it is a significant invention in that iron production yields were increased and it employed all the necessary components for converting rotary motion into reciprocating motion.|$|E
5|$|Naval mine: The Huolongjing {{military}} manuscript {{written by}} Ming dynasty military writer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) also describes naval mines used at sea or on rivers and lakes; made of wrought iron and enclosed in an ox bladder, {{it was a}} timed device in that a burning joss sticks floating above the mine determined when the fuse was to be ignited; the text explicitly mentions that without air and doused in water the fuse would not burn, so the fuse was protected by a long waterproof tube made out of goat's intestine; a later model shown in Ming Chinese scientist and encyclopedist Song Yingxing's (1587–1666) encyclopedia of 1637 shows the ox bladder replaced with a lacquered <b>leather</b> <b>bag</b> while the mine is ignited by a rip cord pulled from the shore to rotate a flint-and-steel firing mechanism.|$|E

25|$|Narseh {{was himself}} {{wounded in the}} battle and fled Armenia into the Persian heartland, presumably {{in the hope of}} raising more troops; the booty taken by the victors was so great that it {{achieved}} legendary status and its transport back to Roman territory posed a logistical challenge. The battle was the origin of a well known anecdote, related by the historian Ammianus Marcellinus, that a simple Roman soldier had looted a highly decorated <b>leather</b> <b>bag</b> filled with pearls from the Persians; the soldier threw away the pearls as useless, but kept the bag.|$|E
25|$|These {{works were}} all {{published}} {{in an era}} before the cigarette had become the dominant form of tobacco consumption and pipes, cigars, and chewing tobacco were still commonplace. Many of the books were published in novel packaging that would attract the learned smoking gentleman. Pipe and Pouch came in a <b>leather</b> <b>bag</b> resembling a tobacco pouch and Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy (1901) came bound in leather, packaged in an imitation cardboard cigar box. By the late 1920s, the publication {{of this type of}} literature largely abated and was only sporadically revived in the later 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The Greek {{engineer}} Ctesibius of Alexandria {{is credited}} with inventing the organ in the 3rd century BC.

The pumps and water regulators of the hydraulis were replaced by an inflated <b>leather</b> <b>bag</b> in the 2nd century AD, and true bellows began to appear in the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th or 7th century AD.

500|$|The book {{takes its}} name from Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, North East England, in whose tomb it was placed, {{probably}} a few years after his death in 687. [...] Although it was long regarded as Cuthbert's personal copy of the Gospel, to which there are early references, and so a relic of the saint, the book is now thought to date from shortly after Cuthbert's death. [...] It was probably a gift from Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey, where it was written, intended to be placed in St Cuthbert's coffin in the few decades after this was placed behind the altar at Lindisfarne in 698. [...] It presumably remained in the coffin through its long travels after 875, forced by Viking invasions, ending at Durham Cathedral. [...] The book was found inside the coffin and removed in 1104 when the burial was once again moved within the cathedral. [...] It was kept there with other relics, and important visitors were able to wear the book in a <b>leather</b> <b>bag</b> around their necks. [...] It is thought that after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England by Henry VIII between 1536 and 1541, the book passed to collectors. [...] It was eventually given to Stonyhurst College, the Jesuit school in Lancashire.|$|E
500|$|Aelian {{described}} the bird in 250 AD in his De Natura Animalium as the kila, a large bird from India with a crop {{that looks like}} a <b>leather</b> <b>bag.</b> In Victorian times the greater adjutant was known as the gigantic crane and later as the Asiatic marabou. It was very common in Calcutta during the rainy season and large numbers could be seen at garbage sites and also standing on the top of buildings. Its local name hargila is derived from Bengali Har for [...] "bone" [...] and Nigalua - [...] "to swallow" [...] and thus means [...] "bone-swallower", and John Latham used it to give the species the binomial name, Ardea argala. At that time it was a belief that it was protected by the souls of dead Brahmins. Young British soldiers were known to harass these birds for fun, even blowing up birds by feeding them meat containing bones packed with a cartridge and fuse. The birds would remain calm when natives passed but would bark in anger when those in European clothes passed by. The birds in Calcutta were considered to be efficient scavengers and an act was passed to protect them. Anyone who killed the bird had to pay a fine of fifty rupees. The old emblem of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation included two adjutant storks facing each other. Captured birds, probably from Calcutta reached menageries in Europe during this period.|$|E

2500|$|The gold {{sovereign}} appears quite a small coin, {{but with}} a face value of £1 it had, in 1895, the same purchasing power as £103 in 2014. Gold is a dense metal: the sovereign contains 0.23542 ounces of gold, with a total weight of 0.25682 ounces. A reason to limit production of double sovereigns (£2) and quintuple sovereigns (£5) was the relative ease of removing gold from these larger coins — chemically, by filing, or using other techniques; for example, drilling small holes into the coin followed by hammering to conceal the holes, or [...] "sweating": shaking a <b>leather</b> <b>bag</b> full of coins {{for a long period}} and collecting the gold dust that was knocked off.|$|E
2500|$|In Mounds 5, 6, and 7, Carver found cremations {{deposited}} in bronze bowls. In Mound 5 [...] were found gaming-pieces, small iron shears, a cup, and an ivory box. Mound 7 also contained gaming-pieces, {{as well as}} an iron-bound bucket, a sword-belt fitting and a drinking vessel, together with the remains of horse, cattle, red deer, sheep, and pig that had been burnt with the deceased on a pyre. Mound 6 contained cremated animals, gaming-pieces, a sword-belt fitting, and a comb. The Mound 18 grave was very damaged, but of similar kind. Two cremations were found during the 1960s exploration to define the extent of Mound 5, together with two inhumations and a pit with a skull and fragments of decorative foil. In level areas between the mounds, Carver found three furnished inhumations. One small mound held a child's remains, along with his buckle and miniature spear. A man's grave included two belt buckles and a knife, and that of a woman contained a <b>leather</b> <b>bag,</b> a pin and a chatelaine.|$|E
