40|$|Mixtures <b>of</b> {{shredded}} <b>tyres</b> {{with sand}} have become accepted geo-materials {{in the past}} decade, especially for use as fill materials. Owing to the large size <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds commonly used in practice, large-scale direct shear testing equipment is specially fabricated to obtain the shear strength parameters of mixtures. The effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-tosand mixing ratio on the mechanical response of the mixtures is studied by performing direct shear tests on mixtures prepared at different mixing ratios. Out of the four types of samples tested, three (with mixing ratios of 20 / 80, 25 / 75 and 35 / 65 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds to sand) are prepared using 50 to 100 mm long tyre shreds and one (25 / 75 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chips to sand) using tyre chips with nominal size of 9. 5 mm. The end-of-test friction angle <b>of</b> all the <b>tyre</b> shred-sand mixtures considered in this research is in the 30 - 33 degrees range. Results of direct shear testing {{from the present study}} and other studies in the literature show that the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-sand mixtures is greater than that <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chip-sand mixtures because the elongated tyre shred pieces are able to provide greater reinforcement effects than are possible with equidimensional (cubical) tyre chips...|$|R
