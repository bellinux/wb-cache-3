25|$|RNA-Seq {{refers to}} the {{combination}} of a high-throughput sequencing methodology with computational methods to capture and quantify transcripts present in an RNA extract. The nucleotide sequences generated are typically around 100 bp in length, but can range from 30 bp to over 10,000 bp, depending on the sequencing method used. RNA-Seq leverages deep sampling of the transcriptome with many short fragments from a transcriptome to allow computational reconstruction of the original RNA transcript by aligning reads to a reference genome or to each other (de novo assembly). The typical dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude for RNA-Seq is a key advantage over microarray transcriptomes. In addition, input RNA amounts are much lower for RNA-Seq (nanogram quantity) compared to microarrays (microgram quantity), which allowed finer examination of cellular structures, down to the single-cell level when combined with linear amplification of cDNA. Theoretically, there is no upper <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification</b> in RNA-Seq, and background signal is very low for 100 bp reads in non-repetitive regions.|$|E

40|$|Amino {{derivatives}} of polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are well-known chemical carcinogens which should be carefully monitored in our environment. They are amenable to anodic oxida- tion on suitable solid or paste electrodes. This fact was exploited for voltammetric determina- tion of 4 -aminobiphenyl on unmodified carbon paste electrode and carbon paste electrodes modified by montmorillonite and sepiolite. The optimum pH of BR buffer for measurement on unmodified carbon paste electrode is pH 2, pH 10 for CPE-SEP and pH 11 for CPE-MMT. It was possible to increase sensitivity of the determination using adsorptive stripping voltam- metry on modified electrodes. The optimum time for accumulation of 4 -aminobiphenyl is 5 minutes. The <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> the order of 10 − 6 mol dm− 3 were obtained for each electrode.

40|$|Multiplex bead-based immunoassays {{are used}} to measure {{concentrations}} of several analytes simultaneously. These assays include control standard curves (SC) to reduce between-plate variability and normalize quantitation of analytes of biological samples. Suboptimal calibration might result in large random error and decreased number of samples with analyte concentrations within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification.</b> Suboptimal calibration may be a consequence of poor fitness of the functions used for the SC, {{the treatment of the}} background noise and the method used to estimate the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification.</b> Currently assessment <b>of</b> fitness of curves is largely dependent on operator and that may add additional error. Moreover, there is no software to automate data managing and quality control.

50|$|The {{techniques}} used for YTX analysis include: CE with ultraviolet (UV) detection and CE coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). CEUV {{is a good}} method for YTX analysis, as its selectivity can easily differentiate between YTXs and DSP toxins.

The technique gives a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 µg/ml and a <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification</b> (LOQ)of 0.9 µg/ml.

50|$|The figure below {{illustrates}} {{the relationship between}} the blank, the limit of detection (LOD), and the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification</b> (LOQ) by showing the probability density function for normally distributed measurements at the blank, at the LOD defined as 3 * standard deviation of the blank, and at the LOQ defined as 10 * standard deviation of the blank. For a signal at the LOD, the alpha error (probability of false positive) is small (1%). However, the beta error (probability of a false negative) is 50% for a sample that has a concentration at the LOD (red line). This means a sample could contain an impurity at the LOD, but there is a 50% chance that a measurement would give a result less than the LOD. At the LOQ (blue line), there is minimal chance of a false negative.|$|E
50|$|The MRL {{is usually}} {{determined}} by repeated (on {{the order of}} 10) field trials, where the crop has been treated according to good agricultural practice (GAP) and an appropriate pre harvest interval or withholding period has elapsed.

For this reason the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification</b> (LOQ) is often used instead of the LOD. As a rule of thumb the LOQ is approximately two times the LOD. For substances that are not included in any of the annexes in EU regulations, a default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg normally applies.|$|E

50|$|Insecticides such as ethion can be {{detected}} with different general chemical detection ways, {{but most of the}} time the samples need to be prepared. And due to fact that the methods are not specific it can be quite difficult to determine if a specific substance is actually present. But a new and novel and simple detection way has been developed. In this method the interaction of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with ethion and the quenching of the resonance relay scattering (RRS) intensity are used. RRS can be used because the change in this was linearly correlated to the concentration of ethion (Range: 10.0-900.0 mg/L). Furthermore, its has as advantages over general detection methods that ethion can be measured in just 3 minutes and that no pretreatment of the sample is required before the measurement. From interference tests it became clear that the method has a very good selectivity for ethion. The limit of detection (LOD) was 3.7 mg/L and <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantification</b> (LOQ) was 11.0 mg/L.
