40|$|This paper investigates {{sales quota}} {{dynamics}} at a Fortune 500 firm. We offer theoretical justifications for observed quota updating processes and test three particular hypotheses {{related to the}} issue. First, current year quotas are computed as a weighted average of <b>last</b> <b>year’s</b> sales and <b>last</b> <b>year’s</b> quota (Bayesian Updating). Second, this year’s sales quota increases more when <b>last</b> <b>year’s</b> sales exceed <b>last</b> <b>year’s</b> quota than this year’s quota falls when <b>last</b> <b>year’s</b> sales do not exceed <b>last</b> <b>year’s</b> quota (Asymmetric ratcheting). And third, the quota setting process is influenced by market and salesperson heterogeneity. Our empirical results support the hypotheses of dynamic quota updating, asymmetric ratcheting, and of heterogeneity in the quota setting proces...|$|R
