He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas {{paved the way for the}} work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E

Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table.

40|$|The {{observed}} boron/beryllium {{ratio in}} extreme Population II stars {{has been interpreted}} as evidence of Be and B synthesis by early Galactic cosmic rays. However, a recent reanalysis of the boron abundance in the Population II halo star HD 140823 suggests that B/H may be larger than previously reported, {{by as much as}} a factor of 4. This would yield a B/Be ratio lying in the range 14 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to B/Be <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 50. The possibilty of a high Population II B/Be ratio stresses the importance of the upper limit to the B/Be ratio arising from cosmic-ray production. It is found that the limit to cosmic-ray-produced B/Be depends upon the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. For any Population II cosmic-ray spectrum that is a single power law in either total energy per nucleon or in momentum, the B/Be ratio constrained to lie in the range 7. 6 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to B/Be <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 14. Thus, if the new B/Be ratio is correct, it requires either a bimodal cosmic-ray flux with a large low-energy component, or, for another B source, possibly the proposed nu-process in supernovae, either of which may be helpful in explaining the observed B- 11 /B- 10 ratio. Finally, it is noted that the boron reanalysis highlights the uncertainty in our knowledge of the B/Be ratio, and the need for additional data on Be and B abundances...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{generalization}} of earlier {{analysis of the}} motion of the heliospheric termination shock in response to heliospheric disturbances (Barnes, 1993) (paper 1), to allow jump conditions that include an energy sink at the shock front. The motivation for this study is that acceleration of the anomalous cosmic ray component may in fact represent such a sink. We have idealized the situation by assuming an infinitely thin shock parameterized by a quantity lambda(0 <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> lambda <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> 1), defined as the fraction of solar wind energy that is lost due to acceleration of the energetic particle component. If the sink is strong (consuming, say, 50 % or more of the incident solar wind energy), the model leads to the following principal conclusions: (1) the shocked plasma would be much denser and cooler than in the standard gasdynamic case, thereby leading to more favorable conditions for direct observation of the shocked plasma; (2) the equilibrium shock position would be slightly farther (<b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 %) from the Sun than in the standard model; (3) as in the gasdynamic case, the shock would normally be in motion, so that the instantaneous position of the termination shock is not determined by interstellar conditions but by the recent history of the wind that has passed through the termination shock; and (4) the response of the shock to upstream disturbances would be similar to the response in the gasdynamic case, but the speed of the new termination shock would be somewhat smaller (probably by a f actor of 4 or less).

40|$|Background: Hepatic {{resection}} is used increasingly for {{the management}} of a variety of benign and malignant conditions, yet the resulting small functional remnant liver volumes and compromised liver function increase the risk for the development of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). In spite of the assistance with the functional and imaging measures to assess preoperatively the size and function of the future liver remnant, and also the use of portal vein embolization as a preventive intervention, PHLF remains a major concern and {{has been shown to be}} a predominant cause of hepatectomy-related mortality. Objective: To investigate the impact of future liver remnant volume on the outcome of major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients and Methods: The study period was from Jan 2000 – Dec 2014. Selection criteria was patient undergoing major hepatectomy with CT volumetry performed. For those with PVE done, only the pre-PVE volume was considered for analysis. 204 patients are recruited in the study, all patients with HCC who had volumetry done before hepactectomy. Results: None of the patients with preoperative sFLR <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 25 % has multi-organ failure while there are 4 % and 3. 6 % patients with preoperative sFLR from 25. 1 % to 35 % and more than 35 % respectively have multi-organ failure. 11. 8 %, 1. 3 % and 4. 5 % patients with preoperative sFLR <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 25 %, from 25. 1 % to 35 % and more than 35 % respectively died during the stay in the hospital after the operation. Conclusions: Although there are no statistical differences between the three groups in postoperative complications, liver failure and and hospital mortality, the hospital mortality for FLR <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 25 % is still higher (11. 8 %) than the other two groups. published_or_final_versionSurgeryMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
