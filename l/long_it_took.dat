5|$|U-15 was {{constructed}} at AG Weser in Bremen for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and then shipped by rail in sections to Pola, where the sections were riveted together. Though {{there is no}} specific mention of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> for U-15s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine UB-3, shipped to Pola from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks.

5|$|U-16 {{was ordered}} by the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen on later in the month. When completed, the {{submarine}} was broken down into sections, loaded onto railcars, and shipped on 20 August to the Austro-Hungarian Navy's main base at Pula. After completing the eight-day journey, the sections were riveted together. Though there is no specific mention of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> for U-16s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine , shipped to Pula from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks.

5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of FBI's investigation, because of the {{possibility}} that international terrorists might have been involved, assistance was requested from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). CIA analysts, relying on sound-propagation analysis, were able to conclude that the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail of burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion. This conclusion was reached after calculating how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> for the sound of the initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the accident sequence. In all cases the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.|$|E

The forward command of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC), which Pallop headed, was also dissolved. A government investigative commission found that the security forces had over-reacted. The Asian Centre for Human Rights questioned the independence and impartiality of the investigative commission. On 3 May 2004 during a senate hearing, Senator Kraisak Choonhavan noted {{that most of those}} killed at Krue Se Mosque {{had been shot in the}} head and there were signs that ropes had been tied around their wrists, suggesting they had been executed after being captured.|$|E

500|$|After {{extended}} {{negotiations between}} Austria-Hungary and Germany, in March 1915 {{it was decided}} for Germany to supply five submarines of the UB I type. This model was familiar to the Austro-Hungarian Navy since the Imperial German Navy had reassembled UB3, UB 8, and UB 9 at the Pola factory. The first boat was bought on April 4, 1915, a [...] "sample" [...] UB 1 boat. This submarine was shipped by rail in sections to Pola, where the sections were riveted together. Though {{there is no record}} of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> for UB-1s parts to be assembled, a sister boat, , shipped from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks.|$|E

500|$|In 1926 the Australians toured England for {{the first}} time since 1921. The English {{selectors}} decided to add two professional cricketers to their committee, choosing Rhodes and Jack Hobbs. With Rhodes in such good form and leading the bowling averages, the selectors tried to convince him to play for England on several occasions through the season but he refused on the grounds that younger men should be chosen. The first four Tests were all drawn; the selectors were conscious, as England entered the final Test, the team had won only one of its previous 19 matches against Australia. [...] The deciding game, at the Oval, was to be played to a finish no matter how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took.</b> The selectors dropped the captain, Arthur Carr, and replaced him with the inexperienced Percy Chapman. They also recalled Rhodes, aged nearly 49, having finally overcome his objections. According to Wisden, the selection of Rhodes [...] "naturally occasioned a good deal of surprise".|$|E

500|$|During {{his student}} years, Lethbridge had frequented the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, {{where he had}} befriended its curator, Louis Clarke. Upon Lethbridge's graduation, Clarke offered him the honorary {{position}} of Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the museum. Lethbridge took up the voluntary and unpaid post, being able to subsist on his family's finances. There, Lethbridge befriended the archaeologist Cyril Fox, aiding in Fox's excavation of the Devil's Dyke in Cambridgeshire. Lethbridge's archaeological excavations were however deemed of poor quality by many of his peers. In turn, Lethbridge derided the archaeological establishment, being frustrated by how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> them to accept what he deemed to be [...] "facts", and he believed in focusing on what he believed to be instinct and common sense. There were exceptions to his scorn; for instance, he developed a friendship with T. D. Kendrick, an Anglo-Saxon art historian who then worked as Keeper of the British Museum in London. Over {{the course of his}} career at the museum, Lethbridge produced 60 archaeological reports, written in an unusually informal manner that used humour and wit and included narrative descriptions of the excavation process.|$|E
500|$|There was initial {{concern over}} Reeve's stamina for {{shooting}} the scenes, as his particular scene with Welling was six pages long, which translated to approximately twelve {{hours of work}} day. Beeman tried to design everything so it was as simple as possible, but Reeve quickly readjusted the scene. Beeman originally had Welling walk into frame and {{stand in front of}} Reeve, and then make a single move behind Reeve. Beeman was told, by Reeve, the scene needed more dynamic between the characters, and if Welling only made a single move, the dynamic would be lost. According to Reeve, [...] "Tom moving around me will hide the fact that I'm unable to move." [...] Beeman's fear of overstretching Reeve's stamina, because of the added shots to the scene, were put to rest when Reeve himself stated it did not matter how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to finish the scene, as long as it turned out great. Reeve was directing Yankee Irving when Smallville was gearing up to film the fourth season opener. As a result, Reeve could not reprise his role as Dr. Swann, which was the intention.|$|E
500|$|The revised florin's {{diameter}} {{was increased}} to 30 millimetres (the weight was unchanged), {{and all the}} lettering on the coin was in Gothic script, resulting in it being known as the Gothic florin. The coin was by the same designers; its date was rendered in Roman numerals. The bust of Victoria and the heraldry on the reverse were largely unchanged. The Latin inscription on the obverse read [...] with the date, while the reverse read [...] Despite a Royal Commission, the drive for decimalisation soon died out; there was only lukewarm support for an 1855 motion in the Commons applauding the issuance of the florin and seeking further decimal coins. The Gothic Florin was produced each year until 1887, excepting 1861 and 1882. From 1864 until 1879, many florins were struck with die numbers on the obverse (found {{to the right of}} Victoria's brooch, possibly part of a Mint investigation into how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> coinage dies to wear out.
