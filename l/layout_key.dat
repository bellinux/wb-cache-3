While all the known optimal layouts, including the Preparata-Vuillemin layout, of the CCC have long wires, we give a new layout scheme which has no long wires while keeping the asymptotically-optimal area.

40|$|The {{question}} of plant layout is central in a manufacturing process. This question {{becomes even more}} important in a mass customization context, when large product diversity has to be managed. The manufacturing process, and specifically the plant layout, has to be designed taking into account this characteristic. When all products are similar, manufacturing plant layouts are relatively easy to design; difficulties come when most products are different and require specific manufacturing operations. This paper proposes a methodology based on data mining techniques to define manufacturing plant layouts {{in a context of}} diversified products. Different steps are proposed to achieve this goal. The methodology considers: 1 / identification of representative sets of products; 2 / identification of manufacturing processes and the relevant layout (for each set of products); 3 / categorization of new products (identification of the closest set of products). The focus is on data transformations that enable to extract relevant information for the manufacturing plant <b>layout.</b> <b>Key</b> words: product families, plant layout, data transformation, data mining. ...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{experiments}} {{examined the}} use of representations of self-to-object or object-to-object spatial relations during locomotion. Participants learned geometrically regular or irregular layouts of objects while {{standing at the edge}} or in the middle, and then pointed to objects while blindfolded in three conditions: before turning (baseline), after rotating 240 degrees (updating), and after disorientation (disorientation). The internal consistency of pointing in the disorientation condition was equivalent to that in the updating condition when participants learned the regular layout. The internal consistency of pointing was disrupted by disorientation when participants learned the irregular layout. However when participants who learned the regular layout were instructed to use self-to-object spatial relations, the effect of disorientation on pointing consistency appeared. When participants who learned the irregular layout at the periphery of the layout were instructed to use object-to-object spatial relations, the effect of disorientation disappeared. These results suggest that people represent both self-to-object and object-to-object spatial relations, and primarily use object-to-object spatial representation in a regular layout and self-to-object spatial representation in an irregular <b>layout.</b> <b>Key</b> words: self-to-object spatial relations, object-to-object spatial relations...|$|E
40|$|From {{environmental}} {{point of}} view, building waste {{is a critical}} issue in present construction. In {{order to reduce the}} depletion of valuable materials and natural resources, waste management of constructions needs to be considered {{in the early stages of}} design. This requires innovative design strategies that take into account the future demolition and provide flexible and versatile structures. Industrial, flexible and demountable building system (IFD) is trying to create buildings with higher quality, more adaptable and better environmental characteristics. But till date, a recognized method for IFD building assessment has not been defined. This research focuses on IFD component analysis process for a residential terrace house layout. In the first step of the research, a conceptual prototype for the key elements was proposed. Next step was to create a procedure for evaluating the suggested design. The evaluation process contains two parts. First, the layout and design characteristics assessment according to IFD criteria was developed. Second, the stability, seismic and load bearing capacity of the designed structure was characterized by conventional nonlinear static analysis (pushover) through finite element computations with ETABS software. It is proposed that, application of these assessments can testify to the flexibility and strength of the designed <b>layout.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Industrial, flexible and demountable building system (IFD), building components, modular coordination system, terrace house layout...|$|E

40|$|The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a radio {{telescope}} designed to operate be-tween 70 MHz and 10 GHz. Due to this large bandwidth, the SKA {{will be built}} out of different collectors, namely antennas and dishes to cover the frequency range ade-quately. In {{order to deal with}} this bandwidth, innovative feeds and detectors must be designed and introduced in the initial phases of development. Moreover, the required level of resolution may only be achieved through a groundbreaking configuration of dishes and antennas. Due to the large collecting area and the specifications required for the SKA to deliver the promised science, the configuration of the dishes and the antennas within stations is an important question. This research builds on the work done before by Cohanim et al. (2004), Hassan et al. (2005) and Grigorescu et al. (2009) to further investigate the applicability of machine learning techniques to de-termine the optimum configurations for the collecting elements within the SKA. This work primarily uses genetic algorithms to search a large space of optimum layouts. Every genetic step provides a population with candidate individuals each of which encodes a possible solution. These are randomly generated or created through the combination of previous encodings. In this study, a number of fitness functions that rank individuals within a population of dish configurations are investigated.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{simulation model}} {{was used to}} assist 5 farmers in developing design criteria for inclusion of robotic milking systems in each farm situation. The barn layout influences arrivals of cows to the milking robot {{as well as other}} cow traffic and must be carefully planned. Each farmer had individual objectives and consequently unique design criteria that determined the optimal solution. Planning factors addressed by simulations on these farms included: 1) optimal cow cooling locations; 2) optimal facility allocation in expanding dairies; 3) concentrate feeder locations and feeding management; 4) number of feeders—based on expected rations; 5) use of a robot in an open cowshed without free stalls; 6) number of robots needed, currently and in the future; 7) eight robots working in harmony; 8) robot locations that allow for expansion; 9) floor space needed in each barn section including maternity and veterinary treatment areas; 10) location of bottlenecks that limit efficiency or expansion; and 11) cow traffic routine as affected by management practices, feed allocation, and farm layout. The simulation allowed farmers to receive a course in managing a “virtual robotic milking farm ” before installation of the barn. Therefore, each could be more confident that his future barn would work properly under his unique local conditions and management practices. One farm checked 2 yr after construction achieved an average daily robot utilization of 84 %, nearly matching the 85 % projected before the barn was built. Important variables considered in the simulations were facility allocation, cow space needed in each farm area, robot utilization, number of cows, milk yield, milk flow rate, feeding method and timing, robot location and orientation, and farm physical <b>layout.</b> (<b>Key</b> words: robotic milking, dairy cow, farm design, simulation) Abbreviation key: RMB = robotic milking barn...|$|E
