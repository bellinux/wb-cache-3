5|$|The {{offensive}} team must <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea were {{expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation, with Essien in central defence. They had doubts about the fitness of captain John Terry going into the final. He appeared to have damaged his ankle ligaments during {{the first leg of}} Chelsea's Champions League tie with Porto, though passed a fitness test just days after. Arsenal {{were expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a similar formation, with Baptista and Aliadière up front.|$|E

5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of a}} field.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona were {{expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. He had pulled a thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he {{was included in the}} 22 man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would leave it late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal {{were expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pirès on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match that this would be Pirès' last match as he had agreed to join Villarreal next season.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E

5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods for {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea were {{predicted}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Willian and Eden Hazard as wide men. Mourinho doubted the fitness of Diego Costa and Gary Cahill {{going into the}} match – the former aggravated his hamstring during a pre-season game against Barcelona. Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Chelsea, with Walcott furthest forward and Mesut Özil in his preferred position as playmaker. Midfielder Jack Wilshere was ruled out of selection, having sustained an ankle injury during training. Arsenal's top scorer of the previous season, Alexis Sánchez, was rested, having won the 2015 Copa América with Chile earlier in the summer. The teamsheets showed Loïc Rémy starting the match for Chelsea up front and Cesc Fàbregas partnering Matic in midfield. As expected Petr Čech started in goal for Arsenal; the goalkeeper moved from Chelsea in search of first-team football.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City were {{predicted}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Nasri and James Milner as wide men. Due to a specified pre-season programme, Pellegrini {{had agreed to}} excuse several players from the match, namely Martín Demichelis, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, Fernandinho, Frank Lampard and Sergio Agüero. Striker Álvaro Negredo was also unavailable for selection because of an injury. Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Manchester City, with Ramsey as a holding midfielder, and Tomáš Rosický in an advanced role behind Olivier Giroud. Goalkeeper David Ospina was ruled {{out of the game}} with a thigh injury; German internationals Per Mertesacker, Mesut Özil and Lukas Podolski did not feature as they were given extended time off following their national side's success at the World Cup.|$|E

5|$|On the field, the Australians—captained by Richie Benaud—were successful. They {{defeated}} Pakistan 2–0 {{in three}} Tests, and India 2–1 over five matches. Australia’s only other Test win on Pakistani soil came in 1998 {{and they have}} only won two series in India since the Benaud-Loxton expedition. They also remained unbeaten outside the Test matches. Despite the success with bat and ball, the Australians were struck down by serious illness during {{the second part of}} their tour in India, despite taking Dr. Ian McDonald—a former Victorian first-class cricketer—with the travelling party. Gordon Rorke, Lindsay Kline and Gavin Stevens all contracted hepatitis; the former two were sent home, while the latter was too ill to fly back to Australia {{until the end of the}} tour. Harvey said that Stevens—who never played first-class cricket again after his illness—"could've been the first man to die on tour". Due to the bevy of unfit players, Loxton was forced to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> one game, against Indian Universities in Bangalore, two years after playing his last first-class match. He scored 33 and bowled six overs without taking a wicket in a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E

25|$|In parades, bands usually <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a marching block {{composed}} of ranks and files.

25|$|At times, C-123 {{crews were}} {{uncomfortable with the}} assault role. South Vietnamese Special Forces were {{sometimes}} capricious about when and where they would fight.

To execute the mission, the C-123s would <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a proper direction, let down in the undercast, {{and if they did}} not break out by a given altitude, would climb back up. There were usually 800-foot ceilings in the valleys, {{and most of the time}} they broke out.|$|E
