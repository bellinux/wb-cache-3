40|$|Cultivation of {{a second}} crop in paddy fields of Guilan {{province}} is a strategy for optimum use of land, supporting family economy and increasing oil-seed production. However, this is impeded under high rainfall and waterlogging conditions. To enhance second-crop cultivation in paddy fields, surface drainage is inevitable. The surface drainage practices should be performed with minimum costs, least time span and least variations of the land. In the present research, longitudinal surface drains were constructed with a spacing of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 m (depth of 20 cm), with and without 1 -m lateral drains (depth of 10 cm) in Rice Research Institute, Rasht, Iran. The experiment was conducted in a complete randomized block design with three replications. Canola (Brassica napa), variety PF, was cultivated as a second crop after rice. The {{results showed that the}} effects of drain spacing on seed yield, days to maturity, number of plants per m 2, and also the effects of lateral drainage on seed yield, plant height, residual N, days to maturity, and number of plants per m 2 are significant (P&lt; 0. 01). Highest yield (2493 kg/ha) was obtained from longitudinal drains 4 m apart, with lateral drainage; drain spacing of 6 and 2 m had acceptable yields, too (2241 and 1817 kg/ha, respectively). For treatments without lateral drainage, 2 -m drain spacing had the highest yield (1324 kg/ha). Considering all the expenses for drainage construction, it was found that net benefit of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drain</b> spacing of 4 and 6 m was twice the costs. Since the rainfall in Nov., Dec., and Jan., 2000, was higher than the 20 -year average rainfall of the same months, it was concluded that the results of this experiment may be recommended in the years with a rainfall less than the year 2000...|$|E
40|$|Periodic {{opening of}} one-way tidal {{floodgates}} was undertaken on two coastal flood mitigation drains to promote exchange with estuarine water and improve drain water quality. The drains {{were located in}} areas with acid sulphate soils and their drainage water frequently had high acidity and low dissolved oxygen (DO). Tidal exchange via floodgate opening generally raised drain water pH levels through dilution and/or neutralisation of acidity. Increases in DO and moderation of extreme diurnal DO fluctuations were also observed. The magnitude and stability of the improved physico-chemical conditions was highly dependant on the volume and quality of tidal ingress water. Relatively rapid reversion (hours to days) in drain water pH and DO was observed once floodgates were closed again. The rate of reversion following floodgate closure was strongly related to outflow volumes, antecedent drain water quality conditions and groundwater levels. Floodgate opening caused changes in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drain</b> water gradients and has potential to slow net drainage rates during non-flood periods. However, complex site specific interactions between drain water and adjacent groundwater can also occur. At one location, a 4 -day floodgate opening event caused recharge of adjacent acid groundwater during the opening phase, raising the potentiometric groundwater level above local low tide minima. This was followed by tidally modulated draw down of acid groundwater and enhanced acid export in the period immediately following floodgate closure. There are also practical considerations, which limit the efficacy of floodgate opening as an acid management strategy. The low elevation (close to mean sea level) of some acid sulphate soil backswamps, combined with seasonal migration of the estuarine salt wedge, means there is considerable potential for saline overtopping of what is currently agricultural land. This constrains the magnitude and duration of controlled tidal exchange. Also, it is during wet periods that acid drainage outflow to the estuary is greatest. At such times the salinity and acid buffering capacity of estuarine water is often low, thus reducing the capacity of tidal exchange waters to neutralise acidity...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a brief summary of {{research}} on the effect of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drains</b> on subgrade support. The Iowa DOT began installing longitudinal subdrains at a depth of 24 " in 1978. The trend in Iowa has been to deeper <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drains</b> with the present standard being 48 " deep. A very limited amount of data would indicate that the deeper <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drains</b> are providing a greater benefit to the subgrade support value. The 24 # deep drains of the Poweshiek Interstate 80 project yielded a spring subgrade support value of 165. The 30 " deep drains on Pottawattamie Interstate 80 yielded a K value of 170 while the 48 "deep drains on Cass County Interstate 80 yielded a K value of 210. This limited amount of data would indicate that the deeper drains provide greater benefit to improvement of the subgrade support values...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, the Iowa Department of Transportation has {{increased}} its use of recycled Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) as drainable base material below some new pavements. Water flowing out of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drains</b> on projects having recycled PCC drainable bases {{was found to have}} a high pH value. The high pH water impedes vegetation growth and becomes a contributing factor to soil erosion at the drain outlet. In addition, the high pH water contributes to the growth of crystalline deposits on the drain outlet wire mesh rodent guard and in some cases caused it to become completely blocked. This research determined which of three choices of recycled PCC drainable base material, gradation, and design would give the lowest pH value in the drain discharge water. The drainable base material having its fines separated out and placed as a 2 -in. (5. 1 -mm) bottom layer, below the remaining coarse material, generally gave pH values around 11. 2 while other designs tested gave pH values around 11. 5...|$|R
40|$|Since 1978 {{the concept}} of <b>longitudinal</b> edge <b>drains</b> along Iowa primary and Interstate {{highways}} has been accepted as a cost-effective way of prolonging pavement life. Edge-drain installations have increased over the years, reaching a total of nearly 3, 000 mi by 1989. With so many miles of edge drain installed, {{the development of a}} system for inspection and evaluation of the drains became essential. Equipment was purchased to evaluate 4 -in. -diameter and geocomposite edge drains. Initial evaluations at various sites supported the need for a postconstruction inspection program to ensure that edge-drain installations were in accord with plans and specifications. Information disclosed by video inspections in edge drains and in culverts was compiled on videotape to be used as an informative tool for personnel in the design, construction, and maintenance departments. Video evaluations have influenced changes in maintenance, design, and construction inspection for highway drainage systems in Iowa...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{greatest}} challenges {{in the study of the}} evolution of mountain ranges is determining the history of the development of longitudinal and transverse drainages. It has been proposed that the increase of the regional slope during mountain building primarily controls the evolution of the drainage pattern from longitudinal to transverse. Incipient crustal shortening in the upper crust is generally characterized by the detachment of the sedimentary cover from its basement resulting in folding and thrusting, and the undulation of Earth's surface. Folding and thrusting induce local slopes counter to the regional slope, which force the water path in the direction of the fold axes and thrust faults, that is, perpendicular to the regional slope. Enhanced regional slope and erosion in the upper crust, which removes the sedimentary cover during mountain building, result in the capture of the longitudinal rivers by the headward migration of the transverse rivers, and eventually by the progressive replacement of the whole longitudinal-dominated drainage by a transverse-dominated drainage. This evolution accounts for the common observation of the persistence of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drains</b> where the sedimentary cover has been partly preserved, and for the dominance of transverse drains where the lower ductile crust has been exhumed. Based on a geomorphological analysis calibrated by published long-term (Apatite Fission Track) erosion rates and, new and published short-term (terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide) erosion rates it can be shown that the drainage of the NW Himalaya is evolving in a similar way. Long-term and short-term erosion rates show that the drainage divide between the transverse Beas river (NW India) and the longitudinal Chenab river, located farther in the hinterland, is migrating to the north at 1. 5 ± 1. 55 mm/yr and 1. 7 ± 0. 7 mm/yr, respectively. Divide migration to the North will eventually involve the capture of the upper reaches of the longitudinal Chenab river in ~ 2 ± 1 Ma. At the scale of the central and eastern Himalaya, this evolution from longitudinal-dominated to transverse-dominated drainage is enhanced by the strong difference in elevation of the efficient base level of the rivers on each side of the chain, which induces the inevitably northward migration of the main divide...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{absence of}} the {{coronary}} sinus is widely recognized in hearts with isomerism of the right atrial appendages, {{little attention has been}} paid to the fashion of the venous return from the heart itself. In this study, the arrangement of coronary venous return was investigated in 99 specimens with isomeric right and 49 with isomeric left appendages. In the normal heart, the coronary veins consist of a circumflex component within the atrioventricular groove and longitudinal components on the ventricular mass. The circumflex venous system was seen in 44 hearts with isomerism of left appendages (90 %), but 23 of these hearts lacked the anatomic features of the coronary sinus. Circumflex veins were entirely lacking in the other 10 % of hearts with isomeric left appendages and in all those with isomeric right appendages. In these hearts, <b>longitudinal</b> veins <b>drained</b> independently into the atria in three patterns. The first was a direct connection, with the venous orifice opening between the trabeculations of the atrial wall immediately having crossed the atrioventricular groove. The second was a crooked return, with the vein running an intramural course along the atrioventricular groove. The third was a distant connection, reaching superiorly to the smooth-walled atrial component after running an intramural course. Intramural courses were seen in 19 % of the longitudinal veins, such veins being found in 62 % of all hearts with no circumflex venous system. These findings, which to the best of our knowledge have never previously been recognized in detail, almost certainly have potential surgical significance.
