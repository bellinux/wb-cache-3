The state assembly passes laws on subjects that are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Parliament of Malaysia such as <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> employment, forests, immigration, merchant shipping and fisheries. The state government is constituted by the chief minister, the cabinet ministers and their assistant ministers.|$|E

All the land managed by the ILA was defined as Israel lands; it included both land owned by the government (about 80%) and land owned by the JNF-KKL (about 13%). The JNF-KKL received the right to nominate 10 of the 22 directors of the ILA, lending it significant leverage within that state body.|$|E

2500|$|The Jewish National Fund (JNF) {{controls}} 12.5 {{percent of}} public land but its statutes prohibit the sale or {{lease of land}} to non-Jews. In October, civil rights groups petitioned the High Court of Justice claiming that a bid announcement by the Israel <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> (ILA) involving JNF land was discriminatory in that it banned Arabs from bidding. In January 2005, the attorney general ruled that [...] "the government cannot discriminate against Israeli Arabs in marketing and allocating lands it manages," [...] {{including those of the}} JNF.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2007, the Israeli Knesset {{approved}} the Jewish National Fund Bill, submitted by MK Uri Ariel (National Union/National Religious Party), in its preliminary reading; but {{the bill was}} later dropped. The bill sought to authorize the JNF practice of refusing to lease land to Arab citizens. The bill called for a new provision to the 1960 Israel <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> Law, entitled [...] "Management of the Jewish National Fund's Lands"; the provision stated that regardless of other conflicting rulings, leasing JNF lands for Jewish settlement did not constitute discrimination, and: [...] "For the purpose of every law, the association documents of the Jewish National Fund will be interpreted according to {{the judgment of the}} Jewish National Fund's founders and from a nationalist-Zionist standpoint." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jewish National Fund is {{a private}} {{organization}} established in 1901 to buy and develop land in the Land of Israel for Jewish settlement; land purchases were funded by donations from world Jewry exclusively for that purpose. The JNF currently owns 13% {{of the land in}} Israel, while 79.5% is owned by the government (this land is leased on a non-discriminatory basis) and the rest, around 6.5%, is evenly divided between private Arab and Jewish owners. Thus, the Israel <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> (ILA) administers 93.5% of the land in Israel (Government Press Office, Israel, 22 May 1997). A significant portion of JNF lands were originally properties left behind by Palestinian [...] "absentees" [...] and as a result the legitimacy of some JNF land ownership has been a matter of dispute. The JNF purchased these lands from the State of Israel between 1949 and 1953, after the state took control of them according to the Absentee Properties Law. While the JNF charter specifies the land is {{for the use of the}} Jewish People, land has been leased to Bedouin herders. Nevertheless, JNF land policy has been criticized as discrimination. When the Israel <b>Land</b> <b>Administration</b> leased JNF land to Arabs, it took control of the land in question and compensated the JNF with an equivalent amount of land in areas not designated for development (generally in the Galilee and the Negev), thus ensuring that the total amount of land owned by the JNF remains the same. This was a complicated and controversial mechanism, and in 2004 use of it was suspended. After Supreme Court discussions and a directive by the Attorney General instructing the ILA to lease JNF land to Arabs and Jews alike, in September 2007 the JNF suggested reinstating the land-exchange mechanism.|$|E
