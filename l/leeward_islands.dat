5|$|Shortly after forming, gale {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles of the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla. Klaus {{was the first}} tropical cyclone on record to hit the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands</b> from the west, {{and as a result}} many were unprepared for the strong winds and rough seas from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the fourth}} named storm and second {{hurricane}} of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Dean formed on July 31 and reached tropical storm status the following day east of the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands.</b> Dean brushed the northern <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands</b> as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, bringing light rain but producing no damage, before turning northward and striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane. Dean continued northward before making landfall in southeastern Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was very}} {{difficult}} to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands</b> and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Klaus was a North Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that hit}} the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands</b> from the west in November of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming from a broad {{area of low pressure}} on November 5, Klaus maintained a northeast movement throughout much of its path. After making landfall on extreme eastern Puerto Rico, it passed {{to the north of the}} <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> resulting in strong southwesterly winds and rough seas. Klaus attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of 90mph (145km/h) before becoming extratropical over cooler waters on November 13. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding and light damage. Klaus caused heavy marine damage in the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> including wrecking at least three ships. The Virgin Islands experienced heavy damage as well.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Baker {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that affected}} the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> Greater Antilles, and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The tropical cyclone was the second intense hurricane, second hurricane, and second tropical storm of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Baker attained peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) near the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> traversed Antigua, and weakened to a tropical depression southwest of Puerto Rico. It re-intensified south of Cuba, strengthened to a strong Category 2 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, and hit the United States near Gulf Shores, Alabama, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Hurricane Baker produced extensive damage in the Lesser Antilles and Cuba, but impacts were minimal in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{declared}} war on France in May 1803 following the short-lived Peace of Amiens and by June, Emerald, {{under the command of}} Captain James O'Bryen, had joined Samuel Hood's squadron in the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands.</b> Prior to the British invasion of St Lucia on 21 June, she harassed enemy shipping, disrupting the island's resupply.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of Ilsa, the Weather Bureau issued a gale warning and hurricane watch for the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> Virgin Islands, and northern Puerto Rico. However, no damage was reported. The storm caused extensive beach erosion and squally conditions in Bermuda.|$|E

25|$|In 1498, Christopher Columbus {{gave the}} island the name San Martin (Saint Martin). However, the {{confusion}} of numerous poorly-charted small <b>islands</b> in the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Island</b> chain meant that this name ended up being accidentally transferred to another island, which is still known as Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten.|$|R
5000|$|The Renaissance Islands are a {{group of}} islands in the West Indies. The group {{comprises}} Saint Martin, Anguilla and Saint Barthélemy.

5|$|Hurricane Daisy {{brought the}} worst {{flooding}} to New England since Hurricane Diane in 1955. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1962 Atlantic hurricane season, Daisy developed from a tropical disturbance located well {{east of the}} <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands</b> on September29. Initially a tropical depression, it headed west-northwestward and failed to strengthen significantly. While located {{a short distance from}} the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> the depression curved northwestward and began intensifying. On October2, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Daisy. Around that time, the storm turned back to the west-northwest and continued to deepen. Daisy reached hurricane status late on October3. Two days later, it became a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, but briefly weakened back to a Category1 on October6.|$|E
5|$|On August15, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued {{for much of the}} <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands.</b> Two days later, the watch was expanded to include Puerto Rico and areas in the eastern Dominican Republic between Cabo Engaño and Cabo Beata. As Ana weakened and dissipated, the watches were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The first {{tropical}} cyclone and hurricane of the 1861 season {{is believed to}} have formed on July 6, immediately east of the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands.</b> A 1938 publication documented the storm's effects on Guadeloupe and St. Kitts, and given a lack of prior reports on the cyclone, modern-day reassessments concluded that it was relatively weak when it affected those islands. After crossing the northern <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> the tropical storm broadly curved toward the northwest, likely intensifying into the equivalence of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 9. The majority of the storm's track in the western Atlantic was unknown until it was reconstructed based on reports from, and the effects on, three ships in its vicinity.|$|E
50|$|They {{are common}} {{on the main}} Antipodes Island, they aren't very common on Bollons Island, they live in very small numbers on <b>Leeward</b> <b>Island</b> where they only live in a 0.1 square {{kilometre}} region of the island. The Antipodes parakeet also live on the 0.1 square kilometre Archway Island as well.|$|R
2500|$|Nevis {{was first}} sighted by Columbus in 1493; an island settled {{for more than}} two {{thousand}} years by Amerindian people. The indigenous people of Nevis during these periods belonged to the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Island</b> Amerindian groups popularly referred to as Arawaks and Caribs, a complex mosaic of ethnic groups with similar culture and language. Lennox Honychurch (D. Phil. in Anthropology) from Dominica, a leading scholar in the history and culture of Caribs, traces the European use of the term [...] "Carib" [...] to refer to the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Island</b> aborigines to Columbus, who picked it up from the Taínos on Hispaniola. It was not a name the Caribs called themselves. [...] "Carib Indians" [...] was the generic name used for all groups believed involved in cannibalistic war rituals, more particularly, the consumption of parts of a killed enemy's body.|$|R
50|$|Daniel {{was born}} at Barnes Ghaut Village in Saint Thomas Lowland Parish, Nevis, West Indies to Joseph Daniel and Melvina Daniel, née Archer. He {{received}} his early education at St. Thomas’ Government Elementary School in Nevis. He entered the teaching profession as a Pupil Teacher in 1950 and attained the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Island</b> Teachers’ Certificate in 1957.|$|R
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{prompted the}} issuance of several tropical storm warnings for the Lesser Antilles. <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands</b> Air Transport cancelled 40flights and sandbags were distributed in the United States Virgin Islands. Danny ultimately only brought light rain to the region, with its effects considered beneficial due to a severe drought.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, hurricane watches and gale warnings were issued for the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands.</b> As Daisy intensified, moved northward, and threatened New England, gale warnings were issued for the coastal areas from Block Island, Rhode Island, to Eastport, Maine, while hurricane watches were issued {{for the east}} coast of Maine.|$|E
5|$|Drifting {{near the}} northeastern Caribbean for several days, Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought prolonged rainfall to the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Islands,</b> the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, triggering widespread flooding and numerous mudslides. Damage from the stormin particular to roads, property and infrastructureexceeded $22 million (2010 USD), {{but there were}} no fatalities. After recurving toward the northeast, Otto proceeded across the open Atlantic without affecting any other landmasses.|$|E
50|$|Wiliwili, {{with the}} {{scientific}} name Erythrina sandwicensis, is {{a species of}} flowering tree in the pea family, Fabaceae that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is the only species of Erythrina that naturally occurs there. It is typically found in Hawaiian tropical dry forests on <b>leeward</b> <b>island</b> slopes up to an elevation of 600 m.|$|R
50|$|In 1865, {{after much}} {{agitation}} and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one composed of one-half elected members and one-half appointed. The elected legislators were outmaneuvered {{on numerous occasions}} by planters allied with colonial administrators. In 1871, Dominica {{became part of the}} <b>Leeward</b> <b>Island</b> Federation. The power of the Black population progressively eroded. Crown Colony government was re-established in 1896.|$|R
50|$|Following World War I, an upsurge of {{political}} consciousness throughout the Caribbean {{led to the}} formation of the representative government association. Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the governing of Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924 and one-half in 1936. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the <b>Leeward</b> <b>Island</b> Administration and was governed as part of the Windwards until 1958, when it joined the short-lived West Indies Federation.|$|R
