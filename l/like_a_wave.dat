5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For example, it can be refracted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave,</b> and has mass like a particle.|$|E
25|$|L'Arbre (The Tree), is a {{painting}} created in 1910 by the French artist, theorist and writer Albert Gleizes. Executed in an advanced Proto-Cubist style, {{the work was}} exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants, 1910 (no. 2160), the following year Gleizes chose to exhibit this work at the Salon de la Section d'Or, Galerie La Boétie, 1912 (no. 34), and Manes Moderni Umeni, S.V.U., Vystava, Prague, 1914 (no. 33). The painting was again shown at the Grand Palais, Salon des Indépendants, Trente ans d'art indépendant, in 1926. L'Arbre, an important work of 1910, appeared at the decisive Salon des Indépendants of 1911, where Cubism emerged as a group manifestation and spread <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> across the globe, shocking the general public in its wake.|$|E

The voltage of <b>a</b> DC <b>wave</b> is roughly constant, whereas the voltage of an AC waveform continually varies between positive and negative values. <b>Like</b> <b>an</b> AC <b>wave,</b> the voltage of <b>a</b> PDC <b>wave</b> continually varies, but <b>like</b> <b>a</b> DC <b>wave,</b> {{the sign of the}} voltage is constant.|$|R

2500|$|René Descartes (1596–1650) {{held that}} light was a {{mechanical}} {{property of the}} luminous body, rejecting the [...] "forms" [...] of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo {{as well as the}} [...] "species" [...] of Bacon, Grosseteste, and Kepler. [...] In 1637 he published a theory of the refraction of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves. Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.|$|E

Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire.

2500|$|Action {{potentials}} cannot propagate {{through the}} membrane in myelinated {{segments of the}} axon. [...] However, the current is carried by the cytoplasm, which is sufficient to depolarize {{the first or second}} subsequent node of Ranvier. [...] Instead, the ionic current from an action potential at one node of Ranvier provokes another action potential at the next node; this apparent [...] "hopping" [...] of the action potential from node to node is known as saltatory conduction. [...] Although the mechanism of saltatory conduction was suggested in 1925 by Ralph Lillie, the first experimental evidence for saltatory conduction came from Ichiji Tasaki and Taiji Takeuchi* [...] and from Andrew Huxley and Robert Stämpfli.* [...] By contrast, in unmyelinated axons, the action potential provokes another in the membrane immediately adjacent, and moves continuously down the axon <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
