40|$|The {{majority}} of {{past studies on}} the foreign market mode of entry have focused on manufacturing industries. Although some studies have explored the entry mode decision of the banking industry, {{most of them have}} adopted the case study method, and systematic studies have been relatively few. This study intends to fill this gap through an investigation of 7, 041 Asian and <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>bank</b> branches covering the period from 1999 to 2005. The analytical results demonstrate that both Asian and <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>banks</b> are market seekers. However, <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>banks</b> are not customer followers. In addition, the larger the scale of the bank or the greater the net interest margin, {{the more likely it is}} that high control entry modes will be adopted. By contrast, in countries in Asia with a greater cultural distance, banks tend to establish low control entry modes to avoid uncertainty. This does not apply, however, in the case of Latin America...|$|R

Significant evidence of cointegration in both long- and short-term relationships is reported. Within Latin America, exogeneity lies mainly with the Brazilian system. Within Eurobanking, the U.

40|$|In recent years, <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>banking</b> sectors have {{experienced}} an accelerated process of consolidation that {{was accompanied by}} important increases in concentration and, in most cases, internationalization. This process, which in many cases was triggered by episodes of financial distress, has posed questions about its implications for the competitive behavior of banks, and for the approach that the supervisory bodies should adopt to balance financial stability considerations {{with the goal of}} fostering competition. Exploiting a rich balance sheet database for 7 <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> countries, we examine the evolution of concentration and foreign penetration indicators and their impact on competition. We conclude that, at least at an aggregate level, {{there is no evidence that}} industry consolidation has led to a less competitive environment. While most <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>banking</b> sectors are far from the perfect competition benchmark, competition estimates do not differ from those computed for developed economies and have remained remarkably stable. Moreover, if anything, the evidence suggests that consolidation led to more rather than less competition in the sector. This may be due in part to the fact that, i...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crises in 1994 - 95 and 1997 - 98 in developingeconomies {{led to an}} overall cry for improvements in regulation and supervision of the financial sector, in particularly of the banking sector. In addition, further privatisation and opening of domestic financial markets to foreign banks was recommended {{as a way to}} increase both stability and efficiency of credit provision by domestic banks (e. g. Burki and Perry, 1998). In Latin America, several countries followed such recommendations and their financial regulation and supervision have improved significantly. Despite these changes, the crisis of 2001 - 02 in Argentina (where after 1994 the strictest bank regulation was introduced) indicates that the <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>banking</b> sector remains fragile. In addition, the problem of credit stagnation became more acute after 1997 - 98 (Barajas and Steiner, 2002). Thus it has become evident that additional measures are required to achieve growth and stability of the banking sector in the region – so that the sector can make a significant contribution to the long-term development of the region. Explaining the fragility of the <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>banking</b> sector requires an integrated macro- and microeconomic analysis.
