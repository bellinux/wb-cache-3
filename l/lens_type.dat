40|$|Background: Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{clinical}} performance of a biweekly (second generation) silicone hydrogel lens and a biweekly hydrogel lens worn for daily wear modality. Methods: We used a double-masked study, in which non-presbyopic, asymptomatic and adapted soft lens wearers were recruited. Subjects wore a silicone hydrogel lens in one eye and a hydrogel lens in the other (<b>lens</b> <b>types</b> and eyes were randomly assigned) for one month. Lenses were replaced every two weeks. Contact lens fitting, pre-lens tear film thinning time, vision, corneal integrity and lens deposits were assessed before and every fortnight after delivery of new lenses. A questionnaire {{was used to compare}} the subjective performance of the two <b>lens</b> <b>types.</b> Results: Thirty of the 33 subjects completed the study. There {{were no significant differences in}} lens fitting (centration and movement), pre-lens tear film thinning time, vision or corneal integrity between the two <b>lens</b> <b>types.</b> Statistically, there was no significant difference in lens deposits between the two <b>lens</b> <b>types</b> but silicone hydrogel lenses tended to have more Grade 3 to 4 lipid deposits than hydrogel lenses. Subjects found no significant differences between the two <b>lens</b> <b>types</b> in terms of vision and comfort. Preference for silicone hydrogel lenses increased from 33 at the first after-care visit to 50 per cent at the second after-care visit. Conclusion: This short-term study demonstrates that the performance of silicone hydrogel and hydrogel lenses is comparable but the former tends to build up more lipid deposits than the latter. We did not find better performance in terms of ocular integrity of silicone hydrogel lenses compared to the hydrogel lenses, probably because the subjects were adapted asymptomatic contact lens wearers before commencing the study. Contact lens wearers having hypoxia-related problems are likely to benefit from using silicone hydrogel lenses, as these lenses provide at least three times more oxygen than conventional hydrogel lenses.

40|$|The {{parameters}} of soft contact lenses may alter during wear. A series of clinical and laboratory experiments {{were conducted in}} order to examine the parameter stability of eight soft contact lenses manufactured from different materials. The following materials (and nominal water contents) were used: HEMA/VP 40 %, HEMA/VP 55 %, HEMA/VP 70 %, VP/MMA 55 %, VP/MMA 70 %, HEMA 40 %, HEMA/MAA 55 % and HEMA/MAA 70 % (HEMA: 2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate, VP: vinyl pyrrolidone, MMA: methyl methacrylate, MAA: methacrylic acid). Two lenses from each of the eight soft contact lens groups were used in experiments concerning the parameter stability. Six subjects were fitted with lenses for 1 day. Verification of back optic zone radius, total diameter, back vertex power, centre thickness and water content was undertaken at 20 degrees C. In vitro measurements of water content, oxygen transmissibility, total diameter and back optic zone radius were taken at 35 degrees C before lens fitting and after 6 h of lens wear. Distortion, discolouration and lens quality were assessed before and after lens wear. When the temperature was raised from 20 to 35 degrees C, a significant reduction in lens water content for all the <b>lens</b> <b>types</b> was observed, as well as a significant reduction in total lens diameter {{for the majority of the}} <b>lens</b> <b>types.</b> Water content, oxygen transmissibility, total diameter and back optic zone radius of all the <b>lens</b> <b>types</b> reduced, following a 6 h open eye wearing period.

High water content materials exhibit a low relative change in oxygen transmissibility following a 6 h wear period. Soft contact lens dehydration leads to a decrease in oxygen transmissibility and total diameter, following a 6 h wear period.

Double-meniscus anastigmats use widely separated positive and negative surfaces, generally thick meniscus lenses, to achieve a flat field. The most basic form is two sharply curved meniscus elements located symmetrically about a stop. Further refinement of the form replaces the two simple meniscus lenses with achromats for chromatic correction. The Dagor type further refines these achromats into triplets with the following design parameters: a high-index, doubly convex (DCX) lens cemented to a medium-index, doubly concave (DCV) lens cemented to a low-index meniscus lens. Up to this point, all refinements have maintained symmetry about the stop. The Plasmat further refines the Dagor form by uncementing the meniscus, allowing for placement away from the first two elements and removing the criterion of symmetry.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: Keratoconus is {{characterized}} by bilateral asymmetrical corneal ectasia that leads to inferior stromal thinning and corneal protrusion. There is currently a lack of consensus regarding the most efficacious method for fitting contact lenses in patients with keratoconus, given the various topographical patterns and evolution grades observed in affected populations. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the association between keratoconus evolution grade and topography pattern and the type and design of fitted contact lens. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of contact lenses fitted in a total of 185 patients with keratoconus (325 eyes). Keratoconus was classified as either grade I, II, III, or IV based on keratometry and cone morphology (nipple, oval, globus, or indeterminate) results. Results: A total of 325 eyes were evaluated in the present study. Of the 62 eyes classified as grade I, 66. 1 % were fitted with monocurve contact lenses. Of the 162 eyes classified as grade I and II, 51 %, 30 %, and 19 % were fitted with adapted monocurve rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (RGPCL), bicurve lenses, and others <b>lens</b> <b>types,</b> respectively. Bicurve <b>lenses</b> were fitted in 52. 1 % and 62. 2 % of eyes classified as grade III and IV, respectively. Of the eyes classified as grade III and IV, monocurve and bicurve RGPCL were fitted in 26 % and 55 %, respectively. In eyes with oval keratoconus, 45 %, 35 %, and 20 % were fitted with monocurve lenses, bicurve lenses, and other <b>lens</b> <b>types,</b> respectively. In eyes with round cones (nipple morphology), 55 %, 30 %, and 15 % were fitted with bicurve lenses, monocurve lenses, and other <b>lens</b> <b>types,</b> respectively. Conclusion: Monocurve RGPCL were most frequently fitted in patients with mild to moderate keratoconus and oval cones morphology, while bicurve lenses were more frequently fitted in patients with severe and advanced keratoconus. This was probably because bicurve lenses are more appropriate for round cones due to increased corneal asphericity...|$|R

5000|$|The double Gauss lens {{consists}} of two back-to-back Gauss lenses (a design with a positive meniscus lens on the object side and a negative meniscus lens on the image side) making two positive meniscus lenses on the outside with two negative meniscus lenses inside them.

5000|$|The {{original}} two element Gauss was {{a telescope}} objective lens consisting of closely spaced {{positive and negative}} menisci, invented in 1817 Carl Friedrich Gauss as an improvement to the Fraunhofer telescope objective by adding a meniscus lens to its single convex and concave lens design. Alvan Clark and Bausch & Lomb further refined the design in 1888 by taking two of these lenses and placing them back to back making a [...] "double Gauss" [...] with indifferent photographic results. Current double Gauss lenses {{can be traced back}} to an 1895 improved design, when Paul Rudolph of Carl Zeiss Jena thickened the interior negative menisci and converted to them to cemented doublets of two elements of equal refraction but differing dispersion in the Zeiss Planar of 1896 to correct for chromatic aberration. It was the original six element symmetric f/4.5 Double Gauss lens. Horace William Lee added a slight asymmetry to the Planar in 1920, and created the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Series 0 (also called the Lee Opic, UK) f/2 lens. It was commercially unsuccessful, but its asymmetry is the foundation of the modern Double Gauss, including the Zeiss Biotar. Later the design was developed with additional glasses to give high-performance lenses of wide aperture. The main development was due to Taylor Hobson in the 1920s, resulting in the f/2.0 Opic and later the Speed Panchro designs, which were licensed to various other manufacturers. In 1927, Lee modified the Opic design and increase the maximum aperture up to f/1.4, that is the Ultra Panchro lens. Further improvement was done by Lee in 1930, the Super Speed Panchro. It was a f/1.5 fast design with 7 glasses in 5 groups, which soon became new popular of fast speed <b>lens</b> <b>type</b> and was cited by many lens manufacturers until the 1960s.The Biotar is another competitor of British Panchro series. In the same year of 1927, Zeiss designed Biotar 50mm f/1.4 for cinematography. Its still photography version, Zeiss Biotar 58mm f/2 (Germany) appeared on the Ihagee Kine Exakta (1936, Germany), the first widely available 35mm single-lens reflex cameras, in 1939. It was also the standard lens on the VEB Zeiss Ikon (Dresden) Contax S (1949, East Germany), the first pentaprism eyelevel viewing 35mm SLR. The Biotar, originally designed in 1927, had a six element asymmetric Double Gauss formula. Post-World War II Zeiss (Oberkochen, West Germany) no longer uses the Biotar name; instead lumping any Double Gauss variant under the Planar name. The Soviet 2/58mm standard lens of the Zenit camera was the most common version of the Biotar, making an excellent value-for-money accessory today for any digital camera with APS size sensor.|$|E
