However, if we use automatically detected eye coordinates, {{the performance of the}} algorithms is only slightly worse than for manually annotated markings. This is because the automatic detection of eye coordinates is not always as accurate as manually detected ones. Another explanation is that for the automatically detected markings, it was only possible to estimate the coordinates for <b>local</b> feature <b>extraction</b> based on the location of both eyes. For the manually annotated ones, however, we additionally used the annotated location of the mouth to estimate these locations more precisely. Therefore, the <b>local</b> feature <b>extraction</b> is much more accurate if an exact location of the mouth region is available.|$|R

The two kernel methods are found to perform similarly and significantly better than the linear method.

We derive efficient water management and pricing plans for two of the four aquifer zones in the Central Oahu corridor, taking into account the possibility of inter-district water trade. Efficient management requires not only intertemporal efficiency within zones but also spatial efficiency between zones, where water is transferred from one zone to the next if, without the transfer, the intertemporal efficiency price in the receiving zone is greater than the efficiency price in the source zone plus the cost of transfer.

40|$|Abstract—Source {{extraction}} was traditionally done by sensor arrays. Recently, sensor {{networks have}} been considered as promising candidates for extraction of multiple sources. In a sensor network, each sensor observes an instantaneous linear mixture of the sources and their observations are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. Two sensor network models are adopted. The first one is cluster based, in which a sensor acts as cluster head and performs <b>local</b> <b>extraction</b> of the sources based on its own observation and the received quantized data from the cluster members. Then, the extracted signal is quantized and the quantized data are sent to the sink while the sink performs global extraction of the sources. The other one is cluster free, in which data collected by the sensors are quantized {{and sent to the}} sink directly. Then, the sink performs global extraction of the sources. The proposed schemes are evaluated against the benchmarking case where the sensor observations are undistorted. Index Terms—Blind source extraction, distributed estimation, wireless sensor network.

40|$|Cosmological {{perturbation}} theory {{relies on the}} decomposition of perturbations into so-called scalar, vector and tensor modes. This decomposition is non-local and depends on unknowable boundary conditions. The non-locality is particularly important at second- and higher-order because perturbative modes are sourced by products of lower-oder modes, which must be integrated over all space in order to isolate each mode. However, given a trace-free rank- 2 tensor, a locally defined scalar mode may be trivially derived by taking two divergences, which knocks out the vector and tensor degrees of freedom. A similar local differential operation will return a pure vector mode. This means that scalar and vector degrees of freedom have local descriptions. The corresponding <b>local</b> <b>extraction</b> of the tensor mode is unknown however. We give it here. The operators we define are useful for defining gauge-invariant quantities at second-order. We perform much of our analysis using an index-free `vector-calculus' approach which makes manipulating tensor equations considerably simpler. Comment: 13 pages. Final version to appear in CQ...|$|E

40|$|The {{reflectance}} of pierid butterfly wings is principally {{determined by}} the incoherent scattering of incident light and the absorption by pterin pigments in the scale structures. Coherent scattering causing iridescence is frequently encountered in the dorsal wings or wing tips of male pierids. We investigated {{the effect of the}} pterins on wing reflectance by <b>local</b> <b>extraction</b> of the pigments with aqueous ammonia and simultaneous spectrophotometric measurements. The ultraviolet-absorbing leucopterin was extracted prominently from the white Pieris species, and the violet-absorbing xanthopterin and blue-absorbing erythropterin were mainly derived from the yellow- and orangecolored Coliadinae, but they were also extracted from the dorsal wing tips of many male Pierinae. Absorption spectra deduced from wing reflectance spectra distinctly diverge from the absorption spectra of the extracted pigments, which indicate that when embedded in wing scales the pterins differ from those in solution. The evolution of pierid wing coloration is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

To address this we have developed an algorithm called LREX (for <b>Local</b> Rule <b>EXtraction)</b> which tackles these issues by extracting rules at two levels: hREX extracts rules by examining the hidden unit to class assignments while mREX extracts rules based on the input space to output space mappings. The rules extracted by our algorithm are compared and contrasted against a competing <b>local</b> rule <b>extraction</b> system. The central claim of this paper is that local function networks such as radial basis function (RBF) networks have a suitable architecture based on Gaussian functions that is amenable to rule extraction. ...|$|R

The primary application is for unsupervised image segmentation, and fast, practical methods are sought. The fundamental assumptions and statistical modelling are derived from the phys-ics of electromagnetic scattering from distributed targets. The physical basis directly leads to the image phenomenon called speckle, which is shown to be potentially non-Gaussian and several statistical distributions are investigated. Speckle non-Gaussianity and polarimetry both hold pertinent information about the target medium and methods that utilise both attributes are developed.

For the segmentation purpose, we use an efficient skin segmentation algorithm, to localize a rectangular region containing the ear.

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{sensing system}} for apolar hydrocarbons is presented which is built from a chemically sensitive polymer-clad silica fiber adapted to an optical {{time domain reflectometer}} (OTDR) setup. OTDR measurements allow locating and detecting chemicals by measuring the time delay between short light pulses entering the fiber and discrete changes in the backscatter signals that are caused by <b>local</b> <b>extraction</b> of hydrocarbons into the fiber cladding.

Distributed sensing of pure liquid hydrocarbons (HC) and aqueous HC solutions with a commercially available mini-OTDR adapted to sensing fibers of up to one kilometer length could be demonstrated. A pulsed laser diode emitting at the 850 -nm telecommunication wavelength was applied in the mini-OTDR to locate the HCs by analyzing the step drop (light loss) in the backscatter signal, which is induced by refractive index changes in the silicone cladding due to analyte enrichment.
