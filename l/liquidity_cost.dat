40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the portfolio implications of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> and uncertainty regarding liquidation costs. In many cases, financial securities such as equities trade in active markets in which equity owners can liquidate their holdings quickly and with little price concession. In contrast, real assets, such as commercial property, {{may take a}} substantial amount of time to sell and entail significant transactions costs (the recent experience during the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis indicates that some markets may fail to operate effectively, making estimates of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> extremely uncertain). For this we focus on literature that considers the impact of uncertainty (as opposed to risk) on portfolio choice (Garlappi, Uppal, and Wang, RFS 2007), and extend this to include a measure of liquidity and liquidity risk of asset prices. In particular, our paper examines the optimal relative weight of real estate in a portfolio when both <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> and the uncertainty regarding <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> are considered.

40|$|Following the 2008 global {{financial}} crisis, and {{in common with}} many stock markets around the world, the Amman Securities Exchange (ASE) experienced some heavy losses. However, what makes the Jordanian market probably different is its inability to recover. The weighted price index fell from 7519. 3 points in 2007 to 5520. 1 points in 2009, to 4593. 9 points in 2012, and to 4336. 7 points {{by the end of}} 2013 respectively.

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} a perpetual prepayment option related to a corporate loan. The default intensity of the firm is supposed to follow a CIR process. We assume that the contractual margin of the loan {{is defined by the}} credit quality of the borrower and the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> that reflects the funding cost of the bank. Two frameworks are discussed: firstly a loan margin without <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> and secondly a multiregime framework with a <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> dependent on the regime. The prepayment option needs specific attention as the payoff itself is an implicit function of the parameters of the problem and of the dynamics. In the unique regime case, we establish quasianalytic formulas for the payoff of the option; in both cases we give a verification result that allows for the computation of the price of the option. Numerical results that implement the findings are also presented and are completely consistent with the theory; it is seen that when liquidity parameters are very different (i. e., when a liquidity crisis occurs) in the high <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> regime, the exercise domain may entirely disappear, meaning that it is not optimal for the borrower to prepay during such a liquidity crisis.

40|$|Understanding the {{determinants}} of liquidity costs in agricultural futures markets is hampered by a need to use proxies for the bid-ask spread which are often biased, and by a failure to account for a jointly determined micro-market structure.

40|$|We build a {{model of}} {{short-term}} interbank loans. The variation across different banks in their cost from handling an excess or a deficit of liquidity (‘liquidity cost’) drives the variation in interest rates. We characterize {{the shape of the}} interest rate curve as a function of loan size and find that a small bank that trades with a large bank tends to get better interest rates for larger loans. The model is consistent with the following observations on the Mexican interbank market, obtained from a unique dataset of interbank loan transactions: (i) the variation in the interest rates on the loans between two large banks is small; (ii) small banks lending to (borrowing from) large banks receive lower (pay higher) interest rates than large banks lending to (borrowing from) other large banks; and (iii) a small bank trading with a large bank gets more favorable interest rates for larger loans. Finally, as an application of the model, we discuss how banking environment changes during a financial crisis. In particular, we estimate the shape of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> function and use that information to measure the shift in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> that banks faced during the 2008 financial crisis. We find that the increased disadvantage that small banks experienced in the interbank market during the crisis can largely be explained by a shift in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost,</b> rather than by changes in loan supply and demand. ∗E-mail...|$|E

The returns adjusted for the estimated <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> are either totally or partially free from noise. If the <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> are fully removed, the sum of squared high-frequency returns - which would be inconsistent for return variance when based on observed returns - becomes a consistent variance estimator when based on adjusted returns. This novel estimator achieves the maximum possible rate of convergence. However, if the <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> are only partially removed, the residual noise is smaller and closer to an exogenous white noise than the original noise. Therefore, any volatility estimator that is robust to noise relies on weaker noise assumptions if {{it is based on}} adjusted returns than if it is based on observed returns...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to analyze <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in {{agricultural}} futures markets based on the observed bid-ask spread (BAS) faced by market participants. The results reveal a highly liquid corn market that mostly offers order execution at minimum cost. The BAS responds negatively to volume and positively to price volatility, but also affects volume traded and price volatility. While statistically significant, these responses on a cents/bushel or a percentage basis are generally small. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> are also virtually impervious to short-term changes in demand for spreading and trend-following trader activity, as well as differences from day-of-the-week changes in market activity. Much larger cents/bushel and percentage changes in BAS occur during commodity index trader roll periods and on USDA report release days. The roll period findings indicate a sunshine trading effect, while announcement effects identify the importance of unexpected information and adverse selection on order execution costs.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{efficient}} method for solving dynamic portfolio selection {{problems in the}} presence of transaction cost, <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> and market impact. Our method, based on least-squares Monte Carlo simulation, has no restriction on return dynamics, portfolio constraints, intermediate consumption and investor's objective.

This separation allows for incorporation of any formation of transaction cost, <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> and market impact.

A number of banks, faced with random streams of payment orders, choose whether to link directly to the payment system, or to use a correspondent bank. Settling payments directly on the system imposes <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> which depend on the maximum liquidity overdraft incurred during the day. On the other hand, using a correspondent entails paying a flat fee, charged by the correspondent to recoup <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> and to extract a profit. We specify a protocol whereby one bank in each period can revisit its choice whether to link directly to the system, or to become clients of other banks, thus generating a dynamic client-correspondent network. We simulate this protocol, observing the emergence of different network structures. The liquidity pricing regime chosen by a central bank is found to affect the tiering process and the network structures it produces.
