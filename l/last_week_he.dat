500|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band; Tintari was {{replaced}} by Brandon Barnes shortly thereafter. [...] With their new drummer, Rise Against began to work on The Unraveling at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, where Principe and Wleklinski had previously recorded material for 88 Fingers Louie. Recording took place {{over the course of}} five weeks, with Mass Giorgini serving as the producer, and Wleklinski serving as the assistant engineer. Wleklinski later remarked on the grueling workdays: [...] "12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it right, you have to play it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time.'" [...] Wleklinski also commented that it was difficult to split his time between recording guitar parts and engineering the songs, and that during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> had to sleep on the studio floor.|$|E
500|$|Johnson.....was {{all over}} the Cerro Grande Fire <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> helped reporters {{understand}} where the fire was headed when low-level Forest Service officials couldn't, ran herd over the bureaucratic process of getting {{state and federal agencies}} and the National Guard involved, and even helped put out some of the fire with his feet. On a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday, when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn, he had his driver stop his car. He jumped out and stomped on the flames, as did his wife and some of his staffers. [...] Johnson's leadership during the fire was praised by Democratic Congressman Tom Udall, who said: [...] "I think the real test of leadership is when you have circumstances like this. He's called on his reserves of energy and has just been a really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here." [...] Johnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election, stating himself to be a Republican with no interest in running for president.|$|E
2500|$|In Steve McNair's {{return from}} a {{strained}} neck and concussion <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>he</b> dominated while running for one touchdown and threw for 2. The Baltimore Ravens snapped a 2-game losing streak with this 35–22 win October 29, 2006. The Ravens defense was excellent as well. They had four interceptions, two for touchdowns by Ronnie Prude and Dawan Landry, and a fumble recovery. [...] Bart Scott knocked Reggie Bush {{out of the game}} with an ankle injury in the fourth quarter.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} by Tim Hanson that {{appeared}} in the Spokesman Review article on August 26, 1984 Schuckardt is quoted as saying: [...] "If there is some way I can just let the people know we didn't run away. We were sent away. We were thrown out of our home. If there was anyway we could have stayed there, we would have. They must know that it was made impossible." [...] The article goes on to state that On June 7, 1984 Chicoine filed a lawsuit in Superior court asking that Schuckardt and 10 of his associates be prohibited from returning to the church property at Mount St. Michael's or Schuckardt's mansion at E2314 South Altamont Blvd. As a result of this lawsuit, a document was served at his mansion. The article states: [...] "Schuckardt said <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> thought the document was an eviction notice rather than an order to appear in court. He also believed an arrest warrant had been issued." [...] Bruce Erickson, a Spokane attorney representing Chicoine stated: [...] "There wasn't any warrant out for his arrest. I or the court or the sheriff's department can't force them to read the documents". Schuckardt left the mansion during the second week of June. The article went on [...] "either Schuckardt nor a legal representative appeared in court. The court therefore issued an order banning the bishop from church property." [...] Spokane County sheriff detectives confirmed that no warrant exists for Schuckardt. The court later ruled that Bishop Schuckardt had never been given proper legal notice of the pending action and overturned its original judgment against him and a handful of his followers.|$|E
