In this scenario, the geopolymeric binders, currently widely used {{in the construction industry}} have emerged. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of alumina addition on the mechanical and thermal properties of metakaolin in geopolymer binder. The geopolymers were synthesized from mixtures of metakaolin/alumina and sodium hydroxide, pressed and characterized by diffraction of X-ray and differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric. Two types of alumina were used in different amounts (14 % and 7 %) in order to evaluate the effect of the <b>load</b> <b>binder</b> obtained.

40|$|In this study, the {{potential}} of wet granulation of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) material was evaluated to assess the risk of premature drug release during processing and to improve the bulk powder flow properties and compactibility {{for the development of}} an immediate release oral dosage form. The poorly water soluble model compounds, itraconazole, fenofibrate, naproxen, and ibuprofen were loaded into the model OMS, COK- 12, and granulated using a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) binder solution. Preliminary assessments were made with itraconazole loaded COK- 12 to study the effects of the initial drug <b>load,</b> <b>binder</b> concentration, binder addition rate, and granulation temperature on premature drug release. Comparison to pure COK- 12 revealed particle size enlargement and enhanced powder flow based on Carr Index and Hausner Ratio results. Following compression to 120 MPa, the compactibility of the granulated material also improved when compared to the untreated COK- 12. In vitro release of itraconazole from the compressed granulated material was assessed with and without the disintegrant, croscarmellose sodium. Incorporation of 2. 4 wt. croscarmellose sodium prior to compression successfully recovered the slight release loss following compression. To assess premature drug release, developments made with itraconazole loaded COK- 12 were applied to loaded fenofibrate, naproxen, and ibuprofen. Results from modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) indicated that the risk of premature drug release during wet granulation was primarily compound dependent. These findings highlight challenges in preparation for a successful manufacturing process of OMS based formulations. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After {{gaining a}} huge success in {{applying}} stamping simulations and formability analysis to validate die face developments, GM moves forward to winning total manufacturability in stamping process. Of which, ensuring die structure integrity and minimizing weight {{is one of the}} important initiatives. Stamping die design (or solid modeling of stamping dies) was traditionally conducted by following the die design manuals and standards. For any design changes beyond the standards, however, there are no math-based tools available to die designers to verify the outcome of the changes. Die structural analysis (DSA) provides a math-tool to validate the design changes and quantify the safety factors. Several years ago, GM Manufacturing Engineering – Die Center started die structural analysis to meet the increasing demands of customer needs in various areas: (1) to validate design changes; (2) to identify root cause of die breakage during the tryout and stamping operations and propose repair schemes; (3) to optimize the die design for weight reduction; (4) to improve press throughput via optimizing the scrap chute openings, and (5) to provide a math-based tool to validate revisions to the current die design standards. In the integrated forming and die structural analysis, after successful line die surface developments, the forming <b>loads</b> (<b>binder</b> force, pad force, and forming tonnages) are extracted from forming simulations and applied to solid die members for structural analyses of stress, strains, and deflections. In the past few years, Die Center conducted static, dynamic and fatigue analysis for many dies that covers the die design changes requested by die design, die construction and stamping plants. This paper presents some fundamentals and issues of integrated forming and die structural analysis and illustrates the significant impact of die structural analysis on die design, die construction and production stamping...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the history}} of {{composite}} solid propellant binders new chemicals are introduced as binders to improve upon the previous generation. Sometimes this is done to improve upon the flaws or shortcomings of a previous binder. Other time it is to meet {{a new set of}} requirements desired by industry. Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) is a hydrocarbon monomer being considered for its potential as a new binder in the composite propellant industry. ^ The binder of a composite solid propellant is arguably the most important feature of the propellant. It is the binder that provides the majority of the structural characteristics of the propellant while also contributing itself as fuel to the combustion process. A binder in composite propellants must also be able to accept the introduction of a large quantity of solid filler; oxidizer, fuel, and other energetic and non-energetic particles. Many of the composite propellants used in industry today have over 80 % of their weight composed of non-binder solid or liquid fillers. These requirements must be met by the binder in some form or fashion to produce a propellant able to compete with binders currently in use. ^ When DCPD is polymerized it produces an extremely tough plastic with excellent tensile and impact strength. Experimentation has found that DCPD is able to support a large quantity of solid materials, over 80 % weight of the mixture, while still retaining a great portion of its original strength. When compared to another similarly <b>loaded</b> <b>binder</b> currently used in industry, Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB), it was found that DCPD composite propellant had nearly 1. 5 times the stress capacity while still exhibiting over 75 % of the strain capacity of HTPB based composite propellant. In addition it was also shown that DCPD composite propellant allows for tailoring of its mechanical properties with the addition of plasticizers. The DCPD based composite propellant also exhibits a burning rate nearly twice that HTPB. These factors combine make Dicyclopentadiene based composite propellant a potentially formidable competitor in the composite propellant industry. ...|$|R

A new technology that combines both the preparation and forming of porous materials has been proposed in this paper.

Influencing factors for microstructure and mechanical properties of the parent material and joint interface are identified. Metal injection molding (MIM) technology was used for fabricating porous materials. The feedstock for injection molding of porous titanium powders was prepared from titanium powders and a polymer-based binder system. In addition, the proportion of powder <b>loading</b> and <b>binders</b> was optimized. Through MIM technology, a porous titanium filter cartridge was prepared. For the purpose of investigating the thermal debinding technology of the filter cartridge, effects of the sintering temperature on the porosity, morphology of micropores and mechanical properties were analyzed.

The fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the lowest cost AM process and is capable of producing only thermoplastic components. Powder injection molding (PIM) is a high volume low cost manufacturing technique for producing complex high precision parts from ceramic or metal powders. This research focuses on applying PIM material systems to the FFF process. Enabling the printing of a high powder <b>loaded</b> thermoplastic <b>binder</b> system which is capable of being printed by FFF methods, and be processed and sintered into a metal component. This new 3 d printing process would be much less expensive than current AM of metal materials because of FFF’s low cost and low post processing costs to produce densified parts. To achieve this, the goal was to develop a powder-polymer feedstock that could be made into FFF filament, 3 D printed, solvent debound, thermally debound, and sintered. Materials for developing the feedstock were selecting from existing FFF and PIM polymers and powders. The developed feedstock was varied to improve ease of printing. The feedstocks were then tested to determine their ability to perform the intended processing steps. The results from experimentation showed FFF printing of materials with a high powder loading of 54. 9 vol% was possible, and the printed parts can be solvent and thermally debound.

Polymeric materials are often employed as binder to bond catalyst particles and also provide ionic conduction [5]. Nafion material is also used as electrode binder which facilitates ionic conduction that provides mechanical support for catalyst particles and enhances dispersion of catalyst particles in the catalyst layer. Nafion possesses many desirable properties as a polymer electrolyte, {{and yet it is}} very expensive and loses ionic conductivity if not sufficiently hydrated [5]. The chitosan binder exhibited better performance than a Nafion binder especially at elevated cell temperatures, ascribed to the hydrophilic nature and water retention characteristics of chitosan.

High energy density {{is one of the}} most important advantages for LIB, however, improvements toward performance measures, such as energy density, power and rate capability, cycling life, safety and cost, need to meet the different requirements for various applications. It is well known that battery performance is highly dependent on the type of electrode material that is employed. Currently most LIBs are predominantly fabricated using graphite as an anode material. Therefore, finding a qualified candidate of anode material to replace graphite is the key to achieve a higher energy density of LIB.

40|$|AbstractThe {{capture and}} {{purification}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) from flue or fuel gas underlies the cost efficiency of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) applications in the power and industrial sectors and there is considerable scope for cost reduction with the development of novel capture technologies. High-temperature sorbents are seen as a “next-generation” technology and a promising candidate is calcium oxide (CaO) derived from natural limestone, which is used in a process known as carbonate looping. This process exploits the reversible reaction between CaO and CO 2 to form calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Unfortunately, sorbent derived from natural limestone loses its capacity to capture CO 2 through long-term cycling, and a large amount of fresh limestone is required to maintain an acceptable CO 2 capture efficiency. This work describes the development and characterisation of synthetic CaO-based sorbents, such as those incorporating a mixed calcium-aluminium oxide binder—in this case produced by precipitation in a slurry bubble column. Reactivity tests using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) demonstrate the improved long-term CO 2 uptake of the synthetic sorbent. The highest CO 2 uptake observed after 30 cycles was achieved with 85  wt. % CaO and binder, which was three times higher than the observed capacity of a natural limestone (Havelock). However, contrary to TGA results, experimental results for reactivity tests conducted using a bench-scale fluidised bed reactor (FBR) showed the highest uptake for the precipitated sorbent with no binder. A decrease in uptake was observed corresponding an increase in <b>binder</b> <b>loading</b> from 0 – 25 wt. %, which was coupled with an increase in mass loss owing to elutriation, attributed to decrepitation during cycling...|$|R

The first part of this study focused on estimating lives of deficient Superpave pavements incorporating nonconforming Superpave mixtures. These criteria were based on the Hamburg Wheel-Tracking Device (HWTD) test results and analysis. The second part of this study focused on developing accelerated mix testing models to considerably reduce test duration. To accomplish the first objective, nine fine-graded Superpave mixes of 12. 5 -mm nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS) with asphalt grade PG 64 - 22 from six administrative districts of KDOT were selected. Specimens were prepared at three different target air void levels @ N[subscript]design gyrations and four target simulated in-place density levels with the Superpave gyratory compactor. Average number of wheel passes to 20 -mm rut depth, creep slope, stripping slope, and stripping inflection point in HWTD tests were recorded and then used in the statistical analysis. Results showed that, in general, higher simulated in-place density up to a certain limit of 91 % to 93 %, results in a higher number of wheel passes until 20 -mm rut depth in HWTD tests. A Superpave mixture with very low air voids @ N[subscript]design (2 %) level performed very poorly in the HWTD test. HWTD tests were also performed on six 12. 5 -mm NMAS mixtures with air voids @ N[subscript]design of 4 % for six projects, simulated in-place density of 93 %, two temperature levels and five <b>load</b> levels with <b>binder</b> grades of PG 64 - 22, PG 64 - 28, and PG 70 - 22.

HWTD test results indicated as expected. Statistical analysis was performed and accelerated mix testing models were developed to determine the effect of increased temperature and load on the duration of the HWTD test. Good consistency between predicted and observed test results was obtained when higher temperature and standard load level were used.

40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} in {{asphalt concrete}} (AC) is of immense importance to pavement design and analysis {{because it is}} one of the most important forms of distress that can lead to structural failure in pavement. Once started, these types of cracks can be combined with other environmental factors leading to detrimental effects such as faster rates of pavement deterioration and shortened pavement life and functionality. Currently AASHTO TP 101, also known as linear amplitude sweep (LAS) specification, is being widely used to evaluate the ability of an asphalt binder to resist fatigue. The LAS method, although mechanistic in its approach, has certain drawbacks. First, the test is performed on an aged 2 -mm thick binder sample, which in reality may never exist in the AC where there is a varying non-uniform thickness of the binder across the components of the AC. Secondly, the test methodology predicts an increased fatigue resistance at lower strain levels of <b>load</b> when the <b>binder</b> ages. This is in contrast to the general belief among researchers that aging is one of the primary contributors to the acceleration of pavement cracking. This study aims to evaluate fatigue resistance in a more realistic approach that is more likely to exist in AC by incorporating sand asphalt mixtures. First, the linear viscoelastic properties of binder and sand asphalt mixture samples were evaluated to obtain the material properties under the influence of aging. Later, the fatigue tests on the sand asphalt mixture were investigated to understand the influence of a thin film of binder on the fatigue resistance. It was observed that based energy dissipation criterion for the binder evaluated a reasonable estimate for fatigue damage at relatively lower temperatures, but was limited to capture the influence of aging. Moreover, it was observed that fatigue testing on a binder at an intermediate temperature of 25 °C could cause edge effects to dominate as seen in the plateau regime for the phase angle in the time sweep tests. In order to overcome the edge effects in the binder LAS tests, the sand asphalt mixture testing was used for analyzing the binder fatigue resistance. Sand asphalt mixture testing could capture the microcracking and macrocracking phases more distinctively when compared to binder testing. In the case of pressure aging vessel (PAV) aged samples, it was observed that the macrocracking phase disappeared and was replaced by sudden changes in the material properties, indicating that the PAV aged mixture was more susceptible to fatigue cracking. By using the simplified viscoelastic continuum damage approach, the fatigue resistance of the binder and sand asphalt mixture was evaluated. The sand asphalt mixture testing was better to capture the influence of aging and changes in the microstructure during fatigue in comparison to binder fatigue tests. Advisor: Yong-Rak Ki...|$|R
