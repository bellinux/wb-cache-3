40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{activity}} of lipase in fermented Africa <b>locust</b> <b>bean,</b> Castor <b>seed,</b> and Africa oil bean was determined. The peak lipase activity for fermented Africa <b>locust</b> <b>bean,</b> Castor <b>seed,</b> and African oil bean were 13. 3 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec, 7. 2 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec and 10. 6 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec at day 5, 4 and 4 respectively. The optimum temperature and pH were 300 C and 7. 0 respectively {{for all the}} fermented seeds above. Increasing NaCl concentration decreases the {{activity of}} Lipase indicating that NaCl is an inhibitor of lipase. The effect of substrate concentration on lipase activity in the fermenting oil seeds shows the normal Michaelis-Menten curve. The Km for African <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> is 0. 065664 mM, Castor seed is 0. 067625 mM, and African oil bean is 0. 075848 mM.

40|$|African {{locust bean}} (Parkia biglobosa) seed {{is rich in}} protein and has {{recently}} {{found its way into}} the feed industry. This research was conducted to determine the growth performance, haematological profile and nutrient digestibility by broiler chickens fed diets containing soaked and fermented African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa) seed meal (SFALBSM). Five diets were formulated in which SFALSBM was included at graded levels of 0, 7. 5, 15, 22. 5 and 30 % designated as T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5 respectively. Two hundred and twenty five (225) day old broiler chickens (Marshall Strain) were fed these diets in a completely randomized design and each treatment was replicated three times with 15 birds per replicate. The experiment lasted 8 weeks (4 week starter phase and 4 week finisher phase). The results of performance of broiler chicks at starter phase showed there were differences (P 0. 05) on digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and ash. The crude fibre, ether extract and nitrogen free extract digestibility were affected by treatments (P< 0. 05). Birds fed T 3 had highest crude fibre digestibility value (P< 0. 05). It was concluded that soaked and fermented African <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>seed</b> meal can be included in broiler chickens diets up to 15 % dietary level at the starter phase and 22. 5 % at the finisher phase without any adverse effect on performance, haematological profile and nutrient digestibility...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAfrican {{locust bean}} (Parkia biglobosa), {{fermented}} into “iru” or “dadawa” is a nutritious condiment featured {{frequently in the}} diet of people of Nigeria and other West African countries. Many consumers benefit from the nutrients, and enjoy the aroma of fermented <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>seed</b> in their foods. However, some dislike seeing the locust beans and would pick {{them out of their}} meals depriving themselves of the nutrients. The availability of iru as fermented, ground and shelf stable bouillon cube may increase the acceptability of this condiment. The objective was to develop a shelf stable iru bouillon with starches as binders. Fermented, dried and ground locust bean with binders were prepared in the ratio of 40 : 10 and 30 : 20 locust bean:binder and cubed. Microbial and proximate analyses of the cubes were carried out. Bacillus spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. were isolated following bouillon cube production. Cassava starch bouillons had the highest moisture content (24. 5 % and 29. 3 %). Bouillons with corn starch had the highest amount of fat (22. 0 %), followed by cassava starch (19. 6 %), while bouillon cubes with potato binder had the highest crude protein content (33. 9 %). Iru without binders had the lowest moisture (11. 5 %) and ash (1. 7 %), the highest crude fat (30. 0 %) and the highest crude protein (46. 3 %) contents. Only Bacillus subtilis was isolated from all the samples after 9 months of storage, indicating that shelf stable iru bouillon cubes is possible, without chemical preservatives. Conclusively, iru bouillon cubes with binders improved the shelf life from few days to over nine months without compromising the safety of the product...|$|E

These colloids are also of value for clinical nutrition. The last opinion could be confirmed by the chemical analysis which revealed that locust bean seeds had higher total phenolic compounds (485. 28 mg/ 100 g) while psyllium seeds (297. 54 mg/ 100 g) and orange peel albedo (246. 11 mg/ 100 g) showed nearly the same level. Major phenolic compound was pyrogallol for locust bean, being cholchecein for other two colloids sources. Total flavonoid compounds were higher for psyllium seeds (536. 46 mg/ 100 g) and <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>seed</b> (275. 76 mg/ 100 g), being less for orange peel albedo (113. 65 mg/ 100 g); major flavonoid in all sources was the hesperidin. The best eating qualities recoded for psyllium sausage followed by locust bean sausage. Generally, all three colloids sources improved the eating quality of beef sausage. Plasticity confirmed the results of sensory evaluation where the best sample was that of psyllium sausage. Higher pH value after 6 months storage at- 18 ºC was in line with the best Water Holding Capacity (WHC) and plasticity levels recorded for psyllium sausage. Color intensity and TBA value were best for locust been followed by psyllium treatments. The lowest color intensity was in line with the highest TBA value. The keeping quality was better when adding the tested colloids; TVN, TBA value, Total Bacterial Count (TBC), Yeast and Mold (Y and M) count was lowest for psyllium followed by locust bean treatment. Other colloids showed the same trend but at lower degree...|$|E

30|$|Previous {{workers have}} {{observed}} that rural households in Nigeria derived up to 80 % of their incomes from the sales of NTFPs (Jimoh et al. 2013). In addition, Ogunsawa and Ajala (2002) and Zaku et al. (2013) reported that over 70 % of the country’s households depend directly on fuelwood as their main sources of energy, with daily consumption estimated at 27.5 million kg/day. Thus, harvesting and processing of NTFPs in many areas in the country have shifted from subsistence exploitation and sales at the local markets to international cross-boundary trade. For example, in the high forest zones of Eastern and Western Nigeria, harvesting of game meat and snails for sales are now major income generating activities almost all year round (Onuche 2011). While in the Savannah zone of Central and Northern Nigeria, honey, fuelwood, <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>seeds,</b> gum arabic, and charcoal production generate lots of incomes for the rural households (Jimoh and Haruna 2007; Jimoh et al. 2013). Similar contributions of NTFPs to rural wellbeing {{have been reported in}} other African countries including Kenya and Tanzania (Campbell 1991; Schaafsma et al. 2014 and Mbuvi and Boon 2009).|$|R

The analyses consisted of determination of the aerobic, anaerobic mesophilic bacterial, staphylococcal and fungal counts. In addition, detection of E. coli 0157 : H 7, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens on the raw seeds before processing and the processed daddawa were also carried out.

The dehuller principally consists of two concentric cylinders, a power transmission shaft and a prime mover. The space between the two cylinders constitutes the dehulling chamber. After design and construction, the dehuller was evaluated based on three parameters, namely moisture content of beans, length of the dehulling head and the speed of rotation of the inner cylinder. Tests showed that efficiency of the machine increased linearly with increases in all the three parameters. The throughput of the dehuller decreased with increases in moisture content and length of dehulling head, but increased with increase in dehulling speed. The maximum values of dehulling efficiency and throughput obtained were 70. 3 % and 0. 51 kg/min. respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Seasoning salts {{have now}} {{replaced}} local condiments {{in the kitchen}} of virtually every Nigerian home thus prompting this comparative study on mineral availability from Nigerian vegetables. The iron content of both seasoning salts (Maggi and A-one) was higher than that in the vegetables. Fermentation decreased the iron content of African <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> while that of melon seed was unaffected. The availability of iron was generally high (21 - 35 %) while Maggi, iru and ogiri enhanced iron availability in Amaranthus composite diets but iron availability from Corchorus composite diets was inhibited. Tannin content in both vegetables was similar but phytate in Corchorus was 300 % greater than in Amaranthus. Fermentation reduced the level of magnesium by 50 % in <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> but increased that of melon seed. The seasoning salts enhanced magnesium availability in Corchorus vegetable and was inhibited by <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> and melon <b>seed.</b> Fermentation improved magnesium availability in condiment-Corchorus composite diets. Copper content was high in the plant foods, low but with high availability in the seasoning salts. Fermentation reduced the copper availability in <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> but increased that of melon seed. Availability of copper was virtually inhibited in all the composite diets. Zinc content of iru and ogiri was 250 % greater than the level in seasoning salts and the vegetables.

This study focuses on the determination of specific heat of some staple crops at different moisture contents and temperatures, using the method of mixtures. The crops included maize, rice, millet, sorghum, groundnut, cowpea, <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> and sesame <b>seed.</b> The temperature levels were 50 oC, 60 oC, 70 oC and 80 oC, while the four moisture levels employed ranged from 1. 96 - 15. 89 % (maize), 2. 79 - 13. 58 % (rice), 2. 27 - 23. 55 % (millet), 2. 89 - 25. 42 % (sorghum), 1. 57 - 29. 02 % (groundnut), 2. 38 %- 30. 70 % (cowpea), 1. 80 %- 12. 20 % (<b>locust</b> <b>bean)</b> and 2. 37 - 21. 5 % (sesame). Results showed that the specific heat varied with grain and increased with increase in moisture content but decreased with respect to temperature increase.

40|$|Suboptimal mineral {{nutrition}} may be {{prevalent in}} Africa; however, research {{is limited by}} the absence of reliable data on the mineral, dietary fiber and phytate content of local foods. For this reason, 75 Ghanaian foods and 3 Malawian cereal flours were analyzed for Zn, Ca, Cu, and Mn by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) was analyzed by the Englyst method, and phytic acid was analyzed using ion-exchange procedures; some foods were analyzed using the HPLC method. On a fresh weight basis (mg/ 100 g FW), legumes and animal products had the highest mineral content ranging from 1. 2 to 8. 5 (Zn), 49 to 4638 (Ca), 0. 15 to 1. 49 (Cu) and 0. 06 to 2. 67 (Mn), for animal products; and from 0. 4 to 6. 0 (Zn), 10 to 442 (Ca), 0. 08 to 1. 47 (Cu), and 0. 28 to 14. 12 (Mn) for legumes. In contrast, cereals had the lowest Ca and Cu content, ranging from 1. 3 to 16 and from 0. 01 to 0. 19 (mg/ 100 g FW), respectively; roots, tubers, plantain, and vegetables had the lowest Zn content (0. 1 - 0. 9 mg/ 100 g FW). The NSP content of groundnuts and bean cakes (mg/ 100 g FW), and the phytate content of cereals and legumes (g/ 100 g FW) were higher than those of other plant foods (for NSP, 5. 8 - 6. 3 vs 0. 2 - 4. 6 for other plant foods; and for phytate, 66 - 279 for cereals; and 118 - 339 for legumes vs 0 - 118 for other plant foods). For cereal flours, over 90 % of the inositol phosphates were inositol hexa- and pentaphosphates, compared to less than 65 % in the fermented cereal products. The molar ratios of phytate:Zn (P:Z) of the cereal staples and most of the starchy staples were similar despite the higher phytate content of the former (8 : 34; for cereals vs 4 : 24 for cassava products and yams). Hence, decreasing the proportion of cereals to starchy staples would probably not improve the bioavailability of Zn. However, the addition of groundnuts, fermented <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>seeds</b> (dawadawa), or fermented kapok seeds (kangtong) to soups and stews, and the use of small fish would increase the mineral content of these dishes. © 1993 Academic Press.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the clinical appearance of gastric dilatation in pet rabbits in terms of acute symptoms, the results of laboratory and radiographical examinations, as well as the therapies and process of gastric dilatation. In the present study, all animals with the diagnosis “gastric dilatation” based on radiographic markers (extended stomach filled with fluid and gas) were included. Over a period of six years (2009 - 2015), 155 consecutive patients were taken under evaluation in this retro- and prospective trial. The rabbits (86 males, therefrom 61 neutered and 69 females, therefrom 24 neutered) had a median age of 3 years with a range from 0. 25 to 11 years. Identified clinical symptoms at first presentation were anorexia (85 %), depression (41 %), abdominal pain (15 %) and absent defecation (12 %). Specific symptoms like diarrhea was determined only in 5 % of the animals. A cohort of 50 clinically healthy rabbits was used as a reference group in radiographical examination. Rabbits with gastric dilatation revealed a significantly more extended stomach of two lumbar vertebrae on the radiographs (p = 0. 001). Significant differences in mortality rate were linked to the quantity of gas in the stomach (p = 0. 001) and ventral or central position of the gas (p = 0. 023). Even so, the mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with gastric extension over the second lumbar vertebra (p = 0. 01). The most frequent biochemical changes in rabbits with gastric dilatation were azotemia (n = 37 / 72), hyperglycemia (n = 28 / 75) and hyponatremia (n = 27 / 63). The mortality rate of rabbits with a glucose concentration above 25 mmol/l was 70 %, with azotemia 43 % and with hyponatremia 36 %. In 15 animals, of which 47 % died, a combination of hyponatremia and hyperglycemia was observed. In 13 rabbits the hematocrit increased to a maximum of 57 %. All the rest hematologic and serum biochmestry values only had little aberrancies. 144 patients underwent conservative therapy, while eight patients underwent surgery after 24 hours without clinical improvement. Three patients died before treatment started. Overall, 105 animals survived and 50 animals died or were euthanized. The cause of gastric dilatation was determined during surgery or necropsy. Obstruction of the small intestine was caused by small pellets of compressed hair (n = 12), <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>seeds</b> (n = 5), intestinal wall strictures (n = 4) or paralytic ileus of the whole intestine (n = 3) and one case of constriction of the small intestine in the caudal abdomen was determine...|$|R

40|$|The ultrasrructure of gels {{formed from}} agar, kappa carrageenan, iota carrageenan, <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum and {{mixtures}} of kappa carrageenan and <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum {{have been studied}} by fast-freeze deep-etch rotary-shadowed replica microscopy. The reproducibility of images obtained suggests that the technique is robust and preserves features of native network architecture at the nanometre level. Agar gels show a range of strand thicknesses, whereas kappa carrageenan has a more homogeneous structure. Iota carrageenan network strands are thinner than those in kappa carrageenan, but thicker than those in <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum gels. Mixed gels of kappa carrageenan and <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum indicate thorough mixing and, therefore, no phase separation at the 10 - 100 nm level. Apparent binary polymer contacts are consistent with, but do not prove unequivocally, the presence of inter-polymer associations...|$|R

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} behaviour of biopolymer mixtures showing synergism {{was investigated}} under different physicochemical conditions using small deformation oscillatory measurements. In addition, the rheological properties of binary polysaccharide mixtures {{were related to}} the microstructure as observed using transmission electron microscopy. Viscoelastic measurements showed that addition of <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum to xanthan or. kappa. -carrageenan strongly influences the viscoelastic properties of the mixture. The effect of <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum on the viscoelastic properties of the mixture was dependent on the degree of side-chain substitution of the galactomannan, ionic environment, temperature and the composition of the mixture. <b>Locust</b> <b>bean</b> gums, with mannose to galactose ratios of ~ 3 (lbg 3) and ~ 5 (lbg 5), have been evaluated. For the mixture of xanthan-locust bean gum, viscoelastic measurements showed that, when the polymers were mixed at room temperature, a gel is formed. Heat treatment of the mixture led to an increase in G' for mixtures containing lbg 5. Addition of salt decreased the synergism between xanthan and <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum. <b>Locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum did not influence the supermolecular structure of xanthan. The synergism observed for mixtures of. kappa. -carrageenan-locust bean gum showed a dependence on the ionic environment. The greatest increase in G' was observed under conditions promoting extensive self-association of. kappa. -carrageenan, that is in the presence of K +. Under ionic conditions (Na + or Ca 2 +), where the tendency for. kappa. -carrageenan to self-associate is low, the synergistic effect of <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum was reduced. <b>Locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum influenced the supermolecular structure of. kappa. -carrageenan by hindering extensive self-association of the. kappa. -carrageenan...|$|R
