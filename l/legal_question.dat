25|$|The legal {{memorandum}} is {{the most}} common type of predictive legal analysis; it may include the client letter or legal opinion. The legal memorandum predicts the outcome of a <b>legal</b> <b>question</b> by analyzing the authorities governing the question and the relevant facts that gave rise to the <b>legal</b> <b>question.</b> It explains and applies the authorities in predicting an outcome, and ends with advice and recommendations. The legal memorandum also serves as record of the research done for a given <b>legal</b> <b>question.</b> Traditionally, and to meet the legal reader's expectations, it is formally organized and written.|$|E

25|$|Of course, we may {{expect to}} hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a <b>legal</b> <b>question,</b> but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In its decision, {{the court}} first {{established}} the <b>legal</b> <b>question</b> {{with the use}} of precedents. It first stated that “Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity”. The purpose of this statement was to make the presence of the inherent conflict between the Government’s efforts and the First Amendment clear. The decision then stated that the government “thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint”. This reinforced the idea that it was the Nixon Administration's responsibility to show sufficient evidence that the newspapers’ actions would cause a “grave and irreparable” danger.|$|E
25|$|Ijtihad (lit. effort, {{physical}} or mental, expended {{in a particular}} activity) is an Islamic legal term referring to independent reasoning or the thorough exertion of a jurist's mental faculty in finding a solution to a <b>legal</b> <b>question.</b> It is contrasted with taqlid (imitation, conformity to legal precedent). According to classical Sunni theory, ijtihad requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, revealed texts, and principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh), and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts (Qur'an and hadith) are considered unambiguous {{with regard to the}} question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (ijma). Ijtihad {{is considered to be a}} religious duty for those qualified to perform it. An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform ijtihad is called a mujtahid.|$|E

25|$|Almost all {{civil work}} is {{dealt with by}} either the High Court or County Courts. Prior to the Act, there was a simple {{financial}} boundary to decide which cases would go to which court—any contract or tort case valued at less than £5,000 {{would go to the}} County Courts, while any case valued at more than that would go straight to the High Court. Section 1 of the Act allows the Lord Chancellor to change the financial boundaries after consultation with senior judges such as the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, and also allows the Lord Chancellor to create categories based on things other than the financial value of the case, such as the complexity involved or the importance of any <b>legal</b> <b>question</b> likely to be raised. An exception to this rule is that the Lord Chancellor cannot ask a County Court to hear any case of judicial review.|$|E
25|$|Ashkenazi forestalled the magisterial {{action by}} resigning {{his office and}} fleeing, in the {{beginning}} of 1714, from Amsterdam, perhaps secretly, with the aid of his friend Solomon Levi Norden de Lima. After leaving his wife and children at Emden, he proceeded to London at the invitation of the Sephardic congregation of that city. In 1705 he was invited to pronounce a judicial decision concerning the orthodoxy of the rabbi David Nieto, who, in a certain sermon, had given utterance to allegedly Spinozistic views. In London Ashkenazi found many friends, and received many tributes of regard. Even before this he had been invited to take the rabbinate of the Sephardic congregation, but refused. It seems that his portrait in oil was painted here, after he had refused, on account of religious scruples, to have his bust stamped on a coin. In the following spring he returned to Emden, and proceeded thence to Poland by way of Hanover, Halberstadt, Berlin, and Breslau, stopping at each place for some time. After spending two years in Staszów, Poland, he was called to Hamburg to serve as member of a judicial body convened to settle a complicated <b>legal</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E

500|$|Lord Mansfield's name is {{frequently}} mentioned in modern legal settings as the originator of [...] "Lord Mansfield's Rule", {{in his own}} words: [...] "...the law of England is clear, that the declarations of a father or mother, cannot be admitted to bastardize the issue born after marriage." [...] This quote comes from Mansfield's appellate decision in [...] The primary <b>legal</b> <b>question</b> in the case was not this preexisting principle, which applies only to children [...] "born after marriage", but rather whether the child had been born before the marriage. The question was whether statements the child's parents allegedly made before their deaths could be introduced {{as evidence that the}} child had been born before their marriage and was thus illegitimate. Mansfield ruled to admit the testimony against the child's legitimacy and grant a new trial. The term [...] "Lord Mansfield's Rule" [...] is often used in a slightly different sense to denote the principle still applied in several jurisdictions that marriage creates a conclusive presumption of a husband's paternity of his wife's child.|$|E
500|$|Bakke {{complained to}} Dr. George Lowrey, {{chairman}} of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. [...] At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. [...] If he was not accepted the second time, “he could then research the <b>legal</b> <b>question.</b> [...] He {{had been a good}} candidate. [...] I thought he’d be accepted and that would end the matter.” [...] Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, “I don’t think Storandt meant to injure the university. [...] It’s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.” [...] Storandt stated, “I simply gave Allan the response you’d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. [...] I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn’t know this would be the case.” Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the Bakke case, Storandt was fired.|$|E

40|$|In {{patent law}} {{most of the}} crucial <b>legal</b> <b>questions</b> such as {{patentability}} and infringement {{are linked to the}} patent claims. The European Patent Office regards patent claims as a set of independent features which are examined separately in a more or less formal way. The author has found that this approach allows for developing a simple logic model which treats patent claim features as logical statements and patent claims as compound statements wherein the individual logical statements are connected by logical connectives. The proposed logic model provides a uniform system for examining various <b>legal</b> <b>questions</b> that are dealt with separately under current case-law, moreover, it allows for examining the logical coherence between the different case-law decisions as well as detecting any hidden logical inconsistencies. The present paper offers an overview of the different <b>legal</b> <b>questions</b> linked to the patent claim and demonstrates the practical application of the proposed model...|$|R
