5|$|In 1968 a new {{committee}} was formed, {{under which the}} club emerged from the doldrums. Manager Paul Ogden took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships, followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles. After the second Manchester League win, Leek joined the Cheshire County League, where they were league champions at the second attempt in the 1974–75 season, but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of Northwich Victoria a series of managers came and went in quick succession {{without being able to}} maintain this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 14 October, {{following}} his exclusion from {{the starting lineup}} of a match against Toronto FC by manager Mauro Biello, Drogba refused {{to play for the}} team that night, removing his name from the squad. With both his fitness, due to a lingering back injury, and his role in the team in question, Drogba did not travel with the team to, although he was in attendance at, their first postseason match at D.C. United, a 4–2 victory on 27 October. Drogba did not nearly experience the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in his second regular season compared to the first, scoring only 10 goals while appearing in only 22 games.|$|E

Nevertheless, they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties, thereby tying down the Soviet forces there.

5|$|While the {{movement}} had its greatest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in Sweden, {{there were a}} number of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Bentsen, with the assistance of Thorkild Henningsen, designed Denmark's first terraced houses in the Bellahøj district of Copenhagen. Very appropriately Klint, working with Bentsen, adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Carl Petersen's main achievement was the Faaborg Museum built for collections of art from Funen. Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for his town planning activities and for his contributions to the Dansk Byplanlaboratorium (Danish town planning laboratory).|$|E
5|$|A notable machinima {{production}} is the comedy series Red vs. Blue created by Rooster Teeth Productions. It has achieved an unparalleled <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in Halo machinima in specific, and machinima in general; it {{is credited with}} bringing attention to the genre. Red vs. Blue generated annual revenues of US$200,000, and special promotional episodes were commissioned by Bungie. The first series, The Blood Gulch Chronicles, ended on June 28, 2007, after 100 regular episodes and numerous promotional videos. Subsequent series include The Recollection, which contains more dramatic elements than its comedic predecessor, Project Freelancer, The Chorus Trilogy, and Anthology, the most recent series. Other machinima series include Fire Team Charlie, The Codex, and the in-game interview show This Spartan Life.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with their}} better-known brothers, Mick and Ray played {{first-class}} cricket for Victoria, although the former moved to Queensland after one season for his native state {{due to a}} lack of opportunities. Neither approached the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> of Neil or Merv and often found themselves dropped, although Ray was a consistent player for Victoria for two seasons in the 1950s and came close to national selection. Mick's daughter, Pauline Harvey-Short, represented Australia in softball and her daughter, Kirby Short, plays for the Queensland women's cricket team. After his playing career ended, Mick became a Test cricket umpire, officiating in two matches. The two other brothers, Brian and Harold, played for Fitzroy in district cricket. Apart from Harold, all of the brothers represented Victoria at baseball.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to discover the role of imagery in a Kickstarter campaign’s success. The study investigated thirty Kickstarter projects that had varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>success.</b> The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> included: very successful, successful, and unsuccessful. Ultimately, the data collected indicated that projects with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> graphic imagery had achieved higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> funding <b>success.</b> The knowledge and insight gained from this research will be useful during the creation of the Kickstarter campaign for PicoBrew’s KegSmart. PicoBrew is an up and coming business in pursuit of financial support for the development and sale of their new product, the KegSmart. Analysis of the attributes that contribute to funding success may prove helpful during the content creation and design phases of the Kickstarter page...|$|R
5|$|As the new line-up (with Wright) toured {{throughout}} North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was, on occasion, close by. The bassist had forbidden any {{members of}} Pink Floyd from attending his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances. Waters also issued a writ for copyright {{fees for the}} band's use of the flying pig, and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters gave up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on Astoria. Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, among other things, rights to The Wall. However, Waters claimed {{that they would never}} have the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> that they had during his tenure again.|$|E
5|$|Formed in 1903 as {{a result}} of the {{amalgamation}} of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the two European trophies. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, though a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup.|$|E
5|$|Several {{video game}} sequels were {{released}} over the years, {{but did not}} reach the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> as the original. The first, titled Q*bert's Qubes, shows a copyright for 1983 on its title screen, whereas the instruction manual cites a 1984 copyright. It was manufactured by Mylstar Electronics, and uses the same hardware as the original. The game features Q*bert, but introduces new enemies: Meltniks, Shoobops, and Rat-A-Tat-Tat. The player navigates the protagonist around a plane of cubes while avoiding enemies. Jumping on a cube causes it to rotate, changing {{the color of the}} visible sides of the cube. The goal is to match a line of cubes to a target sample; later levels require multiple rows to match. Despite the popularity of the franchise, the game's release was hardly noticed. Parker Brothers showcased home versions of Q*bert's Qubes at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1985. Q*bert's Qubes was ported to the Colecovision and Atari 2600.|$|E

5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left {{a job at a}} bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In, {{located on}} Commissary Lane across from Star Tours and {{adjacent}} to ABC Commissary, opened on April 20, 1991 {{as one of}} the twenty new attractions opened at Walt Disney World to mark the complex's twentieth anniversary. The restaurant was created with a strong emphasis on theme, in emulation of the 50's Prime Time Café, which had opened two years prior. Disney hoped that the focus on theme would bring the Sci-Fi Dine-In the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> that had been garnered by the 50's Prime Time Café. Within five weeks of opening, it was serving between 1,500 and 2,000 meals on a daily basis, just as the 50's Prime Time Café was doing. A year after opening, the Sci-Fi Dine-In had become the most popular restaurant in the park, serving more than 2,200 people per day at peak periods. Starting from its earliest days, the restaurant equipped its servers with point of sale mobile devices that relayed orders to a printer in the kitchen, which was considered at the time to be in keeping with the science fiction theme because the technology had been developed shortly prior.|$|E
