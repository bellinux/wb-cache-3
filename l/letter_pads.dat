It {{is used by}} many local governments {{such as those of}} Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City, Bhaktapur Municipality, Thimi Municipality, Kirtipur Municipality, Banepa Municipality, in signboards, <b>letter</b> <b>pads,</b> and such. Regular programs are held in the Kathmandu Valley to promote the script and training classes are held to preserve the language. The script is being endorsed by the Nepal Bhasa movement and is used for headings in newspapers and websites.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1998, San-X {{launched}} Tarepanda erasers and <b>letter</b> <b>pads,</b> {{which proved}} enormous hits. San-X believed these products were successful {{because they were}} released shortly after the Asian financial crisis of autumn 1997, {{a time when many}} people in Japan were facing layoffs and, consequently, were sympathetic toward a [...] "worn-out" [...] panda character. By 1999, sales of Tarepanda goods had reached 30 billion yen. Character Databank, a Japanese character popularity monitoring firm, has claimed Tarepanda was a huge hit in Japan. It was rated {{one of the most popular}} characters in Japan for its cuteness.|$|E
40|$|In India same drug {{molecules}} {{are sold}} under different brand names by different pharmaceuticals. To persuade the physicians to prescribe their brands pharmaceuticals engage in marketing techniques like giving samples, gifts, sponsoring travel etc. Many countries {{are striving to}} reduce the impact of incentives on prescription behaviour. This study explores the influence of pharmaceutical marketing on the prescription practices of doctors in India. There were 103 study subjects - 50 doctors and 53 sales personnel. Data collection was done by a self administered questionnaire. Data were collected on 36 variables which were supposed to influence prescription. The effectiveness of the promotional strategies on prescription behaviour was marked in a seven point Likert scale ranging from 2 ̆ 2 not at all effective 2 ̆ 2 (score= 1) to 2 ̆ 2 extremely effective 2 ̆ 2 (score= 7). Open ended questions were used to collect qualitative data. Good rapport with the doctor, launch meetings, reputation of the company, quality of the drug and brand names significantly influenced prescription behaviour, while direct mailers, advertisements in journals and giving <b>letter</b> <b>pads</b> and other brand reminders were less effective. Commonly used method of giving samples was not among the twenty most effective methods influencing prescription. Product quality and good company are still factors that influence prescription. Pharmaceutical marketing influences the choice of brands by a physician. The more expensive strategies involved in public relations are more effective. Sending mails and journal advertisements are less effective strategies. How expensive marketing strategies affect cost of the medicines has to be explored further...|$|E
5000|$|A keypad {{is a set}} {{of buttons}} {{arranged}} in a block or [...] "pad" [...] which bear digits, symbols or alphabetical <b>letters.</b> <b>Pads</b> mostly containing numbers are called a numeric keypad. Numeric keypads are found on alphanumeric keyboards and on other devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, push-button telephones, vending machines, ATMs, Point of Sale devices, combination locks, and digital door locks. Many devices follow the E.161 standard for their arrangement.|$|R

50|$|After {{filling in}} 32 letters, {{the board is}} turned through 90 degrees and another 32 letters written (note that {{flipping}} the board horizontally or vertically is the equivalent). Shorter messages are filled with null <b>letters</b> (i.e., <b>padding).</b> Messages longer than 64 letters require another turn {{of the board and}} another sheet of paper. If the plaintext is too short, each square must be filled up entirely with nulls.|$|R
50|$|The poem {{code was}} {{ultimately}} {{replaced with the}} one-time <b>pad,</b> specifically the <b>letter</b> one-time <b>pad</b> (LOP). In LOP, the agent was provided {{with a string of}} letters and a substitution square. The plaintext was written under the string on the pad. The pairs of letters in each column (such as P,L) indicated a unique letter on the square (Q). The pad was never reused while the substitution square could be reused without loss of security. This enabled rapid and secure encoding of messages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Secure hash {{functions}} are the unsung heroes of modern cryptography. Introductory courses in cryptography often leave them out — since they don’t {{have a secret}} key, {{it is difficult to}} use hash functions by themselves for cryptography. In addition, most theoretical discussions of cryptographic systems can get by without mentioning them. However, for secure practical implementations of public-key ciphers, digital signatures, and many other systems they are indispensable. In this paper I will discuss the requirements for a secure hash function and relate my attempts {{to come up with a}} “toy ” system which both reasonably secure and also suitable for students to work with by hand in a classroom setting. 1 1. Hash Functions Hash {{functions are}} an essential part of modern cryptographic practice. At their root, however, hash functions don’t necessarily have anything to do with cryptography, or even secrecy. By definition, a hash function is any function which takes an arbitrarily long string of characters or bits as input and returns a fixed-length output. A simple example using characters from the Roman alphabet is given in [2, Example 3. 6. 1, p. 233]: write the string in rows of five <b>letters</b> each (<b>padding</b> if necessary) and convert each letter to its numerical equivalent. Then add down the columns modulo 26 and convert the result back to letters. For example, if the input string is “Hello, my name is Alice”, the procedure would go...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{describe}} {{the success of}} diverse recruitment methods in a randomized controlled clinical trial of exercise in persons with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). MethodsAn analysis of recruitment sources conducted for the 746 men and women completing a baseline visit for the study to improve leg circulation (SILC), a randomized controlled trial of exercise for patients with PAD. For each recruitment source, we determined the number of randomized participants, the rate of randomization among those completing a baseline visit, and cost per randomized participant. ResultsOf the 746 individuals who completed a baseline visit, 156 were eligible and randomized. The most frequent sources of randomized participants were newspaper advertising (n = 67), mailed recruitment letters to patients with PAD identified at the study medical center (n = 25), and radio advertising (n = 18). Costs per randomized participant were $ 2750 for television advertising, $ 2167 for Life Line Screening, $ 2369 for newspaper advertising, $ 3931 for mailed postcards to older community dwelling men and women, and $ 5691 for radio advertising. Among those completing a baseline visit, randomization rates ranged from 10 % for those identified from radio advertising to 32 % for those identified from the Chicago Veterans Administration and 33 % for those identified from posted flyers. ConclusionMost participants in a randomized controlled trial of exercise were recruited from newspaper advertising and mailed recruitment letters to patients with known PAD. The highest randomization rates after a baseline visit occurred among participants identified from posted flyers and mailed recruitment <b>letters</b> to <b>PAD</b> patients...|$|R
