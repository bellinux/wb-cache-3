40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that intermittent (<b>lammas)</b> <b>shoot</b> growth in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings from dry regions of southwest Oregon is adaptively significant. Seedlings from open-pollinated families (160 total) from two inland (dry) and two coastal (wet) sources were grown under either well-watered or intermittent drought conditions (temporary drought followed by rewatering) for two growing seasons. In the first growing season, the results supported the hypothesis: the frequency of a second flush was genetically controlled (although weakly, hf 2 £ 0. 34); more seedlings, on average, from inland families than from coastal families displayed a second flush; and seedlings from inland families were more responsive to the intermittent drought regime in terms of increased frequency of a second flush (relative to the frequency in the well-watered regime). During the second growing season, the intermittent drought treatment did not promote intermittent shoot growth, although inland and coastal families had different patterns of shoot growth that reflected adaptations to soil water availability. We conclude that inland families have adapted to dry summers and short growing seasons by relying predominantly on predetermined growth for seedling height increment after the first growing season. In response to wetter and generally longer growing seasons, however, coastal families have developed a less regulated pattern of shoot extension and rely more on free growth...|$|E

A few provenances or mother trees were chosen for each species, referring to the results of preliminary trials 2 ～ 4). Observations and measurements were made on the growth (height and diameter), the period of opening of buds, the formation of <b>lammas</b> <b>shoots,</b> the extent of injury by late frosts, and the mortality, in their nursery stage (Table 2).

40|$|Lammas growth, a rare {{phenomenon}} for Korean {{red pine}} (Pinus densiflora), occurred in 2006. <b>Lammas</b> <b>shoots</b> showed higher frequency and longer length in Seoul's hotter urban center than in urbanboundary or suburban forest sites. Frequency and length showed a close correlation with urbanization densityand vegetation cover expressed in NDVI. Air {{temperature in the}} late summer of 2006 was more than 1 ℃ higherthan an average year. Of the predominant environmental signals that modulate bud flush, only temperaturechanged significantly during the year. Differences in temperature between the urban centers, urban boundariesand suburban forests correlated with varying land-use density. The rise in temperature likely spurred lammasgrowth of the Korean red pine. Symptoms of climate change are being detected throughout the world, and itsconsequences will be clearer in the future. Considerate interest in the responses of ecological systems to thevariable changes is required to prepare for unforeseeable crises.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the interaction between herbaceous competition, fertility, and seed source on Douglas-fir survival and growth. A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of these various factors on the production of <b>lammas</b> <b>shoots</b> and the selectivity of deer browse. Finally, the role of lammas growth in the recovery from deer browsing was examined. Lammas growth, commonly referred to as second flushing, is the precocious flush of growth from the newly formed terminal bud in mid-summer. Weed control was the dominant factor influencing seedling survival and growth, accounting for 49 percent of the explained variation in seedling volume after two years. Weed control significantly conserved soil moisture and resulted in an increased number of seedlings exhibiting a second flush of growth. Fertilization through the addition of nitrogen had no effect when used in conjunction with weed control and had a negative effect when used without the benefit of weed control, Seedlings from the seed orchard source were significantly larger in diameter than the wild type source after two growing seasons, but were of similar height. Of the seedlings which were browsed twice by deer those with the benefit of weed control had over twice the stem volume of those without the benefit of weed control. Lammas growth contributed to the stem volume response to weed control by additional height growth, thus allowing the seedlings to recover from and escape the effects of deer browse...|$|R
40|$|The oak mildew invaded Western Europa in {{the years}} 1908 and 1909. Since then this parasite, Microsphaera alphitoides Griff. & Maubl. (syn. M. quercina (Schw.) Burr.) has {{occurred}} regularly in the Netherlands on oak seedlings and oak coppice, mainly Quercus pedunculata Ehr. (syn. Q. robur L.). After {{the appearance of the}} fungus its identity and also its mode of hibernation has been amply discussed. Perithecia with ascospores were discovered by Arnaud and Foëx (1912) in France. In the Netherlands perithecia were only occasionally observed, as their occurrence seems to depend on weather conditions during the summer months (Hartsuyker, 1939). Besides ascospores, if present, chlamydospores on old infected leaves described by Ferraris (1909) might be a source of infection of young leaves in spring (Petri, 1923). However, these observations were not confirmed by other investigators. Neger (1911), Peglion (1911), and somewhat later also Van Poeteren (1912) observed hibernation of the mildew in infested buds from which malformed shoots developed in spring, stem and leaves being covered with mycelium and conidia. Woodward et al. (1929) described the way the mildew spreads: conidia from these shoots infect young healthy leaves in the neighbourhood, on which circular colonies develop. The growth of these white patches stops rather soon, probably owing to thickening of the cuticle of the ageing leaves. As has been noted by Ditu et al. (1964) leaves are severely attacked up to the age of 20 days. A second outbreak may occur on the newly developed <b>Lammas</b> <b>shoots.</b> Van Poeteren (1918) gave a clear description of the two periods of spread...|$|R
40|$|Des Douglas issus de boutures âgées de 9 il 12 mois ont été soumis à divers traitements lumineux et thermiques afin d’observer la capacité de débourrement de l’ensemble des bourgeons. En début d’expérience, tous les bourgeons étaient en repos apparent. Par rapport à une photopériode courte (9 h) un éclairement de 16 h (250 ụE m- 2 s- 1) stimule {{fortement}} le débourrement des bourgeons. Cette stimulation s’observe également pour un éclairement faible (40 ụE m- 2 s- 1) donné en complément de la période de 9 h. Ces résultats ont été confirmés chez des plants issus de semis et âgés de 4 ans où, de plus, un éclairement pendant 16 h accroît fortement le nombre de bourgeons réactivés. Une période de froid (5 °C) réactive tous les bourgeons d’une bouture si le traitement a duré 9 semaines. L’allongement de la pousse de première génération qui se produit dès la fin de la période froide est d’autant plus important que le froid a duré plus longtemps. Enfin, des températures élevées données en alternance (35 °C pendant 9 h et 25 °C pendant 15 h) durant 2 semaines accroissent notablement le débourrement des bourgeons. 1 et 3 semaines de ce traitement stimulent également, mais de façon moindre, le débourrement. Ces effets sont obtenus en régime d’alimentation hydrique et minérale non limitante. La discussion met l’accent sur l’hétérogénéité physiologique de la population de bourgeons d’un jeune plant révélée par des exigences différentes pour leur débourrement, en photo-périodes longues ou en températures froides ou en températures chaudes. The aim of {{this article}} was to describe and to measure the characteristics of the bud burst of 9 to 12 month old cuttings of Pseudotsuga menziesii as a function of variations in photoperiod, light energy and temperature. At the beginning of the experiments, all the buds were seemingly in a rest state. Compared with a short photoperiod (9 h) a 16 h lighting period (250 ụE m- 2 s- 1) - accelerated and strongly stimulated the intensity of bud burst (fig. 1). The same result, although less intense, was observed when weak lighting (40 ụE m- 2 s- 1) was given as a complement to the 9 h period (fig. 1). These results have been confirmed on 4 years old plants on which a high energy (430 ụE m- 2 s- 1) - 16 h lighting period strongly enhanced the number of reactivated buds (fig. 2) as compared with the reactivated buds numbered on plants placed under the same photoperiod but with less intense light (250 ụE m- 2 s- 1). On those plants placed in 9 h photoperiod, only intense light slightly enhanced the bud burst. A cold period (5 °C) accelerated the growth of all buds of the cuttings if the treatment lasted 9 weeks. For shorter cold periods, the intensity of bud burst depended upon the duration of the stay at cold temperature (fig. 3). The elongation of the shoot of the first generation which occured immediately after the cold period was higher when the cold period was longer (fig. 4). Finally, high temperatures given alternatively (35 °C during 9 h and 25 °C during 15 h) for 2 weeks enhanced appreciably the bud burst. 1 or 3 weeks of this treatment were less effective (fig. 5). These effects were obtained in non limiting conditions of water and mineral nutrition. Whatever the culture conditions, a slow growth phase took place immediately after a rapid elongation period. This was morphologically visible by the formation of scaly buds or, in some cases, by a few scales surrounding green buds. We discuss the physiological heterogeneity {{of the population of the}} buds of a cutting as revealed by their different photoperiodic or temperature needs for their bud burst. These factors are not essential for the growth of all the buds, but they synchronize and hasten the renewal of the growth. According to the results high temperatures associated with long summer days could explain the formation of <b>lamma</b> <b>shoots</b> by trees growing outside...|$|R
