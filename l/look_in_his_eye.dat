2500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Fly" [...] began during {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby at Berlin's Hansa Studios in 1990. The song's origins {{can be traced}} to a demo recorded there, which eventually evolved into the B-side [...] "Lady With the Spinning Head." [...] The demo was among the material that was bootlegged from the Berlin sessions and released as Salome: The Axtung Beibi Sessions. In 1991, the album's recording sessions moved to the seaside mansion [...] "Elsinore" [...] in Dalkey, where the group continued to work on the demo. It was troublesome, but it inspired portions of three separate songs, [...] "The Fly" [...] being one of them, and [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station" [...] being the other two. Lead vocalist Bono stated, [...] "One day, [...] Flood had a different <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> It started to feel good. We recorded 'The Fly'. Edge's guitar sound was literally like a fly had broken into your brain and was buzzing around." ...|$|E
60|$|Corky was {{standing}} {{staring at the}} picture. His face was set. There was a hunted <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|He stood hesitating on the steps, a wistful <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Bok {{crouched}} {{near the}} fire, with a horror-struck <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Brooke {{glanced at}} him quietly, with a curious <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Two mornings {{later the}} Captain {{appeared}} at the breakfast-table with the same shifting and uneasy <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{was driving}} her very sweetly, {{but with a}} worried <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and a tremor in his arm.|$|E
60|$|For some minutes Kasteliz {{spoke in}} pure Hungarian while Swithin waited, with a forced {{smile and a}} fixed <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> He did not {{understand}} Hungarian.|$|E
60|$|Mose {{was looking}} {{straight}} ahead with a musing <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mary <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> clearly, with a slight, but {{perfectly}} sweet smile.|$|R
60|$|Holderness {{stood still}} for a moment. There was a queer <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} James, {{when he joined}} Peter on the tenth tee, that the latter's manner was strange. He was pale. There was a curious <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|So I {{gets him}} down a side way {{on a board}} walk where the attractions were some less violent. At a little six by eight stall Tobin halts, with a more human <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Then I said, [...] "William Nye!" [...] But {{he turned}} upon me, And the <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> Was quite painful to see; And he says, [...] "You mistake: this poor Injin I protects from such sharps as you be!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{wanted to}} <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> She {{wanted him to}} look at her.|$|R
5000|$|Cause {{she wants}} to {{put her arms around}} <b>his</b> neck, and <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> so blue ...|$|R
60|$|COKESON. Ye-es, {{but it was}} the <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> I can't {{explain my}} meaning--it was funny.|$|R
6000|$|But {{something}} in Mr. Hamlin's manner, and a peculiar <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> did not satisfy Leonidas. [...] "Are {{you going to}} see her now?" [...] he said eagerly. [...] "I can show you the house, and then run in and tell her you're outside in the laurels." ...|$|E
60|$|At this {{there came}} a <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> that I could not mistake. His {{education}} had been neglected in one essential and eminently British particular: he could not box. No more could I, you may say; but then I had the more impudence--and I had made the proposal.|$|E
60|$|Mitchell did {{not appear}} amused. I watched his face anxiously. He had made no remark, but the missed putt which would have saved the hole had been very short, and I feared the worst. There was a {{brooding}} <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> as {{we walked to the}} fourteenth tee.|$|E
60|$|The lame man's face brightened. He had {{the upward}} <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> which {{prolonged}} suffering often brings.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{she spoke}} the {{professor}} {{came into the room}} still with the dazed <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then Weston stood up, with {{a little}} flush {{on his face and}} a curious <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] {{said the}} man, with an awed {{voice and a}} strange, fatuous <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "What did I tell you? You see, it's allus so! Now," [...] he added roughly, [...] "get up and get out o' this, afore you lose the boots and shirt off ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't strange at all," [...] said Andor, {{with a shrug}} of the shoulders, for now {{he thought}} that BÃ©la was drunk, so curious was the <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> [...] "considering that I put that key there myself half an hour ago--it is the key of {{the back door of}} this house." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{first impulse}} on {{entering}} {{the room had}} been to throw her arms about his neck, but the momentary glimpse of his face she had caught {{when he turned to}} greet her arrested her steps. His face was deathly pale, and there was an excited <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> which seemed strangely to contrast with his light, indifferent tone.|$|E
60|$|He merely nodded; but a <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{gave her}} to {{understand}} {{that he would do}} his duty.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{smiled at}} her, {{and there was}} a <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> which shone there for no other woman.|$|R
60|$|Steele {{never asked}} questions, but the hungry <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{was enough to}} make even a truthful fellow exaggerate things.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went away}} {{and found a}} silver Chile dollar in an old vest of O'Connor's. I took him some fried fish and rice for his supper. In the morning I went down to a lagoon and had a drink of water, {{and then went back}} to the jail. O'Connor had a porterhouse steak <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, there's no news to tell, I believe," [...] said Goodwin, with {{a mischievous}} <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> [...] "except that old Geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day. If {{something}} doesn't happen to relieve his mind I'll have {{to quit smoking}} on his back porch--and there's no other place available that is cool enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|In vain Mr. Prince {{urged the}} failing {{condition}} of Mrs. Starbottle, her absolute freedom from complicity with Carry's flight, the pardonable and natural instincts of the girl, {{and his own}} assurance that {{they were willing to}} abide by her decision. And then with a rising color in his cheek, a dangerous <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> but a singular calmness in his speech, he added,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{looked down}} at him silently, {{and there was a}} <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> which went {{straight}} to the Major's heart.|$|R
60|$|He came back, {{and there}} was a greedy <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> now which ought to have alarmed her, but did not.|$|R
60|$|Clavering {{stood still}} a moment, with an {{unpleasant}} <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> but the Sheriff, who seemed the least disconcerted, touched his arm.|$|R
