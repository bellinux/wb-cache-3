A 0. 2 mW beam at 1064 nm exhibiting 4 dB squeezing has been generated using a phase-sensitive type-I parametric amplifier pumped by a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser.

Introduction Compared to other surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waveguides, DLSPPWs are characterized by a good compromise between efficient <b>light</b> <b>squeezing</b> on sub-wavelength structures and reasonably long propagation range [1]. DLSPPWs can be easily fabricated using e-beam or photolithography.

Therefore, DLSPPW are very promising components for high-density optical circuits or interconnects between integrated circuits and optical links. Improvements on DLSPPWs are still underway to further increase the propagation length in order to obtain very long-range DLSPPWs with propagation length exceeding few hundred microns [3].
