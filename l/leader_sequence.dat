40|$|The {{intergenic regions}} in {{bacterial}} genomes can contain regulatory <b>leader</b> <b>sequences</b> and small RNAs (sRNAs), which both serve to modulate gene expression. Computational analyses have predicted {{the presence of}} hundreds of these noncoding regulatory RNAs in Escherichia coli; however, only about 80 have been experimentally validated. By applying a deep-sequencing approach, we detected and quantified {{the vast majority of}} the previously validated regulatory elements and identified 10 new sRNAs and nine new regulatory <b>leader</b> <b>sequences</b> in the intergenic regions of E. coli. Half of the newly discovered sRNAs displayed enhanced stability in the presence of the RNA-binding protein Hfq, which is vital to the function of many of the known E. coli sRNAs. Whereas previous methods have often relied on phylogenetic conservation to identify regulatory <b>leader</b> <b>sequences,</b> only five of the newly discovered E. coli <b>leader</b> <b>sequences</b> were present in the genomes of other enteric species. For those newly identified regulatory elements having orthologs in Salmonella, evolutionary analyses showed that these regions encoded new noncoding elements rather than small, unannotated protein-coding transcripts. In addition to discovering new noncoding regulatory elements, we validated 53 sRNAs that were previously predicted but never detected and showed that the presence, within intergenic regions, of σ 70 promoters and sequences with compensatory mutations that maintain stable RNA secondary structures across related species is a good predictor of novel sRNAs...|$|R

25|$|Evidence for {{a single}} {{promoter}} model was verified when viruses were exposed to UV light. UV radiation can cause dimerization of RNA, which prevents transcription by RNA polymerase. If the viral genome follows a multiple promoter model, the level inhibition of transcription should correlate with {{the length of the}} RNA gene. However, the genome was best described by a single promoter model. When paramyxovirus genome was exposed to UV light, the level of inhibition of transcription was proportional to the distance from the <b>leader</b> <b>sequence.</b> That is, the further the gene is from the <b>leader</b> <b>sequence,</b> the greater the chance of RNA dimerization inhibiting RNA polymerase.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{sequence}} {{within the}} genome is conserved across the family {{due to a}} phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity (see Mononegavirales) in which genes closest to the 3’ end of the genome are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5’ end. This {{is a result of}} structure of the genome. After each gene is transcribed, the RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase pauses to release the new mRNA when it encounters an intergenic sequence. When the RNA polymerase is paused, there is a chance that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must reenter the genome at the <b>leader</b> <b>sequence,</b> rather than continuing to transcribe the length of the genome. The result is that the further downstream genes are from the <b>leader</b> <b>sequence,</b> the less they will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.|$|E

It is found in high concentrations in biological fluids and is expressed in virtually all organs of the body (CST3 is a housekeeping gene). The highest levels are found in semen, followed by breastmilk, tears and saliva. The hydrophobic <b>leader</b> <b>sequence</b> indicates that the protein is normally secreted. There are three polymorphisms in the promoter region of the gene, resulting in two common variants. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with altered cystatin C levels.|$|E
25|$|Bioinformatic {{analysis}} of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed {{that they were}} not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 – 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition. In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with {{the other end of the}} spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array. The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the <b>leader</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E

To define the defects in the secretion-defective <b>leader</b> <b>sequences,</b> we selected revertants by requiring growth on sucrose. Surprisingly, most of the reversion events consisted of point changes and duplications in the upstream noncoding portion of the gene.

40|$|SummaryBacterial mRNAs often contain <b>leader</b> <b>sequences</b> that {{respond to}} {{specific}} metabolites or ions by altering {{expression of the}} associated downstream protein-coding sequences. Here we report that the leader RNA of the Mg 2 + transporter gene mgtA of Salmonella enterica, which was previously known {{to function as a}} Mg 2 +-sensing riboswitch, harbors an 18 codon proline-rich open reading frame—termed mgtL—that permits intracellular proline to regulate mgtA expression. Interfering with mgtL translation by genetic, pharmacological, or environmental means was observed to increase the mRNA levels from the mgtA coding region. Substitution of the mgtL proline codons by other codons abolished the response to proline and to hyperosmotic stress but not to Mg 2 +.

[...] Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. [...] This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion. [...] When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain.

40|$|Two {{different}} transcription {{termination control}} mechanisms, the T box and S box systems, {{are used to}} regulate transcription of many bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, amino acid biosynthesis, and amino acid transport genes. Both of these regulatory mechanisms involve an untranslated mRNA leader region capable of adopting alternate structural conformations that result in transcription termination or transcription elongation into the downstream region. Comparative analyses revealed a small RNA secondary structural element, designated the GA motif, that is highly conserved in both T box and S box <b>leader</b> <b>sequences.</b> The motif consists of two short helices separated by an asymmetric internal loop, with highly conserved GA dinucleotide sequences {{on either side of}} the internal loop. Site-directed mutagenesis of this motif in model T and S box <b>leader</b> <b>sequences</b> indicated that it is essential for transcriptional regulation in both systems.

40|$|The dimer {{initiation}} site (DIS) hairpin of the HIV- 2 untranslated leader RNA mediates in vitro dimerization through ‘loop–loop kissing’ of a loop-exposed palindrome sequence. Premature RNA dimerization must be prevented during the retroviral life cycle. A regulatory mechanism {{has been proposed}} for the HIV- 1 leader RNA that can adopt an alternative conformation in which the DIS motif is effectively masked by long-distance base pairing with upstream <b>leader</b> <b>sequences.</b> We now report that HIV- 2 RNA dimerization is also regulated. Sequestering of the DIS motif by base pairing interactions with downstream <b>leader</b> <b>sequences</b> mediates a switch to a dimerization-impaired conformation. The existence of two alternative conformations of the HIV- 2 leader RNA is supported by UV melting experiments. Furthermore, the equilibrium between the two conformations can be shifted by annealing of antisense oligonucleotides or by deletion of certain leader regions. These measures have {{a profound impact on}} the dimerization properties of the transcript, demonstrating a mutual exclusivity between the alternative conformation and dimerization, similar to what has been described for the HIV- 1 leader. The overall resemblance in regulation of HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 RNA dimerization suggests that a similar mechanism may be operating in other lentiviruses and perhaps all retroviridae...|$|R
