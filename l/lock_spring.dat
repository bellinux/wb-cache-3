2500|$|The Glock 19 is {{effectively}} a reduced-size Glock 17, called the [...] "Compact" [...] by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about [...] {{compared to the}} Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18.

30|$|Calipers are the {{orthotic}} devices used in SCI {{cases with}} injury at T 6 –T 9. The classification of calipers {{has been mentioned}} in Fig.  9. They are fitted to the lower limb of SCI patients {{with the help of}} metal rods. KAFO is a type of orthotic device which stabilizes knee, ankle and foot, where the knee is supported by a caliper. In some cases, the joint is locked using a drop <b>lock,</b> <b>spring</b> loaded lock, cam lock, ball lock, dial lock or a plunger type of lock. The KAFOs are mainly used to support the patients with muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesions and lost structural integrity [40]. However, combination of KAFO and a Shannon’s brace provides better support. Shannon’s brace is used separately or combined with KAFO to provide waist support, once the patient shows improvement. It helps the patients in restoring his functional abilities. In context to locomotion, it helps a patient to become independent of supportive/mobility aids.|$|E

50|$|The model 1880s {{did not do}} well in testing. The rod's {{retaining}} mechanism was problematic and did {{not work}} well until a key {{was added to the}} <b>locking</b> <b>spring.</b> The design modifications altered the ballistics of the weapon, and the sights had to be modified to compensate for the changes. Because of these problems, the model 1880s were all returned from the field and were placed into storage. After a failed successor design, the 1882, further attempts at improvement succeeded with the 1884, 1886 and 1888 rifles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Locking {{devices are}} widely used in robotics, for {{instance}} to <b>lock</b> <b>springs,</b> joints or to reconfigure robots. This review paper classifies the locking devices currently described in literature and preforms a comparative study. Designers can therefore better determine which locking device best matches {{the needs of their}} application. The locking devices are divided into three main categories based on different locking principles: me-chanical locking, friction-based locking and singularity locking. Different locking devices in each category can be passive or active. Based on an extensive literature survey, the paper summarizes the findings by comparing different locking devices on a set of properties of an ideal locking device. I...|$|R

50|$|A plastic cord lock (also {{known as}} cord fastener, plastic stopper or cord toggle) {{attaches}} to drawstrings and tightens {{without the use}} of knots. Cord locks allow mountaineers to fasten clothing and camping equipment quickly in cold conditions when the fingers are encased in heavy gloves. They consist generally of three parts: a barrel, a toggle (plunger), and a spring. Squeezed together, tension is released and the cord lock can move freely up and down the cords. Released, the tension is engaged and the cord lock stays in place. They come in many sizes and shapes to suit to any purpose, including plastic cord lock, mini size cord <b>lock,</b> no <b>spring</b> cord <b>lock,</b> with <b>spring</b> cord <b>lock,</b> with rim cord lock.|$|R

On trying the door of the girl's room, she found it still locked. Mrs. Dornell called, but there was no answer. Full of misgivings, she privately fetched the old house-steward and bade him burst open the door--an order by no means easy to execute, the joinery of the Court being massively constructed. However, the <b>lock</b> <b>sprang</b> open at last, and she entered Betty's chamber only to find the window unfastened and the bird flown.|$|R
25|$|According to Armenian lore, {{there are}} women who, in {{consequence}} of deadly sins, are condemned to spend seven years in wolf form. In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and <b>locks</b> <b>springing</b> open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.|$|R

40|$|A {{vertically}} supported {{comb drive}} with {{the feasibility of}} actuation in two perpendicular directions utilizing electrostatic force from interdigitated comb-shape electrodes has been demonstrated. The prototype microstructures are made of 2 µm thick polysilicon by a standard surface micromachining process. They are vertically lifted after the final sacrificial layer releasing process and are fixed on the substrate {{with the assistance of}} micro <b>locking</b> <b>springs</b> and micro hinges. The microstructures can vibrate in the directions either parallel or normal to the comb fingers, depending on the physical setups of the supporting structures and the polarity of driving electrodes. Experimentally, under 10 V dc bias voltage and 10 V ac peak-to-peak driving voltage in air, the prototype structure is found to resonate at the first fundamental mode of 6. 8 kHz in the parallel direction. In the direction normal {{to the surface of the}} comb fingers, several bands of vibration movements have been observed between 500 Hz and 11. 9 kHz due to the strong coupling between the two comb structures. As such, these microresonators using the vertically supported two-directional comb drive might find potential applications in the area of MEMS or MOEMS including optical systems on a chip.
