Up Front has terrain, attack opportunities, and other factors determined by cards dealt to the players.|$|E

This can be done manually or by using a small machine that essentially uses tape to pull the film leader out of the cassette. In cases when {{the end of the}} film cannot be removed or if the film is damaged, the film can be removed using a dark bag or a dark box. A twin check number (a pair of stickers with a unique number) is put onto the film and the matching number onto the film processing envelope, so that after processing this film can be easily identified to the customers envelope. Films are spliced on the leader cards one or two at a time, to do this {{the end of the film}} is cut square, special chemical-resistant tape is used to attach the film to the <b>leader</b> <b>card.</b> The leader card(s) is/are then inserted into the film processor and are fed through the machine using sprockets in the card. The film goes through a developer, bleach, fix and stabilizer, then through a dryer. After the film is processed it is cut from the <b>leader</b> <b>card</b> and reunited with the processing envelope containing the customer details, and then from here the film goes forward for printing.|$|E

50|$|The {{team was}} founded in 1983 when Simon decided to bring his {{sponsorship}} from Vermont American to a new team of his own creation. He saw an immediate boost in performance as he qualified for the Indianapolis 500 {{for the first time}} since 1980 and was noticeably more competitive than he was with the <b>Leader</b> <b>Card</b> team. In 1985 Simon brought in Brazilian Raul Boesel to drive full-time as he scaled back his own racing to a part-time schedule, occasionally joining Boesel in a second car. Simon only competed in four races in 1986 as Boesel drove the team's primary car to 17th in points and was competitive in nearly every race. A number of other drivers made part-time appearances in Simon's other entry as Dick Simon Racing became one of the premier teams for pay drivers. This trend continued in 1988 which would be Simon's final year of racing as Arie Luyendyk replaced Boesel in the team's full-time entry. In 1989 Scott Brayton joined Luyendyk as the team fielded a pair of full-time fully funded entries for the first time. Luyendyk finished 10th in points while Brayton finished 15th. Luyendyk left the team for 1990 and was replaced by Japanese rookie Hiro Matsushita while Brayton again finished 15th. Matsushita took his Panasonic funding elsewhere for 1991, leaving Brayton to drive a single Simon entry to a respectable 12th-place points finish. Brayton, Matsushita, and Boesel returned to the team in 1992 and Boesel finished 9th in the championship while Brayton finished 15th again. The team also fielded a car in the Indy 500 for female rookie Lyn St. James who became the second woman to compete in the race. St. James returned for a partial schedule in 1993 while Brayton and Boesel drove the full-time cars to 15th and 5th-place points finishes respectively, with Boesel capturing 3 runner-up finishes. In 1994 Matsushita again returned to the team as Boesel continued in the other car, this time finishing 7th in points. In 1995 the team signed Dean Hall and Formula One veteran Eliseo Salazar to drive the team's two cars and they were joined in April by rookie Carlos Guerrero. Hall left the team after failing to qualify for the Indy 500 while Salazar and Guerrero managed 21st and 30th-place points finishes respectively.|$|E

50|$|Playing {{with the}} Leaders {{expansion}} changes the game mechanic, {{as the second}} thing done in the game after choosing a Wonder board is to choose <b>leaders.</b> Four <b>leader</b> <b>cards</b> are dealt to each player, and the cards are drafted so that each player ends up with two cards they chose and two they did not. At {{the start of each}} Age, players may recruit one leader, paying its coin cost and putting it into play. To compensate for this extra expense, with the Leaders expansion, players start with six coins instead of three. As with the Age cards, instead of recruiting a leader, a player may choose to discard the card to gain three coins or build a Wonder stage with it.|$|R
