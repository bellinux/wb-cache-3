Ca, Na, Cl, K and Mg accumulate along the lower side of caps of horizontally oriented roots. The most dramatic asymmetries of these ions {{occur in the}} apoplast, especially the mucilage. We could not detect any {{significant differences in the}} concentrations of these ions in the central cytoplasm of columella cells along the upper and lower sides of caps of horizontally-oriented roots. However, the increased amounts of Na, Cl, K and Mg in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>walls</b> of columella cells along the lower side of the cap suggest that these ions may move down through the columella tissue of horizontally-oriented roots. Ca also accumulates (largely in the mucilage) along the lower side of the elongating zone of horizontally-oriented roots, while Na, P, Cl and K tend to accumulate along the upper side of the elongating zone. Of these ions, only K increases in concentration in the cytoplasm and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>walls</b> of cortical cells in the upper vs lower sides of the elongating zone. These results indicate that (1) gravity-induced asymmetries of ions differ significantly in the cap and elongating zone of graviresponding roots, (2) Ca accumulates along the lower side of the cap and elongating zone of graviresponding roots, (3) increased growth of the upper side of the elongating zone of horizontally-oriented roots correlates positively with increased amounts of K in the cytoplasm and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>walls</b> of cortical cells, and (4) the apoplast (especially the mucilage) may be {{an important component of the}} pathway via which ions move in graviresponding rots of Zea mays.

Using immunocytochemical {{techniques}} and antibodies that specifically recognize xyloglucan (anti-XG), polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan I (anti-PGA/RG-I), and methylesterified pectins (JIM 7), {{we have shown}} that these polysaccharides are differentiaUy synthesized and localized during cell development and differentiation in the clover root tip. In cortical cells XG epitopes are present at a threefold greater density in the newly formed cross walls than in the older <b>longitudinal</b> <b>walls,</b> and PGA/RG-I epitopes are detected solely in the expanded middle lamella of cortical cell corners, even after pretreatment of sections with pectinmethylesterase to uncover masked epitopes. These results suggest that in cortical cells XG and PGA/RG-I are differentially localized not only to particular wall domains, but also to particular cell walls. In contrast to their nonoverlapping distribution in cortical cells, XG epitopes and PGA/RG-I epitopes largely colocalize in the epidermal cell walls. The results also demonstrate that the middle lamella of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>walls</b> shared by epidermal cells and by epidermal and cortical cells constitutes a barrier to the diffusion of cell wall and mucilage molecules. Synthesis of XG and PGA/RG-I epitope-containing polysaccharides also varies during cellular differentiation in the root cap. The differentiation of gravitropic columella cells into mucilage-secreting peripheral cells {{is marked by a}} dramatic increase in the synthesis and secretion of molecules containing XG and PGA/RG-I epitopes. In contrast, JIM 7 epitopes are present at abundant levels in columella cell walls, but are not detectable in peripheral cell walls or in secreted mucilage.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the current study was to assess left atrial (LA) {{physiology}} in relation to associations between LA volume change and regional tissue velocities and strains, and to extend this information to patients with mitral stenosis (MS) or mitral regurgitation (MR). Subjects and Methods: Twenty-two healthy persons, 22 patients with moderate-to-severe MS, and 22 patients with moderate-to-severe MR were studied. Tissue velocities, strains, and time-volume curves of the LA were acquired using tissue Doppler imaging and 3 -dimensional echocardiography. Results: In healthy controls, the maximal LA volume was negatively correlated with the posterior <b>wall</b> <b>longitudinal</b> systolic strain (r=- 0. 45, p= 0. 03). The time-to-maximal LA volume was positively correlated with the time-to-posterior <b>wall</b> <b>longitudinal</b> peak strain (r= 0. 46, p= 0. 03) and the time-to-circumferential peak strain (r= 0. 59, p= 0. 004). The LA active emptying fraction (LAactEF) was positively correlated with the posterior <b>wall</b> <b>longitudinal</b> peak systolic and late diastolic tissue velocities. In patients with MS, the maximal LA volume was negatively correlated with the posterior wall radial peak systolic velocity and the longitudinal late diastolic velocity. In patients with MS, the LAactEF had an additional positive correlation with the anterior <b>wall</b> <b>longitudinal</b> and circumferential systolic velocities, whereas the patients with MR had an additional positive correlation between the LAactEF and the lateral <b>wall</b> <b>longitudinal</b> peak strain as compared with the healthy cantrols...|$|R
