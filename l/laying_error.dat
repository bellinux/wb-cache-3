However, testing these ΣΔ ADCs is becoming a costly task due to trends towards high-resolution implementations and associated increase in samples required to extract key specifications. In this paper, we propose a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) technique for high-resolution ΣΔ ADCs. The technique, mostly digital, moves most of the test complexity to the digital domain, that is in-line with the philosophy of ΣΔ modulation.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formulation of an elasto-plastic strain based approach suitable for assessing fatigue strength of notched components subjected to in-service variable amplitude cyclic loading. The hypothesis is formed that the crack initiation plane is closely aligned with the plane of maximum shear strain amplitude, its orientation and the associated stress/strain quantities being determined using the Maximum Variance Method. Fatigue damage is estimated by applying the Modified Manson-Coffin Curve Method (MMCCM) along with the Point Method (PM). In the proposed approach, the required critical distance is treated as a material property whose value is not affected either by the sharpness of the notch being assessed or by the profile of the load spectrum being applied. The detrimental effect of non-zero mean stresses and degree of multiaxiality of the local stress/strain histories is also considered. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed design methodology was checked against several experimental data taken from the literature and generated under different uniaxial variable amplitude load histories. In order to determine the required local stress/strain states, refined elasto-plastic finite element models were solved using commercial software ANSYS®. This preliminary validation exercise allowed us to prove that the proposed approach is capable of estimates <b>laying</b> within an <b>error</b> factor of about 2. These preliminary results are certainly promising, strongly supporting the idea that the proposed design strategy can successfully be used to assess the fatigue lifetime of notched metallic components subjected to in-service multiaxial variable amplitude loading sequences...|$|R
60|$|In this capricious world, {{nothing is}} more capricious than posthumous fame. One of the most notable {{examples}} of posterity's lack of judgment is the Eleatic Zeno. This man, who may {{be regarded as the}} founder of the philosophy of infinity, appears in Plato's Parmenides in the privileged position of instructor to Socrates. He invented four arguments, all immeasurably subtle and profound, to prove that motion is impossible, that Achilles can never overtake the tortoise, and that an arrow in flight is really at rest. After being refuted by Aristotle, and by every subsequent philosopher from that day to our own, these arguments were reinstated, and made the basis of a mathematical renaissance, by a German professor, who probably never dreamed of any connection between himself and Zeno. Weierstrass,[13] by strictly banishing from mathematics the use of infinitesimals, has at last shown that we live in an unchanging world, and that the arrow in its flight is truly at rest. Zeno's only <b>error</b> <b>lay</b> in inferring (if he did infer) that, because {{there is no such thing}} as a state of change, therefore the world is in the same state at any one time as at any other. This is a consequence which by no means follows; and in this respect, the German mathematician is more constructive than the ingenious Greek. Weierstrass has been able, by embodying his views in mathematics, where familiarity with truth eliminates the vulgar prejudices of common sense, to invest Zeno's paradoxes with the respectable air of platitudes; and if the result is less delightful to the lover of reason than Zeno's bold defiance, it is at any rate more calculated to appease the mass of academic mankind.|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{pulsations}} of {{the rapidly}} oscillating Ap (roAp) star HD 24712 (HR 1217) based on nonadiabatic analyses {{taking into account}} the effect of dipole magnetic fields. We have found that all the pulsation modes appropriate for HD 24712 are damped; i. e., the kappa-mechanism excitation in the hydrogen ionization layers is not strong enough to excite high-order p-modes with periods consistent with observed ones, all of which are found to be above the acoustic cut-off frequencies of our models. The main (2. 721 mHz) and the highest (2. 806 mHz) frequencies are matched with modified l= 2 and l= 3 modes, respectively. The large frequency separation (≈ 68 μHz) is reproduced by models which <b>lay</b> within the <b>error</b> box of HD 24712 on the HR diagram. The nearly equally spaced frequencies of HD 24712 indicate the small frequency separation to be as small as ≈ 0. 5 μHz. However, the small separation derived from theoretical l= 1 and 2 modes are found to be larger than ∼ 3 μHz. The problem of equal spacings could be resolved by assuming that the spacings correspond to pairs of l= 2 and l= 0 modes. The amplitude distribution on the stellar surface is strongly affected by the magnetic field resulting in the predominant concentration at the polar regions. Amplitudes and phases of radial-velocity variations for various spectral lines are converted to relations of amplitude/phase versus optical depth in the atmosphere. Oscillation phase delays gradually outward in the outermost layers indicating the presence of waves propagating outward. The phase changes steeply around τ∼- 3. 5, which supports a T-τ relation having a small temperature inversion there. Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

For my part, I think that if poor dear Raleigh had considered the example of David a little more closely, he need never have feigned madness at all; and that his <b>error</b> <b>lay</b> quite in an opposite direction from looking on the Bible heroes, David especially, as too sure models. At all events, let us try Raleigh by the very scriptural standard which he himself lays down, not merely in this case unwisely, but in his 'History of the World' more wisely than any historian whom I have ever read; and say, 'Judged as the Bible taught our Puritan forefathers to judge every man, the character is intelligible enough; tragic, but noble and triumphant: judged as men have been judged in history for the last hundred years, by hardly any canon save those of the private judgment, which philosophic cant, maudlin sentimentality, or fear of public opinion, may happen to have forged, the man is a phenomenon, only less confused, abnormal, suspicious than his biographers' notions about him.'

I never intended it as an argument, but only as an illustration of what I had said before concerning the election of words; and all he can charge me with is only this, that if Seneca could make an ordinary thing sound well in Latin by the choice of words, the same, with the like care, might be performed in English: If it cannot, I have committed an error on the right hand, by commending too much the copiousness and well-sounding of our language, which I hope my countrymen will pardon me; at least the words which follow in my Dramatic Essay will plead somewhat in my behalf; for I say there, that this objection happens but seldom in a play; and then, too, either the meanness of the expression may be avoided, or shut out from the verse by breaking it in the midst.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Partridge hath been lately {{pleased to}} treat me after a very rough manner, in that which is called, his almanack for the present year: Such usage is very undecent from one gentleman to another, and does not at all {{contribute}} {{to the discovery of}} truth, which ought to be the great end in all disputes of the learned. To call a man fool and villain, and impudent fellow, only for differing from him in a point meer speculative, is, in my humble opinion, a very improper style for a person of his education. I appeal to the learned world, whether in my last year's predictions I gave him the least provocation for such unworthy treatment. Philosophers have differed in all ages; but the discreetest among them have always differed as became philosophers. Scurrility and passion, in a controversy among scholars, is just so much of nothing to the purpose, and at best, a tacit confession of a weak cause: My concern is not so much for my own reputation, as that of the Republick of Letters, which Mr. Partridge hath endeavoured to wound through my sides. If men of publick spirit must be superciliously treated for their ingenious attempts, how will true useful knowledge be ever advanced? I wish Mr. Partridge knew the thoughts which foreign universities have conceived of his ungenerous proceedings with me; but I am too tender of his reputation to publish them to the world. That spirit of envy and pride, which blasts so many rising genius's in our nation, is yet unknown among professors abroad: The necessity of justifying myself will excuse my vanity, when I tell the reader that I have near a hundred honorary letters from several parts of Europe (some as far as Muscovy) in praise of my performance. Besides several others, which, as I have been credibly informed, were open'd in the post-office and never sent me. 'Tis true the Inquisition in Portugal was pleased to burn my predictions, and condem the author and readers of them; but I hope at the same time, it will be consider'd in how deplorable a state learning lies at present in that kingdom: And with the profoundest veneration for crown'd heads, I will presume to add, that it a little concerned His Majesty of Portugal, to interpose his authority in behalf of a scholar and a gentleman, the subject of a nation with which he is now in so strict an alliance. But the other kingdoms and states of Europe have treated me with more candor and generosity. If I had leave to print the Latin letters transmitted to me from foreign parts, they would fill a volume, and be a full defence against all that Mr. Partridge, or his accomplices of the Portugal Inquisition, will be able to object; who, by the way, are the only enemies my predictions have ever met with at home or abroad. But I hope I know better what is due to the honour of a learned correspondence in so tender a point. Yet some of those illustrious persons will perhaps excuse me from transcribing a passage or two in my own vindication. The most learned Monsieur Leibnits thus addresses to me his third letter: Illustrissimo Bickerstaffio Astrologiae instauratori, etc. Monsieur le Clerc, quoting my predictions in a treatise he published last year, is pleased to say, Ita nuperrime Bickerstaffius magnum illud Angliae fidus. Another great professor writing of me, has these words: Bickerstaffius, nobilis Anglus, Astrologorum hujusce Saeculi facile Princeps. Signior Magliabecchi, the Great Duke's famous library-keeper, spends almost his whole letter in compliments and praises. 'Tis true, the renowned Professor of Astronomy at Utrecht, seems to differ from me in one article; but it is in a modest manner, that becomes a philosopher; as, Pace tanti viri dixerim: And pag.55, he seems to <b>lay</b> the <b>error</b> upon the printer (as indeed it ought) and says, vel forsan error typographi, cum alioquin Bickerstaffius ver doctissimus, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{need for}} improved {{assessment of risk}} from heavy metal {{contamination of the environment}} has prompted scientific interest in quantifying and predicting metal solubility, ‘lability’ and bioavailability. This has {{led to the development of}} new techniques to fractionate and speciate trace metals in soils. The objectives of the current study were to increase understanding of the effects of (i) soil properties, (ii) contaminant source and (iii) contact time on metal lability and solubility in soils. Multi-stable isotope dilution (ID) methods were used to determine the lability (E-values) of Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in soils, alongside more traditional approaches employed for metal fractionation including single and sequential extraction procedures. Most of the work was undertaken using (i) archived soils amended by metal salts (MA soils; n= 23) and (ii) topsoils collected from Nottingham, Wolverhampton and London (Urban soils; n= 100). The resulting data was used first to quantify the factors affecting trace metal lability in the MA soils using a logistic (S-shape) model which described metal E-value primarily as a function of soil pH with secondary influences from other soil properties. It was apparent that mineral oxides were important fixation phases for Ni, Zn and Cd while Pb was strongly affected by organic matter in soils. This model, parameterised on soils contaminated originally by metal nitrate solution, was then applied to the Urban soils to reveal the extent to which contaminant source still controlled metal lability. A further investigation of the long-term effect of metal source on metal lability was pursued through a third dataset of rural roadside soils (n= 42) which had received Pb mainly from petrol-derived and geogenic sources, defined by their isotopic signature. It was demonstrated that petrol-derived Pb remained more labile than Pb from the parent material, despite decades of contact, although both petrol-derived and geogenic Pb contributed to both the labile and non-labile fractions. In a fourth dataset, soils that had received Pb from sewage sludge amendment (n= 16), the co-existence of high phosphate concentration from sewage sludge limited the magnitude and range of Pb lability, probably through formation of Pb-phosphate minerals. No consistent agreement was found between labile fraction of Pb and any single sequential extraction (SEP) fraction in all soils contaminated by Pb from multiple sources. Both empirical equations (extended Freundlich) and mechanistic models (WHAM-VII) were used to predict metal solubility in the MA and Urban soils. The advantage of using E-values (ME) over metal extractable by dilute nitric acid (MExt) to represent the reactive metal fraction in predictions of solubility was very clear for WHAM-VII, but not for the ‘locally parameterised’ Freundlich model. This was almost certainly due to the strong links between pH and E-value becoming subsumed into the coefficient nominally describing the direct influence of pH on metal solubility in the extended Freundlich equation. However, overestimation of the solution concentration from WHAM-VII was observed for all five metals, and strongly correlated with soil pH. Fractionation information from WHAM suggested that the source of the model’s underestimation of metal binding most likely <b>lay</b> with <b>errors</b> in the description of metal binding by Fe and Mn oxides for Ni, Zn and Cd and humic acid (HA) for Cu. An additional factor is the absence of potential binding phases in the WHAM model, such as particulate CaCO 3, and the greater diversity of active adsorbents in soils at high pH values. WHAM is based on the assumption that all metal bound to HA is labile. However, in the current study, ‘non-labile’ Cu, Zn and Pb fractions were observed in suspensions of HA extracted from grassland and peat soils. These were quantified by measuring metal E-values and EDTA-extraction of HA-bound metal using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to ICP-MS to separate free and HA-complexed metal forms. Evidence of time-dependent metal fixation by HA was found for all three metals during the course of a 40 and 160 day incubation study. The proportion of non-labile Cu held by HA could be 40 - 50...|$|R
6000|$|He did {{not at all}} undervalue what {{he called}} the mere {{political}} connection, but he urged that the root of such a connection lay in the natural affection of the colonies for the land from which they sprang, and their spontaneous desire to reproduce its laws and the spirit of its institutions. From first to last he always declared the really valuable tie with a colony to be the moral and the social tie.[217] The master key with him was local freedom, and he was never weary of protest against the fallacy of what was called 'preparing' these new communities for freedom: teaching a colony, like an infant, by slow degrees to walk, first putting it into long clothes, then into short clothes. A governing class was reared up for the purposes which the colony ought to fulfil itself; and, as the climax of the evil, a great military expenditure was maintained, which became a premium on war. Our modern colonists, he said, after quitting the mother country, instead of keeping their hereditary liberties, go out to Australia or New Zealand to be deprived of these liberties, and then perhaps, after fifteen or twenty or thirty years' waiting, have a portion given back to them, with magnificent language about the liberality of parliament in conceding free institutions. During the whole of that interval they are condemned to hear all the miserable jargon about fitting them for the privileges thus conferred; while, in point of fact, every year and every month during which they are retained under the administration of a despotic government, renders them less fit for free institutions. 'No consideration of money ought to induce parliament to sever the connection between any one of the colonies and the mother country,' though it was certain that the cost of the existing system was both large and unnecessary. But the real mischief was not here, he said. Our <b>error</b> <b>lay</b> in the attempt to hold the colonies by the mere exercise of power.[218] Even for the church in the colonies he rejected the boon of civil preference as being undoubtedly a fatal gift,--'nothing but a source of weakness to the church herself and of discord and difficulty to the colonial communities, in the soil of which I am anxious to see the church of England take a strong and healthy root.'[219] He acknowledged how much he had learned from Molesworth's speeches,[220] and neither of them sympathised with the opinion expressed by Mr. Disraeli in those days, 'These wretched colonies will all be independent too in a few years, and are a millstone round our necks.'[221] Nor did Mr. Gladstone share any such sentiments as those of Molesworth who, in the Canadian revolt of the winter of 1837, actually invoked disaster upon the British arms.[222] ...|$|R
5000|$|Alabama {{state courts}} {{strictly}} follow the common-law {{definition of the}} writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct errors of fact. The writ may not be issued to correct errors of law. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Alabama (Citations and quotes removed): The writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy known more for its denial than its approval. Even so, Alabama Courts allow the writ of error coram nobis to attack judgments in certain restricted instances.When no rule or statute controls, [...] "the common law of England, {{so far as it}} is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws and institutions of this state, shall, together with such institutions and laws, be the rule of decisions, and shall continue in force, except as from time to time it may be altered or repealed by the Legislature." [...] § 1-3-1, Ala. Code 1975.The writ of error coram nobis was one of the oldest remedies of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of <b>error</b> <b>lay</b> to an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of <b>error</b> coram nobis <b>lay</b> to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment. Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.An evidentiary hearing must be held on a coram nobis petition which is meritorious on its face. An evidentiary hearing on a coram nobis petition are required upon meritorious allegations::*that counsel was denied.:*that the State used perjured testimony.:*that petitioner was not advised of right to appeal or right to transcript.:*of an ineffective assistance of counsel, specifically, failing to present alibi witnesses and failing to subpoena witnesses.:*of the denial of effective assistance of counsel.A writ of error coram nobis is also the proper procedural mechanism by which a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent may collaterally challenge that adjudication.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this thesis}} {{the focus has}} been on laser speckle. It is done in {{collaboration}} with poLight. They are developing a projector, where laser light is the source of illumination. In such projectors, laser speckle degrades the image quality. The aim of this project is to construct a speckle reduction device {{to be used in the}} laser projector. The theory covers a description of laser speckle, how to reduce the speckle contrast, and five methods to so. We explain why speckle arises and which parameters we can manipulate to reduce the speckle contrast. The five speckle reduction methods included in this thesis are; vibrating diffuser, slowly moving diffuser, Hadamard matrices, scattering tube, and vibrating mirror. Large vibrational motions are unwanted, considering the size of the device, generation of noise, and problems with alignment of the optical components in the projector that this would lead to. The quality of the laser beam is prominent in order to produce a sharp image, thus the use of diffusers with large scattering angles is not a good solution. The scattering tubes, designed by poLight, are tubes filled with micro pearls in a polymer gel. The size of the pearls decides the nature of the scattering. Larger pearls will give less back scattering and more light transmitted in the forward direction. If the tubes are rotated in a well balanced device we can avoid generating vibrations. The Hadamard matrices is the only one of the five methods which is not based on a motion. The challenge is to find a SLM to implement the matrices. It requires a low response time in order to present enough matrices during the exposure time of the eye. The laboratory setup we use to measure the speckle contrast is an improved version of the setup constructed in the specialisation project. A screen was removed from the old setup, and the speckle is now imaged directly from the speckle reduction device. The measured speckle reduction is thus due to the device alone, and not affected by the screen. The results were reproducible and in agreement with what we expected. We implemented a vibrating diffuser, both the single and the slowly moving. A piece cut from a plastic bag and some Scotch Magic tape were used as diffusers. The tape is the strongest diffuser and gives the lowest speckle contrast, however, it also has the largest scattering angle. The single tape diffuser reduced the speckle contrast to $C = 0. 112 $. With two tape difusers in series the intensity in the images becomes too low to exploit the dynamic range of the CCD sensor. The result is a higher calcualted speckle contrast with two diffusers, $C= 0. 131 $, even though it ought to be smaller. We tested five prototypes of the scattering tube with different concentrations. The tube with the highest concentration has the highest speckle reduction abilities. It also has the strongest scattering effect. The scattering is less than with the tape diffuser, and so is the speckle reduction. The speckle contrast is reduced to $C= 0. 320 $ when the tube is rotated, and to $C= 0. 389 $ when it is vibrated. The tubes was also tested in series with a ground glass. The ground glass acted as a second diffuser. In this setting, vibration and rotation of the tubes reduced the speckle contrast equally, $C approx 0. 283 $ From the measured speckle contrast of the diffusers and tubes in stationary conditions, a polarization analysis should show a depolarization of the laser beam. This were the case only for the plastic diffuser. It is assumed that the <b>error</b> <b>lays</b> with the polarization analysis. There should be a depolarization in the tape and a partial depolarization in the tubes. A calculation of the speckle size was performed as well. Based on the theory we expected the size of the speckle grains to be $sigma_s = 37. 77 ~mu m$. From the Fourier analysis of a speckle image from the setup we calculated the speckle size to be $sigma_s = 5. 35 $~mm, which is approximately 140 times bigger. The expected speckle size is too small, because we did not take into account a small magnification in the setup. The Fourier analysis of discrete and limited sets of data points is probably the main explanation of the difference, but a more thorough study is needed. </p...|$|R
6000|$|The dinner-party at Guestwick Manor on {{that day}} was not very bright, and yet the earl had done all {{in his power to}} make his guests happy. But gaiety did not come {{naturally}} to his house, which, as will have been seen, was an abode very unlike in its nature to that of the other earl at Courcy Castle. Lady de Courcy at any rate understood how to receive and entertain a houseful of people, though the practice of doing so might give rise to difficult questions in the privacy of her domestic relations. Lady Julia did not understand it; but then Lady Julia was never called upon to answer for the expense of extra servants, nor was she asked about twice a week who the ---- was to pay the wine-merchant's bill? As regards Lord De Guest and the Lady Julia themselves, I think they had the best of it; but I am bound to admit, with reference to chance guests, that the house was dull. The people who were now gathered at the earl's table could hardly have been expected to be very sprightly when in company with each other. The squire was not a man much given to general society, and was unused to amuse a table full of people. On the present occasion he sat next to Lady Julia, {{and from time to time}} muttered a few words to her about the state of the country. Mrs Eames was terribly afraid of everybody there, and especially of the earl, next to whom she sat, and whom she continually called [...] "my lord," [...] showing by her voice as she did so that she was almost alarmed by the sound of her own voice. Mr and Mrs Boyce were there, the parson sitting on the other side of Lady Julia, and the parson's wife on the other side of the earl. Mrs Boyce was very studious to show that she was quite at home, and talked perhaps more than any one else; but in doing so she bored the earl most exquisitely, so that he told John Eames the next morning that she was worse than the bull. The parson ate his dinner, but said little or nothing between the two graces. He was a heavy, sensible, slow man, who knew himself and his own powers. [...] "Uncommon good stewed beef," [...] he said, as he went home; [...] "why can't we have our beef stewed like that?" [...] "Because we don't pay our cook sixty pounds a year," [...] said Mrs Boyce. [...] "A woman with sixteen pounds can stew beef as well as a woman with sixty," [...] said he; [...] "she only wants looking after." [...] The earl himself was possessed of a sort of gaiety. There was about him a lightness of spirit which often made him an agreeable companion to one single person. John Eames conceived him to be the most sprightly old man of his day,--an old man with the fun and frolic almost of a boy. But this spirit, though it would show itself before John Eames, was not up to the entertainment of John Eames's mother and sister, together with the squire, the parson, and the parson's wife of Allington. So that the earl was over-weighted and did not shine on this occasion at his own dinner-table. Dr Crofts, who had also been invited, and who had secured the place which was now peculiarly his own, next to Bell Dale, was no doubt happy enough; as, let us hope, was the young lady also; but they added very little to the general hilarity of the company. John Eames was seated between his own sister and the parson, and did not at all enjoy his position. He had a full view of the doctor's felicity, as the happy pair sat opposite to him, and conceived himself to be hardly treated by Lily's absence. The party was certainly very dull, as were all such dinners at Guestwick Manor. There are houses, which, in their everyday course, are not conducted by any means in a sad or unsatisfactory manner,--in which life, as a rule, runs along merrily enough; but which cannot give a dinner-party; or, I might rather say, should never allow themselves to be allured into the attempt. The owners of such houses are generally themselves quite aware of the fact, and dread the dinner which they resolved to give quite as much as it is dreaded by their friends. They know that they prepare for their guests an evening of misery, and for themselves certain long hours of purgatory which are hardly to be endured. But they will do it. Why that long table, and all those supernumerary glasses and knives and forks, if they are never to be used? That argument produces all this misery; that and others cognate to it. On the present occasion, no doubt, there were excuses to be made. The squire and his niece had been invited on special cause, and their presence would have been well enough. The doctor added in would have done no harm. It was good-natured, too, that invitation given to Mrs Eames and her daughter. The <b>error</b> <b>lay</b> in the parson and his wife. There was no necessity for their being there, nor had they any ground on which to stand, except the party-giving ground. Mr and Mrs Boyce made the dinner-party, and destroyed the social circle. Lady Julia knew that she had been wrong as soon as she had sent out the note.|$|R
