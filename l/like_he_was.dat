5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match on}} the card was the Six-Man tag team match. The Headshrinkers' manager Afa {{interfered}} by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring. At one point, Tatanka looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gaining control, as he began his usual war dance. Bigelow {{kicked him in the}} back of the head, however, to end his momentum. Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win.|$|E

5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 2012, Los Hijos del Averno {{lost the}} CMLL World Trios Championship to El Bufete del Amor ("The Law of Love"; Marco Corleone, Máximo, and Rush). Averno {{was forced to}} team up with {{constant}} rival La Mascara, for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, just <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> for the 2012 tournament. The team worked together without too many problems {{in the first round}} as they defeated the team of El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino, but stumbled in the second round as they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador, Jr. On April 26, 2013, at the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show Averno defeated Místico La Nueva Era to win the vacant Mexican National Welterweight Championship.

5|$|On January 22, 2011, La Máscara {{made his}} Japanese debut, {{when he took}} part in the Fantastica Mania 2011 weekend, co-promoted by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling in Tokyo.

The following night, he, Máscara Dorada and La Sombra successfully defended the CMLL World Trios Championship against La Ola Amarilla (Okumura, Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro Takahashi). In April 2011, La Máscara began feuding with the WWE bound Averno, which led to CMLL booking the two to face each other in a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuesta on June 17. On June 17 at Juicio Final, La Máscara picked up the biggest win of his career by defeating Averno two falls to one and forcing him to unmask himself. Afterwards, La Máscara and Averno continued their rivalry, building up to another singles match on July 4, where Averno successfully defended the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. On July 15, La Generación Dorada lost the CMLL World Trios Championship to Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Ephesto and Mephisto). After La Máscara pinned Averno in a six man tag team match on July 22, the two agreed to another match for the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship on July 29, where Averno was again able to retain the title. La Máscara and Averno faced each other again on September 9 {{in the second round of}} the Universal Championship tournament, where Averno once again was victorious.

The team worked together without too many problems in the first round as they defeated the team of El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino, but stumbled in the second round as they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador, Jr. On April 7, La Máscara returned to New Japan Pro Wrestling at Invasion Attack, where he and Valiente unsuccessfully challenged Tama Tonga and El Terrible for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. On June 30, La Máscara, Rush and Titán defeated Los Invasores (Kráneo, Mr. Águila and Psicosis) to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. On August 13, La Máscara lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to Mephisto.

He declared Mieszko III his guard and made a testament in which declared his cousin Mieszko the Younger, son of Mieszko III, his heir. Shortly afterwards Mieszko the Young started acting <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> already the ruler of Masovia an Kuyavia, so Leszek apologised to Kazimierz II and changed his testament by making Kazimierz II his heir.|$|E

Chin tried to escape, but was held by Nitz in a bear hug while Ebens repeatedly bludgeoned Chin {{with a baseball bat}} until Chin's head cracked open.

25|$|This time, Earnhardt {{was back}} for good, winning six championships {{over the next}} two decades, with crew chiefs Kirk Shelmerdine and Andy Petree, and Goodwrench {{replacing}} Wrangler as the primary sponsor after 1987. In the late 1990s Earnhardt's performance began to slow down, and went through 1997 without a victory. The next year, he won the Daytona 500 after 20 starts, all ending in losses. The year after that one, he was able to score wins at Talladega, as well as cause more controversy, after he spun Terry Labonte out to win a race at Bristol. In 2000, he looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> finally regaining his old form, winning twice and finishing runner-up to Bobby Labonte in points, and his many fans hoped he was gearing up for his record-breaking 8th championship.
