50|$|A NOx {{adsorber}} or NOx trap (also called <b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap,</b> abbr. LNT) is {{a device}} {{that is used to}} reduce oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO2) emissions from a lean burn internal combustion engine by means of adsorption.|$|E
50|$|A major {{research}} activity in his Department is {{the reduction of}} NOx emissions in the oxidizing exhaust emissions of diesel engines. This reduction may be conducted by use of selective Catalytic reduction catalyst (SCR) which required feed of ammonia precursor or by use of <b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>Trap</b> (LNT) which contains expensive precious metals. Another option is the use a reactor with LNT catalyst followed by one with SCR to avoid the need to inject ammonia precursors. Luss and colleagues are conducting both experimental and simulation studies of novel catalyst architecture with goal to enable a reduction of the expensive precious metal without affecting {{the effectiveness of the}} NOx destruction.|$|E
50|$|Reduction in NOx {{emissions}} from compression-ignition engines {{has previously been}} addressed {{by the addition of}} exhaust gas to incoming air charge, known as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). In 2010, most light-duty diesel manufacturers in the U.S. added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet new federal emissions requirements. There are two techniques that have been developed for the catalytic reduction of NOx emissions under lean exhaust conditions: selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> or NOx adsorber. Instead of precious metal-containing NOx absorbers, most manufacturers selected base-metal SCR systems that use a reagent such as ammonia to reduce the NOx into nitrogen. Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of urea into the exhaust, which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia. One trademark product of urea solution, also referred to as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), is AdBlue.|$|E

Examples included in this review are the in-situ determination of the electrical impedance of three-way catalysts based on ceria-zirconia solutions and of <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> of earth-alkaline based coatings, as well as approaches to determine the ammonia loading in Fe-SCR-zeolites with electrical ac measurements. Even more sophisticated approaches based on interactions with electromagnetic waves are also reviewed. For that purpose, metallic stick-like antennas are inserted into the exhaust pipe.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that the degree of loading of several types of {{automotive}} exhaust aftertreatment devices can be directly monitored in situ and in a contactless way by a microwave-based method. The goal of this study was to clarify whether this method can also be applied to NOx storage and reduction catalysts (<b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps)</b> in order to obtain further knowledge about the reactions occurring in the catalyst and to compare the results with those obtained by wirebound NOx loading sensors. It is shown that both methods are able to detect the different catalyst loading states. However, the sensitivity of the microwave-based method turned out to be small compared to that previously observed for other exhaust aftertreatment devices. This may limit the practical applicability of the microwave-based NOx loading detection in <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Real world {{emissions}} of {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NOx) often greatly exceed those achieved in the laboratory based type approval process. In this paper the real world emissions from a substantial sample of the latest Euro 6 diesel passenger cars are presented {{with a focus on}} NOx and primary NO 2. Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) data is analysed from 39 Euro 6 diesel passenger cars over a test route comprised of urban and motorway sections. The sample includes vehicles installed with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (LNT), or selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The results show wide variability in NOx emissions from 1 â€“ 22 times the type approval limit. The average NOx emission, 0. 36 (sd. 0. 36) g km- 1, is 4. 5 times the Euro 6 limit. The average fraction primary NO 2 (fNO 2) is 44 (sd. 20) %. Higher emissions during the urban section of the route are attributed to an increased number of acceleration events. Comparisons between PEMS measurements and COPERT speed dependent emissions factors show PEMS measurements to be on average 1. 6 times higher than COPERT estimates for NOx and 2. 5 times for NO 2. However, by removing the 5 most polluting vehicles average emissions were reduced considerably...|$|R
40|$|Large-bore {{natural gas}} engines {{are used for}} {{distributed}} energy and gas compression since natural gas fuel offers a convenient and reliable fuel source via the natural gas pipeline and distribution infrastructure. Lean engines enable better fuel efficiency and lower operating costs; however, NOx emissions from lean engines are difficult to control. Technologies that reduce NOx in lean exhaust are desired to enable broader use of efficient lean engines. <b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts have demonstrated greater than 90 % NOx reduction in lean exhaust from engines operating with gasoline, diesel, and natural gas fuels. In addition to the clean nature of the technology, lean NOx traps reduce NOx with the fuel source of the engine thereby eliminating the requirement for storage and handling of secondary fuels or reducing agents. A study of <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts for lean natural gas engines is presented here. Testing was performed on a Cummins C 8. 3 G (CG- 280) engine on a motor dynamometer. <b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts were tested for NOx reduction performance under various engine operating conditions, and the utilization of natural gas as the reductant fuel source was characterized. Engine test results show that temperature greatly affects the catalytic processes involved, specifically methane oxidation and NOx storage on the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap.</b> Additional studies on a bench flow reactor demonstrate the effect of precious metal loading (a primary cost factor) on <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> performance at different temperatures.

40|$|Presented is a {{nonlinear}} {{model of}} a, <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> with applications to diagnostics {{and to a}} lean burn engine control strategy for purging NO x from a trap. A <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> purging strategy is proposed based on a fundamental understanding of trap behavior and {{a model of the}} propagating transient reductant front through the trap during purge. ^ Purging a <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> of NOx emissions is challenging for several reasons. First, the engine air/fuel ratio must be controlled such that lean and rich operation are possible. Secondly, spark ignition engine torque changes with air/fuel ratio. Therefore, engine torque control is necessary for lean burn applications. Thirdly, the engine a. ir/fuel ratio purge profile, which determines the rich exhaust gas profile used to purge the lean NO x trap, must accomplish two goals. The profile must be designed such that the fuel economy penalty, during purge, is minimized to ensure the overall fuel economy during both lean and rich operation is maximized. In addition, the purge profile must send reductant to reduce NOx and oxygen stored in the trap without excessive tailpipe emissions. The focus of this work is the development of a <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> model to be used in conjunction with a model based purge profile which meets the aforementioned goals. ^ The purge profile proposed in this work is based on the development of a nonlinear <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> purge model. The model includes critical purging phenomena such as NOx storage and release dynamics, NO x and oxygen reduction dynamics, and includes an on-line stored oxygen estimate. A first principle based chemical model describing the reduction of NOx during purge forms the fundamental <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> purge model. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are considered the most effective reductants and a method of estimating exhaust gas hydrogen content downstream of a catalyst is presented. Validation of the NOx purge model is achieved through engine dynamometer experiments. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-throughput}} (HT) screening platform {{developed at}} hte with the application focus on automotive catalysis is described. hte HT units are configured for performing steady-state testing, {{as well as}} dynamic tests with fast feed switches, such as lean/rich excursions {{for the evaluation of}} NOx storage capacity and efficiency of <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (LNT), ammonia storage capacity for selective catalytic reduction (SCR), evaluation of oxygen storage capacity (OSC), as well as lambda sweep tests for screening of three-way catalysts (TWC). Even though catalysts are screened on a rather small scale (~ 100 mg powder), experience showed that dosing rather complex gas mixtures in concentrations close to that found in real exhaust for the given application is mandatory to generate relevant data. The objective of this work is to give additional insight into HT technology. In the industrial research laboratory, HT screening has matured to become a reliable approach for rapid screening of both reaction parameter spaces, as well as material properties relevant for exhaust gas catalyst development. Due to the speed of optimized screening involving 48 parallel reactors, automated handling of primary data is an imported requirement. Software for data reduction, like estimation of light-off temperature, needs to be robust and handle results for diverse sample libraries in an unattended fashion. In combination with the statistical design of experiment and multivariate data analysis, HT testing has become a valuable enhancement to automotive catalyst development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>Traps</b> (LNT), {{a leading}} {{automotive}} NOx abatement technology, {{have been under}} intense investigation from industry and academia {{for the past two}} decades. This work presents the results of our reaction experiments which simulate the cyclic exhaust conditions over monolithic <b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>Traps</b> (LNT) samples, providing overall performance data, and in situ Diffuse Reflectance Infra-red Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies which provide information about the surface chemistry. Insights from these data, when combined, have enabled conception of physico-chemical models of the NOx storage-reduction processes upon which our mathematical models of trap performance are based. ^ A set of seven LNT formulations with 0. 6 â€“ 6. 3 wt. % Pt and 4 â€“ 20 wt. % Ba on Al 2 O 3 were investigated for their NO x trapping abilities at 300 Â°C, 30000 hrâˆ’ 1. It was found that the initial complete NOx storage ability of the traps depends on the proximity of Ba to Pt and thus on the Pt, Ba loading and dispersion. It was also concluded that the NOx storage occurs via two parallel pathwaysâ€”(1) using the spilled over oxygen as the oxidant for nitrate formation on Ba vicinal to Pt (fast route) and (2) using NO 2 itself as the oxidant via the disproportionation reaction on the remaining Ba sites (slow route). The NO 2 disproportionation rate was also found to be susceptible to the NO 2 partial pressure over the <b>trap,</b> rendering <b>NOx</b> storage less efficient when NO + O 2 was used as the NOx source vs. NO 2 + O 2. DRIFTS showed that bulk-like nitrates were formed on samples with 20 wt. % Ba but existed primarily in the form of surface nitrates on 8 and 4 wt. % Ba samples. Furthermore, the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O in the lean-rich feed led to competitive adsorption on Ba and led to formation of carbonates (20 wt. % Ba) /carboxylates (8 and 4 wt. % Ba), hydroxides and nitrates. In addition, presence of water was found to cause agglomeration of the highly dispersed Ba phase on 8 and 4 wt. % Ba. A phenomenological model was developed to explain all these observed effects on the variety of LNTs. The insights gained from the NOx storage experiments allowed us to speculate that having higher Pt loading near the inlet of the monoliths and lower loadings downstream might prove to be a formulation with higher trapping efficiency and lower cost as compared to the traps with constant Pt loadings across the monolith channel length. ^ Regeneration was studied between 150 â€“ 300 Â°C with H 2 as a model reductant. At 30000 hrâˆ’ 1, the regeneration was found to be H-atom feed rate limited. It was observed that NH 3 was as good a reductant as H 2 and was found that ammonia actually played the role of an intermediate during regeneration with H 2. H 2 O or CO 2 did not have any significant impact on the regeneration mechanism. A â€˜plug flowâ€™ (moving front) model for regeneration was proposed and based on this mechanism it was concluded that to achieve maximum selectivity towards N 2, an incomplete regeneration of the trap was needed since NH 3 escaped only in the absence of NOx downstream of the reductant front. ^ In summary, the fundamental knowledge gained from the experiments could be extended to formulation of more efficient and cheaper LNT systems and optimum strategies for their operation in addition to being used as the building block for a mathematical model of the process.

40|$|An {{independent}} controller {{was proposed}} to perform real-time diagnosis and modeling based control for diesel aftertreatment devices, {{such as the}} diesel particulate filters (DPF) and the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (LNT). The diesel aftertreatment devices for this research were in active flow control configuration. As opposed to passive aftertreatment control where the engine tailors the raw exhaust conditions, in active aftertreatment configuration, the raw exhaust conditions were modified with independent controls, such as aftertreatment temperature control, exhaust flow control, and aftertreatment excess air/fuel ratio (A) control. The determination of the diesel engine transient exhaust gas temperature is essential for effective active flow aftertreatment control schemes. To overcome the slow response of the high-inertia thermocouples used in the harsh diesel exhaust environment, a temperature response model was developed {{as part of this}} research. The temperature response model was verified by tests conducted on a Yanmar NFD 170 single cylinder diesel engine setup. The model was then implemented into a National Instrument PCI- 6023 E multifunction data acquisition board with LabVIEW. The LabVIEW program was tested on the Yanmar engine setup and was capable of estimating the transient exhaust gas temperature in real-time using the temperature data obtained from two high-inertia thermocouples with a proper diameter ratio. The simplified transient aftertreatment model representing the regeneration behavior of the DPF and the performance of the LNT were also proposed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Distributed {{energy is}} an {{approach}} for meeting energy needs that has several advantages. Distributed energy improves energy security during natural disasters or terrorist actions, improves transmission grid reliability by reducing grid load, and enhances power quality through voltage support and reactive power. In addition, distributed energy can be efficient since transmission losses are minimized. One prime mover for distributed energy {{is the natural}} gas reciprocating engine generator set. Natural gas reciprocating engines are flexible and scalable solutions for many distributed energy needs. The engines can be run continuously or occasionally as peak demand requires, and their operation and maintenance is straightforward. Furthermore, system efficiencies can be maximized when natural gas reciprocating engines are combined with thermal energy recovery for cooling, heating, and power applications. Expansion of natural gas reciprocating engines for distributed energy is dependent on several factors, but two prominent factors are efficiency and emissions. Efficiencies must be high enough to enable low operating costs, and emissions must be low enough to permit significant operation hours, especially in non-attainment areas where emissions are stringently regulated. To address these issues the U. S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission launched research and development programs called Advanced Reciprocating Engine Systems (ARES) and Advanced Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (ARICE), respectively. Fuel efficiency and low emissions are two primary goals of these programs. The work presented here {{was funded by the}} ARES program and, thus, addresses the ARES 2010 goals of 50 % thermal efficiency (fuel efficiency) and < 0. 1 g/bhp-hr emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). A summary of the goals for the ARES program is given in Table 1 - 1. ARICE 2007 goals are 45 % thermal efficiency and < 0. 015 g/bhp-hr NOx. Several approaches for improving the efficiency and emissions of natural gas reciprocating engines are being pursued. Approaches include: stoichiometric engine operation with exhaust gas recirculation and three-way catalysis, advanced combustion modes such as homogeneous charge compression ignition, and extension of the lean combustion limit with advanced ignition concepts and/or hydrogen mixing. The research presented here addresses the technical approach of combining efficient lean spark-ignited natural gas combustion with low emissions obtained from a <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalyst aftertreatment system. This approach can be applied to current lean engine technology or advanced lean engines that may result from related efforts in lean limit extension. Furthermore, the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> technology has synergy with hydrogen-assisted lean limit extension since hydrogen is produced from natural gas during the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalyst system process. The approach is also applicable to other lean engines such as diesel engines, natural gas turbines, and lean gasoline engines; other research activities have focused on those applications. Some commercialization of the technology has occurred for automotive applications (both diesel and lean gasoline engine vehicles) and natural gas turbines for stationary power. The research here specifically addresses barriers to commercialization of the technology for large lean natural gas reciprocating engines for stationary power. The report presented here is a comprehensive collection of research conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysis for lean natural gas reciprocating engines. The research was performed in the Department of Energy's ARES program from 2003 to 2007 and covers several aspects of the technology. All studies were conducted at ORNL on a Cummins C 8. 3 G+ natural gas engine chosen based on industry input to simulate large lean natural gas engines. Specific technical areas addressed by the research include: NOx reduction efficiency, partial oxidation and reforming chemistry, and the effects of sulfur poisons on the partial oxidation, reformer, and <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts. The initial work on NOx reduction efficiency demonstrated that NOx emissions < 0. 1 g/bhp-hr (the ARES goal) can be achieved with the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalyst technology.

Such transformations of the barium species are found to significantly promote NO(x) uptake from 250 to 450 C. The increase in the NO(x) uptake for the water-treated samples can be attributed to an enhanced Pt-Ba interaction through the redistribution of barium species.

40|$|Sulfur {{poisoning}} and regeneration of <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> {{were investigated}} using experiments and kinetic modeling. A commercial Pt, Rh and barium containing NOx storage catalyst was used. The catalyst also contained oxygen storage material. First the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was investigated using steps with oxygen and hydrogen. The OSC was substantial {{with a total}} use of all hydrogen (1 %) for about 20 s. The results were similar at the three investigated temperatures (300, 400 and 500 degrees C), indicating {{that it is a}} low activation barrier connected with the process. Further, no effect was observed when adding 15 ppm SO 2 to the feed. Since no SO 2 was observed in the outlet it is possible that SO 2 is adsorbed during the lean period and then reduced to form H 2 S in the rich period (not measured). Further, the NOx storage was found to decrease during SO 2 exposure, and the decrease was linear and dose dependent. In addition, we investigated different regeneration strategies. When using 500 ppm H- 2 for 60 min at 700 degrees C the regeneration was poor. However, when adding 5 % CO 2 to the 500 ppm H- 2 the regeneration was increased drastically. Further, the regeneration was decreased when decreasing the temperature to 600 degrees C, and further decreased when using 500 degrees C. In addition, it was beneficial with increasing the hydrogen concentration. The kinetic model contains three sub-models; (i) NOx storage and regeneration, (ii) oxygen storage and reduction and (iii) sulfur poisoning and sulfur regeneration. It was crucial to add NOx storage on two sites; barium and alumina. The NOx adsorbed on alumina is more loosely bound. Further, in the model formation of sulfates were added on both components. This was important in order to describe the rate of the sulfur deactivation. If sulfur was adsorbed only on barium the deactivation would have been too rapid.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{heavy-duty vehicle}} emission regulations are prompting {{the use of}} PM and NOx aftertreatment systems in the US, the EU and Japan. In the US, the EPA Highway Diesel Rule, which will be fully implemented in 2010, has stimulated debate over whether urea selective catalytic reduction (urea-SCR) or <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (LNT) are the better NOx aftertreatment approach for meeting this new standard. And, if urea-SCR is indeed the preferred option, how can its compliance and infrastructure challenges be overcome during the relatively short window of time between now and 2010. This thesis begins by performing a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of urea-SCR and LNT aftertreatment to determine which technology is more appropriate for use in heavy-duty vehicles and how sensitive that judgment is to changes in key variables, such {{as the price of}} urea. The focus then shifts to an exploration of the various compliance and infrastructure challenges associated with urea-SCR, namely the need to have a replenishable supply of urea. In particular, the actions and policies necessary to surmount those obstacles are discussed. Next, the policies and market factors that {{played a role in the}} EU's successful introduction of urea-SCR are examined and assessed for their ability to be applied in the US context. Finally, the long-term viability of urea-SCR is appraised through an investigation of the potential for competing emission control technologies to emerge and the prospect that urea-SCR becomes adopted by the light-duty diesel market. This thesis concludes by offering both a prognosis for what can be expected to occur between now and 2010, given the current course of action, as well as policy recommendations for how that trajectory might be corrected, such that the introduction of urea-SCR in 2010 is achieved with the maximum air quality benefit at the lowest cost. by Kristian M.

Pt material properties, including dispersion and particle size, {{are known to}} be important factors in determining NOx uptake performance, since Pt provides active sites for NO oxidation to NO 2 necessary for storing NOx as nitrates, and for the reduction of nitrates to N- 2. In this work, the physicochemical properties of Pt in Pt-BaO/Al 2 O 3 LNT catalysts, such as the Pt accessible surface area and particle size, were investigated by using various tools, such as irreversible volumetric H- 2 chemisorption, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), following successive reductive treatments at elevated temperatures.

40|$|Catalyst {{technology}} has been {{an essential element of}} the industrial development of the 20 th century and it had tremendous impact in improving the quality of life. Heterogeneous catalysis has been particularly important for processes involving petroleum refining, chemical production and environmental clean-up. As part of our contribution to the field, this work focuses on understanding specific phenomena linked to NO x abatement processes, hydrogenation of light hydrocarbons and H 2 generation via the water gas shift (WGS) reaction. In all cases, kinetic measurements were conducted and complemented with a combination of techniques such as, x-ray absorption (XAS), infrared (IR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy. ^ The NO oxidation reaction {{is the first step in}} the cyclic operation of <b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>Traps</b> (LNT), a process designed to reduce the amount of NO and NO 2 emitted from lean-burn combustion engines. LNT catalysts are multi-component, consisting of a noble metal (Pt, Pd, Rh), an alkaline or alkaline earth element, and a high surface area support. It is known that NO 2 can be trapped more effectively than NO. Therefore increasing the rate of NO oxidation is highly desirable. Under realistic conditions, however, the trap is exposed to impurities from lubricants and gasoline that can detrimentally affect the catalyst performance. Among these contaminants, sulfur is well known to adsorb strongly on Pt. Part of the work described here focuses on evaluating the effect of pre-adsorbed sulfur on the rate of NO oxidation and the stability of Pt supported on mesoporous silica (SBA- 15). It was found that pre-sulfiding the catalysts did not affect the rate or kinetics of reaction. However, the evidence suggests sulfur adsorption is dynamic depending on the environment. This outcome served as a platform to study the nature of catalyst deactivation with time. Irrespective of the presence of sulfur, it is suggested that platinum oxidation is the main source of deactivation. ^ The effect of sulfur was also studied on a different catalytic system operating under reducing conditions. The goal was to compare the thio-resistance and regenerability of two Pt catalysts supported on Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2. Kinetic measurements for the hydrogenation of ethylene in addition to chemisorption and x-ray absorption (XAS) methods were used to conclude that both supports were similarly affected by sulfur. Regeneration treatments up to 450 ÂºC under H 2 were found ineffective in restoring the rates of the S-free catalysts. The interaction between sulfur poisoning and the occurrence of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) on Pt/TiO 2 is discussed. ^ The final contribution concentrates on developing Pt-based catalysts with WGS turnover rates (TOR) comparable or higher than the commercial Cu formulations and the additional robustness of a noble metal component. First, the addition of alkali (Na, Li, K) was found to promote the TOR (250 ÂºC) by as much as 107 times that of Pt/Al 2 O 3. X-ray absorption measurements confirmed no correlation between the rate promotion and the fraction of oxidized Pt. The change in kinetics suggest that alkali assist in water dissociation steps. The promotion followed the order Na 3 Ì†e Li âˆ¼ K. Based on IR and 13 C isotopic exchange experiments it was proposed that alkali facilitate a parallel path likely involving formate intermediates. The rate enhancement by addition of Fe oxides to Pt catalysts was also investigated. The use of non-porous Al 2 O 3 support with layers of Fe prepared by atomic layer deposition was intended to increase the surface sensitivity of XAS measurements. The data showed that the rate increases with the relative amount of reducible iron, quantified by chemisorption, XAS or XPS.

This smart perovskite displays excellent NOx reduction activities for lean-burn exhausts (NOx conversion > 90 %, N- 2 selectivity > 90 %) over a wide operating temperature range (275 - 400 degrees C), {{as well as an}} extremely high sulfur tolerance. Our results evidenced Pd dissolving into or segregating out of perovskite in lean-burn and fuel-rich atmospheres. The segregated metallic Pd from perovskite in fuel-rich atmospheres is crucial for obtaining these promising achievements.

The {{early years of}} the project focused on reducing the fuel penalty associated with <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> (LNT, also known as NOx adsorber catalyst) regeneration and desulfation. While Navistar pursued engine-based (in-cylinder) approaches to LNT regeneration, complementary experiments at ORNL focused on in-exhaust fuel injection. ORNL developed a PC-based controller for transient electronic control of EGR valve position, intake throttle position, and actuation of fuel injectors in the exhaust system of a Navistar engine installed at Oak Ridge. Aftertreatment systems consisting of different diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) in conjunction with a diesel particle filter and LNT were evaluated under quasi-steady-state conditions.

40|$|Low-temperature {{activity}} and selectivity for <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> reduction over silver/alumina is strongly {{dependent on the}} composition of surface silver species. This motivates the present investigation {{of the role of the}} supported silver species for the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> reduction with methanol. The catalyst samples, with different composition of silver species, are characterized by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD), temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H- 2 -TPR) and temperature programmed desorption with NO (NO-TPD) in oxygen excess. The small differences in acidity do not significantly influence the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> reduction with methanol. However, comparison of results from H- 2 -TPR experiments with previous characterization by UV-vis spectroscopy shows that fairly small silver species are reduced by hydrogen, possibly small silver clusters. These small silver species are likely, in addition to others, involved in the <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> reduction reactions. NO-TPD experiments, in the presence of oxygen and hydrogen, reveal a shift in temperature for one of the desorption peaks from the different samples. This peak is likely related to the shift in temperature for NOx reduction during methanol-SCR conditions for the compared samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Lean-burn {{aftertreatment}} systems using <b>NOX</b> <b>traps</b> {{for reducing}} emissions from diesel exhausts require periodic regeneration after each storage stage. Optimizing these events is a challenging problem {{and a model}} capable of simulating these processes would be highly desirable. This study describes an experimental investigation, which has been designed {{for the purpose of}} validating a <b>NOX</b> <b>trapping</b> and regenerating model. A commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package is used, to model <b>NOX</b> <b>trapping</b> and regeneration, using the porous medium approach.

To validate the model a one-dimensional <b>NOX</b> <b>trap</b> system has been tested on a turbocharged, EGR-cooled, direct injection diesel engine controlled with an engine management system via DSPACE. Fast response emission analyzers have been used to provide high resolution data across the after-treatment system for model validation. Measurements show CO is the primary reductant. After the trap NO and NOâ‚‚ spikes (NOX slippage) were observed both {{at the beginning and end}} of the regeneration period. The former is believed to be due to insufficient reductant. Whilst the model can qualitatively describe the main storage and regeneration phases it failed to predict NOX slippage...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>Trap</b> (LNT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} eective {{after-treatment}} technologies used to reduce NOx emissions of diesel engines. One relevant problem in this context is LNT regeneration timing control. This problem is indeed difficult due to the fact that LNTs are highly nonlinear systems, involving complex physical/chemical processes that are hard to model. In this paper, a novel data-driven model predictive control (D 2 -MPC) approach for regeneration timing of LNTs is proposed, allowing us to overcome these issues. This approach does not require a physical model of the engine/trap system but is based on low-complexity polynomial prediction model, directly identied from data. The regeneration timing is computed through an optimization algorithm, which uses the identied model to predict the LNT behavior. The proposed D 2 - MPC approach is tested in a co-simulation study, where the plant is represented by a detailed LNT model, developed using the well-known commercial tool AMEsim, and the controller is implemented in Matlab/Simulink...|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} barium oxide and {{platinum}} during the sulfation of Pt-BaO/Al 2 O 3 <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts were investigated by S K edge XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and Pt L-III XAFS (X-ray absorption fine structure). All {{of the samples}} studied [Al 2 O 3, BaO(x; x = 8 or 20 wt %) /Al 2 O 3, Pt(2. 5 wt %) /Al 2 O 3, and Pt(2 wt %) -BaO(x; x = 8 or 20 wt %) /Al 2 O 3] were pre-sulfated prior to the X-ray absorption measurements. It was found that barium oxide itself {{has the ability to}} directly form barium sulfate {{even in the absence of}} Pt and gas-phase oxygen. In the platinum-containing samples, the presence of Pt-O species plays an important role in the formation of sulfate species. For the case of the BaO(8) /Al 2 O 3 sample, where the barium coverage is about 0. 26 ML, both baria and alumina phases are available for sulfation. S XANES results show that barium sulfates are formed preferentially over aluminum sulfates. When oxygen is absent from the gas phase, the sulfation route that involves Pt-O is eliminated after the initially present Pt-O species are completely consumed. In this case, formation of sulfates is suppressed unless barium oxide is also present. Pt L-III XAFS results show that the first coordination sphere around the Pt atoms in the Pt particles is dependent upon the gas mixture used during the sulfation process. Sulfation under reducing environments (e. g., SO 2 /H- 2) leads to formation of Pt-S bonds, while oxidizing conditions (e. g., SO 2 /O- 2) continue to show the presence of Pt-O bonds. In addition, a reducing environment was found to cause Pt sintering in greater extent than an oxidizing one. This result explains why samples sulfated under reducing conditions had lower NOx uptakes than those sulfated under oxidizing conditions. Therefore, our results provide needed information for the development of optimum practical operation conditions (e. g., sulfation or desulfation) for <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts that minimize deactivation by sulfurclose 161...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of hydrogen and silver loading on <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> reduction with methanol over Ag-Al 2 O 3 are investigated by flow-reactor experiments, H- 2 -TPR, TEM and XPS. Reduction of silver at low temperatures over Ag-Al 2 O 3 with high silver loading, suggests involvement of silver species/particles that are large (which {{is supported by}} the TEM analysis) and/or loosely bound to the support. The silver species reduced by hydrogen cannot be directly associated with the activity for NOx reduction under methanol-SCR conditions. Furthermore, the activity for NOx reduction increases slightly at low temperatures when hydrogen is added to the feed. However, also without co-fed hydrogen, a high low-temperature activity is achieved for methanol assisted <b>lean</b> <b>NOx</b> reduction over Ag-Al 2 O 3...|$|R
