40|$|A modular and {{scalable}} seamless {{tiled display}} apparatus includes multiple display devices, a screen, and multiple <b>lens</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Each display device is subdivided into multiple sections, and each section is configured {{to display a}} sectional image.

The multiple <b>lens</b> <b>assemblies</b> are configured to merge the projected sectional images to form a single tiled image. The projected sectional images may be merged on the screen by magnifying and shifting the images in an appropriate manner.

40|$|Because of {{the severe}} {{geometrical}} distortion {{induced by the}} optical system and the limited kinetic accuracy of mechanical system in the vision-based mobile-phone <b>lens’s</b> <b>assembly</b> system, the nonlinear, perspective distortion errors and the kinematics errors generally exist in the assembly process of the mobile-phone lens. It is necessary to predict the assembly quality of the vision-based mobile-phone lens’s pick-and-place system so as to eliminate the immediate effect on the assembling process before extracting quantitative assembling. Comparison with current research methods, the back-propagation artificial neural network is applied to predict the assembly quality of the vision-based mobile-phone lens’s pick-and-place system. Firstly, the mobile-phone <b>lens’s</b> <b>assembly</b> quality characteristics are defined and sampled; Secondly, a back-propagation artificial neural network of the mobile-phone <b>lens’s</b> <b>assembly</b> quality prediction is presented; Finally apply some training samples obtained from the experiments to train and test this back-propagation artificial neural network.

The 1971 model year Matadors acquired a [...] "beefier" [...] front end look for all three body designs: two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and station wagon. The AMC Matador shared its basic body design from the firewall back with the Ambassador, which was built on the same platform, but had a longer wheelbase and front-end sheetmetal, a formal grille and luxurious trim, as well as more standard equipment that included air conditioning. Interior wise, it shared the same dash, instrument cluster, steering wheel, and arm rests as the 1970 Rebel. Also reused was the 1967–1970 Rebel [...] "Weather Eye" [...] three-lever fan/heat control unit. The 1971 model came with a split-bench front seat with individual fold-down center arm rests for passenger and driver seats. Externally the 1971 model retained the same trunk lid chrome strip and rear-corner chrome garnishes as the 1970 Rebel.

2500|$|Direction {{refers to}} the shape, quality and {{evenness}} of a lamp's output. [...] The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by three factors. [...] The first are {{the specifics of the}} lamp, reflector and <b>lens</b> <b>assembly.</b> [...] Different mounting positions for the lamp (axial, base up, base down), different sizes and shapes of reflector {{and the nature of the}} lens (or lenses) being used can all affect the pattern of light. [...] Secondly, the specifics of how the lamp is focused affect its pattern. [...] In ellipsoidal reflector spotlights (ERS) or profile spotlights, there are two beams of light emitted from the lamp. [...] When the cones of both intersect at the throw distance (the distance to the stage), the lamp has a sharply defined 'hard' edge. [...] When the two cones do not intersect at that distance, the edge is fuzzy and 'soft'. [...] Depending on which beam (direct or reflected) is outside the other, the pattern may be 'thin and soft' or 'fat and soft'. Lastly, a gobo or break up pattern may be applied to ERSs and similar instruments. [...] This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. [...] It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. [...] Gobos, or templates, [...] come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.|$|E

50|$|The maximum usable {{aperture}} of a lens is specified as {{the focal}} ratio or f-number, {{defined as the}} lens's focal length divided by the effective aperture (or entrance pupil), a dimensionless number.

Larger apertures (smaller f-numbers) provide a much shallower depth of field than smaller apertures, other conditions being equal. Practical <b>lens</b> <b>assemblies</b> may also contain mechanisms to deal with measuring light, secondary apertures for flare reduction, and mechanisms to hold the aperture open until the instant of exposure to allow SLR cameras to focus with a brighter image with shallower depth of field, theoretically allowing better focus accuracy.|$|R
