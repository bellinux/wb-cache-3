50|$|The Danish Mortgage Credit Act imposes strict {{matching}} rules between the assets (e.g., mortgage loans) and the liabilities (e.g., mortgage bonds) of mortgage credit institutions. Each new loan is in principle {{funded by the}} issuance of new mortgage bonds of equal size and identical cash flow and maturity characteristics, dubbed the balance principle or, in, the balanced book principle (p. 29). The proceeds {{from the sale of}} the bonds are passed to the borrower and similarly, interest and principal payments are passed directly to investors holding mortgage bonds. Moreover, the Mortgage Credit Act establishes strict lending rules which differ {{depending on the type of}} property financed. Maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios and lending periods are set up for each category of property. While for all categories of properties, the maximum <b>lending</b> <b>period</b> can be up to 30 years, maximum lending limits differ significantly according to the nature of the mortgaged property. For owner-occupied homes, rental properties, cooperative homes and housing projects, mortgage loans can represent up to 80 percent of the value of the property. In contrast, maximum LTV ratios are limited to 70 percent for agricultural properties, 60 percent for commercial real estate and secondary residences, and 40 percent for un-built sites.|$|E

30|$|The dummy {{variable}} Mb_disclosed equals 1 if the borrower of a loan has disclosed his microblog, otherwise it equals 0. The {{dummy variable}} Cmp {{is a time}} variable, which takes the value of 0 or 1 for periods prior to or after the disclosure campaign. Controls represent a vector of loan characteristics, such as loan amount, interest rate, and <b>lending</b> <b>period.</b> The main parameter of interest is β 3. The result of β 3 is negative (− 0.652) and significant (p[*]<[*] 0.01), suggesting that this campaign negatively influenced the default probability of the loans whose borrowers have disclosed their social media account. One possible reason is that these borrowers care about social stigma costs.

30|$|Prosper is {{the first}} {{peer-to-peer}} lending marketplace in the United States, currently with over two million members and $ 692 million of funded loans. 5 Prosper offers unsecured loans with fixed rates. The loans are fully amortized over the <b>lending</b> <b>periods</b> of 3 or 5  years. Prosper’s current mechanism works as follows. A borrower creates a loan request, specifying the purpose of loan and the loan amount. A customers specific interest rate is calculated using Prosper’s internal models and listed for potential lenders to view. Lenders then compete to provide portions of the loan on first-come basis. This {{is known as a}} posted-price mechanism. 6 Prior to December 20, 2010, Prosper followed the auction model in setting the lending rate. In this mechanism, the borrower lists an amount and a reserve rate. The reserve rate is the maximum rate, she is willing to take on for the loan. Lenders then bid on both the loan amount and an offer rate. At the close of the bidding process, the loan application is considered successful if the total loan amount bid by the lenders is no less than the requested amount. Only lenders bidding lower offer rates than the requested reserve rate are considered in determining the total loan amount. This mechanism is a uniform price mechanism where each winning lender receives the same rate.|$|R
40|$|The {{consequence}} of the economic crisis, the access of the external financing resources was narrowed significantly and lenders had became more cautious. This meant that the external source providers analyze more thoroughly the source claimants, and {{they also need to}} be more aware of their situation, to submit well founded loan applications to financial institutions. The other aspect is why the indicators presented in the study, the firms should be addressed much more thoroughly than ever before to have a much better understanding their situation, to recognize the sources of internal funding opportunities, and to use more efficiently the available internal resources. However, analysts should be aware of which are the ratios which should be paid a special attention and which ones are essential to assess a given situation, knowing them they can properly inform the leaders as well as to give an appropriate help to the decision makers. To ensure the appropriate level of internal resources the company's activity is continuous financing closely related to the working capital management.

The research describes the subjective quality of Sipus V 3 software, its statistical information output, and the use of the output in decision making process. The research employs a questionnaire method to collect data and its respondents are 44 librarians involving in Sipus V 3 and 26 persons working at the information management department responsible for the statistic output of Sipus V 3.

40|$|Provision of {{electrical}} infrastructure in emerging economies, like Indonesia, is very challenging post the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Constrained lending via international finance markets {{has led to}} a {{reduction in the number of}} investors and shorter <b>lending</b> <b>periods</b> for public private partnerships (PPPs) projects. While domestic Indonesian investors and banks have begun to be involved in such projects, the scale of budgetary requirements for the delivery of power plant projects generally exceeds the financial capacity of both the public sector and local financial markets. This paper presents the findings of a Delphi style survey and proposes implementation strategies that may overcome current investment constraints and still attain Value for Money (VfM) from the delivery of Indonesian PPP power projects post the 2008 GFC. Initially, qualitative data was acquired from two industry seminars to establish the context of Indonesian PPP power projects. This was followed by two rounds of the Delphi technique to develop consensus among a panel of industry experts about realizing VfM from Indonesian PPPs. The results show that (i) export credit agencies from regional Asian countries have increased their roles to support PPP power projects (ii) structural deficiencies of local power industry manufacturing has created barriers for greater roles of local finances in the projects (iii) enhanced contractual risk allocation between the public and private sector can potentially improve project outcomes; these involve greater transparency and accountability of project guarantee processes. This study adapted key implementation features for attaining VfM into short, medium, and long term development strategies that are suitable for Indonesia. It has been concluded that a sustainable energy system can be realized when there is alignment of interests between the government, project sponsors, fuel suppliers, and lenders.

However, the economic literature demonstrates that creditors' lending standards become more stringent (lax) when credit is rationed (abundant) suggesting that they value voluntary disclosure from borrowers differentially across credit market regimes. I draw upon the economic and finance literature on credit rationing to test whether the effects of voluntary disclosure on firms' cost of debt capital is greater during periods of credit rationing. I provide some evidence that confirms this prediction. Moreover, I provide some evidence that this relation is stronger for smaller firms than larger firms during periods of credit rationing suggesting that creditors value voluntary disclosure more from firms that have fewer resources to cover the increased agency cost of <b>lending</b> during <b>periods</b> of credit rationing...|$|R
