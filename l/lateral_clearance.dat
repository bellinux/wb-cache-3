It is further verified that speed distortions in intermediate and high density region induced by assumption of constant <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> requirements can be revised by introducing its variability characteristics. In addition, two contrastive impacts of lateral drift behavior are observed. That is, it causes speed fluctuation in low density while alleviating the speed fluctuation in relatively high density.

50|$|The 1916 {{station was}} built of brick and {{stone in the}} current Beaux-Arts {{architecture}} style with a vitrified tile waiting room and monumental wooden benches. It served three 12-car-length island platforms with enclosed seating areas situated between three pairs of tracks (main and yard leads). Originally the platform surfaces were level with the floors of the railroad passenger cars, but they were later lowered {{to the level of}} the track, reportedly due to substandard <b>lateral</b> <b>clearances</b> between the platforms and carbodies caused by the tracks' partially curved alignment when lengthier cars came into use; the change further spared train crews the inconvenience of having to lower and raise trap doors over the coach stairwells for this single station alone when platform levels of the other stations on this commuter route were not elevated to match. One of the platforms was removed altogether. Access to the platforms was available by stairways at the Penn Ave., South Ave., and Franklin Ave. underpasses, in addition to the station tunnel which also served as the Ross Ave. pedestrian underpass. There was also a separate tunnel at the station to deliver mail, express, and baggage to the platforms (a U.S. post office was later constructed across the street from the station, forming a sort of civic center in conjunction with the municipal building/public library, also across the street).

30|$|Heterogeneous traffic {{conditions}} prevail in developing countries. Vehicles maintain weak lane discipline which increases lateral interactions of vehicles significantly. It {{is necessary to}} study these interactions {{in the form of}} maintained lateral gaps for modeling this traffic scenario. This paper aims at determining lateral clearances maintained by different vehicle types while moving in a heterogeneous traffic stream during overtaking. These data were collected using an instrumented vehicle which runs {{as a part of the}} stream. Variation of obtained clearance with average speed of interacting vehicles is studied and modeled. Different instrumented vehicles of various types are developed using (1) ultrasonic sensors fixed on both sides of vehicle, which provide inter-vehicular lateral distance and relative speed; and (2) GPS device with cameras, which provides vehicle type and speed of interacting vehicles. They are driven on different roads in six cities of India, to measure lateral gaps maintained with different interacting vehicles at different speeds. Relationships between lateral gaps and speed are modeled as regression lines with positive slopes and beta-distributed residuals. Nature of these graphs (i.e., slopes, intercepts, residuals) are also evaluated and compared for different interacting vehicle-type pairs. It is observed that similar vehicle pairs maintain less <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> than dissimilar vehicle pairs. If a vehicle interacts with two vehicles (one on each side) simultaneously, <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> is reduced and safety of the vehicles is compromised. The obtained relationships can be used for simulating <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> maintaining behavior of vehicles in heterogeneous traffic.|$|E
30|$|In {{the best}} model, {{it is found}} that the {{negative}} sign of the coefficient for LC means that Density moderately decreases with the increase of LC.

Consequently, the wider LC slightly improves LOS on horizontal curves. This result is consistent with logic.|$|E

This subanalysis assesses the effect of dose of rtPA by region on clearance of IVH. METHODS: Sixty-four patients within 12 to 24 hours of spontaneous IVH were randomized to placebo or 0. 3 mg, 1 mg, or 3 mg of rtPA twice daily through an extraventricular drain. Twelve subregions of the ventricles were scored from 0 to 4. Effect of dose on IVH clearance to 50 % of baseline score was compared by survival analysis for all regions combined and by subregion. Models including ventricular region, dose, and baseline score were compared by Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS: IVH score reduced faster across all regions with increasing rtPA dose (clearance to 50 %: log-rank P< 0. 0001; placebo- 11. 43 days, 95 % CI, 5. 68 - 17. 18; 0. 3 mg- 3. 19 days, 1. 00 - 5. 38; 1 mg- 3. 54 days, 0. 45 - 6. 64; 3 mg- 2. 59 days, 1. 72 - 3. 46). In the combined models, dose and baseline score were independently associated with reduction in IVH score, which was quickest in the midline ventricles, then the anterior half of the lateral ventricles and slowest in the posterior half of the <b>lateral</b> ventricles (<b>clearance</b> to 50 %: P< 0. 0001; rtPA dose: hazard ratio, 1. 47, 1. 30 - 1. 67; midline versus anterolateral hazard ratio, 1. 71, 1. 08 - 2. 71; midline versus posterolateral hazard ratio, 4. 05, 2. 46 - 6. 65; baseline score hazard ratio, 0. 96, 0. 91 - 1. 01) with a significant interaction between dose and ventricular region (P= 0. 005).

30|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> (LC) is the sidewise safety spacing {{maintained}} by a vehicle with neighboring vehicles when it travels through a traffic stream. Along with the longitudinal gap, LC {{is an important}} parameter in heterogeneous traffic streams with weak lane discipline, and is affected by several factors including type of vehicle, vehicle speed, driver behavior and external factors. Heterogeneous traffic results in larger variation in individual vehicle’s speed and no lane-discipline behavior during overtaking or interacting with other vehicles. Thus, a study is needed which develops a model of LC {{for each type of}} vehicles, or rather, between pairs of different vehicle types. Previous studies by Gunay [1] made consideration for loose lane discipline and function of available width for overtaking vehicles, whereas Pal and Mallikarjuna [2] and Mallikarjuna et al.

30|$|Some {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to establish the relationship between speed and <b>lateral</b> (or transverse) <b>clearance</b> maintained by interacting vehicles. Pal and Mallikarjuna [2] collected data and evaluated the average lateral gap versus percentage area occupancy relationship in heterogeneous traffic. In a later study [3], it was found that lateral gaps maintained by vehicles vary with respect to their speeds and vehicle types. A commercial software ‘TRAZER’ which automatically collects traffic data based upon image processing of a recorded traffic stream was used in this research; however, data extracted from this software suffers from serious accuracy issues at different levels. A continuum model by Nair et al. [10] or a pore space model by Ambarwati et al. [11] has been devised based upon available minimum spacing between vehicle corners, referred as pores. These models do not consider vehicle speeds in developing relationships of distances between vehicles with other traffic parameters like area occupancy. Linear relationship between LC and speed was assumed in many heterogeneous simulation models, such as the HETEROSIM model developed by Arasan and Koshy [12], the CASIM model by Maurya and Chakraborty [13] and the unidirectional model by Metkari et al. [14]. Validation of these models was limited to macroscopic parameters only. Potential field model (conceived by Chakraborty et al. [15]) can also be extended for heterogeneous conditions, if different vehicle-type parameters are introduced and lateral parameters are calibrated properly.|$|R

This paper reports the results of a driving simulator study, which sought to analyze the effects that three cross-section configurations of a two-lane rural road and four geometric elements of the road have on driver behavior, during the interaction with a cyclist. A two-lane rural road, about 11  km long, was designed and implemented in an advanced-interactive driving simulator. Three different cross-sections (all with same width, but with and without a bicycle lane and for different widths of bicycle lane) were tested. Forty participants carried out three driving sessions (one for each road alignment with different cross-section) and were exposed to the condition of bicycle traffic along four geometric elements of the alignment (2 tangents with different lengths, right curve and left curve). The driving simulator experiments were designed in such a way that, along the sections where the driver–cyclist interactions occurred, the oncoming traffic was absent. Overall, 468 speed profiles and 468 lateral position profiles were plotted to obtain the descriptive variables of the driver behavior during the interaction with the cyclist. The influences of cross-sections, geometric elements and bicycle traffic conditions on driver behavior were evaluated by a multivariate variance analysis. The presence of the cyclist determined different levels of influence on driver's trajectory for the three cross-sections. A wider bicycle lane ensured a higher later clearance distance between driver and cyclist, allowing safer overtaking maneuver. The interferences of the cyclist on driver's behavior depended on the geometric elements. On tangents, the lowest lateral clearances were recorded and no speed reduction was observed, compared to the cyclist absence condition. On the left curve, the higher <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> was recorded, due to the concordant tendencies of the driver {{to move away from the}} cyclist and to cut the curve. This determined an excessive and risky displacement of the vehicle to the opposing lane, whose criticality was also emphasized by the high speed adopted by the driver. On the right curve, the <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> was higher than that recorded on the tangents, probably due to the necessity of the driver to perform the demanding maneuver of entering in the right curve, which also determined a speed reduction compared to the cyclist absence condition. The obtained results provide suggestions for the most efficient cross-section reorganization of existing two-lane rural roads in order to improve the road safety...|$|E
30|$|Among {{environmental}} factors, {{high traffic}} density, narrow lane width, high horizontal curve grade, {{rising and falling}} gradients and limited <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> are related to increased incident rates (Oppenheim and Shinar 2012; Martens and Jenssen 2012). In particular rising and falling gradients is highlighted {{to increase the number}} of HGV and bus fires in Austria (Rattei et al. 2014). The area where the gradient goes from falling to rising is accident prone due to a likely abrupt change in speed (Martens and Jenssen 2012), which is also confirmed by Norwegian tunnel incident statistics (Nævestad and Meyer 2014). Tunnel entry portals have a high accident frequency, probably due to changing lighting conditions. The provision of traffic and safety information is necessary to improve driving behaviour and safety; but there is also a risk in providing too much information. In particular, information should be restricted 200  m before the tunnel entrance since then most drivers focus on the tunnel portal. It has been seen that many vehicles continue entering a tunnel even though traffic signals indicate the tunnel is closed, instead some kind of physical obstacle should be used (Martens and Jenssen 2012).|$|E
40|$|External {{gear pumps}} and motors are robust and low cost {{components}} and {{are widely used}} in industrial and mobile applications; nowadays however, optimal global efficiency represents a more crucial aspect to be considered when designing a hydraulic machine. For this reason, it becomes a primary necessity to investigate the phenomena which determine and affect the hydraulic machine total efficiency. In this work, the volumetric efficiency of external gear pumps is investigated {{by means of a}} mathematical model already presented in a previous paper and the results obtained are compared with experimental data. First of all, the mathematical model is briefly presented; then the predicted results are discussed considering the influence of the pump operating conditions. Moreover, the influence on the volumetric efficiency of the behaviour of the hydraulically balanced bearing blocks, and hence of the pump axial balance, is exposed. In particular, it is shown that the tilted position of the bearing blocks and the height of the <b>lateral</b> <b>clearance</b> can greatly affect the volumetric efficiency. The data coming from an experimental investigation carried out on commercial external gear pump units are then presented; both the volumetric and the mechanical efficiency have been measured. The comparison between the experimental data and the numerical results allows discussing the bearing blocks balancing behaviour during pump operation...|$|E
