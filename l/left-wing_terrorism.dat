40|$|The {{dynamics}} of terrorism seem {{to follow a}} double track evolution. On the one hand, terrorism presents at the beginning a strong ideological component, {{particularly in the case}} of <b>left-wings</b> oriented <b>terrorism.</b> As events unfurl, terrorism drifts further apart from its original objectives. In the final stage, the ideological component relate almost exclusively to the ideology of violence for its own sake. On the other hand, the state ideological commitment to the preservation of the state creates a process whereby terrorism movements are being increasingly « marginalized ». The state administrative legal and political functions bring about a process through which terrorists, henceforth, are perceived as criminals. The case of the Red Brigades in Italy is used to illustrate this double track process...|$|R
2500|$|Despite these changes, in {{the months}} that the {{kidnapping}} of Aldo Moro developed and executed, no Secret Service was designed to combat internal subversion. The committees were acting according to old standards: the planning of measures to be taken in case of emergency dating back to the 1950s, and it hadn't been updated even after the alarming growth of terrorism. This was {{due to the fact that}} the country had spread an atmosphere of resignation (if not indulgence) to the <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism,</b> because in the trials defendants get extenuating circumstances, Prima Linea was considered a simple subversive association (instead of an armed gang) and a part of the judiciary harbored hostility towards the State and was sympathetic to the revolutionary myths; so that the political scientist [...] said that terrorism had become [...] "a historical phenomenon understandable (though not justifiable) in a period of social change thwarted by a corrupt political class".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, the US State Department {{released}} 1,080 {{pages of}} declassified State Department documents which {{revealed that the}} Administration of US President Jimmy Carter had grown increasingly hostile towards the 1976 junta due to its human rights violations and that former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was derailing efforts to weaken the junta by fueling tensions between Carter's Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and his national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Other State Department documents have indicted that the Gerald Ford Administration which preceded the Carter Administration was strongly sympathetic to the junta and that in October 1976, Kissinger had managed to strengthen the junta by successfully advising Argentina Foreign Minister César Guzzetti {{to carry out his}} anti-Communist policies [...] "before Congress gets back." [...] These documents also reveal that President Carter initially congratulated the Argentine Military Junta for combating <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> without quarter. Nevertheless, it has also been documented that the US government did not have either direct involvement or direct knowledge of the developments leading up to coup or the subsequent developments which followed.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{chronology}} of the repression is still debated, however, and some sectors claim the long political war started in 1969. Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist guerrillas {{as early as}} 1969, and individual cases of state-sponsored terrorism against Peronism and the left {{can be traced back}} to the Bombing of Plaza de Mayo and Revolución Libertadora in 1955. The Trelew massacre of 1972, the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance since 1973, and Isabel Martínez de Perón's [...] "annihilation decrees" [...] against left-wing guerrillas during Operativo Independencia (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War. The left-wing guerrillas and their support base, were responsible for causing at least 6,000 casualties among the military, police forces and civilian population, according to a National Geographic Magazine article published in the mid-1980s. Proyecto Desaparecidos estimates that 500–540 members of the Armed Forces and police were killed combating <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> from 1976–83, but does not reveal the number of civilians believed to have been killed or wounded (including the armed forces and police wounded) at the hands of the guerrillas during this period.|$|E

40|$|A unique dataset {{is used to}} {{separately}} {{analyze the}} social origins of <b>left-wing</b> and nationalist-separatist <b>terrorism</b> in 17 Western European countries between 1970 and 2007. We argue that {{the differences in the}} historic roots, ultimate goals as well as their negotiability, levels of domestic and international support, and politico-military strategies of these types of ideologically or ethnically motivated terrorism make it plausible that they respond differently to specific social conditions and changes. We show that there are indeed factors that matter either to left-wing (e. g., the Cold War, leftist party strength) or nationalist-separatist terrorism (e. g., ethnic polarization, non-violent protest). However, both types of terrorism are robustly associated with larger populations and higher unemployment rates. This suggests that both may be ameliorated through social progress, even though ethnic terrorism seems to respond more strongly to socio-economic and political incentives (e. g., economic progress, political participation). Finally, we show that a pooling of terrorism data - which disregards motivational bonds, but is nevertheless common in empirical analyses - may mask the role of otherwise relevant terrorism correlates in distinct types of terrorism...|$|R
40|$|Warning: On 16 January 2015, {{following}} a police intervention in Verviers {{and in the}} aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, the Belgian government announced a series of measures against radicalization and terrorism. They are said to include the extension of terrorist offences, the extension of the use of special investigation techniques, the enlargement of the possibility to withdraw Belgian nationality and to withdraw temporarily the identity cards and passports, the implementation of the freezing of assets at the national level, the possibility to call on the army for specific surveillance missions and the strengthening of the analysis capacities of Belgian intelligence services. INTRODUCTION A. Belgian Experience with Terrorism Until recently, the terrorist threat with which Belgium was confronted was far more limited than in other Member States (MS) of the European Union (EU), such as Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. However, this does not mean that it was totally nonexistent. Like many other Western European states, during the first half of the 1980 s, Belgium faced extreme <b>left-wing</b> domestic <b>terrorism,</b> especially the activities of the so-called cellules communistes combattantes (CCC). Although this group committed numerous terrorist attacks that resulted in the death of two firefighters and injury to three others, their seriousness was more limited than those performed by the German Rote Armee Fraktion (RAF) or the Italian Brigate Rosse. During the late 1980 s and 1990 s, no significant terrorist threat was recorded. But the situation changed about ten years ago. According to intelligence and investigative authorities, the international terrorist threat, especially that related to radical Islamist terrorism, has become a major concern in Belgium. The country serves as an operating base for terrorist Jihadist groups, cells or networks; recruitment and training of terrorists have been organised from Belgium, and Belgium does not escape from the phenomenon of radicalization and homegrown terrorism. In this regard, the existence of more or less organised and structured recruitment network(s) to go to fight in Syria are worrying. Lone wolves and self-radicalisation are also included among Belgian terrorist threats. Action has been taken to face the radicalisation threat, for instance, with the adoption in 2005 of a ‘national counter-radicalism plan’ and a more recent federal programme of prevention of violent radicalisation.

2500|$|During {{the height}} of Argentine <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism,</b> the Cubans used their embassy in Buenos Aires to {{maintain}} direct contact with Argentine guerrillas. In 1973, the Montoneros merged with the Cuban-backed FAR (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias or Armed Revolutionary Forces) that in 1972 had planted a bomb in the Sheraton hotel in Buenos Aires that killed a Canadian tourist. On 13 February 1974, a clandestine meeting was held in Mendoza, Argentina, and the Junta de Coordinacion Revolucionaria (JCR or Junta of Revolutionary Coordination) was formed. The JCR consisted of four guerrilla groups: the Uruguayan Tupamaros (MLN-T), the Chilean Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) and the Bolivian Revolutionary Army (ELN). The ERP guerrillas maintained a guerrilla warfare training school, an arms factory, and a false documentation center in Argentina. These were all closed down in 1975 by Argentine security forces. In 1976, ERP guerrillas started receiving training in Cuba on an 1800 hectare (7 square miles) estate near Guanabo {{as well as at}} another site in Pinar del Rio. In July 2008, Fidel Castro admitted that he backed left-wing radicals and guerrilla forces in Argentina in order to start an armed revolution: [...] "The only place where we didn't promote a revolution was in Mexico. In the rest (of Latin America) we tried, without exception." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Nunca Más {{report issued}} by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) in 1984, about 9,000 people had [...] "disappeared" [...] between 1976 and 1983. According to a secret cable from DINA (Chilean secret police) in Buenos Aires, an {{estimate}} by the Argentine 601st Intelligence Battalion in mid-July 1978, which started counting victims in 1975, gave the figure of 22,000 persons. This estimate was first published by John Dinges in 2004. Estimates by human rights organizations were up to 30,000. The Montoneros admitted losing 5,000 guerrillas killed, and the ERP admitted the loss of another 5,000 of their own guerrillas killed. By comparison, Argentine security forces cite 775 deaths of their own. In contrast, there were 13,500 victims of <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> in Argentina. There is no agreement on {{the actual number of}} detenidos-desaparecidos. In an interview with Buenos Aires daily Clarin in 2009, Fernandez Meijide, who formed part of the 1984 truth commission, claimed that the documented number of Argentines killed or disappeared was closer to 9,000. The Asemblea por los Derechos Humanos (APDH or Permanent Assembly for Human Rights) estimated the number of disappeared as 12,261, which included [...] "definitive disappearances" [...] and PEN detainee survivors of the clandestine detention centres spread throughout Argentina. The total figure of official prisoners was 8,625 and of these PEN detainees 157 were killed after being released from detention. Between 1969 and 1979 left-wing guerrillas accounted for 3,249 kidnappings and murders. CONADEP also recorded 458 assassinations (attributed to the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance) and about 600 forced disappearances during the period of democratic rule between 1973 and 1976.|$|E
50|$|<b>Left-wing</b> <b>{{terrorism}}</b> (sometimes called Marxist-Leninist {{terrorism or}} revolutionary/left-wing terrorism) is terrorism meant to overthrow conservative or capitalist systems {{and replace them}} with Marxist-Leninist, socialist, or Anarchist societies. <b>Left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> also occurs within already socialist states as activism against the current ruling government.|$|E

50|$|<b>Left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{began in}} 1969 when the Proletarian Revolutionaries and Proletarian Socialists formed the Federation of Revolutionary Youth of Turkey (Dev-Genç).

5000|$|<b>Left-wing</b> <b>{{terrorism}}</b> has {{its roots}} in 19th and early 20th century anarchist terrorism and became pronounced during the Cold War. [...] Modern <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> developed {{in the context of the}} political unrest of 1968. In Western Europe, notable groups included the West German Red Army Faction (RAF), the Italian Red Brigades, the French Action Directe (AD), and the Belgian Communist Combatant Cells (CCC). Asian groups have included the Japanese Red Army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, although the latter organization later adopted nationalist terrorism. In Latin America, groups that became actively involved in terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s included the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, the Peruvian Shining Path, and the Colombian 19th of April Movement.|$|E
5000|$|According to Sarah Brockhoff, Tim Krieger and Daniel Meierrieks, while <b>left-wing</b> <b>{{terrorism}}</b> is ideologically motivated, nationalist-separatist {{terrorism is}} ethnically motivated. They {{argue that the}} revolutionary goal of <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> is non-negotiable, whereas nationalist terrorists {{are willing to make}} concessions. [...] The rigidity of the demands of left-wing terrorists may explain their lack of support relative to nationalist groups. [...] Nevertheless, many on the revolutionary left have showed solidarity for national liberation groups employing terrorism, such as Irish nationalists, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the South American Tupamaros, seeing them as engaged in a global struggle against capitalism. Since nationalist sentiment is fueled by socio-economic conditions, some separatist movements, including the Basque ETA, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Irish National Liberation Army incorporated communist and socialist ideology into their policies.|$|E

5000|$|According to George Michael, [...] "right-wing {{terrorism}} and violence {{has a long}} history in America". Right-wing violent incidents began to outnumber Marxist incidents in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. Michael observes the waning of <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> accompanying the rise of right-wing terrorism, with a noticeable [...] "convergence" [...] of the goals of militant Islam with those of the extreme right. Islamic studies scholar Youssef M. Choueiri classified Islamic fundamentalist movements involving revivalism, reformism, and radicalism as within the scope of [...] "right-wing politics".|$|E
5000|$|In 1972 Carstens {{was first}} elected into the Bundestag, {{of which he was}} a member until 1979. From May 1973 until October 1976 he was {{chairman}} of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, succeeding Rainer Barzel. During that time he was an outspoken critic of left-wing tendencies in the German student movement and particular accused the governing Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) of being too soft on left-wing extremists. He also famously denounced the author and Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll as a supporter of <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> (specifically, the Baader-Meinhof Gang) for his 1974 novel The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Italy {{endured the}} Years of Lead, a period {{characterized}} by frequent terrorist attacks {{from both the}} far-left and the far-right. between 1969 and 1982, the nation suffered 8,800 terrorist attacks, in which a total of 351 {{people were killed and}} 768 were injured. Right-wing terrorism was dominant in Italy from 1969 to 1974, while <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> was dominant in the late 1970s. The Years of Lead are considered to have begun with the Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan in December 1969, perpetrated by Ordine Nuovo, a right-wing neofascist group. Sixteen people were killed, and 90 injured, in the bombing.|$|E
5000|$|From the outset, the {{editorial}} drift was conservative and nationalist. The GDR {{was referred to}} as the Soviet Occupation Zone (German: Sowjetische Besatzungszone or SBZ). The usage continued well into the 1980s, when Bild began to use the GDR's official name cautiously, putting it in quotation marks. Bild (along with fellow Springer tabloid B.Z.) heavily influenced public opinion against the German student movement and <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> in the years following 1966, and was blamed by some for the climate that contributed to the assassination attempt on activist Rudi Dutschke in 1968—a popular catchphrase in left-wing circles sympathetic to student radicalism was [...] "Bild hat mitgeschossen!" [...] ("Bild shot at him too!").|$|E
5000|$|Modern left-wing {{terrorist}} {{groups in the}} United States developed from remnants of the Weather Underground and extremist elements of the Students for a Democratic Society. Between 1973 and 1975, the Symbionese Liberation Army was active, committing bank robberies, two murders, and other acts of violence. Most notably, the group kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst. During the 1980s, both the May 19th Communist Organization (M19CO) and the smaller United Freedom Front were active. A 2001 study found [...] "Leftist extremists were responsible for three fourths of the officially designated acts of terrorism in America in the 1980s." [...] After 1985, following the dismantling of both groups, one source reports there were no confirmed acts of <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> by similar groups.|$|E
5000|$|While Orden {{served as}} the eyes and ears of the {{security}} forces in rural areas, the military was confronted with a growing new phenomenon in the urban setting, that of <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Soon after the failed coup attempt of 1972, kidnappings for ransom and hit-and-run attacks on government buildings and other targets became increasingly common in San Salvador. The groups claiming credit for the majority of these actions were the People's Revolutionary Army (Ejercito Revolucionario del Pueblo—ERP) and the Farabundo Marti Popular Liberation Forces (Fuerzas Populares de Liberacion Farabundo Marti—FPL), both radical offshoots of the PCES (the ERP was the new designation of [...] "the Group" [...] that had killed Regalado in 1971).|$|E
50|$|On 7 April 1979, {{at the age}} of forty-six, Antonio Negri {{was arrested}} for his part in the Autonomy Movement, along with others (Emilio Vesce, Luciano Ferrari Bravo, Mario Dalmaviva, Lauso Zagato, Oreste Scalzone, Pino Nicotri, Alisa del Re, Carmela di Rocco, Massimo Tramonte, Sandro Serafini, Guido Bianchini, and others). Padova's Public Prosecutor Pietro Calogero accused them of being {{involved}} in the political wing of the Red Brigades, and thus behind <b>left-wing</b> <b>terrorism</b> in Italy. Negri was charged with a number of offenses, including leadership of the Red Brigades, masterminding the 1978 kidnapping and murder of the President of the Christian Democratic Party Aldo Moro, and plotting to overthrow the government. At the time, Negri was {{a political science professor at}} the University of Padua and visiting lecturer at Paris' École Normale Supérieure. The Italian public was shocked that an academic could be involved in such events.|$|E
