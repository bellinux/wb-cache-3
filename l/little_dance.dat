500|$|Oldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' {{independence}} {{with the}} Beatles' obligation to record in EMI's studios, saying {{it made them}} appear as [...] "mere mortals... sweating in the studio for the man". He promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty counterpoints to the Beatles by having the band pose unsmiling {{on the cover of}} their first album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as [...] "Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?", although Wyman says [...] "Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally.... never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively". In a 1972 interview, Wyman stated [...] "We were the first pop group to break away from the whole Cliff Richard thing where the bands did <b>little</b> <b>dance</b> steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{reception in}} trade publications, but some advertisements would boast {{the power of}} the film or {{go so far as to}} call it a great American drama. The The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "As a sketch of country folk, admirable because it is true. The situations are well worked out. The conversion! Could it be? A New England church meeting would be a good place to exhibit and - ask questions." [...] Though the reviewer in the The New York Dramatic Mirror however disagreed that the premise was plausible, [...] "A [...] old deacon forms the complicating element in this rather conventional and rather improbable story. That a girl could become a comic opera star without the knowledge of her parents is a strain for the imagination. That a simple <b>little</b> <b>dance</b> like the one in the picture could effect such a conversion is another tax on belief. The acting is good, especially in the heroine's role. The deacon displays an unnatural tendency in such a stern character when he rapturously kisses the photograph of his daughter." [...] It is unknown if the character of Deacon Sanders is really a church deacon because the synopsis states Deacon Sanders is a farmer who is [...] "nearly as poor as he is religious".|$|E
500|$|Teri VanHorn of MTV {{said that}} with [...] "Her body newly toned and her smile beaming, she looked every bit like {{a woman who had}} emerged from her quarter-life crisis {{stronger}} than yesterday." [...] She also said Spears performed with [...] "a naughty, free-spirited attitude", as though she [...] "had invited 900 friends to her dirty <b>little</b> <b>dance</b> party, and too bad for you if you couldn't roll with the fun." [...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you want to call it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nixon {{later told}} Soap Opera Digest that she always planned on pairing Dimitri with Erica, but held {{off to see}} if they worked well together. [...] "Long before their {{relationship}} started, viewers were saying that Erica and Dimitri belong together," [...] she said. [...] "They have great chemistry and are very alike, kindred spirits." [...] Nixon wrote the beginning of the couple's story as a love-hate relationship where they both disliked each other. The dislike became an attraction that resulted in a [...] "tug-of-war" [...] type of story. [...] "We can't even define it as a romance," [...] Nader said. [...] "It has to be defined as a positioning of players. Dimitri is very well aware that he has to dance a <b>little</b> <b>dance</b> with her." [...] Nixon made the relationship different from Erica's other ones. In previous romances, she acted as the aggressor. In this one, Nixon positioned Dimitri as the one who pursued Erica and made the first sexual overtures. She also used the Erica and Dimitri relationship as a way of developing a new, more sexual side of Dimitri. Nader said, [...] "There was a part of Dimitri that he never explored before because he married so young. A part of him shut down. But now, there is a whole other aspect of his sexual nature that has been awakened and Erica is about that. [...] a lot more fire with her." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{came the}} very serious affair of the ball. The Marchesa had asked that her dear little friend Ayala Dormer might {{be allowed to}} come over to a <b>little</b> <b>dance</b> which her own girls were going to have. Her own girls were so fond of Ayala! There would be no trouble. There was a {{carriage}} which would be going somewhere else, and she would be fetched and taken home. Ayala at once declared that she intended to go, and her Aunt Emmeline did not refuse her sanction. Augusta was shocked, declaring that the <b>little</b> <b>dance</b> was {{to be one of the}} great balls of the season, and pronouncing the whole to be a falsehood; but the affair was arranged before she could stop it.|$|E

60|$|Striped Chipmunk was whisking about {{among the}} brown-and-yellow leaves {{that covered the}} ground {{on the edge of}} the Green Forest.

60|$|Had it been otherwise, I must {{long ago}} have perished; {{but as it}} was, it is {{surprising}} how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride.

50|$|The Chamber Symphony has {{usually been}} {{compared}} to his colleague Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 1, with Alex Ross pointing that the work has more personality and invention than anything by Shostakovich {{from the same period}} while lacking Shostakovich's rock-solid sense of form, his Beethovenian aura of inevitability. Also relating the work to Igor Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat and Paul Hindemith's Kammermusik, he praised the Largo as absolutely magical and the fast passages with its rhythmic surprises, unusual tonal combinations, nasty <b>little</b> <b>dances</b> that start and stop.|$|R

60|$|With an air {{of smiling}} coquetry {{he had never seen}} before, Pauline {{stretched}} out a truly Spanish foot and offered him its dainty covering. Won by the animation of her manner, Manuel forgot his misgivings and played his part with boyish spirit, hovering about his stately wife as no assiduous maid had ever done; for every flower was fastened with a word sweeter than itself, the white arms kissed as the ornaments went on, and when the silken knots were deftly accomplished, the lighthearted bridegroom performed a <b>little</b> <b>dance</b> of triumph about his idol, till she arrested him, beckoning as she spoke.|$|E

60|$|We {{carried him}} to a {{neighbouring}} sunny parlour, where ivy embowers all {{the walls and the}} sun lies all day. There he revived a <b>little,</b> <b>danced</b> up and down, perched on a green spray that was wreathed across the breast of a Psyche, and looked then like a little flitting soul returning to its rest. Towards evening he drooped; and, having been nursed and warmed and cared for, he was put to sleep on a green twig laid on the piano. In that sleep the little head drooped--nodded-- fell; and little Hum went where other bright dreams go--to the Land of the Hereafter.|$|R
