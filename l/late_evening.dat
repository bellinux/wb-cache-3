5|$|Two of the lines, 400 and 500, are {{designated}} as providing inner services. These operate along the Drammen Line to Asker, along the Trunk Line to Lillestrøm and the Østfold Line to Ski, stopping at all stations. The six other line, {{which make up}} the outer services, only make occasional stops on these sections. The inner services operate with a normal headway of 30 minutes, with 15 minutes offered in one direction during rush hour. In <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> {{and parts of the}} weekend, this is further reduced to 60 minutes. NSB's outer routes operate with a normal headway of 60 minutes, with rush-hour services offered at 30-minute intervals and <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> service provided every 120 minutes. Services between Årnes and Kongsvinger is limited to five daily services, and from Mysen to Rakkestad with four daily services. The Gjøvik Line runs with a 40-minute headway, with three different stopping patterns. One calls at all stations until Hakadal, one calls at most stations until Jaren, while one is an express service that runs the line's full length to Gjøvik.|$|E
5|$|After a heavy, {{concentrated}} artillery barrage, the White Guards began advancing {{from house}} to house and street to street, as the Red Guards retreated. In the <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> of 3 April the Whites reached the eastern river banks of Tammerkoski. The Reds' major attempts to break the siege of Tampere from outside, along the Helsinki-Tampere railway, failed. The Red Guards lost the western parts of the town between 4 and 5 April. The Tampere City Hall was among the last strongholds of the Red troops. The battle ended 6 April 1918 with the surrender of Red forces in the Pyynikki and Pispala sections of Tampere.|$|E
5|$|At the Sci-Fi Dine-In, lunch guests {{stay for}} an average of fifty minutes and dinner guests {{for an average}} of just longer than an hour, with lunch and dinner guests being served their food on average five and ten minutes after {{ordering}} respectively. The restaurant participates in the Disney Dining Plan. Meals are served starting at 10:30a.m. on Sundays and Wednesdays, and starting at 11:00a.m. every other day of the week. The restaurant closes each day {{at the same time that}} the park does, which is in the <b>late</b> <b>evening.</b> The menu is the same all day, without a distinction between lunch and dinner. A full bar service is available, and there is also a limited wine selection.|$|E
60|$|That {{was good}} advice, {{but it was}} too <b>late.</b> <b>Even</b> as Tommy Tit spoke, a sharp face with red, angry eyes was thrust out of Happy Jack's doorway. It was the face of Shadow the Weasel.|$|R
60|$|Eunice tottered {{back against}} the door. Her hand went up to her side {{in a way that}} had been getting very common with her of <b>late.</b> <b>Even</b> in the midst of her {{excitement}} Caroline noticed it.|$|R

"Bothered by Dulac’s non-conformist ideas, {{disturbed}} by her impure origins, the censors had refused the article which, only after vigorous protest by {{the editor-in-chief of}} the magazine, appeared three weeks <b>late.</b> <b>Even</b> dead, Germaine Dulac still seemed dangerous..." ...|$|R
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|Gwyn {{died in the}} <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> of July 17, 1906 while {{visited his}} daughter, Mrs. Frank L. Rehn (Margaret), {{at her home in}} Yonkers, New York.

His body was taken back to Philadelphia, where he was interred in the Woodlands Cemetery following a military funeral on July 19, 1906. He was buried in the cemetery plot section E, Lot 33 that he bought over fifty years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Hiei was {{attacked}} repeatedly by Marine Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo planes from Henderson Field, Navy TBFs and Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from , which had departed Nouméa on 11 November, and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the United States Army Air Forces' 11th Bombardment Group from Espiritu Santo. Abe {{and his staff}} transferred to Yukikaze at 08:15. Kirishima was ordered by Abe to take Hiei under tow, escorted by Nagara and its destroyers, but the attempt was cancelled because {{of the threat of}} submarine attack and Hieis increasing unseaworthiness. After sustaining more damage from air attacks, Hiei sank northwest of Savo Island, perhaps after being scuttled by her remaining crew, in the <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> of 13 November.|$|E
6000|$|Beatrice {{could have}} answered, [...] "Not at all;" [...] but she said, [...] "O never mind, it can't be helped; {{we should be}} <b>late</b> <b>even</b> {{if we were to}} set off now, and besides we might be caught and stopped." ...|$|R
60|$|Falgate gasped--a {{helpless}} fool--while Mainwaring hurled himself {{forward to}} prevent the thing he saw impended. Too <b>late.</b> <b>Even</b> as he flung out his hands to grapple with his lordship, Rotherby's arm drove straight before him and sent his sword through the undefended back of Mr. Caryll.|$|R
50|$|After this {{succession}} of delays {{it was too}} late for TF 34 to give any practical help to 7th Fleet, other than to assist in picking up survivors from Taffy 3, and too <b>late</b> <b>even</b> to intercept Kurita's force before it made its escape through San Bernardino Strait.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{squall line}} that {{developed}} from near Dallas to Kansas City moved eastward throughout the <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> and overnight hours causing numerous reports of damaging wind {{along with many}} spin-up tornadoes from Louisiana to Ohio and Indiana. It then moved through the southeast U.S. during the early morning hours. Additional strong thunderstorms developed ahead of the front across the southeast during the overnight and early morning hours. A record (at the time) of five tornado emergency declarations were issued on February 5; four for Tennessee, and one in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Saberkas Weekend Market {{is located}} at Sarbekas Commercial Centre. It opens in <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

5|$|Towards midday, the 79th Reserve Division {{was ordered}} to {{recapture}} the portions of its third line lost during the progression of the Canadian attack. However, {{it was not until}} 6:00pm that the force was able to organize and counterattack, clearing the Canadian Corps troops out of the ruined village of Vimy but not recapturing the third line south of the village. By night time, the German forces holding the top of the ridge believed they had overcome the immediate crisis for the mean time. Additional German reinforcements began arriving and by <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> portions of the 111th Infantry Division occupied the third line near Acheville and Arleux, with the remainder of the division arriving the following day.|$|E
50|$|Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205 (2007), is a Supreme Court of the United States case {{in which}} the Court {{determined}} that the federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to hear habeas appeals that are filed <b>late,</b> <b>even</b> if the district court said the petitioner had additional time to file.|$|R

5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
50|$|When {{the narrator}} returns home, he is {{met with a}} crowd of people outside his house. His wife has {{committed}} suicide: she has jumped out of the window while holding an icon.

60|$|The {{messenger}} {{eventually found}} the Duke {{in the courtyard}} of the Admiral's house, standing over the Admiral's dead body, which his assassins had flung down from the bedroom window. Guise laughed, and stirred the head of the corpse with his foot, answering that the message came too <b>late.</b> <b>Even</b> as he spoke the great bell of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois began to ring for matins.|$|R
5|$|On May 5, the SPC {{issued a}} high risk of severe weather for Central Kansas and central Nebraska, while {{moderate}} and slight risks for severe weather extended for areas far beyond. The low pressure system in place moved northward, but the extending front had barely moved. The storms were quick to develop. Severe weather reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during the early afternoon hours. The most intense activity took place during the late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the <b>late</b> <b>evening,</b> but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E
5|$|The French {{arrived in}} Armenia in the <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> on Friday, December 9 and {{relieved}} the exhausted Armenian workers who {{then returned to}} Yerevan. Japan sent a monetary gift of $9 million while Italy had {{plans to build a}} prefabricated village for the victims, and West Germany offered to send more than a dozen heavy cranes. The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, {{refused to}} {{recognise}} the Whites Guard's power status, {{and decided to}} establish a military authority of their own. Aaltonen placed the Red power base in Helsinki. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January 1918, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the Uprising, was lit in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' Hall. The large scale mobilization of the Reds began in the <b>late</b> <b>evening</b> of 27 January, with the Helsinki Guard {{and some of the}} Guards located along the Viipuri-Tampere railway having become active between 23–26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolsheviks' weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment; 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of Kämärä in the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918.|$|E
