5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per <b>land</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would be more difficult to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed <b>land</b> <b>unit</b> with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|Loughor Castle was {{constructed}} {{on the western}} edge of the Welsh commote, or <b>land</b> <b>unit,</b> of Gwyr. The castle was built shortly after 1106, when Henry de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick, was given the Gower Peninsula by Henry I. The Anglo-Norman colonisation of the region followed, with Gower becoming a Marcher territory, enjoying extensive local independence. Loughor Castle was strategically important because it controlled the main road running through Gywr from Beaumont's main base at Swansea Castle, and was a valuable coastal port. The castle took its name from a corruption of the title of the Roman fort.|$|E
50|$|Military {{units in}} Victoria {{are divided into}} two types: land and naval. <b>Land</b> <b>units</b> fight against enemy <b>land</b> <b>units,</b> and can occupy enemy provinces. They {{are the key to}} {{military}} supremacy. Naval units provide a more supportive role; bombarding enemy <b>land</b> <b>units</b> and fighting sea battles. Some naval units can also transport <b>land</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{observation}} {{system of}} the iVLBI consists of three sub-systems. These include (1) two or more <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> on the Moon, (2) an orbiter orbiting around the Moon, and (3) a ground station. Phase differences among radio waves that are transmitted on the Moon are monitored through the orbiter. An antenna/receiver on the ground station receives radio waves from all the <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> on the Moon simultaneously, and phase differences can be measured among the radio waves received at the ground station. The range differences among the <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> and the antenna of the ground station can be obtained after correcting for the phase differences among radio waves transmitted from the <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> on the Moon. Tides and rotational variations of the Moon can be detected with a higher accuracy using the iVLBI system than is currently possible with VLBI observation or lunar laser ranging on the Earth. The accuracy of the range difference between two <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> and the antenna on the Earth depends on the measurement error of the phase {{difference between the two}} <b>landing</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{predominant}} fauna or food rich {{wildlife and}} animal species encountered in the Ashanti Kingdom were the hen, sheep, goat, duck, turkey, rabbit, guinea fowl, fish, and the porcupine national symbol of the Ashanti Kingdom, as well as about thirty multipurpose flora species of trees and shrubs and over thirty-five ornamental plants beautifying the Ashanti Kingdom environs. These tree/shrub-crop-animal (hen/fish) components were intensively integrated spatially and/or sequentially on the same <b>land</b> <b>unit</b> of individual Asante houses.|$|E
500|$|The government, {{at higher}} levels, was closely {{modelled}} after the Magadhan and Satavahana administrative machinery. The empire {{was divided into}} Maharashtrakas (provinces), then into smaller Rashtrakas (Mandala), Vishaya (district), Bhoga (group of 10 villages) {{which is similar to}} the Dasagrama unit used by the Kadambas. At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of VikramadityaI even mentions a <b>land</b> <b>unit</b> called Dasagrama. In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the Gangas, the Banas and the Sendrakas. Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of mahajanas (learned brahmins) looked after agraharas (called ghatika or [...] "place of higher learning") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 mahajans and Aihole which was served by 500 mahajanas. Taxes were levied and were called the herjunka– tax on loads, the kirukula– tax on retail goods in transit, the bilkode– sales tax, the pannaya– betel tax, siddaya– land tax and the vaddaravula– tax levied to support royalty.|$|E
2500|$|During the Ptolemaic period, the cubit strip square was {{surveyed}} using {{a length}} of 96 cubits rather than 100, although the aroura was still figured to compose 2756.25m². A 36sq.cubit area {{was known as a}} kalamos and a 144sq.cubit area as a hamma. The uncommon bikos may have been 1½hammata or another name for the cubit strip. The Coptic shipa (...) was a <b>land</b> <b>unit</b> of uncertain value, possibly derived from Nubia.|$|E

30|$|Radio waves {{emitted from}} {{two or more}} <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> on the lunar surface are {{received}} by an antenna at the Earth station, and the range differences between these <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> are measured with an error of several millimeters. The phase differences between the oscillators of these <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> are monitored via an orbiter that orbits around the Moon. We have developed a simple roundtrip method to obtain these phase differences and also propose a method of calibrating the system delay on the ground. In order to observe {{the rotation of the}} Moon and monitor the phase differences effectively, we designed the position of the <b>landing</b> <b>units</b> and the orbit of the orbiter. Further, we concurrently analyzed the characteristics of the common view period. The error of the system was analyzed and to have a high accuracy. The results show that inverse VLBI technology can be used to measure the rotation of the Moon and new scientific results can be obtained.|$|R
