25|$|No {{polygonal}} {{path between}} two points is {{shorter than the}} line between them. This implies that no curve can have an arc length less than the distance between its endpoints. By definition, the arc length of a curve is the least upper bound of the lengths of all polygonal approximations of the curve. The result for polygonal paths shows that the straight line between the endpoints is shortest of all the polygonal approximations. Because the arc length of the curve is {{greater than or equal}} to the length of every polygonal approximation, the curve itself cannot be shorter than the straight <b>line</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} {{regarding}} how one measures direction for this purpose. Some say one should face the direction {{which would be}} the shortest distance to Jerusalem, i.e. the arc of a great circle, as defined in elliptic geometry. Thus in New York one would face north-northeast. Others say one should face the direction along a rhumb <b>line</b> <b>path</b> to Jerusalem, which would not require an alteration of compass direction. This would be represented by a straight line on a Mercator projection, which would be east-southeast from New York. In practice, many individuals in the Western Hemisphere simply face due east, regardless of location. In the presence of an ark that does not face Jerusalem, one should pray toward the ark instead.|$|E
500|$|Since then, general {{relativity}} has been acknowledged as {{the theory that}} best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From {{the perspective of the}} object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight <b>line</b> <b>path</b> in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as [...] "gravitational force".|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{approaches to}} topologically segmenting 2 D time-dependent vector fields. For {{this class of}} vector fields, two important classes of lines exist: stream <b>lines</b> and <b>path</b> <b>lines.</b> Because of this, two segmentations are possible: either concerning the behavior of stream <b>lines,</b> or of <b>path</b> <b>lines.</b> While topological features based on stream lines are well established, we introduce <b>path</b> <b>line</b> oriented topology as a new visualization approach in this paper. As a contribution to stream line oriented topology we introduce new methods to detect global bifurcations like saddle connections and cyclic fold bifurcations {{as well as a}} method to tracking all isolated closed stream lines. To get the <b>path</b> <b>line</b> oriented topology we segment the vector field into areas of attracting, repelling and saddle-like behavior of the <b>path</b> <b>lines.</b> We compare both kinds of topologies and apply them to a number of test data sets.

Topological methods aiming in capturing the asymptotic behavior of <b>path</b> <b>lines</b> rarely exist because <b>path</b> <b>lines</b> are usually only defined over a fixed time-interval, making statements about their asymptotic behavior impossible. For the data class of periodic vector fields, this restriction does not apply any more. Our approach detects critical <b>path</b> <b>lines</b> as well as basins from which the <b>path</b> <b>lines</b> converge to the critical ones.
