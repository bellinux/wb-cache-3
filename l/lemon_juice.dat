5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E

5|$|After ReaLemon {{met with}} success in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} {{it into the}} United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging to mislead consumers by confusing their product with Jif.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Jif's product launch in 1956, it was marketed with the tagline 'Real <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in a Jif'. In 1956, Jif was the sole brand of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> {{packaged}} in a squeeze pack container in the United Kingdom. The new Jif brand used the packaging developed by Edward Hack.|$|E

5|$|The plastic lemon {{container}} {{and the idea}} of marketing <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in this manner was also undertaken independently by Stanley Wagner, a businessperson in the frozen food industry, and also a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Wagner's plastic lemon was produced by Shipton, a plastics company. Wagner was with the company Coldcrops, Ltd., which produced Realemon. The Realemon trademark was developed and used for a <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> product based upon reconstitution in the 1940s. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter with their own design. It is of intrigue to some that both Pugh and Wagner were both former Royal Air Force pilots.|$|E
5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultrafiltration}} {{of orange}} and <b>lemon</b> <b>juices</b> {{has been investigated}} on a pilot-plant scale at constant concentration using tubular configuration polymeric and ceramic membranes. The permeate fluxes {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on the tangential feed velocity at the membrane but almost independent of the driving force at average pressures over the membrane greater than ≈ 0. 2 MPa. These results are due to the formation of a pectin-pulp deposit on the membrane, which effectively controls the ultrafiltration. Because of their different surface structures and roughness this deposit has different properties for the ceramic and polymeric membranes. This causes the latter to behave as rough tubes. The ceramic membranes give higher permeate fluxes at a lower Reynolds number than the polymeric membranes. This and their smooth tube behaviour indicate the possibility of greater energy efficiency for the industrial application of the ceramic than of the polymeric membrane...|$|R
