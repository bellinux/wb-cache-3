30|$|Although many works address urban <b>logistics</b> <b>assessment</b> and evaluation, and {{propose a}} plethora of {{indicators}} [35, 37 – 39], {{most of them have}} a common point: they can be calculated from the estimation of total travelled distances and times. The economic aspects can be evaluated by defining {{the costs and benefits of}} the urban logistics system and assessing the system’s viability. The environmental assessment can be carried out to identify the main impacts of the system on the environment and estimate them. Regarding social evaluation and assessment, it is still difficult to produce quantitative consensual evaluations, although congestion, employment and satisfaction seem the easiest indicators to quantify. A serious social assessment would require a more qualitative approach, with interviews with the main interested parties (for example employees, inhabitants of the city, customers of the food service).

The {{object of}} this article is a comparative analysis, systematization of assessment methods and methodological approach development to assess the <b>logistics</b> outsourcing <b>assessment</b> of the innovatively active enterprise. The results of the analysis. Due to our research, five approaches for outsourcing assessment were identified. The first approach suggests such way of outsourcing efficiency assessment: when index of outsourcing effectiveness is considered as a difference between the costs in a case; when process is conducted, using the enterprise resources and in a case, when the process is conducted by another enterprise. The second approach includes the calculation of index of outsourcing effectiveness. The third approach includes the assessment criterion of outsourcing effectiveness development. The fourth approach includes methods that combine enterprise income and expenses variation. The fifth approach includes the assessment of outsourcing effectiveness, which is based on change of performed function quality. The existence of multiple assessment methods of outsourcing effectiveness and disadvantages of their usage make it difficult to find acceptable solutions for methodological practice and also make the widely usage of the above mentioned methodological approaches in the process of the outsourcing effectiveness assessment impossible. It is especially subject to logistics outsourcing of the innovatively active enterprise, because indexes for its assessment are not quantitative, but they are qualitative. Special attention is paid to such indexes as confidentiality, skill level of workers, enterprise flexibility to customer requirements, availability of the necessary certificates and so on. To conduct the <b>logistics</b> outsourcing <b>assessment</b> of the innovatively active enterprise such stages are proposed:The assessment of the implementation expediency of logistics outsourcing. This stage includes: 1. Detection of function(s) for transferring to outsourcing. 2. Creation of set of Fn indexes to assess the quality and cost of functions performing. 3. Determination of regulatory value of Fnmin and Fnmax indexes. 4. Calculation of In index. 5. Calculation of the feasibility index of function I outsourcing / insourcing). Selection of logistics provider. This stage includes: 1. Logistics providers detection. 2. Formation of the providers assessment criteria and their validity. 3. Assessment of outsourcers criteria. 4. Calculation of the relative assessment of companies indexes. 5. The decision-making according to logistics functions for outsourcing). Conclusions and directions of further researches. The systematization of assessment methods of the enterprise outsourcing is performed in the article. Methodological approach for <b>logistics</b> outsourcing <b>assessment</b> of the innovatively active enterprise is suggested. This methodological approach is based on a comparative assessment of the most important performance characteristics that provide implementation of the functions for two variants: insourcing and outsourcing.

40|$|Although Operation Desert Storm {{has been}} heralded as a marvel in logistics, it was plagued with inefficiencies. Because of {{decreases}} in lift capacity since the Gulf War, and {{in anticipation of}} future operations that will likely evolve more rapidly, the U. S. needs better tools to develop efficient logistics plans. The Warfighting and <b>Logistics</b> Technology <b>Assessment</b> Environment (WLTAE) developed by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory simulates the effects of logistical decisions on operational outcomes. WLTAE tracks the flow of units and materiel into ports in theater via a Time Phased Force Deployment Data List (TPFDDL) that remains fixed throughout the simulation, regardless of concurrent port damage. Responding to degradations of ports is an essential feature of robust planning, and requires continuous updates of the TPFDDL. We show how to modify a TPFDDL and its planned flow of supplies into a theater to account for changes in port capabilities. First, the, flows of materiel in the TPFDDL are aggregated into notional ships by a ship-loading heuristic. Second, these notional ships are rescheduled as' necessary to alternate ports and/or arrival dates by a ship reassignment heuristic. The solution quality of each heuristic is objectively assessed by comparison with a respective optimal solution to an equivalent mathematical programming model. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} logistics {{system is}} {{critical to the success of}} military operations. Recently, the Department of Defense (DoD) has begun to move from a ''just in case'' logistics system that relies on large stores of inventoried materials toward a ''just in time'' system based on obtaining and delivering supplies when and where they are needed. For this new logistics concept to operate smoothly and responsively and be highly robust, one must understand the interrelationships between warfighting and logistics, such as the impact of losses of logistics links/nodes and the changing pace of warfighting operations.

40|$|Background: The Samoan {{population}} {{is a growing}} population and one with an estimated high incidence of aphasia. Language assessment with bilingual individuals {{is said to be}} a challenging area of Speech-Language Therapy practice. Language assessment of bilingual Samoan-English speakers with aphasia is a field with limited research, and the specific experience of the individuals involved is an important factor to consider in improving SLT practice with this population. Aims: The current thesis aimed to explore the experience of language assessment of bilingual Samoan-English speakers with aphasia as perceived by those involved in the assessment process. Method: Two qualitative studies were utilised to address the aims, the first was a single case study observing the process of language assessment of a bilingual Samoan-English speaker with aphasia and follow-up interviews with other participants involved. The second study was a focus group with Speech-Language Therapists who had experience with language assessment of bilingual Samoan-English speakers with aphasia. Outcome and results: The results of the case study revealed eight themes: language assessment of bilingual Samoan-English speakers with aphasia is a hard process for the individuals involved; language assessment of bilingual Samoan-English speakers with aphasia is a team process; differences in understanding of communication impairments and the assessment process; time; preparation; appropriateness of assessment tasks, resources, and processes; uncertainty; and flexibility. The results of the focus group indicated eight categories: Speech-Language Therapists’ background, using interpreters, family involvement, Samoan language and culture, getting an initial impression of and building rapport with the individual with aphasia, assessment tasks and resources, determining which language(s) to assess and <b>logistics</b> of <b>assessment.</b> Conclusion: Language assessment of bilingual Samoan-English speakers with aphasia is a challenging area of Speech-Language Therapy practice. Challenges are multifaceted and although some challenges may be present in all language assessment with individuals with aphasia, they are further exacerbated by the addition of multiple languages, people, and culture.

40|$|Field {{teaching}} is an indispensable feature of geoscience education, at all levels. However, delivering effective field experiences is challenging under many circumstances – not least for distance {{students such as}} Open University (OU) undergraduates. Hence, OU geoscience modules over the last 25 years have featured virtual field trips (VFTs), exploiting a range of formats, typically delivered via CD-ROM, DVD or web browser. 2013 saw a dramatic reboot with the launch of Virtual Skiddaw, a field exercise framed in a multi-user virtual environment that was created using 3 D gaming software (Unity 3 D). Virtual world field trips (VWFTs) offer a wealth of new opportunities for online field learning. Advances in scanning and photogrammetry make detailed observation possible, while the digital landscape and ambient audio foster immersion. Rather than merely trying to replicate an outdoor field trip, the VWFT can also go ‘beyond fieldwork’: users can access aerial perspectives; drape the digital landscape with different imagery (e. g. maps); teleport and fly to save time; call up subsurface cross-sections; even fade other avatars out if they are obscuring the view! The multi-user capability enables collaborative work, even among groups that are widely dispersed, as OU students are. There are times when a VFT can replace physical fieldwork, for example for those who cannot access the outdoor locations. However, we regard their primary role as support for physical field teaching, so that students can {{make the most of}} their, often limited, time in the field: pre-trip familiarisation and orientation, followed by post-trip revision, reflection or extension – for both educators and students; introducing basic fieldwork concepts and <b>logistics,</b> risk <b>assessment,</b> and even some fieldwork skills – for instance to students with no prior field experience – to alleviate anxiety and build confidence. For example, in Virtual Skiddaw both mapwork and compass skills can be practised {{in the context of a}} 3 D landscape.

Even for the most studied fisheries in the north Atlantic, the uncertainty regarding what is actually caught has implications for management.

Distant and high sea fisheries often suffer from poor sampling due to sampling personal <b>logistics.</b> Consequently, stock <b>assessment</b> and management of marine fish resources exploited by those fisheries are based on poor or scarce catch data.
