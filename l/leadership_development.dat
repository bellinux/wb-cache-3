5|$|The White Stag <b>Leadership</b> <b>Development</b> Program, {{founded in}} 1958, is {{a summer camp}} for youth 11-18 led by two California-based non-profits that sponsor <b>leadership</b> <b>development</b> activities. The teen youth staff of the two {{programs}} develop and produce several week-long leadership summer camps every year for several hundred youth from Central and Northern California and a few youth from other states and countries. The outdoors program is based on hands-on learning methods to develop competencies.|$|E
5|$|During a {{thorough}} study, the national BSA staff interviewed participants, parents, and leaders. They distributed questionnaires to program participants, reviewed the White Stag literature, and observed {{the program in}} action. They also conducted a statistical analysis of troops taking part in White Stag and compared them to non-participating units. In December 1965, Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton received the White Stag Report. It stated that offering <b>leadership</b> <b>development</b> to youth was a unique opportunity for Scouting to provide a practical benefit to youth and would add substantial support to Scouting's character development goals. It recommended that Wood Badge {{should be used to}} experiment with the <b>leadership</b> <b>development</b> principles of White Stag. The program had until this time taught the adults the same Scoutcraft skills a boy was required to learn to become a First Class Scout along with concepts of the patrol method.|$|E

5|$|Pilot-testing and {{experimentation}} continued {{for three more}} years. An experimental junior leader training program was begun in 1969.

5|$|Bánáthy was {{promoted}} {{as a junior}} officer of the Royal Hungarian Army and served {{on the faculty of}} the Ludovika Akademia under his mentor, Commandant Colonel-General Kisbarnaki General Farkas. Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered. Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the Hungarian Scout Association at the time. Bánáthy became committed to training the young men in officer's leadership skills; he served as the voluntary national director for youth <b>leadership</b> <b>development</b> {{and a member of the}} National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge <b>Leadership</b> <b>Development</b> (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event {{conducted by a}} lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, {{on the role of}} advisers in the OA.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} before his {{retirement}} on August 1, 1965, the national council began a program to update the Wood Badge program and shift its emphasis from teaching Scoutcraft to leadership skills. After he was officially retired, his opinion was still sought after and respected. Dr. John W. Larson, Director of Boy Scout Leader Training for the National Council, was working with Béla H. Bánáthy and Bob Perin, Assistant National Director, Volunteer Training Service, to adapt the leadership competencies of the White Stag <b>Leadership</b> <b>Development</b> Program into a new Wood Badge syllabus.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis, entitled Understanding <b>Leadership</b> and Management <b>Development</b> in a Health Board of NHS Scotland, {{is completely}} written by Jireh Hooi Inn Seow for submission {{to meet the}} partial requirements of the Doctor of Philosophy. This doctoral research is {{in the field of}} <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development.</b> It explores and seeks to understand healthcare <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development</b> in a region (officially called a Health Board) of NHS Scotland. It employs a qualitative methodology, anchored within a broad approach of interpretivism, and the fieldwork data collection methods of interviewing and participant observation to inform the objective of this study, which is to investigate the prominent behavioural attributes, values, attitudes, traits, ways of thinking and feelings, or actions exhibited by the research subjects who are emergent Scottish healthcare leaders and managers. This research involves two stages of data collection where the second round of interviews takes place slightly {{more than a year after}} the first round. After reviewing the literature on seven popular <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development</b> practices or programme, and after the analyses of qualitative empirical data from the fieldwork, this research provides the discovery of how the healthcare professionals are developed as well as an understanding of a mechanism underlying their <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development.</b> The application of meme theory, the main theoretical lens of this research, reveals the workings of a memetic mechanism behind <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development.</b> Thus, this main contribution of this research is the addressing of the relative shortage of research publication on <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development,</b> particularly on the mechanisms underlying <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development,</b> by showing how healthcare professionals are developed into leaders and managers via the spread, replication, transmission, and acquisition of memes; this study then offers suggestions of how <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development</b> programme could be designed in light of such a memetic <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development.</b> The main contribution of this research also includes the discovery of <b>leadership</b> and management <b>development</b> memes which are then categorised into four memeplexes labelled as the Altruism Memeplex, the Motivation Memeplex, the Motivating Memeplex, and the People-developing Memeplex. In addition, a minor contribution of this study is a novel interview data collection method in the research design that incorporates 360 -degree feedback...|$|R

Activities include the classroom courses, physical training, <b>leadership</b> <b>development,</b> and drill & ceremonies. Encampments are usually held at the wing (state) level and, when available are usually at military installations, preferably active United States Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard installations, with military support.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the {{perceptions}} of the Solomon Island school leaders on the value of the <b>leadership</b> training and <b>development</b> programme which they completed. A qualitative research design was employed for the study. Interviews were conducted with the participants who attended the <b>leadership</b> training and <b>development</b> program to gather data needed for the study. Analysis of the data showed that prior to the <b>leadership</b> training and <b>development</b> program the school leaders faced a lot of challenges in leading their schools because they possessed limited knowledge and skills on leadership. On the other hand, the analysis of the data showed that the <b>leadership</b> training and <b>development</b> program has contributed positively in meeting the myriad demands of work expected of them. The findings of the study have implications to the performances, in turn, productivity of those school leaders who have not gone through the <b>leadership</b> training and <b>development</b> program. Added to that the findings have implications for the much needed support for school leaders especially the need to mount <b>leadership</b> training and <b>development</b> programs for them to improve their knowledge, skills, attitude, beliefs and values in order to enhance school’s overall performance...|$|R
