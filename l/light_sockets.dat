This posed many challenges in the early development of commercial electricity, because just about everything was made out of wood or other flammable materials.

Leviton is most famous for its Decora wall switch, the flat low profile form factor which replaced the standard toggle switch in many homes and office.|$|E
50|$|Lightbulb sockets, <b>light</b> <b>sockets</b> lamp sockets or lampholders provide {{electrical}} {{connections to the}} lamps and support it in the lighting fixture. The use of sockets allows lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for these lampholders, created by de facto and by various standards bodies. A general coding system is a letter or abbreviation followed by a number. Some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to wires; some reflector lamps have screw terminals for wire connections.|$|E
50|$|A {{light switch}} {{combined}} with a <b>light</b> <b>socket</b> is sometimes installed in basement or utility areas of homes. The switch is operated by a pull chain or cord. It is also possible to have the cord-operated switch separate from the <b>light</b> <b>socket,</b> which is particularly common in British bathrooms. Until 2001 it was a requirement of the UK wiring regulations that all bathroom switches were operated by pull cords.|$|R

50|$|The Yeon Building is a {{historic}} 59.13 m, 15-story office building completed in 1911 in downtown Portland, Oregon. Almost completely clad in glazed terra-cotta, and culminating in a colonnade on the top floors, the Yeon Building once was illuminated at night by <b>light</b> <b>sockets</b> built into the cornices, but later removed. The building's namesake is Jean Baptiste Yeon (1865-1928), a self-made timber tycoon who financed the construction. At the time of completion, the Yeon Building was the tallest building in Oregon and it remained so for nearly two years.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{practical and}} theoretical issues {{arising from the}} fact that experts and consumers have different ways of conceptualising and measuring energy consumption. James Thurber’s grandmother “lived the latter years of her life in the horrible suspicion that electricity was dripping invisibly all over the house ” (Thurber 1963, p 168). The idea that electricity might leak from empty <b>light</b> <b>sockets</b> is both bizarre {{and at the same time}} strangely plausible. Delivered in a variety of forms, gas, electricity, oil, coal, wood etc.; energy permits countless services and is embodied in almost everything we find around us. Both everywhere, and nowhere, it remains a mysterious if not magical feature of everyday life. So the image of leaking <b>light</b> <b>sockets</b> is appealing not just because it is a quaintly ridiculous idea conjured up by a confused old lady but because it precisely articulates lingering uncertainty about the intangible qualities of this most pervasive resource. Taking the invisibility of energy as a point of departure, this paper explores the different kinds of knowledge we have of energy use. Although the technologies of domestic energy measurement are familiar enough, we know what a meter looks like and we all get energy bills, it still requires an act of faith to believe in the “reality ” of energy consumption. Those who have learned the official languages of energy efficiency have access to richer vocabularies of revealing terminology and can talk more confidently in terms of kilowatts, U values and the rest. But how do these different knowledges relate, and how do different ways of knowing energy influence perceptions of the possibilities and problems of energy conservation? In exploring these issues, the paper re-examines theories of energy and knowledge implicit in energy policy and energy related research. 1...|$|E
