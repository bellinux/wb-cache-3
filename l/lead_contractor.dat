The detonation of a thermonuclear bomb by the Soviet Union spurred Trevor Gardner to form the Teapot Committee in October 1953. Chaired by John von Neumann, its purpose was to study the development of ballistic missiles, including ICBMs. Ramo and Wooldridge were committee members, and Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. became the <b>lead</b> <b>contractor</b> of the resulting ICBM development effort, reporting to the United States Air Force.|$|E
25|$|The civil {{engineering}} firm Ammann and Whitney was named <b>lead</b> <b>contractor.</b> The airport was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy on November 17, 1962. As originally opened, the airport had three runways (current day runways 1C/19C, 1R/19L, and 12/30). Its original name, Dulles International Airport, was changed in 1984 to Washington Dulles International Airport. The main terminal was designed in 1958 by famed Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, {{and it is}} highly regarded for its graceful beauty, suggestive of flight. In the 1990s, the main terminal at Dulles was reconfigured to allow more space between {{the front of the}} building and the ticket counters.

25|$|The {{technical}} requirements and exacting standards required of a facility like the Kauffman Center made {{it one of}} the most complex structures in the world to design and build. The building, which took nearly five years to complete, contains 40,000 square feet of glass, 25,000 cubic yards of concrete, and 27 steel cables. The main lobby, Brandmeyer Great Hall, is built of a glass ceiling and sloping glass walls that provide a panoramic view of Kansas City to the south. The twenty-seven steel cables on the south façade are anchored in embeds that weigh approximately one and a half tons, and the embeds are an extension of the foundation and bedrock beneath the building. When the steel cables were pulled taut during the construction process, the entire steel structure shifted two to six inches to the south. This tensioning provides stability to the structure and keeps the glass lobby securely in place. The Kauffman Center covers 13 acres (53,000 m2), including landscaped grounds over the 1,000-space, city-owned Arts District Garage. The cost of the project was approximately $413 million, which includes both a $40 million operating endowment and the city’s $47 million construction of the parking garage. The Kauffman Center was designed by lead architect Moshe Safdie, acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, theater consultant Theatre Projects Consultants and Richard Pilbrow, and engineering firm Arup. Local firm BNIM was the associate architect. <b>Lead</b> <b>contractor</b> was J.E. Dunn Construction Group of Kansas City.|$|E
500|$|Construction delays {{were caused}} by river {{flooding}} during spring rains. A design mistake meant {{that one of the}} bridges in the structure was built a foot (...) too low, and Grandville Avenue was lowered to compensate for the error. Before the opening, MDOT held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on the freeway to allow local residents to walk along the structure on August 12. The first northbound lanes were opened to traffic in mid-August, three weeks ahead of schedule. <b>Lead</b> <b>contractor</b> Kiewit Western, a company whose [...] "employees have been known to work 13-hour days and 100-hour weeks", accelerated their work schedule {{over the course of the}} project to compensate for the delays and still finish the venture early.

500|$|Maintenance of the RAAF's Hornets {{is carried}} out by both air force {{personnel}} and civilian contractors. Until the early 1990s, all routine servicing and {{a significant proportion of}} intensive [...] "deeper maintenance" [...] was undertaken by the air force. However, the share of intensive maintenance tasks outsourced to the private sector was increased during the 1990s under the RAAF-wide Commercial Support Program. Under current arrangements, the four Hornet-equipped units undertake all routine servicing and some of the more complex deeper maintenance tasks. The remainder of the deeper maintenance work, as well as all major refurbishments and upgrade projects, are carried out by commercial firms. BAE Systems has been the <b>lead</b> <b>contractor</b> for Hornet deeper maintenance since 2003, and Boeing Australia has also provided maintenance services for the aircraft since it won a contract to do so in 2010. In August 2017 Boeing's contract was extended until the planned retirement of the Hornets in 2021, with the company also gaining responsibility for integrating weapons onto the type.

40|$|Construction {{managers}} {{have for a}} long time focused their attention on conversion processes, with little attention given to flow activities, leading to uncertain flow processes, expansion of non value-adding activities, and reduction of output value. This paper investigates the incidence of non value-adding activities in construction projects in Indonesia and Australia, focusing on non-residential building and infrastructure projects. Data was collected via questionnaires and personal interviews targeting 99 respondents from Indonesia and 50 respondents from Australia. A quantitative approach was adopted for this research utilising the results of a questionnaire survey involving 53 variables that relate to non value-adding activities. The variables were then separated into two classifications: waste categories that contribute to a reduction in the value of construction productivity and waste cause variables that could be defined as factors producing waste. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the different perceptions amongst the respondents and to determine the key variables of non value-adding activities. The paper illustrates the key waste categories, the key waste cause variables and <b>leads</b> the <b>contractors</b> to focus their attentions on these issues {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of non value-adding activities during the construction process...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Hybrid {{concrete}} can provide high quality, cost effective structural frames {{in a variety}} of situations when compared to other, more conventional, solutions such as in-situ concrete and steel frames. The key players in the design and construction supply chain process for hybrid concrete are <b>lead</b> frame <b>contractors</b> and design engineers. The use of hybrid concrete, however, is sometimes not considered by contractors and designers during the initial stages of design. This is often {{because of a lack of}} reliable and accessible hybrid concrete cost and production time information. Without this information, contractors and designers may disregard hybrid concrete as a design alternative, potentially omitting the most appropriate solution before it has even been considered. This paper reports on a collaborative research project in the United Kingdom which has developed HyCon - a prototype design support tool which allows contractors and designers at the conceptual design stage to carry out "what if?" analysis in a virtual reality environment to consider various hybrid concrete alternatives against a range of 'hard' and 'soft' performance criteria. The 'hard' criteria allow contractors and designers to assess initial and whole life cycle cost and production duration implications. The 'soft' criteria encourage the whole project team to assess and prioritise the importance and performance of design alternatives against criteria such as physical form and space...|$|R
40|$|The Lead Abatement Strike Team (LAST) was {{developed}} in 2002 by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) in response to community concern about management of children with elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs). Fourteen hundred backlog properties (housing at least one child with EBLLs) were identified through inspection as having housing-based lead hazards for which no satisfactory environmental remediation (control of lead hazards) had been achieved. In {{the first two years}} of LAST, 834 new housing cases also were identified. The heightened awareness of this problem, sparked in part by community advocacy efforts, led to the appropriation of 1. 5 million dollars for environmental remediation.
