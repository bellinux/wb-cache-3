40|$|Large-scale {{infrastructure}} projects require {{the acquisition of}} appropriate land for their construction and maintenance, while they often cause extensive fragmentations of the affected landscape and land plots as well as significant land loss of the immediately affected land owners. A good practice in this field comes from Germany. In Germany, the so-called “land consolidation for large-scale projects” is used to distribute the land loss among a larger group of land owners and to reduce the damages caused by land dissection. In this article, the results of detailed analyses of the land consolidation for large-scale projects’ procedures in Germany are presented. The procedure is coordinated by the land consolidation authority, which has to check several formal and content requirements before implementing a land consolidation procedure. The needed land for the large-scale infrastructure project has to be provided by {{the owners of the}} land plots in the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>area</b> by selling it to the developer, by balanced land-loss following the land consolidation plan or relinquishment of re-allocation of particular land owners.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate a landowner’s status as a lessor in <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> on agricultural <b>areas</b> in Europe. The research was based on surveys designed for <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> experts from Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Latvia, Estonia and statistical data of the areas. The lease of agricultural land is common in Europe. However, there are differences related to how common the lease is and what the rental value of land is. The variation is based on factors such as differences in the markets, historical development of the agricultural lands and current legislation. The lessors have rights as landowners in <b>land</b> <b>consolidation,</b> but in case the land is used by third parties, lessor’s status is more limited compared to other landowners’.

40|$|This master thesis {{addresses}} {{challenges of}} the determination of agricultural land use, based on the land production potential indicated by the soil productivity index, which is recorded in the land cadastre. In the theoretical part, legislation of protection of agricultural land, spatial planning and land cadastre in Slovenia are presented. They are crucial for understanding the implementation {{and use of the}} land productivity index for the determination of agricultural land use. The focus is on current “Agricultural Land Act”, which was introduced in 1996, with amendments, in particular the amendment from 2011, which has brought a new categorization of agricultural land with two categories: prime agricultural land conservation areas (TVKZ) and other agricultural areas (OKZ). The thesis presents analytical studies of the soil productivity index in thirteen municipalities in Pomurje region in order to determine whether the soil productivity index of agricultural land is a suitable criterion for determining the areas of TVKZ and OKZ. For each municipality the average value of soil productivity index and distribution of agricultural land considering soil productivity index classes was determined. Furthermore, the analysis of the soil productivity index of agricultural land in drainage areas and in areas of permanent crops (plantations) was conducted, and the soil productivity index was analyzed considering the slope of the terrain. The thesis provides results of three versions of TVKZ and OKZ areas for all thirteen municipalities, which are than compared with the areas of the old agricultural land classification, i. e. with the best agricultural land (K 1) and other agricultural land (K 2). The results of our research confirmed the suitability of the soil productivity index for determining the areas of TVKZ and OKZ. However, {{it has been shown that}} the same limit value of the soil productivity index is not suitable to determine the areas of TVKZ in all municipalities that were included into our research. Thus, two new criteria were defined for determining areas of TKVZ: areas with irrigation systems and intensive orchard plantations. The thesis concludes that the determined areas of TVKZ and OKZ are geographically much more dispersed than the areas of K 1 and K 2. To ensure the homogeneity of the TVKZ and OKZ areas it is necessary to consider additional criteria: vineyard <b>areas,</b> drainage <b>areas,</b> <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>areas</b> and the slope of the terrain...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} changes in {{legislation}} and practice of the <b>Land</b> <b>Consolidation</b> Courts (LCC) in the period from the current <b>Land</b> <b>Consolidation</b> Act entered into force on 01. 01. 1980. The research {{is based on a}} document survey of court records, rulings and case documents as well as various reports and preparatory works. The sample of cases comprises a total of 283 claims handled by four LCC in respectively 1985 and 2005. Findings conclude that the LCC has changed from being an agrarian reformer - "the classic land consolidation" - to be a tool for most types of property and land rights. Its origin as a special court and an agricultural policy instrument is central to understanding and explaining the LCC development. Urbanization, social change and structural rationalization in agriculture have created new frameworks but also new responsibilities. Meanwhile, court reforms with the establishment of the Norwegian Courts Administration, and transfer of administrative responsibility of the LCC from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Court Administration has also been of significant importance. It has also been a period with many changes in the legislation with new Civil Proceedings Act, changes in the Planning and Building Act and the new Land Registration Act. Research shows that the overarching institutional framework has been of great importance for the LCC development. I have investigated the possibility for a discontinuity {{in the development of the}} LCC during this period, for example signaled by the transfer to the court administration. New tasks have been added to the original tasks. There is, however, a growing bias related to tasks such as boundary dispute resolution and <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> in urban <b>areas.</b> There are also a growing number of cases in which joint use and new land management organizations are the primary issues. The number of agricultural land rearrangements has decreased. The proceedings of the court have also been modernised and professionalised. Even though more changes in land use require permission from the public authorities, there are relatively few cases where a <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> court needs to ask for permission from public bodies. However, this is an area that may need closer regulation. Hopefully this thesis contributes to the discussion about development of the LCC courts. I would also argue that despite the many legislative changes there has not been a discussion about the more fundamental conditions for use of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation...</b>|$|R

The paper focuses on <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> for agricultural purposes, that is <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> as an instrument to abolish fragmentation of agricultural holdings. <b>Land</b> <b>consolidation</b> for specific non-agricultural purposes such as nature and landscape is not an issue in this paper. <b>Land</b> <b>consolidation</b> on a voluntary basis implies too much uncertainty with respect to its final results. <b>Land</b> <b>consolidation</b> can only be carried out in an efficient way when it is based on special legislation.

40|$|The Danish <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> {{tradition}} {{has its roots}} in the land reform launched in the 1780 s. The first “modern ” <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> law was adopted in 1924. The <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedure is today basically the same as the system which was introduced in 1955. Until 1990, <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> was used as an instrument for agricultural development (i. e. mainly through reduction of land fragmentation and increase in agricultural holding sizes). In 1990, the objective of implementing <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> was broadened. It was explicitly included in the preamble of the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> law that the objective is both to contribute to agricultural development and to the implementation of nature and environmental projects as well as to provide land as compensation for agricultural holdings affected by such projects. Since 1990, the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> and <b>land</b> banking instruments have proven to be absolutely essential in the process of reaching voluntary agreements with the landowners affected by nature projects. Public funding of the traditional <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> projects with agricultural development as main objective was discontinued in 2006. At the same time, the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> projects implemented in recent years (after a public initiative often in connection with the implementation of a nature project) may only include land transactions which contribute to the implementation of the public initiated project. Thus, the multi-purpose potential which could be expected after the amendment of the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> law in 1990 has so far not been realized. The volume of the Danish <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> program has in the last years been reduced more than half compared to the previous decades.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the position of the landowner and his/her degree of influence on <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> in general and specially within the municipality of Pedersöre. This study is divided into two fields: a) the decision-making and the degree of influence of a private landowner and b) the general development of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation.</b> This study emphasizes the real possibilities the landowner has of influencing <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> and how these possibilities appear in practise. The continuity of Finnish <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> activity is also investigated. The aim was to find out if the land reform process has been a slow and long lasting or if the cadastral procedures have been separate technical procedures. The empiric data for this study was collected from <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> records and articles published in a local newspaper from Pedersöre during the 20 th century. The method used in this study was a qualitative content analysis. Financial measures taken by the state in <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures has, according to this study stimulated the implementation of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures.

These have also influenced the implementation of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures. The long duration of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures has made it significantly difficult for a landowner to estimate the economic outcome of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation.</b> This study suggests that there has been a long lasting and almost continuous land reform within the research area (Pedersöre).

Land fragmentation, methodical guidelines, legislative measures, financing {{and implementation of}} <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> projects are compared. Extensive, broad, complex <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> (LC) brings direct and indirect economic, environmental, social and landscape benefits for land owners and communities alike. It is a planning and development tool that is crucial for regional development. Authors focus on success of LC projects (measured by numbers of accepted projects relative to the country size) and their historical backgrounds in both neighbouring countries. Comprehensive <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> (CLC) and simple <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> (SLC) are examined. Approach to LC is similar in both countries. Demand for solving certain problems (e. g. land fragmentation, ownership fragmentation) is higher in Slovakia. Comprehensive <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> projects were initiated earlier in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic. But the current situation is significantly worse in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic. Risk of promoting particular interests resulting in an environment with disrupted dynamics of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> is mentioned. Slovakia {{has a chance to}} change current dismal situation in the field of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> only with the support of landowners...|$|R
