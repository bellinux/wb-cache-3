During a bank strike in 1966, which lasted twelve weeks, he went to England, as many striking officials did, but didn't return when the strike was settled. [...] "I had a wild and wonderful time in England, with no bank manager <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> shoulder," [...] he said. Doing general labouring work, he frequented the folk clubs and the Irish music pubs where he met Seamus Ennis, Margaret Barry, Luke Kelly, Martin Byrnes and many other traditional musicians.|$|E
2500|$|After nearly {{drinking}} {{himself to}} death during the shooting of The Klansman (1974), Burton was dried out at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Burton was allegedly inebriated while making the movie, {{and many of his}} scenes had to be filmed with him sitting or lying down due to his inability to stand upright. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently. According to his own diaries, he used Antabuse to try to stop his excessive consumption of alcohol, which he blamed for wrecking his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor. Burton himself said of the time leading up to his near loss of life, [...] "I was fairly sloshed for five years. I was up there with John Barrymore and Robert Newton. The ghosts of them were <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> shoulder." ...|$|E

He also performed on Frank Wildhorn's concept album of the musical The Civil War, singing the song [...] "The Day the Sun Stood Still". By year's end, Tritt also released his final Warner Bros. album, No More <b>Looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>My</b> Shoulder. It was his first of four consecutive albums which he produced with Billy Joe Walker, Jr., who is a session guitarist, producer, and New Age musician. The album was led off by the ballad [...] "If I Lost You," [...] which peaked at number 29 on the country charts and number 86 on the Hot 100. Michael Peterson (who recorded for Warner Bros.'

The album's third and final single was a cover of Jude Cole's [...] "Start the Car" [...] (previously the B-side to [...] "If I Lost You"), which peaked at number 52.|$|E
