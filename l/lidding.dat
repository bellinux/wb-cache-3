40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to formulate solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for improving the dermal delivery of a local anesthetic agent lidocaine (<b>LID).</b> SLN and NLC were characterized for particle size distribution, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRD), thermal behavior by differential scanning colorimeter (DSC) and surface morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). LID-loaded SLN and NLC were formulated into hydrogels for topical application. The in vitro permeation profiles of <b>LID</b> SLN gel, <b>LID</b> NLC gel, and a marketed <b>LID</b> formulation (Xylocaine® gel) were evaluated by using guinea pig skin. The in vivo efficacy of <b>LID</b> SLN gel, <b>LID</b> NLC gel, and a marketed <b>LID</b> formulation (Xylocaine® gel) gel was evaluated on guinea pig using pinprick test. <b>LID</b> SLN showed a particle size of 78. 1  nm with a polydispersity index of 0. 556, whereas <b>LID</b> NLC showed a particle size of 72. 8  nm with a polydispersity index of 0. 463. The entrapment efficiency of <b>LID</b> in both SLN and NLC was 97 % and 95. 9 %, respectively. The TEM studies revealed the almost spherical nature of <b>LID</b> SLN and NLC formulations. The XRD and DSC studies of <b>LID</b> SLN suggested amorphization of drug in the carrier system. The SLN formulation was stable with respect to particle size, polydispersity, and entrapment efficiency for 6  months at 40 °C/ 75 % relative humidity (RH). Negligible leakage was observed for the NLC formulation when stored for 1  month at 40 °C/ 75 % RH.

50|$|The primary {{component}} of a blister pack is a cavity or pocket made from a formable web, usually a thermoformed plastic. This usually has a backing of paperboard or a <b>lidding</b> seal of aluminum foil or plastic. A blister that folds onto itself is often called a clamshell.|$|E
50|$|Blister packs are {{commonly}} used as unit-dose packaging for pharmaceutical tablets, capsules or lozenges. Blister packs can provide barrier protection for shelf life requirements, and a degree of tamper resistance. In the US, blister packs are mainly used for packing physician samples of drug products or for over-the-counter (OTC) products in the pharmacy. In {{other parts of the}} world, blister packs are the main packaging type since pharmacy dispensing and re-packaging are not common. A series of blister cavities is sometimes called a blister card or blister strip as well as blister pack. The difference between a strip pack and blister pack is that a strip pack does not have thermo-formed or cold formed cavities; the strip pack is formed around the tablet {{at a time when it}} is dropped to the sealing area between sealing moulds. In some parts of the world the pharmaceutical blister pack is known as a push-through pack (PTP), an accurate description of two key properties (i) the <b>lidding</b> foil is brittle, making it possible to press the product out while breaking the <b>lidding</b> foil and (ii) a semi-rigid formed cavity being sufficiently collapsible to be able to dispense the tablet or capsule by means of pressing it out with the thumb. Breaking the <b>lidding</b> foil with a fingernail for the appropriate tablet will make the pressing out easier.|$|E

50|$|Since most of {{the jars}} have lip rims, {{it is thought that}} the jars {{originally}} supported <b>lids,</b> although few stone <b>lids</b> have been recorded; this may suggest that the bulk of <b>lids</b> were fashioned from perishable materials.

40|$|The main {{complications}} {{of this type}} of lower <b>lid</b> reconstruction are lash loss or malposition, entropion of the upper <b>lid,</b> upper <b>lid</b> retraction, undue laxity of the lower <b>lid,</b> and <b>lid</b> margin deformities. These can all be avioded by meticulous attention to surgical details and dressing techniques. I believe that this is the best and simplest method of providing a <b>lid</b> of acceptable function and appearance. The advantages {{of this type of}} operation are: (1) The new lower <b>lid</b> is constructed of <b>lid</b> tissue including the tarsus and conjunctiva from the upper <b>lid.</b> (2) The function and appearance of the new lower <b>lid</b> are acceptable with practically no tendency to late retraction. (3) The function and appearance of the upper <b>lid</b> need not be interfered with. (4) No external scars are produced except when a lash transplant is done. This transplant leaves a small, hardly noticeable scar in {{the lower part of the}} opposite brow. (5) The technique is relatively simple and well within the realm of any well-trained ophthalmic surgeon. The obvious disadvantages are the surgeon's inability to inspect the eye for two to four months and the inconvenience to the patient of having one eye closed for such a long period of time...|$|R

50|$|Blister packs {{are created}} {{by means of a}} {{form-fill-seal}} process at the pharmaceutical company or designated contract packer. A form-fill-seal process means that the blister pack is created from rolls of flat sheet or film, filled with the pharmaceutical product and closed (sealed) on the same equipment. Such equipment is called a blisterline. There are two types of blister machine' design: rotary and flat-plate, depending on the mechanism for sealing the <b>lidding</b> foil.|$|E

50|$|Medical blister trays {{differ from}} {{pharmaceutical}} blister packs in {{that these are}} not push-through packs. The thermoformed base web is made of a thicker plastic sheet, generally between 500 to 1000 µ and can not be collapsed, thus forming a solid tray. The <b>lidding</b> film provides a peel-open feature and is generally porous to allow sterilization (such as the Dupont medical Tyvek material). Such medical blister packs are used for sterile medical devices, used in hospitals.|$|E
50|$|Secondary seals {{are common}} with {{sensitive}} products that may deteriorate or where extra security is needed. Foil or plastic innerseals are used on some bottles, Heat sealed <b>lidding</b> films are used on some tubs.

Additionally, many closures feature ventilation to prevent bloating, collapse or explosion due to unequalized pressure during processing or storage. Venting technologies utilize common {{materials such as}} PTFE, PP, etc. These elements are preferred due {{to their ability to}} withstand temperatures of 260°C and water intrusion pressure levels of 770 mbar.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} factors and {{possible}} mechanisms associated with decreased self-awareness of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (<b>LIDs)</b> {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We enrolled 30 PD patients with <b>LIDs.</b> Patients were video-recorded in an "on" phase while experiencing <b>LIDs.</b> <b>LIDs</b> were objectively rated {{by means of the}} Unified Dyskinesias Rating Scale (UDyRS) by two movement disorders specialists while examining the patients. Patients were asked to rate the body site and the severity of their <b>LIDs</b> according to the 5 -point UDyRS. Patients then rated their own <b>LIDs</b> while watching the video recording of themselves. Lastly, the patients rated the <b>LIDs</b> of other reference PD patients on a video recording. The same reference video recordings were shown to 15 healthy individuals matched for age, gender and education. Results: Seven of the 30 PD patients investigated were subjectively unaware of the presence of their <b>LIDs.</b> The majority of patients, however, recognized their <b>LIDs</b> when watching video recording of themselves. Patients displayed a specific poor self-awareness of trunk <b>LIDs,</b> in both the subjective evaluation and in the video recording-based subjective evaluation. By contrast PD patients correctly recognized <b>LIDs</b> in video recordings of reference PD patients. Poor self-awareness correlated with predominance of motor symptoms on the left body side. Conclusions: Poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> is present in a proportion of PD patients as a form of anosognosia. The poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> in the trunk is likely to be due to a complex interplay involving both anosognosic mechanisms and deficits in proprioceptive axial kinesthesia.

40|$|Lipases {{naturally}} {{function at}} the interface formed between amphiphilic molecules and the aqueous environment. Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) is a well-characterised lipase, known to exhibit interfacial activation during which a <b>lid</b> region covering the active site becomes displaced upon interaction with an interface. In this study, we investigate the effect the {{amino acid sequence}} of the <b>lid</b> region on interfacial binding and <b>lid</b> dynamics of TLL. Three TLL variants were investigated, a wild-type variant, a variant containing an esterase <b>lid</b> region (Esterase), and a Hybrid variant, containing both wild-type <b>lid</b> residues and esterase <b>lid</b> residues. Multiple coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the interfacial binding orientation of TLL was significantly affected {{by the nature of}} amino acids in the <b>lid</b> region, and atomistic simulations indicated effects on the structural dynamics of the <b>lid</b> itself. The atomistic simulations, as well as steered molecular dynamics simulations, also indicated that the Esterase <b>lid</b> region was less flexible than the wild-type <b>lid</b> region, whereas the Hybrid variant displayed superior <b>lid</b> flexibility and stability in the open conformation both at the interface, and in aqueous solution. Additional experiments performed to investigate the activity and binding behaviour of the lipase variants indicated a slightly higher specific activity for the Hybrid variant compared to the wild-type variant, correlating the observations of increased <b>lid</b> flexibility. Together, these results are in line with previous experimental studies, highlighting the importance {{of the nature of the}} amino acid residues within the functional <b>lid</b> region of lipases, particularly regarding interfacial binding orientation, activation, and structural stability...|$|R
