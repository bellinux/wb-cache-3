500|$|Forman and {{his colleagues}} were {{committed}} to the strategy of casting non-professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible. Most of the actors were chosen from among relatives, friends and acquaintances of Forman and his crew, {{to the point where}} Forman was later to liken the atmosphere to making a [...] "home movie". For the title role, Forman selected his 18-year-old ex-sister-in-law, Hana Brejchová, not because, as was rumored at the time, he wanted revenge on his ex-wife, movie-star Jana Brejchová, but because he had known Hana a long time, trusted her, and had great respect for her natural talents: [...] "She had an amazing ability of free expression, but with the risk that she didn’t recognize the extent. However, Vlada Pucholt [...] held her firmly in the rhythm of the scene, in a professional position.” The character of Milda's father was played by the uncle of Forman's cameraman, and Milda's mother was played by a factory <b>lathe</b> <b>operator</b> whom Passer and Papoušek had met on a streetcar, and who struck them as someone who [...] "seemed so interested in things around her, no matter how silly". The factory supervisor was played by the actual public relations manager of the factory at Zruč nad Sázavou, where location shooting took place. For the main trio of reservists, Forman wanted to use non-professionals, including the writer Josef Škvorecký, but found that, while the three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs, they lost their rhythm when all three were included in the same shot. So Forman went to Škvorecký and told the writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with the professional actor Vladimir Mensik. [...] In Škvorecký's words: [...] "To tell someone that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very nice way of letting him know that he should stay with screen-play writing. [...] Milos is a very considerate person. The fact that he so gently threw me out made possible the greatest scene of Loves of a Blonde". Forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional: [...] "While nonactors keep the actors honest and real, the actors give the scene the rhythm and shape that the nonactors don't feel. A nonactor inhabits the situation so completely that he or she isn't able to view it from the outside, to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose. Nonactors are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on, so an actor can pull them through the dramatic arch of the scene and draw out the emotional contours of the situation." ...|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{relationship}} between skin tumours in man {{and exposure to}} polyaromatic hydrocarbons has been studied in <b>lathe</b> <b>operators</b> exposed to cutting oils. Seven cases of scrotal cancer and 13 cases of senile keratosis and keratoacanthoma were observed. The risk varied as the 1. 6 th power of duration of exposure for cancer on the scrotum and the 2. 4 th power for tumours on the hand and forearms. These results accord well with experiments on animals. There was some evidence of an increasing trend in risk with increasing age at first exposure. Exposure to some mineral oils is a well known cause of skin tumours in both laboratory animals and man (IARC, 1984). The carcinogenic properties of the oils {{is thought to be}} mainly due to their content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (IARC, 1984). A common animal model for carcinogenesis involves painting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or mineral oils containing PAH on the skin, and several experiments studying dose- response relationship in this animal model have been reported. However, there are few data on the {{relationship between}} exposure to PAH and skin tumours in humans.

25|$|Women {{also played}} an {{important}} role in British industrial production during the war, in areas such as metals, chemicals, munitions, shipbuilding and engineering. At the beginning of the war in 1939 17.8% of women made up employment in these industries and by 1943 they made up 38.2%. With the start of the war there was an urgent need to expand the country’s labour force and women were seen as a source of factory labour. Before the war women in industrial production were exclusively on assembly, which was seen as cheap and undemanding work but during the war women were needed in other areas in the production process that were previously done by men such as <b>Lathe</b> <b>operators.</b> The Ministry of Labour created training centres that gave an introduction to the engineering process, and by 1941 women were allowed entrance as the importance of the engineering industry grew and became a large source of female employment. Areas such as aircraft manufacture, light and heavy general engineering and motor vehicle manufacturing all saw an increase in female employment during the war. Aircraft production saw the largest rise in female employment as it rose from 7% in 1935 to 40% in 1944. At the start of the war men who were already in engineering were prevented from going to war because engineering was seen as an important industry to war production but in 1940 there became a need for more female workers to supply the necessary labour for factory expansion. By 1941 with the shortage of skilled labour the Essential Workers Order was introduced which required all skilled workers to register and prevented workers from quitting from jobs that were deemed essential to the war effort without agreement from a National Service Officer. The Registration for the Employment Order in 1941 and the Women of Employment Order in 1942 also attempted to get more women into the workforce. The Women of Employment Order required women ages 18–45 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce. Aircraft production was given the top labour priority and many women were diverted into it with some even being transferred from agricultural production.|$|R

50|$|Safe {{usage of}} a lathe {{also depends on}} the operator's choice of proper {{techniques}} for the lathe, tools, and wood. For example, using a high spindle speed with an unbalanced wooden blank may cause the lathe to vibrate dangerously. Spinning a large turning blank too fast may cause it to explode. Inappropriate use of tools such as gouges and skew chisels can cause a catch, where the tool bites suddenly and aggressively into the wood in an uncontrolled manner. This exerts very large forces on the wood, the tool, the <b>lathe</b> and the <b>operator,</b> often causing the wood to break apart or tear free from the lathe. Lathe accidents often pull the tool out of the operator's hand and throw them in unexpected directions. Particular care is also required for wooden shapes that are not circular, such as off-center work, or bowls with wings or square rims. Portions of the turning extend farther from the axis of rotation, and are sometimes more difficult to see than {{the bulk of the}} wooden blank.|$|R
40|$|Changes on {{the shop}} floor require machine {{operators}} to develop skills and expertise to perform tasks {{that have more}} cognitive complexity. The literature in human machine systems suggests that operators develop elaborate mental models that influence all aspects of their interaction with complex manufacturing systems. Research on the human factors issues in manufacturing is in its infancy, and none of this research has focused on operator mental models. Therefore, this research investigates the operator mental models when they control CNC lathe and EDM. The goal of this research is to identify and understand cognitive issues that may be used to improve the design of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). ^ This research consists of two sequential studies, study 1 on CNC lathe control and study 2 on EDM control. Study 1 required five experienced machinists to verbalize or 2 ̆ 2 think aloud 2 ̆ 2 while controlling a CNC lathe while study 2 required nine experienced tool makers to verbalize as they created a mold cavity using an EDM. Study 1 examined two VPA methods and found that concurrent VPA was better suited for shop floor activities than retrospective VPA. A hybrid approach with concurrent VPA as the primary method and retrospective VPA as the secondary methods was used in study 2. ^ The verbal data was transcribed, segmented, encoded, and analyzed along with operator control behavior to derive mental models. These mental models for both tasks were compared and contrasted. The verbal protocol data was used to identify similarities and differences in operator control behavior for CNC <b>lathe</b> and EDM. <b>Operators</b> had elaborate mental models of part geometry and the manufacturing processes needed to achieve the desired shape. Operators used exploratory learning as their primary problem-solving strategy. Operators used rough and finish machining strategies to adjust the trade-off between input and output parameter setting in EDM only. During each machine tools automatic cycle, the operators demonstrated elaborate mental models of monitoring and trouble-shooting. This was especially important for EDM, where the operators were continually adjusting process parameters to maintain stable machining conditions. These core mental models were used to derive guiding principles for AMT user interface design. These principles were developed into concept for interface tools that need to be developed and studied further. ...|$|R
