5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} told what she can and cannot do. After it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E

[...] In addition to the portrayal of Katherine, Hazlitt likes that of Cardinal Wolsey and of King Henry himself, which, though [...] "drawn with great truth and spirit [...] <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> disagreeable portrait, sketched by the hand of a master."

500|$|Zimmerman and {{his team}} took {{feedback}} from the directors of previous Star Trek series to make the new space easier in which to film. Whereas in other series there has been purpose built sets for briefing rooms, following the feedback this area was built into the bridge itself as the directors had stated that it proved difficult to make several people sit around a table seem interesting. The transporter design {{was intended as a}} reference to the original series design that was created by Matt Jefferies, with Zimmerman including certain design elements such as the wall patterns around the transporter itself. The design of the engineering deck was overhauled from previous series with the intention for it to look like the engine room of a nuclear submarine.

[...] The film grossed over $120 million at the U.S. box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described her as [...] "a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker's whimsy" [...] while Rex Reed of The New York Observer felt she was [...] "desperately in need of a new agent." ...|$|E

500|$|The growing dispute {{disturbed}} {{members of}} the British government, as war looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> real possibility, and an armed conflict would disrupt the extensive British commercial interests in the area. Argentina and Chile both imported British-made goods, while the United Kingdom imported large amounts of Argentine grain, most shipped through the River Plate, and Chilean nitrates. The British government mediated negotiations {{between the two countries}} through their envoy in Chile. These were successfully concluded on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other eighteen months' advance notice. The warships under construction were sold to the United Kingdom and Japan: Chile's battleships became the former's , and Argentina's armored cruisers the latter's [...] It is not clear if the two planned Argentine battleships were ordered, but in any case the plans were quickly scuttled. Capitán Prat, Garibaldi, and Pueyrredón were disarmed with the exception of their main batteries, as there was no crane capable of removing the cruisers' gun turrets.|$|E

Erlewine picked [...] "White Christmas" [...] and [...] "Orange Colored Sky" [...] as his top choices from the EP. Evigshed Magazine's Sylvia Lesas complimented the musical arrangement of the tracks, saying that Gaga's vocals were a highlight of the EP and adding, [...] "'The Edge of Glory' featuring beautiful piano line gives me chills. It is a truly moving version. [...] makes every song special." [...] Erin Strecker from Entertainment Weekly gave a glowing review of the release, explaining that Gaga's fans might have been expecting a release <b>like</b> <b>A</b> <b>Very</b> Gaga Holiday which gave prominence to the singer's vocals.

Club wrote that [...] "much of this episode felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> deliberate throwback to season one, in {{some very good}} ways", and IGN's Robert Canning said that [...] "the overarching storylines on Glee have become far more engaging than {{what we saw in}} the first half of the season". John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode [...] "does a lot of things right when it comes to the plot", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as [...] "consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode [...] "brought more narrative developments that didn’t make sense", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, [...] "the rest of the episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times liked the episode and described it as [...] "the kind that makes you belly-laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment".|$|E
500|$|Defeated Sanity {{underwent}} further line-up {{changes with}} Jens Staschel joining on vocals, Christian Kuehn on guitar and Jacob Schmidt filling in on bass. In August 2006, the band recorded their second studio album at Soundlodge Studios. It was produced and engineered by Jörg Ukenand, and mastered by Robbert Kok of Disavowed. In the meantime, Gruber played drums for Austrian blackened death metal band Belphegor on their North American tour with Unleashed and Krisiun. Psalms of the Moribund was released through Grindethic Records in March 2007. Like its predecessor, the album received mixed reviews, with Erik Thomas of webzine Teeth of the Divine saying, [...] "With ultra deep, almost grindcore styled burps layered over complex yet savage riffs, Defeated Sanity, {{unlike some of}} their US peers, do manage to throw in some nice grooves and lurches amid the blasting carnage, hence the Suffocation and Devourment comparisons, but otherwise, Psalms of the Moribund is a pretty breakneck assault of squealing, pinch harmonics and ravenous blast beats." [...] Chronicles of Chaos reviewer Kostas Sarampalis criticized the vocal style of Jens Staschel, stating, [...] "The constant low guttural growling is completely unintelligible, used more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> (<b>very</b> blunt) instrument rather than a means to convey lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|Before filming began, Eminem {{spoke to}} Paul Rosenberg on the {{telephone}} about his ideas for a music video of [...] "Not Afraid"; the two shared thoughts and started collaborating in May2010. American director Richard [...] "Rich" [...] Lee was hired to direct the video, which was shot on Market Street, in Newark, New Jersey as well as New York City. On the first day, Eminem filmed the opening scene on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building. Lee called the moment [...] "sort of <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> internal feeling kind of video". In an interview, while the video was being shot, Eminem spoke about working with Lee [...] "as pretty anti-climactic, for the most part, you know what I mean... It's good working with him, you know, he's about his business". The scene in which Eminem jumps from a cliff and dives, was done at Greenpoint Warehouse, in Brooklyn with Lee and video producer Justin Diener. Also working with Eminem on the video included Dennis Dennehy and Chris Clancy for marketing. The final scene filmed {{on the first day}} was where Eminem would try to escape from a dark basement on a set built by production designer Ethan Tobman; shooting in Newark also continued.|$|E

500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The Sun that he was [...] "so proud of [...] lyrically" [...] and thought the song [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] contained the best lyrics he had ever written. Taylor explained that it was [...] "very easy" [...] for him to focus on the [...] "more serious lyrics, like a love song very dear to [...] heart" [...] but stated that [...] "Wrestlers" [...] was [...] "equally as important and feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different style of music than we have ever got down on record before." [...] He discussed [...] "Wrestlers" [...] in the band's interview with The Sun, explaining that the song is [...] "musically and lyrically quite direct" [...] because [...] "it doesn't have thousands of layers", in contrast to the song [...] "Bendable Poseable". The concept of the song [...] "Wrestlers", originates from a text message from James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. After Doyle toured with Murphy, Murphy sent a text message that said, [...] "Sorry you can't have Al back, I'll wrestle you for him. And I'll beat you because I'm bigger and stronger than you." [...] Goddard explained that [...] "the words in that song are about wrestling", and the band [...] "have no doubt" [...] that Murphy would defeat them in a wrestling fight.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E

That {{sounds to me}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which {{was to have been}} stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E
500|$|Despite Fischer's results against Taimanov and Larsen, his {{upcoming}} match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task. Nevertheless, the Soviet government {{was concerned about}} Fischer. [...] "Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games... 'It might be possible that I win it earlier,' Petrosian replied", and then stated: [...] "Fischer's [...] wins do not impress me. He is a great chess player but no genius." [...] Petrosian played a strong [...] in the first game, gaining the advantage, but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered. This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world's top players (in the Interzonal and Candidates matches), a winning streak topped only by Steinitz's 25 straight wins in 1873–1882. Petrosian won the second game, finally snapping Fischer's streak. After three consecutive draws, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6½–2½ (+5−1=3). Sports Illustrated ran {{an article on the}} match, highlighting Fischer's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian's outdated system of preparation:Fischer's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory. His response to Petrosian's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example: Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks, yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly, he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple, classic principles. Upon completion of the match, Petrosian remarked: [...] "After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius. I on the other hand, either had a breakdown or was tired, or something else happened, but the last three games were no longer chess." [...] "Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form, and that he should have had a plus score {{at the end of the}} sixth game..." [...] to which Fischer replied, [...] "People have been playing against me below strength for fifteen years." [...] Fischer's match results befuddled Botvinnik: [...] "It is hard to talk about Fischer's matches. Since the time that he has been playing them, miracles have begun." [...] "When Petrosian played like Petrosian, Fischer played <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong grandmaster, but when Petrosian began making mistakes, Fischer was transformed into a genius." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Guilty" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television commentators, who praised its storylines. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a complimentary review.

Fowler noted that Michael fully took [...] "advantage of his unique, tragic, situation by having him purposefully use one world as a source of information to help him solve a case". Stating that the episode had [...] "top-tier entertainment", Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9 out of 10", classifying it as [...] "great". Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic mainly enjoyed this episode. McHatton claimed that Rex's current behaviour and thoughts are [...] "understandable" [...] and [...] "heart-renching". He concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "4.7 out of 5" [...] score. Caroline Preece from Den of Geek gave praise in the episode.

HitFix's Alan Sepinwall noted many parts of the episode. Sepinwall stated that there was a [...] "notable change in feel or style" [...] from other episodes, because of different writers for the episode.
