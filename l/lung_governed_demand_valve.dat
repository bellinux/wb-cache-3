The gas supply for the second <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> may be from the same scuba set or from a separate cylinder.

5000|$|The ambu-bag was {{a further}} {{advancement}} in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> {{as the primary}} method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> (all new models of <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> now have pressure relief valves set at 60 cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a [...] "pop-off" [...] valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally {{more common in the}} pre-hospital setting than the <b>demand</b> <b>valve.</b> However, the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is of paramount importance. The <b>demand</b> <b>valve,</b> while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> was {{a revolutionary}} {{new piece of}} equipment. At the simple push of a button, high-flow oxygen could be {{delivered}} into the lungs of the patient without the worry of the device cycling and, thus, ceasing to pump oxygen. Any amount of pressure that might be required to inflate the lungs could be achieved, and the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> was better able to detect obstructions in the lungs and more able to [...] "work with the patient" [...] than the Emerson and Pulmotor could. The <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress. Conserving the often limited reserves of oxygen was easier with a <b>demand</b> <b>valve,</b> as oxygen was designed only to flow when either the button was depressed or the casualty inhaled. Later medical opinion decided that getting high flow oxygen into a patients airway {{was a factor in}} causing vomiting and aspiration. <b>Demand</b> <b>valve</b> resuscitators were introduced with restrictors to limit flow rates to 40 lpm. Use of the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> resuscitator in Europe was limited by the lack of pressure relief valve or audible alarm for high pressure.|$|R

25|$|The {{secondary}} <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> can be {{a hybrid}} of a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> and a buoyancy compensator inflation valve. Both types are sometimes called alternate air sources. When the secondary <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is integrated with the buoyancy compensator inflation valve, since the inflation valve hose is short (usually {{just long enough to}} reach mid-chest), {{in the event of a}} diver running out of air, the diver with air remaining would give his or her primary second stage to the out-of-air diver, and switch to the inflation valve himself.|$|R
25|$|The <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> {{is usually}} firmly {{attached}} to the helmet or mask, {{but there are a}} few models of full face mask that have removable <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> with quick connections allowing them to be exchanged under water.

2500|$|The terms [...] "{{regulator}}" [...] and [...] "demand valve" [...] {{are often}} used interchangeably, but a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is a regulator that delivers gas only while the diver is inhaling and reduces the gas pressure to ambient. In single hose regulators, the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is the second stage, which is either held in the diver's mouth by a mouthpiece or attached to the full-face mask or helmet. In twin hose regulators the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> {{is included in the}} body of the regulator which is usually attached directly to the cylinder valve or manifold outlet.|$|R
25|$|The donor is {{expected}} to take a good breath and pass his/her <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> (or mouthpiece {{in the case of a}} twin-hose regulator) to the recipient, who {{is expected}} to take two good breaths and pass it back. In reality the recipient will often take more than two breaths, and the donor should expect this and relax to minimize metabolic rate. The donor should retain a good grip on the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> throughout the buddy breathing process, as a panicked recipient may fail to give it back. A reasonably reliable way of keeping control of the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is to grasp the hose firmly in the fist where it connects to the <b>demand</b> <b>valve.</b> This provides good control but allows the recipient to use the purge button if needed.|$|R
50|$|A few {{models of}} {{full-face}} mask {{are provided with}} secondary ports to which additional <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> can be connected, either by screw connector (Ocean Reef) or by bayonet style connector (Draeger). These allow for bailout or decompression gas to be ported to the mask via an entirely independent scuba set, but {{it is necessary to}} control which gas is used at any given time by using a valve on the supply line or cylinder.The Draeger Panorama mask also allows the primary <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> to be unplugged from the mask and a bailout <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> to be substituted. This can be done underwater with very little water ingress to the mask, and is closely equivalent to switching <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> with a half mask, but a little slower and more complex.|$|R

2500|$|A {{downstream}} <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> {{serves as}} a fail safe for over-pressurization: if a first stage with a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> malfunctions and jams in the open position, the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> will be over-pressurized and will [...] "free flow". Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without inflating buoyancy devices. The effect of unintentional inflation might be to carry the diver quickly to the surface causing the various injuries that can result from an over-fast ascent. There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's breathing bag, a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} <b>demand</b> <b>valves.</b> Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a pressure relief valve, unless it has a built in over pressure valve, so that over-pressurization does not inflate any buoyancy devices connected to the regulator.|$|R
