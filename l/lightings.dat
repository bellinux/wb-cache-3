25|$|In 1973, Schneerson {{started a}} Chanukah {{campaign}} to encourage all Jews worldwide to light their own menorah. After all tin menorahs were given out that year, a military manufacturer was commissioned to make {{tens of thousands}} of additional menorahs for distribution. In 1974, a public lighting of a Chanukah menorah was held by the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in years following menorah <b>lightings</b> on public grounds were conducted in cities worldwide. Legal challenges to the <b>lightings</b> on public grounds reached the Supreme Court and it was ruled that public <b>lightings</b> did not violate the Constitution.

25|$|By the 1920s, the KKK {{developed}} a women's auxiliary, with chapters in many areas. Its activities included participation in parades, cross <b>lightings,</b> lectures, rallies, and boycotts of local businesses owned by Catholics and Jews. The Women's Klan {{was active in}} promoting prohibition, stressing liquor's negative impact on wives and children. Its efforts in public schools included distributing Bibles and petitioning for the dismissal of Roman Catholic teachers. As {{a result of the}} Women's Klan's efforts, Texas would not hire Catholic teachers to work in its public schools. As sexual and financial scandals rocked the Klan leadership late in the 1920s, the organization's popularity among both men and women dropped off sharply.|$|E

500|$|The plot, graphics, {{and audio}} have {{received}} mixed reviews. The plot and characters {{have been called}} cliché by Game Informer, GameSpot, and GamesRadar. Game Informer called the childhood prologue monotonous but commented on the improving story after the time skip. GameSpot agreed, calling the prologue the [...] "weakest {{part of the story}} on its own" [...] but [...] "crucial point of reference" [...] which adds depth and eventually breaks away from the cliché. GamesRadar shared the same opinion as GameSpot and praised Richard's transformation into a villain. As for the graphics, IGN considered them outdated while Joystiq described it as washed-out with jerky movements. For the audio, IGN, Game Informer, and GamesRadar, considered the music underwhelming and the voice acting acceptable. IGN describes the voice acting [...] "works" [...] but some parts suffer from weak script. Game Informer compared the voices to a well-produced anime and GamesRadar considered them fitting for the characters. Meanwhile, GameTrailers criticized the presentation completely, citing the plot as predictable, the characters unengaging, the <b>lightings</b> flat, animations stiff, lipsyncing off, forgettable music, and the voice acting as dry.|$|E

2500|$|The {{festival is}} {{observed}} by the kindling {{of the lights}} of a unique candelabrum, the nine-branched menorah (also called a Chanukiah/Hanukiah), one additional light on each night of the holiday, progressing to eight on the final night. The typical menorah consists of eight branches with an additional visually distinct branch. The extra light, with which the others are lit, is called a shamash ( [...] , [...] "attendant") and is given a distinct location, usually above or below the rest. Other Hanukkah festivities include playing dreidel and eating oil-based foods such as doughnuts and latkes. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah <b>lightings</b> in open public places in many countries.|$|E

60|$|Seen by daylight, Chitterlow was {{not nearly}} such a {{magnificent}} figure {{as he had been}} by the subdued nocturnal <b>lightings</b> and beneath the glamour of his own interpretation. The lines were the same indeed, but the texture was different. There was a quality about the yachting cap, an indefinable finality of dustiness, a shiny finish on all the salient surfaces of the reefer coat. The red hair and the profile, though still forcible and fine, were less in the quality of Michael Angelo and more in that of the merely picturesque. But it was a bright brown eye still that sought amidst the interstices of the baby-linen.|$|E
60|$|The Rover arrested his step, as {{the other}} {{disappeared}} and stood {{for more than a}} minute in an attitude of high and self-gratulating triumph. It was quite apparent he was exulting in his success. But, though his intelligent face betrayed the satisfaction of the inward man, it was illumined by no expression of vulgar joy. It was the countenance of one who was suddenly relieved from intense care, rather than that {{of a man who was}} greedy of profiting by the services of others. Indeed, it would not have been difficult, for a close and practised observer, to have detected a shade of regret in the <b>lightings</b> of his seductive smile, or in the momentary flashes of his changeful eye. The feeling, however, quickly passed away, and his whole figure and countenance resumed the ordinary easy mien in which he most indulged in his hours of retirement.|$|E
6000|$|A most {{interesting}} {{view of the}} way in which pious heathens of a late age regarded Apollo's menagerie may be got from Plutarch's essay on the Delphic responses. It is the description of a visit to Delphi. In the hall of the Corinthians the writer and his friends examine the sacred palm tree of bronze, and [...] "the snakes and frogs in relief round the root of the tree". [...] "Why," [...] said they, [...] "the palm tree is not a marsh plant, and frogs are not a Corinthian crest." [...] And indeed one would think ravens and swans, and hawks and wolves, and anything else than these reptiles would be agreeable to the god. Then one of the visitors, Serapion, very learnedly showed that Apollo was the sun, and that the sun arises from water. [...] "Still slipping into the story your <b>lightings</b> up and your exhalations," [...] cried Plutarch, and chaffed him, as one might chaff Kuhn, or Schwartz, or Decharme, about his elemental interpretations. In fact, the classical writers knew rather less than we do about the origin of many of their religious peculiarities.|$|E
