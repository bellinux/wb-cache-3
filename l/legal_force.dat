5|$|The Authority's {{principal}} innovation was its supranational character. It had a broad area {{of competence}} to ensure {{the objectives of the}} treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no <b>legal</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded <b>legal</b> <b>force</b> to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 15th and early 16th centuries, the Hussey family owned the manor of Old Sleaford. John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford was {{executed}} for treason {{for his part}} in the Lincolnshire Rising. The manor and his residence at Old Place reverted to the Crown and were later sold to Robert Carre. George Carre or Carr from Northumberland had settled in Sleaford by 1522 when he was described as a wool merchant. His son Robert bought Hussey's land and the castle and manor of New Sleaford from Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. His eldest surviving son Robert, founded Carre's Grammar School in 1604, and his youngest son Edward was created a baronet; his son founded Sleaford Hospital in 1636. The last male descendent died in 1683 and the heiress, Isabella Carre, married John Hervey, Earl of Bristol, in whose family the estates remained until the 1970s. The Carres and Herveys had a strong influence: in addition to extracting dues from their tenants, they took leading tradesmen to the Exchequer Court to gain <b>legal</b> <b>force</b> behind their monopoly on charging tolls on market and cattle traders and for driving animals through the town.|$|E

25|$|On 11 November 2010 Part 2 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 {{was brought}} into force by a {{commencement}} order. Part 2 of the Act deals with the ratification of treaties and puts Parliamentary scrutiny of treaties on a statutory footing, so changing the convention into a provision having <b>legal</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
25|$|For example, given a deeded {{easement}} to use someone else's {{driveway to}} reach a garage, if a fence or permanently locked gate prevents the use, nothing is done to remove and circumvent the obstacle, and the statutory period expires, then the easement ceases to have any <b>legal</b> <b>force,</b> although the deed held by the fee-simple owner stated that the owner's interest was subject to the easement.|$|E

30|$|The {{question}} under debate concerns humanitarians in {{a number}} of ways: firstly, when we consider stakeholder responsibility for, or complicity in, illegal forced displacement or dispossession through forced displacement; secondly, how we address the issue of forced displacement, and illegal appropriation through forced displacement as humanitarians; and finally, in establishing who has responsibility for carrying out a <b>legal</b> <b>forced</b> displacement or evacuation.|$|R
30|$|This article {{argues that}} while most {{stakeholders}} cannot assign guilt or {{enforce the law}} they can establish if a forced displacement is illegal and when forced displacement becomes pillage or illegal appropriation. This paper takes the position, that ultimately, all stakeholders can decide if the criteria of a <b>legal</b> <b>forced</b> displacement or evacuation has been transgressed and if the HLP of civilians is being pillaged or illegally appropriated.|$|R
25|$|Through much of {{the first}} year of the war, the {{government}} in Washington continued to regard the conflict as merely an insurrection, and that the Confederate government had no legal standing. According to the view of the Lincoln administration, the letters of marque issued by Jefferson Davis or the seceded states had no <b>legal</b> <b>force,</b> and the privateersmen who relied upon them did not represent a legitimate authority. Taking merchant vessels on the high seas therefore was piracy, with the penalty of death upon conviction.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty {{was never}} {{ratified}} by the United Kingdom and carried no <b>legal</b> <b>force</b> in New Zealand for over a century, finally receiving limited recognition in 1975 {{with the passage of}} the Treaty of Waitangi Act. The Colonial Office and early New Zealand governors were initially fairly supportive of the Treaty as it gave them authority over both New Zealand Company settlers and Māori. As the settlers were granted representative and responsible government with the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, the Treaty became less effective, although it was used to justify the idea that Waikato and Taranaki were rebels against the Crown in the wars of the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|SOPA and PIPA protests were {{overlapped}} {{and followed}} by protests against ACTA which has a similar sense. The ACTA treaty was signed by 22 Member States in Europe and {{was expected to be}} signed before March 2012 by the other left Cyprus, Estonia, Netherlands and Slovakia, and thus would have gained <b>legal</b> <b>force</b> for the whole European Union. On February 11, more than 200 European cities took part in a widespread protest against ACTA. Although protests were held in Europe, the signing of ACTA was led by USA, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, and Singapore, which were first to sign the treaty at a ceremony on October 1, 2011, in Tokyo. However, the concerns of ACTA are much related and raised after the protests against SOPA and PIPA which directed the public attention to bills and acts that may threaten Internet and civic liberties.|$|E
40|$|Relative {{to other}} {{developed}} countries, very {{little has been}} written about any aspects of accounting history in Cyprus. This is a surprising omission given the extensive and rich history of Cyprus, extending back some 10, 000 years. This paper is a tentative attempt to reduce this vacuum. It does so by looking at different phases of Cyprus' history and, within those phases, identifying some of the significant factors that either hindered or encouraged the development of accounting practice on the island and suggesting some possible influences for these. Like other studies on the history of accounting in various countries, this paper argues that the practice of accounting, and the accountancy profession, evolves over time and in response to various political, economic, <b>legal</b> and social <b>forces.</b> Cyprus, accounting history, accountancy, political <b>forces,</b> economic <b>forces,</b> <b>legal</b> <b>forces,</b> social forces, global business, economics, finance,...|$|R

40|$|The Electronic Market Hypothesis (EMH) (Malone & Yates & Benjamin 1987) {{holds that}} {{electronic}} markets will eventually evolve towards unbiased markets {{under the pressure}} of both competitive and <b>legal</b> <b>forces</b> and that this process is inevitable in case of markets for commodities. We criticize the EMH for its definitional impreciseness, its disregard for strategic and technological counter forces and the absence of market characteristics as contingent factors in the prediction. These critiques drive our research interest in the nature and effectiveness of the competitive and <b>legal</b> <b>forces</b> that are held to be crucial in the evolution towards unbiased markets, in particular {{in the light of the}} regulatory authorities that are often installed to institutionalize these forces. In this paper we present our ongoing research that intends to nuance the, in our opinion, overly optimistic and naive view of the EMH by examining the Dutch electricity industry as an example of a commodity market that has recently been liberalized.

25|$|The Protocol's first {{commitment}} period started in 2008 {{and ended in}} 2012. A second {{commitment period}} was agreed on in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: Australia, the European Union (and its 28 member states), Belarus, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Protocol or not put into <b>legal</b> <b>force</b> the Amendment with second round targets. Japan, New Zealand and Russia have participated in Kyoto's first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets are Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the United States (which has not ratified the Protocol). As of July 2016, 66 states have accepted the Doha Amendment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. Of the 37 countries with binding commitments, 7 have ratified.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{theory of}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} elaborates how scriptures {{should be interpreted}} {{from the standpoint of}} linguistics and rhetoric. It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the <b>legal</b> <b>force</b> of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date. In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (ijmaʿ) and analogical reasoning (qiyas). It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of ijtihad, which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question. The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (ʿaql) as a source of law in place of qiyas and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} technical {{impediment to}} any Regency Bill involved {{the lack of}} a speech from the throne, which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The speech was normally delivered by the King, but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as Lords Commissioners; but no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the Great Seal of the Realm was affixed to it. The seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the Lord Chancellor to affix the Great Seal without the King's consent, as the act of affixing the Great Seal in itself gave <b>legal</b> <b>force</b> to the bill. This legal fiction was denounced by Edmund Burke as a [...] "glaring falsehood", as a [...] "palpable absurdity", and even as a [...] "forgery, fraud". The Duke of York described the plan as [...] "unconstitutional and illegal." [...] Nevertheless, others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently, on 3 February 1789, more than two months after it had convened, Parliament was formally opened by an [...] "illegal" [...] group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced, but before it could be passed the King recovered. The King declared retroactively that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.|$|E
