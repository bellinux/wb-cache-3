5000|$|According to Anthony G. Williams, the [...] "API {{blowback}} {{principle is}} used virtually in all open bolt sub-machine guns" [...] (technically, although generally these {{are known as}} [...] "simple blowback" [...] weapons due to the very <b>late</b> <b>ignition</b> of the cartridge compared to specially designed API blowback guns like the MK 108), although [...] "the relatively low pressures and velocities mean that extended chambers and rebated-rim cartridges are not required" [...] for sub-machine guns. In heavier weapons, advanced primer ignition (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker for use on the Becker 20-mm automatic cannon. It became a feature {{of a wide range}} of designs that can be traced back to Becker's, including the Oerlikon cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The {{throttle}} bypass/throttle solenoid {{system is}} combined with ignition retardation and slight fuel enrichment (mainly to provide cooling), typically ignition occurs at 35-45° ATDC. This <b>late</b> <b>ignition</b> causes very little expansion of the gas in the cylinder; hence the pressure and temperature will still be very high when the exhaust valve opens. At the same time, the amount of torque delivered to the crankshaft will be very small (just {{enough to keep the}} engine running). The higher exhaust pressure and temperature combined with the increased mass flow is enough to keep the turbocharger spinning at high speed thus reducing lag. When the throttle is opened up again the ignition and fuel injection goes back to normal operation. Since many engine components are exposed to very high temperatures during ALS operation and also high pressure pulses, this kind of system is very hard on the engine and turbocharger. For the latter not only the high temperatures are a problem but also the uncontrolled turbo speeds which can quickly destroy the turbocharger. In most applications the ALS is automatically shut down when the coolant reaches a temperature of 110-115 °C to prevent overheating.|$|E

50|$|The {{ammunition}} {{for the original}} M1 launcher was the M6, which was notoriously unreliable. The M6 was improved and designated M6A1, and the new ammunition was issued with the improved M1A1 launcher. After the M6, several alternative warheads were introduced. Many older M1 launchers were modified to M1A1 standards in July and August 1943, with batches of M6 rockets also being modified with the <b>latest</b> <b>ignition</b> systems {{to be able to}} be fired from the modified M1 launchers; these rockets were designated M6A2. The M6A3 rocket featured a blunt, rounded nose to lessen the chances of it ricocheting off of angled armor, and was meant to be fired from the M9, and later M9A1, launchers. Late in World War II, the M6A4 and M6A5 rockets with improved fuses were developed. These rockets arrived too late to see service during the war, but were used post-war.|$|R

40|$|Gasoline {{consumption}} and pollutant emissions from transportation are costly and have serious, demonstrated environmental and health impacts. Downsized, turbocharged direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) gasoline engines consume less fuel and achieve superior performance compared with conventional port fuel injected spark ignition (PFI-SI) engines. Although more efficient, turbocharged DISI engines have new emissions challenges during cold start. DISI fuel injection delivers more liquid fuel into the combustion chamber, increasing the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons. The turbocharger slows down activation (warm-up) of the catalytic exhaust after-treatment system. The {{objective of this}} research is to find a control strategy that: 1. Accelerates warm-up of the catalyst, and 2. Maintains low emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (UBHCs) during the catalyst warm-up process. This research includes a broad experimental survey of engine behaviour and emission response for a modern turbocharged DISI engine. The study focuses on the idle period during cold-start for which DISI engine emissions are worst. Engine experiments and simulations show that late and slow combustion lead to high exhaust gas temperatures and mass flow rate for fast warm-up. However, late and slow combustion increase the risk of partial-burn misfire. At the misfire limit for each parameter, the following conclusions are drawn: 1. <b>Late</b> <b>ignition</b> timing is {{the most effective way to}} increase exhaust enthalpy flow rate for fast catalyst warm-up. 2. By creating a favourable spatial fuel-air mixture stratification, split fuel injection can simultaneously retard and stabilize combustion to improve emissions and prevent partial-burn misfire. 3. Excessive trapped residuals from long valve overlap limit the potential for valve timing to reduce cold-start emissions. 4. Despite their more challenging evaporation characteristics, fuel blends with high ethanol content showed reasonable emissions behaviour and greater tolerance to late combustion than neat gasoline. 5. Higher exhaust back-pressure leads to high exhaust temperature during the exhaust stroke, leading to significantly more post-flame oxidation. 6. Post-flame oxidation in the combustion chamber and exhaust system play a critical role in decreasing the quantity of catalyst-in emissions due to hydrocarbons that escape primary (flame) combustion. A cold start strategy combining <b>late</b> <b>ignition,</b> 15 % excess air, and high exhaust backpressure yielded the lowest cumulative hydrocarbon emissions during cold start. by Kevin David Cedrone.

40|$|Full cycle {{simulations}} of KAUST optical diesel engine {{were conducted in}} order to provide insights into the details of fuel spray, mixing, and combustion characteristics at different start of injection (SOI) conditions. Although optical diagnostics provide valuable information, the high fidelity simulations with matched parametric conditions improve fundamental understanding of relevant physical and chemical processes by accessing additional observables such as the local mixture distribution, intermediate species concentrations, and detailed chemical reaction rates. Commercial software, CONVERGE™, was used as the main simulation tool, with the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence model and the multi-zone (SAGE) combustion model to compute the chemical reaction terms. SOI is varied from <b>late</b> compression <b>ignition</b> (CI) to early partially premixed combustion (PPC) conditions. The simulation results revealed a stronger correlation between fuel injection timing and combustion phasing for late SOI conditions, whereas the combustion phasing starts to decouple from SOI for early SOI cases. The predictions are consistent with the experimental observations, in terms of the overall trends in combustion and emission characteristics, while the high fidelity simulations provided further insights into the effects of mixture stratifications resulting from different SOI conditions...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{and global warming}} are two challenging issues that scientists and engineers are currently tackling with high priority. Within the automotive industry, these challenges mainly lie in reducing vehicle exhaust emissions and improving fuel and combustion efficiency. In this chapter, problems concerning exhaust emissions of soot, NOx, CO 2, and unburned hydrocarbons from an internal combustion engine (ICE) are discussed first, including laws and regulations governing emission levels in various countries. Further, analysis is made on the recent shift from increasing mechanical power while maintaining fuel consumption to significantly reducing fuel consumption and emissions while maintaining power. Methods to reduce emissions and to improve performance in conventional engines are also discussed. The chapter then focuses on the <b>latest</b> development in <b>ignition</b> and combustion technology for new engine types. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) which combines the concepts and advantages of petrol and diesel engines is discussed in detail. The combustion temperature of HCCI is about 500 K below conventional diesel and spark ignition engines. As a result, an HCCI engine emits near zero levels of soot or particulate matter and achieves about 90 - 98 % reduction in NOx raw emissions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca 2 + releases (Ca 2 + clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na+-Ca 2 + exchanger current (INCX). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited cardiac pacemaker cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca 2 + cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca 2 + releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) -based Ca 2 + clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD INCX over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e. g., L-type Ca 2 + current (ICaL) and/or hyperpolarization-activated (“funny”) current (If) conductances]. The system Ca 2 + clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca 2 + fluxes, which optimize cell Ca 2 + balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca 2 + release and late DD INCX as SR Ca 2 + pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1. 8 – 4. 6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca 2 + clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca 2 + clock is disabled, the system parametric space for fail-safe SANC operation considerably shrinks: without rhythmic <b>late</b> DD INCX <b>ignition</b> signals membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca 2 + clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function. A synergism of the coupled function of Ca 2 + and membrane clocks confers fail-safe SANC operation at greatly varying rates...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Natural gas combi boilers {{are one of the}} most common branches of the household goods used for space and domestic hot water (DHW) heating. Although most of the combi boilers in the market have reached considerably high space heating efficiency values via condensing technology, there is still a huge demand on increasing their DHW comfort level and efficiency. Broad definition of the comfort level in the combi boilers is the expectation of an end-user to have hot water in a very short time and without fluctuations. DHW expectancy differs from market to market, therefore resulting in wide product diversity and a challenging competition between the manufacturers. The present study has mainly focused on the investigation of one of the parameters which are particularly effective on the DHW comfort level. As the first step, 1 D mathematical model is constructed for DHW function with the transient energy equations of the concerning components. The differential energy equations of the model are discretized implicitly with Finite Difference Scheme in order to solve them numerically in Matlab. Boundary and initial conditions are defined as closely as possible to the exact working conditions. Thermodynamic properties of the flue gas mixture and water are obtained via open source software Cantera [1]. Then, the numerical results are compared with the experimental data to validate the model. After obtaining a model for basic applications and rough results to estimate the behavior of an appliance, one of the software parameters affecting the comfort level of the end-users, <b>late</b> <b>ignition</b> time is investigated numerically. cf 201...|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) combustion {{is considered to}} be an attractive alternative to traditional internal combustion engine operation because of its extremely low levels of pollutant emissions. However, there are several difficulties that must be overcome for HCCI practical use, such as difficult ignition timing controllability. Indeed, too early or too <b>late</b> <b>ignition</b> can occur with obvious drawbacks. In addition, the increase in cyclic variation caused by the ignition timing uncertainty can lead to uneven engine operation. As a way to solve the combustion phasing control problem, dual-fuel combustion has been proposed. It consists of a diesel pilot injection used to ignite a pre-mixture of gasoline (or other high octane fuel) and air. Although dual-fuel combustion is an attractive way to achieve controllable HCCI operation, few studies are available to help the understanding of its in-cylinder combustion behavior. In this paper, numerical simulations of dual-fuel combustion processes are presented. An implemented version of the multi-dimensional CFD KIVA 3 V code was used for the study. This version incorporates various advanced sub-models, including the G-equation flame propagation model coupled with CHEMKIN. The influence of injection timing and mixture composition on emission production, as well as on combustion pressure and on heat release rate has been analyzed with two different multi-hole injectors (six and eight holes). Four combustion strategies were compared, and pressure, heat release rate, temperature and emissions results are provided. As expected, decreasing the amount of diesel fuel injected, combustion behavior becomes closer to HCCI combustion, especially with the eight-hole injector. An effective ignition controllability has been obtained with very low percentages of injected diesel fuel for the whole set of considered injection timings...|$|E
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} charge {{compression ignition}} (HCCI) engine can be {{run on a}} large range of fuels if the appropriate operating conditions are chosen. This can improve the efficiency of biofuel production from low-value biomass by suppressing {{the need for the}} transformation process to obtain products that are compatible with spark ignition or compression ignition engines. A simple biochemical process that includes acidogenic fermentation and produces a mixture of various esters can take advantage of this flexibility. However, the behavior of this mixture under HCCI conditions needs to be characterized. It can also have a great impact on the HCCI operating limits and its successful implementation. Using an HCCI engine, we investigated how the operating limits are modified by the combustion characteristics of three of these esters: ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, and ethyl butanoate. This paper reports the experimental results for each of these products and for ethanol taken as the reference fuel. It also analyzes their effects on the ignition timing and the combustion rate. For the selected operating conditions, stable HCCI operations on a large range of equivalence ratios were obtained for every fuel The difference in specific heats of the air/fuel mixtures and in the ignition kinetics both contributed to the ignition characteristics. Ethanol ignites earlier, which leads to a low upper limit, whereas the <b>late</b> <b>ignition</b> of ethyl acetate shifts the operating zone upward due to smoothed high loads but unstable low loads. As a consequence, these low-grade products can be used in an HCCI engine. Fuel blends of these products may take advantage of the different combustion characteristics to extend the HCCI zone. Still, the range of this extension is difficult to estimate and the research of the optimal fuel blend composition will, therefore, remain the focus of future work...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to find ways to}} improve combustion and reduce emissions from supercharged natural gas engines. In-cylinder flow measurements were made with laser doppler velocimetry, LDV, heat release was calculated from cylinder pressures and emissions were measured at various locations. The original combustion chamber was a low turbulence-generating geometry, resulting in an overall slow combustion. Four new combustion chambers were designed, to generate high turbulence and hence a fast combustion. The piston-geometry with the highest turbulence was more tolerant for highly diluted mixtures in terms of engine stability, which is favorable for lean burn operation or high amounts of EGR at stoichiometric operation. The flow-measuring tests were made on a single-cylinder engine. Base-engine performance measurements were conducted on a multi-cylinder version of the engine. The results show that pulse-width fuel-injection close to the cylinders (at the throttle) resulted in variations in air/fuel ratio between the cylinders. Cycle-to-cycle variations were high in cylinders with leaner mixtures, and NOX emissions were high from cylinders with richer mixtures. <b>Late</b> <b>ignition</b> timing, high boost pressure and lean mixture led to the need for a small spark gap in order to avoid misfires with the original ignition system. A larger gap results in higher spark energy, but the ignition system must be powerful enough not to cause misfires. The original ignition settings were retarded to suppress NOX formation. The HC and CO emissions were also lower than at maximum brake torque ignition (MBT) due to higher temperatures during expansion and exhaust, leading to more post-oxidation. Load and efficiency were reduced with the retarded ignition timing. A new engine control system was installed with high power ignition modules, enabling a larger spark gap. Idle quality was improved and maximum load was increased with this new system. Cylinder-individual control of fuel injection and ion-current measurements in all six cylinders made it possible to adapt port fuel-injection and cylinder balancing. Both cycle-to-cycle and cylinder-to-cylinder variations were reduced with cylinder balancing at lean operation. The ion-current integral and variations in the integral were used to perform the cylinder balancing. Lean burn operation was compared to stoichiometric operation diluted with EGR. The raw emissions of NOX and HC were higher at lean burn operation than for the EGR case. NOX emissions after a three-way catalyst were up to 700 times higher at lean operation (29. 5 g/kWh vs. 0. 042 g/kWh), and HC emissions approximately 20 times higher (2. 7 g/kWh vs. 0. 13 g/kWh). The early flame period (ignition to 5 % burned) was much longer for the EGR case, since EGR has a stronger influence on laminar flame speed than excess air. The main combustion duration (10 % to 90 % burned) was similar for both cases. The ion-current signal was very weak for the lean burn cases, but a strong signal was found for the EGR case...|$|E
