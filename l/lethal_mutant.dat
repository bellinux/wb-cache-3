Skull Man revolves around Tatsuo Kagura, who early in his life was subjected to several mutating science experiments that ended up giving him amazing powers and skills.

Various cellular factors are known to interact with Ras proteins. In order to find the novel cellular factors {{that are associated with}} Ras function, we have constructed synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants</b> of the ras 1 + gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and used them to identify the genes that are functionally dependent on the Ras 1. We first constructed S. pombe strains in which chromosomal ras 1 gene is placed under the nmt 1 promoter that is regulated by thiamine. This strain shows ras 1 + phenotype in the absence of thiamine, whereas it shows ras 1 - phenotype in the presence of thiamine. Second, we mutated the constructed strains with ultraviolet light (UV) and selected two synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants</b> that could not grow when Ras 1 function was repressed (ras 1 -). One of the mutants, KSC 3, showed a swollen cell shape, aberrant deposition of septum materials, and aberrant nuclei. The other mutant, KSC 4, showed sensitivity to hyper-osmolarity when Ras 1 function is absent. These mutants, however, grow normally when Ras 1 is expressed (ras 1 +). These two novel synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants</b> of ras 1 provide the means to isolate the corresponding genes that function in association with Ras 1 in S. pombe.

These mutants were isolated and genetically characterized by Richard Epstein, Antoinette Bolle and Charles Steinberg in 1962 (although publication of their initial findings was delayed for 50 years: see Epstein et al., 2012.

[...] Another class of conditional <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants,</b> referred to as temperature-sensitive mutants, was obtained by Robert Edgar and Ilga Lielausis. [...] Studies of these two classes of mutants led to considerable insight into numerous fundamental biologic problems. Thus understanding was gained on the functions and interactions of the proteins employed in the machinery of DNA replication, repair and recombination, and on how viruses are assembled from protein and nucleic acid components (molecular morphogenesis). Furthermore, the role of chain terminating codons was elucidated. One noteworthy study was performed by Sydney Brenner and collaborators using amber mutants defective in the gene encoding the major head protein of phage T4. [...] This experiment provided strong evidence for the widely held, but prior to 1964 still unproven, [...] "sequence hypothesis" [...] that the amino acid sequence of a protein is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene determining the protein.

Sequence analysis of the mutant revealed a point mutation resulting in a nonconservative change (Glu to Lys) in the regulator domain of the RR at position 63. To confirm that this signal transduction system was essential, a disrupted copy of either the RR (yycF) or the HK (yycG) was constructed {{with a set of}} suicide vectors and used to generate tandem duplications in the chromosome. Resolution of the duplications, leaving an insertion in either the yycF or the yycG coding region, was achieved only in the presence of an additional wild-type copy of the two open reading frames. Phenotypic characterization of the conditional <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> showed that at permissive growth conditions, the mutant was hypersusceptible to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics, even {{in the presence of the}} ermB resistance determinant. Other mutant phenotypes, including hypersensitivity to unsaturated long-chain fatty acids and suppression of the conditional lethal phenotype by high sucrose and NaCl concentrations, suggest that the role of the two-component system includes the proper regulation of bacterial cell wall or membrane composition.

40|$|Background: Many {{attempts}} have been made to describe the origin of life, one of which is Eigen’s cycle of autocatalytic reactions [Eigen M (1971) Naturwissenschaften 58, 465 – 523], in which primordial life molecules are replicated with limited accuracy through autocatalytic reactions. For successful evolution, the information carrier (either RNA or DNA or their precursor) must be transmitted to the next generation with a minimal number of misprints. In Eigen’s theory, the maximum chain length that could be maintained is restricted to 100 { 1000 nucleotides, while for the most primitive genome the length is around 7000 { 20000. This is the famous error catastrophe paradox. How to solve this puzzle is an interesting and important problem in the theory of the origin of life. Methodology/Principal Findings: We use methods of statistical physics to solve this paradox by carefully analyzing the implications of neutral and <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants,</b> and truncated selection (i. e., when fitness is zero after a certain Hamming distance from the master sequence) for the critical chain length. While neutral mutants play an important role in evolution, they do not provide a solution to the paradox.
