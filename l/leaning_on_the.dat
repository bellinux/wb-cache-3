The Spanish empire, which included Spain, the Netherlands, Naples, Milan and Spain's possessions in the Americas, went to his son, Philip. His brother, Ferdinand, who had negotiated the treaty in the previous year, was already in possession of the Austrian lands and was also the obvious candidate to succeed Charles as Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the outer wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the outer wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E

Weakness may be reported, but is often masked by pain and is usually found only through examination. With longer-standing pain, the shoulder is favored and gradually loss of motion and weakness may develop, which, due to pain and guarding, are often unrecognized by the patient and only brought to attention during examination.|$|E

One resulting concession that England did obtain from the Netherlands was a restriction on the press, making such publications illegal to produce.|$|E

25|$|In 1360 {{the kingdom}} of Galicia was again at the centre of a {{succession}} crisis, this time of European dimension. The throne of Castile was disputed between King King Peter I and his half-brother, Henry Count of Trastámara, within the broader context of the Hundred Years' War. This fratricidal conflict lasted between 1354 and 1369, having its origin in the policies of Peter I, who tried to expand his royal power while <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> councils of cities and municipalities; this would {{come at the expense}} of the high nobility, including Castilian families such as Pimentel, Ponce de León, Mendoza, Fernández de Córdoba, and Alvarez de Toledo; and Galician ones as Castro. As a result, in 1354 a coalition of nobles rose in defence of a pactual monarchy, although this coalition was soon discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Acharya later {{returned}} to Berlin {{and over the}} course of the war, was in Stockholm briefly along with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya. In Stockholm in May 1917, Acharya and Chattopadhyaya formed a Propaganda Bureau and later joined by Har Dayal. This bureau worked independently of the Berlin Committee and the German foreign office. The duo are known to have met with K.M. Troionovsky at this time and explained the Indian situation, winning approval from the latter for the Indian cause. The Paris Indian society had been in touch with Russian communists before the Russian revolution. Nicholas Safransky, a Russian bomb expert, is known to have been involved in training the Indian revolutionaries in bomb manufacture and explosives. and Acharya was greatly impressed by the revolution itself, hailed at the time as a watershed in the struggle of colonial people against imperialism. The publication of a manifesto by the Soviet Union declaring support for colonies against imperialism was attractive to the Indian nationalists, who saw Soviet Russia as a future centre for coordinating activities, and also intended Russia to be a channel for Indian nationalists in any peace negotiations. This was also the time that the Swedish government under diplomatic pressure from Britain, gradually was <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indian propaganda bureau, while relationship of the Berlin committee with the German foreign office was also strained on apprehensions of German imperial designs and over allocation of funds. Chatto and Acharya arranged for Troionovsky to be provided with a large amount of the committee's literature to acquaint the Soviets with the Indian situation when the latter left Stockholm for Petrograd. However, Acharya was ultimately disappointed with the Socialist conference in Stockholm, which in his opinion entirely skirted the issue of the colonies. Towards the end of 1918, Acharya {{returned to}} Berlin along with Chatto.|$|E

In {{the presence of}} a Torah scroll, this paragraph is recited with the head <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of the left hand or sleeve (right hand when wearing tefillin on the left) as per Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 131:1-2).

2500|$|Guitarist Michael Einziger {{noted that}} his {{contributions}} to the album were influenced by his musical studies during the band's hiatus: [...] "Maybe my desire to return to simplicity, or even to just go to simplicity - because I've never really written music that simple before — {{is sort of a}} response to maybe having a better or larger perspective of the overall musical landscape that I’ve never had before." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "Over the years, we've become less and less aggressive as far as our music goes. There's always moments of that aggression, but this album is pretty free of that. It's definitely not a hard rock record. I think we're asking a lot of our fans. We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making this type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd cited Einziger as a key reason for the band's new direction, noting [...] "Michael really buckled down and studied musical composition that inspired him to reach out and dig into different places that he never has before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara recounted a {{discussion}} regarding {{the right of}} the firstborn in [...] Once Rabbi Jannai was walking, <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder of Rabbi Simlai his attendant, and Rabbi Judah the Prince came to meet them. Rabbi Judah the Prince asked Rabbi Jannai what the Scriptural basis was for the proposition that a son takes precedence over a daughter in the inheritance of a mother's estate. Rabbi Jannai replied that the plural use of the term [...] "tribes" [...] in the discussion of the inheritance of the daughters of Zelophehad in [...] indicates that the mother's tribe is to be compared to the father's tribe, and {{as in the case of}} the father's tribe, a son takes precedence over a daughter, so in the case of the mother's tribe, a son should take precedence over a daughter. Rabbi Judah the Prince challenged Rabbi Jannai, saying that if it this were so, one could say that as in the case of the father's tribe, a firstborn takes a double portion, so in the case of the mother's tribe would a firstborn take a double portion. Rabbi Jannai dismissed the remark of Rabbi Judah the Prince. The Gemara then inquired why it is true that a firstborn son takes a double share in his father's estate but not his mother's. Abaye replied that [...] says, [...] "of all that he [...] has," [...] implying all that [...] "he" [...] (the father) has and not all that [...] "she" [...] (the mother) has. The Gemara asked whether the proposition that a firstborn son takes a double portion only in the estate of his father might apply only in the case where a bachelor married a widow (who had children from her first marriage, and thus the father's firstborn son was not that of the mother). And thus where a bachelor married a virgin (so that the firstborn son of the father would also be the firstborn son of the mother) might the firstborn son also take a double portion in his mother’s estate? Rav Nahman bar Isaac replied that [...] says, [...] "for he [...] is the first-fruits of his [...] strength," [...] from which we can infer that the law applies to the first fruits of the father’s strength and not the first-fruits of the mother’s strength. The Gemara replied that [...] teaches that though a son was born after a miscarriage (and thus did not [...] "open the womb" [...] and is not regarded as a firstborn son for purposes of [...] "sanctification to the Lord" [...] and [...] "redemption from the priest" [...] in [...] ) he is nonetheless regarded as the firstborn son for purposes of inheritance. [...] thus implies that only the son for whom the father's heart grieves is included in the law, but a miscarriage, for which the father's heart does not grieve, is excluded. (And thus, since [...] is necessary for this deduction, it could not have been meant for the proposition that the law applies to the first fruits of the father’s strength and not of the mother’s strength.) But then the Gemara reasoned that if [...] is necessary for excluding miscarriages, then [...] should have read, [...] "for he is the first-fruits of strength," [...] but [...] in fact says, [...] "his strength." [...] Thus one may deduce two laws from [...] But the Gemara objected further that still that the words of [...] "the first-fruits of his [...] strength," [...] not her strength, might apply only to the case of a widower (who had children from his first wife) who married a virgin (since the first son from the second marriage would be only the wife's firstborn, not the husband’s). But where a bachelor married a virgin (and thus the son would be the firstborn of both the father and the mother), the firstborn son might take a double portion also in his mother’s estate. But Raba concluded that [...] states, [...] "{{the right of the}} firstborn is his ," [...] and this indicates that the right of the firstborn applies to a man’s estate and not to a woman’s.–b2.
