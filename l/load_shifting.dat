40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. An {{investigation}} was conducted into {{the potential to}} do demand side management on the locomotive battery chargers on South African mines. The potential to do <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> and energy efficiency on new technology battery chargers was examined. A simulation model was drawn up to simulate the potential to do <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> on the currently installed battery chargers. This model was further extended to include the high frequency battery chargers, to enable the simulation of <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> and energy efficiency of these chargers. Electricity utilisation on the locomotive battery chargers on a mine can be increased from about 50 % to 96 % by replacing the currently installed ferro resonant chargers with new technology, high frequency battery chargers. This results in an energy efficient implementation. It is also possible to realise <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> on these high frequency battery chargers to realise more electricity cost savings, {{as well as to}} reduce the electrical load in Eskom's peak time(s). Electrical energy cost savings of up to R 442 600 is possible by replacing all the chargers with high frequency chargers and doing <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> in Eskom's peak times. The payback can be as short as 2. 7 years. It is also possible to realise <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> on the currently installed ferro resonant battery chargers on a mine. Annual electrical energy cost savings of up to R 234 200 is possible by implementing <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> in Eskom's morning and evening peak periods.

40|$|Various {{smart grid}} pilots are being {{initiated}} worldwide {{to explore the}} flexibility in electricity demand of households. The potential flexibility of appliances can be unlocked using either manual or (semi-) automated demand response. In the Dutch smart grid pilot Your Energy Moment the effect of demand response is studied. The participating households are equipped with a smart washing machine or smart tumble dryer. These appliances {{can be used to}} manually respond to the dynamic tariff applied in the pilot, or cycles can be programmed to automatically respond to price fluctuations. Based on the pilot results, the total <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> of the washing machine and tumble dryer is quantified. Subsequently, the effect of the program function is studied, focusing on the use of this function and on the flexible hours provided for the schedule horizon. The results show that the load of the smart appliances is shifted in time.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} Demand-Side Management (DSM) opportunities in the South African cement industry. This was done by identifying four criteria that affect the DSM <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> process on a production facility. These criteria were used as benchmarks against which the viability of possible <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> projects on a cement factory was measured. In order to test these criteria, procedures were developed for identifying viable <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> projects on a cement factory. These procedures include everything from the introduction to the plant management, through data gathering and refining, to the simulation of silo levels and material flows, and optimisation of these to result in an optimised <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> schedule for different plant systems. These procedures were tested by means of a case study on a cement factory in the North- West Province of South Africa. The case study showed that it is possible to perform a viable <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> of approximately 9 megawatt (MW) on this factory, for an annual electricity cost saving of R 656, 501. 38. Various concerns of the plant personnel have been identified, and possible solutions have been proposed in order to help overcome these concerns. Even though there were some limitations preventing the full testing of these procedures, the study showed that it is definitely possible to find large viable <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> projects in the cement industry. It should be possible to expand the same principles to include other equipment on a cement factory, and should work for most similar cement factories. Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. South Africa is {{currently}} facing a major electricity crisis {{due to the}} continuous growth in electricity demand. Eskom, the largest electricity supplier in South Africa, have enabled numerous methods to support energy reduction in both the residential and industrial sectors. Programs developed by Eskom to help the different major electricity consuming industries {{with the development of}} energy efficient and <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> strategies, have already been put into practice. These programs solely focus on the potential savings in megawatts each production sector might consist of. The key features of the Eskom electricity reduction initiative are driven by the energy efficiency concept and the peak demand <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> capability. Both the <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> and energy efficient initiatives are mostly active in the mining industry, because of the high electricity consumption levels of a standard mining operation. One of the most inefficient systems currently active within a mining operation is the ventilation control system. This dissertation describes the energy efficient and <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> research on the current underground ventilation system by means of certain design methodologies that might improve the inefficient operational features on both the standard underground auxiliary fans and the main surface fans. The operational features of a standard 2 -pole 45 kW issued auxiliary fan were tested, by using a fan-testing column to compare the performance criteria to that of an improved auxiliary fan design. An energy saving potential on a single 45 kW unit of 11 kW was evident during the testing analysis. This amounted to an estimated annual energy saving potential of R 370, 000. 00 with a total saving of 561 kW on all the installed 45 kW units at Kopanang goldmine, by means of an investment in the replacement of the current installed units with that of the improved units. A secondary study was to gather information on the main surface fan operational features at Kopanang and Mponeng goldmines. The gathered information showed an estimated possibility for <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> and efficiency initiatives, which will result in fan operating life expansion and electricity savings capabilities. Annual electricity savings of up to R I, 500, 000. 00 were calculated on efficiency and <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> strategies and gave an indication on how costly inefficient operations are. The calculated I 0 % increase in main fan efficiency resulted in an annual saving of nearly R 1, 100, 000. 00 with a reduction of 1, 05 MW at Mponeng goldmine and an annual saving of nearly R 721, 000. 00 with a reduction of 675 kW at Kopanang goldmine. The <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> potential at Mponeng and Kopanang goldmines were nearly 3, 5 MW and 2, 25 MW respectively. Capital investments from either Eskom or alternative investors will definitely play a crucial part in the realization of energy efficiency and <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> measures. It may include, improved fan installations, variable speed drives for the main fans and real time management systems. If the mine should decide to invest in these efficient strategies, the proposed Eskom DSM program might result in a net energy savings potential for any mining operation. Master...|$|R

40|$|A {{feature of}} the Smart Grid is the {{utilization}} of flexible load in the power system. The presence of flexible load allows part of the power consumption to be shifted from peak hours to off-peak hours; this change in power consumption is called a <b>load</b> <b>shift.</b> If the usage pattern of appliances is identified, {{it is possible to}} estimate the capacity of a potential <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> as well as evaluate if the utilization of flexible load in the power system results in a <b>load</b> <b>shift.</b> This master thesis project aims to create a model which works as an aid when studying usage patterns by identifying when appliances that contribute to the <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> are active. The model should be able to give approximations of the switch-on and switch-off time of the appliances using only information from a single meter that measures the total power consumption of the entire household. Recently, artificial neural networks have been successfully applied to these kinds of problems. The constructed model thus includes neural networks which regress the start time and end time of a target appliance. The networks are trained and evaluated both on simulated data and on real measured data from the Stockholm Royal Seaport project. The model is able to give highly accurate estimates of the start and stop time when trained with simulated data. When using real data the accuracy of the model is relatively low. In order to increase the performance the neural network part of the model has to be trained on a larger dataset. A study of how the sampling time of the input affects the performance of the model is also carried out. The results show no evidence that the sampling time affects the accuracy of the model. However, the architecture of the neural networks trained to recognize data with different sampling frequencies are not identical; if the pooling layers of all networks were removed {{it might be possible to}} establish a connection between sampling time and performance...|$|R
40|$|As {{countries}} {{move toward}} larger shares {{of renewable energy}} and build fleets of electric vehicles, the slow diffusion of active electricity load management should concern energy policy makers and users alike. It leads to unnecessarily costly investments and/or jeopardizes reliability. Active load management can increase capacity factors of existing capacity, {{reduce the need for}} new capacity, and alleviate congestion and transmission constraints. In addition, it reduces price volatility, mitigates market power, and lowers electricity prices for end-users. This paper conceptually and empirically explores barriers to <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> in industry from an end-user perspective. Based on the taxonomy of barriers developed in the realm of barriers to energy efficiency, a questionnaire was developed which translates these barriers into 21 items in the context of <b>load</b> <b>shift.</b> Then, an online survey was carried out among companies located primarily in Southern Germany. The findings suggest that the most important barriers are risk of disruption of operations, impact on product quality, and uncertainty about cost savings. Of little concern are access to capital, lack of employee skills, and data security. The findings of statistical tests suggest that larger companies are more concerned about technical, financial and regulatory risk than smaller ones. Companies with a continuous production process report lower barrier scores than companies using batch or just-in-time production. A principal component analysis clusters the barriers, points to differences between barriers to <b>load</b> <b>shift</b> and barriers to energy efficiency, and offers guidance for future empirical studies...|$|R
