25|$|In 2000, a T-34 Model 1943 was {{recovered}} that had spent 56 {{years at the}} bottom of a bog in Estonia. The tank had been captured and used by retreating German troops, who dumped it in the swamp when it ran out of fuel. The anaerobic environment of the bog preserved the tank and ensured there were no signs of oil <b>leakage,</b> rust, <b>or</b> other <b>significant</b> water damage. The engine was restored to full working order.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{flexibility}} in spectrum shaping, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for dynamic spectrum access. However, the out-of-band (OOB) power radiation of OFDM introduces significant interference to the adjacent users. This problem is serious in cognitive radio (CR) networks, which enables the secondary system {{to access the}} instantaneous spectrum hole. Existing methods either do not effectively reduce the OOB power <b>leakage</b> <b>or</b> introduce <b>significant</b> bit-error-rate (BER) performance deterioration in the receiver. In this paper, a joint spectral precoding (JSP) scheme is developed for OOB power reduction by the matrix operations of orthogonal projection and singular value decomposition (SVD). We also propose an algorithm to design the precoding matrix under receive performance constraint, which is converted to matrix condition number constraint in practice. This method well achieves the desirable spectrum envelope and receive performance by selecting zero-forcing frequencies. Simulation {{results show that the}} OOB power decreases significantly by the proposed scheme under condition number constraint...|$|R

30|$|Other {{examples}} of vesicle <b>leakage</b> <b>or</b> bursting following illumination have been reported, which {{may result from}} phenomena similar to those reported here. For example, prolonged illumination (minutes to hours) of phospholipid GUVs containing membrane-localized fluorescent dyes led to a gradual increase in membrane tension, ultimately leading to a cycle of opening of a transient pore in the membrane, followed by leakage of vesicle contents and pore closing [28]. In another case, 500 nm LUVs containing a high (self-quenching) concentration of calcein, docked to a supported lipid bilayer by a SNARE complex, were occasionally observed to burst during illumination [29]. In neither of these cases was the mechanism driving increased membrane tension and subsequent <b>leakage</b> <b>or</b> bursting investigated.|$|R
