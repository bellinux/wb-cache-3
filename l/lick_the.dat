5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who {{have been exposed to}} higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> clitorises of dominant females, the females will not <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|The mammary glands {{of mammals}} are {{specialized}} to produce milk, {{the primary source}} of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly.|$|E
5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs {{have evolved to}} live in multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), {{is thought to have}} evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs {{are active}} {{primarily}} {{during the day}} (diurnal), during which time they feed primarily on fruits and nectar, often adopting suspensory postures while feeding. The seeds of the fruit they eat pass through their digestive tract and are propagated throughout the rainforests in their feces, helping to ensure new plant growth and a healthy forest ecosystem. These lemurs are also significant pollinators of the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis). Without destroying the inflorescence, they <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> nectar from deep inside the flower using their long muzzles and tongues, collecting and transferring pollen on their snouts and fur from plant to plant. This relationship {{is thought to be}} a result of co-evolution.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
5|$|Lavender's primary pitch was the spitball, and {{his method}} of {{preparation}} was to <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> ball. In a game on July19, Lavender was about to load the ball when he smelled a liniment on the ball. He reported this to the home plate umpire, who then ejected the Phillies manager, Red Dooin, from the game. Dooin had been caught doing this to another spitballer, Marty O'Toole, a few days earlier. On September26, Lavender and the Cubs were ahead 9–0in {{the top half of}} the ninth inning versus Cincinnati, when the Reds scored 10runs against Lavender and two other pitchers to take the lead 10–9. The Cubs ultimately prevailed and gained the victory by scoring two runs in the bottom half of the ninth. Lavender started just one more game in 1912, a 3–2victory on October5 against St. Louis. Following the season, the Cubs played a series of exhibition games with the Chicago White Sox of the American League called the City Series. Lavender started the first game against Ed Walsh, and the game ended after nine innings with a scoreless tie. Lavender gave six hits and Walsh just one. After the two teams played to a 12-inning tie two days later, Lavender pitched the Cubs to victory in game three. Two additional victories gave the Cubs a 3–0series lead, but the White Sox were able to win four straight games, twice defeating Lavender, including in the series finale. He completed his rookie season with his career-high 16victories, against 13losses, and a 3.04earned run average(ERA) in 251innings pitched.|$|E

While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation. Post copulation genital grooming has also been observed.|$|E

Around these gaps great quantities of elk, deer, bear and other bones are still found today. Dr. Thomas S.

25|$|Copulation is {{frequent}} {{in winter}} colonies, {{with as many}} as 27 instances observed per day in colonies with large proportions of female bats. During mating, the bats screech loudly, and males will <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> female's vulva. This species probably has the ability to breed year-round. Gestation is estimated at 5–7 months, after which the female gives birth to one pup. Pups are most frequently seen in August, though they have been observed in February, March, April, and December as well.|$|E

25|$|People {{can acquire}} cat-associated infections through bites, {{scratches}} or other direct contact {{of the skin}} or mucous membranes with the cat. This includes 'kissing' or letting the animal <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> mouth or nose. Mucous membranes are easily infected when the pathogen is {{in the mouth of}} the cat. Pathogens can also infect people when there is contact with animal saliva, urine and other body fluids or secretions, When fecal material is unintentionally ingested, infection can occur. Feline zooinosis can be acquired by a person by inhalation of aerosols or droplets coughed up by the cat.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{accounts of}} Blue Licks {{describe it as}} a place where animals gathered to <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> salt deposits flowing from the springs in the area. The Reverend James Smith provides this account in his 1795–97 diary: As you approach the Licks, at the distance of 4 or 5 miles from it, you begin to perceive the change. The earth seems to be worn away; the roots of the trees lie naked and bare; the rocks forsaken of the earth, that once covered them, lie naked on the neighboring hills, and roads of an amazing size, in all directions, unite at the Licks, as their common center. Here immense herds of buffalo used formerly to meet and with their fighting, scraping etc., have worn away the ground to what it is at present.|$|E
25|$|In {{honor of}} Asclepius, a {{particular}} type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes– the Aesculapian snakes– crawled around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world. From about 300 BCE onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary– the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation. Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to <b>lick</b> <b>the</b> wounds of sick petitioners.|$|E
