The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight.|$|E
5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain <b>light</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{object recognition}} under various <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> for a robot which finds a user-specified object and brings {{it to the}} user. The system first constructs object models under a known <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> Because the <b>lighting</b> <b>condition</b> in model construction {{is different from that}} in object recognition, the system needs to transform the model’s color for the current <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> The system estimates color transformation by using only one observed color of a reference object. Last the system tries to recognize a user-specified object based on the estimated <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> When the system fails in recognition, it tries again by using the user’s advice. Experiments using real-world refrigerator scenes are shown. ...|$|R
40|$|We discuss tting a semiparametric model {{based on}} two sources of information, which is {{motivated}} by a rat sleep dataset. In a recent study, rats were exposed to two dierent <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> The rst, baseline condition, was a standard 24 -hour schedule of 12 hours lights on followed by 12 hours lights o; the second, test condition, exposed rats to a continuous 3 hours lights on / 3 hours lights o schedule. Rat sleep {{was believed to be}} aected mainly by the circadian rhythm under the baseline <b>lighting</b> <b>condition</b> and by both the circadian rhythm and light under the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> In this article, we suggest tting a nonparametric model for the dataset under the baseline <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> For the dataset under the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition,</b> a two-part model is suggested. The rst part equals an unknown coecient multiplied by the nonparametric function used for modeling the dataset under the baseline <b>lighting</b> <b>condition,</b> explaining the remnant of the circadian rhythm under the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> The second part is a periodic nonparametric function which would explain the eect of the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> This modeling procedure can be used to model other physiological parameters aected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

5|$|The {{most common}} and {{effective}} colours are red, yellow, black and white. These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, have strong contrast, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning colouration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and colour combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning colouration evolves in response to background, <b>light</b> <b>conditions,</b> and predator vision. Visible signals may be accompanied by odours, sounds or behaviour to provide a multi-modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} horror genre is {{also known}} for other non-combat challenges, such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world, and collecting and managing an inventory of items. Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items. Occasionally, levels are designed with alternative routes. Levels also challenge players with maze-like environments, which test the player's navigational skills. Levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic (often making use of dim or shadowy <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility) to challenge the player and provide suspense, although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments.|$|E

40|$|Gaze {{direction}} {{is an important}} communicative cue. In order to use this cue for human-robot interaction, software needs to be developed that enables the estimation of head pose. We began by designing an application that is {{be able to make}} a good estimate of the head pose, and, contrary to earlier neural network approaches, that works for non-optimal <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> Initial results show that the approach using multiple networks trained with differing datasets, gives a good estimate of head pose, and it works well in poor <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> The solution is not optimal yet. Smart selection rules taking into account different <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> would enable us to select the neural networks trained with images with similar <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> This research will allow us to use head orientation cues in Human-Robot interaction with low-resolution cameras and in poor <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> The software allows the robot to give a timely reaction to the dynamical communicative cues used by humans...|$|R
40|$|Images of {{the same}} face viewed under {{different}} <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> look different. It {{is no surprise then}} that face recognition systems based on image comparisons can fail when the <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> vary. In this paper we address this failure by designing a new <b>lighting</b> <b>condition</b> independent face matching technique. We begin by demonstrating that the colour image of a face viewed under any <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> is a linear transform from the image {{of the same}} face viewed under complex (3 lights at 3 locations) conditions. Our new matching technique solves for the best linear transform relating pairs of face images prior to calculating the image difference. For a database of 15 (complexly illuminated) faces and 45 test face images the new matching method delivers perfect recognition. In comparison, matching without accounting for <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> fails 25 % of the time. I.

As the reigning champions the French Davis Cup team {{had only one}} {{scheduled}} challenge match during the season and could skip the preliminary rounds. Lacoste and Cochet entered the British Hard Court Championships. Pat Spence eliminated Cochet in the semifinal stage but lost to Lacoste in the final. Cochet and Bennett gained the mixed doubles title. In May he accepted a one-on-one and a doubles challenge with Béla von Kehrling and the Hungarian Davis Cup team in Budapest. In front of a local crowd of 3000, Cochet won in four sets against the home favorite. The doubles match between Von Kehrling – Jenő Péteri and Cochet – Roger Danet was indefinitely suspended due to bad <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> at 6–2, 7–9, one set each. The next stop was in Vienna where he won the Austrian International Championships. Returning home he secured his French International Championships title by overcoming Lacoste in the final in four sets. The doubles were won by Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon {{despite the efforts of}} Cochet and René de Buzelet. Cochet and recurring partner Bennett added the French hard courts mixed title to their set of accolades after defeating Helen Wills, women's world champion, and Frank Hunter, the No. 2 USLTA player in a three-set championship match. On 6 July at the 1928 Wimbledon Championships Lacoste equalized with a victory over Cochet and deprived him of the title. Cochet and Bennett lost in the mixed quarterfinals. Cochet and Brugnon won the doubles again over Gerald Patterson and John Hawkes after their 1926 triumph. At the end of July in the Challenge round of the Davis Cup at Roland Garros the Musketeers, with the absence of Brugnon, defeated the United States to keep the trophy in French possession. Cochet won all three of his rubbers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new method to change the {{illumination}} condition of a face image, with unknown face geometry and albedo information. This problem is particularly difficult when {{there is only one}} single image of the subject available and it was taken under a harsh <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> Recent research demonstrates that the set of images of a convex Lambertian object obtained under a wide variety of <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> can be approximated accurately by a low-dimensional linear subspace using spherical harmonic representation. However, the approximation error can be large under harsh <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> [2] thus making it difficult to recover albedo information. In order to address this problem, we propose a subregion based framework that uses a Markov Random Field to model the statistical distribution and spatial coherence of face texture, which makes our approach not only robust to harsh <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions,</b> but insensitive to partial occlusions as well. The performance of our framework is demonstrated through various experimental results, including the improvement to the face recognition rate under harsh <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate a set of colors with a mobile robot. Estimating colors is particularly important if objects in an environment can only be distinguished by their color. Since the appearance of colors can change due to variations in the <b>lighting</b> <b>condition,</b> a robot needs to adapt its color model to such changes. We propose a two level Gaussian model in which the <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> are estimated at the upper level using a switching Kalman filter. A hierarchical Bayesian technique learns Gaussian priors from data collected in other environments. Furthermore, since estimation of the color model depends on knowledge of the robot’s location, we employ a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter to maintain a joint posterior over robot positions and <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> We evaluate the technique {{in the context of}} the RoboCup AIBO league, where a legged AIBO robot has to localize itself in an environment similar to a soccer field. Our experiments show that the robot can localize under different <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> and adapt to changes in the <b>lighting</b> <b>condition,</b> for example, due to a light being turned on or off.
