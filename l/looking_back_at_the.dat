5|$|The Quatermass Memoirs is a British radio drama-documentary, {{originally}} {{broadcast in}} 5 episodes on BBC Radio 3 in March 1996. Written by Nigel Kneale, {{it was born}} out of his Quatermass series of films and television serials, which had first been broadcast in the 1950s. The idea for the show appeared as BBC radio intended to create a season of programming <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, and it was the final piece of writing Kneale completed relating to the character.|$|E

India trailed by 56 in the first innings and lost the six second innings wickets for 63. Batting at No.3, Shastri was last out for a courageous 107 out of 251 allout. <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the his career, he was to consider this his finest innings. The bowlers were Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and Ian Bishop and the pitch, difficult.|$|E

25|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{different}} {{causes of}} pica related to assessment, the clinician {{will try to}} develop a treatment. First, there is pica {{as a result of}} social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These things can be placed in a “Pica Box” that should be easily accessible to the individual when they feel like engaging in pica.|$|E

500|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{defeat of}} the {{incumbent}} Social Democrats, the opinion among {{several members of the}} defeated incumbents was that the election was lost because the previous government failed to bring down unemployment, and failed to campaign on it as an issue. Ardalan Shekarabi, the former chairman for the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, stated that [...] "the Moderates were right strategically to focus on unemployment". Former Social Democratic minister Leif Pagrotsky stated that internal fighting, authoritarianism and perceived aggressiveness as well as a loss of appeal to the middle class and city inhabitants contributed to the election loss.|$|E

On their third album, as on their phase-shifting 1986 debut," [...] he continues, [...] "Eric B.'s samples truly are beats, designed {{to accentuate the}} natural music of an idealized black man's voice." [...] <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> late eighties in Rolling Stone in 1997, Ed Moralez describes Rakim as [...] "the new-school MC of the moment, using a smooth baritone to become the jazz soloist of mystic Afrocentric rap." ...|$|E

[...] He returned to writing for radio {{for the first time since}} the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary The Quatermass Memoirs for BBC Radio 3. Partly composed of Kneale <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> events that led to the writing of the original three Quatermass serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV Quatermass serial and featuring Andrew Keir, star of the Hammer version of Quatermass and the Pit, as the Professor.|$|E
500|$|The {{localization}} team faced {{some issues}} when localizing the character Jean Armstrong: in the Japanese version, he {{is portrayed as}} an okama character, {{which at the time}} of the game's development was a general word for effeminate men, often implying homosexuality, but also used for biologically male persons who do drag or speak like women, regardless of their sexuality and gender, and even including trans women. Because of this, they only had a vague concept of [...] "gay", and had to make it understandable for English-speaking players. Hsu looked through all information that is given about Jean in the game, and came to the conclusion that he is a gay cis man who likes to perform non-passing drag. <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> game in 2014, Hsu said that she still thought Jean caused confusion due to the general public having a less informed and nuanced understanding of gender and sexuality {{at the time of the}} game's release.|$|E

It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey's nave… The Quatermass Experiment frightened the life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation… Quatermass {{was one of the first}} series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying." ...|$|E

500|$|Kneale {{had brought}} Quatermass's story {{to a close}} in the 1979 serial Quatermass, and for many years {{saw no reason to}} revisit the character. However, in 1995 he was {{approached}} by BBC radio producer Paul Quinn with an idea for creating a drama-documentary about the character as part of a season of BBC radio programming <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1950s. Quinn told Dreamwatch magazine, [...] "For many people who remember the seminal experience of hiding behind the sofa when the Quatermass serials came on the television, Quatermass was the 1950s. His adventures [...] have gone down in popular cultural history." [...] Kneale was intrigued by the idea, and agreed to write new dramatic material of Quatermass relating his memories which Quinn could then combine with archive clips from the existing episodes of the various Quatermass television serials. Kneale saw the older Quatermass of this new serial as [...] "the same very concerned scientist who is now, in retrospect, horribly worried about what he may have done to the world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted". It was Kneale's first radio work since he had written the play You Must Listen for the BBC in 1952, and his first work for the BBC in any medium since the mid-1970s.|$|E
