The presence {{of hydrogen}} in titanium alloys usually results in degradation of their microstructure and properties, as well promote some undesirable effects such as hydrogen corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement [3]. Positive nature of the effects of hydrogen on the properties of titanium alloys is manifested in the high temperature hydrogen treatment (HTM- Hydrogen Treatment of Materials), where hydrogen is temporary alloying component [4 - 9]. This is possible because of the high values of diffusion coefficients can be easily introduced into the titanium and it just as easily removed. Titanium and its alloys show the absorbability of almost 60 at. % of hydrogen at 600 °C. The <b>limit</b> hydrogen <b>of</b> <b>solubility</b> in Tiα is very low and does not exceed 0. 05 at. % at room temperature. The <b>limit</b> hydrogen <b>of</b> <b>solubility</b> in Tiβ is much higher and its maximum value is 48 at. %.
