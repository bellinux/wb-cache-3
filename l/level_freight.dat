50|$|In the United States, {{urban freight}} policy and {{planning}} is {{conducted at the}} federal, state, regional, and local levels. At the federal <b>level,</b> <b>freight</b> planning and policy is guided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST) that establishes the National Multimodal Freight Policy and National Freight Strategic Plan. In addition, the FHWA Office of Freight Management and Operations conducts freight research, develops analytical tools and data, and organizes freight professional development programs.|$|E
50|$|At {{its peak}} in the 1930s the Port Authority said it was {{handling}} {{more than half of}} the LCL freight operations south of 59th Street in Manhattan with more than 8,000 tons of goods passing through it each month. On one day alone in 1937 it was reported that 650 trucks had used the facility. The railroads involved were the Pennsylvania Railroad; Lehigh Valley Railroad; Baltimore & Ohio; Erie Railroad; Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad; Central Railroad of New Jersey; New York Central Railroad; New York, New Haven & Hartford. The building included four freight elevators that could carry fully loaded 20 ton trucks. Because of the warehouse mission of the building it was able to avoid some of the setback rules that greatly reduced the buildable space available for the skyscrapers that mark the Manhattan skyline. As a result, the 15-story building with its football field size floors has more available rentable square footage than the 102-story Empire State Building which has 2.2 million square feet. The construction occurred at a time of a massive projects built to deal with what at the time was street <b>level</b> <b>freight</b> railroad traffic on Manhattan's west side. Other projects in the neighborhood in the era included construction of the High Line and Starrett-Lehigh Building.|$|E
30|$|These {{differences}} in the levels of participation are also visible in the issues raised and the direct outcomes of each category of meetings. At the local <b>level,</b> <b>freight</b> topics discussed related to the daily life of deliveries, including impacts for the residents and working conditions for the delivery staff. Solutions were not discussed except in some very specific cases such as the rearrangement of the delivery bays in a very busy retail street, or routes and parking areas for the trucks accessing an exhibition hall. At the municipal level, issues examined were both very practical and broad ranging, leading to a reformulation of traffic and parking regulations, land use zoning and a new management of on-street delivery bays. At the regional level, an additional group of stakeholders, the real estate developers, emerged and imposed logistics land use and development as a dominant item on the meetings’ agenda. The Region’s representatives (elected officials and staff) were willing to endorse this theme as {{it is part of}} their general mandate on regional economic development.|$|E

40|$|Freight {{transportation}} {{is a critical}} component of socioeconomic activities. However, freight planning models are not as well developed as passenger traffic models There is an urgent need for freight planning at both the state and national level. The objective of this dissertation is to address several crucial issues related to freight modeling. ^ The availability and quality of freight and truck data are major obstacles for state level planning. The first part of this dissertation contributes to freight planning practice by quantitatively evaluating the merits of currently available data sources and developing a novel state level truck generation model. The study indicates a significant discrepancy among major sources, the Commodity Flow Survey, the TRANSEARCH database, and highway monitoring data for the State of Connecticut. A synthetic OD method was developed to integrate information from various sources to improve the truck origin-destination estimation. This approach provides a novel framework to improve state level truck traffic planning utilizing multiple data sources. ^ A second focus of this dissertation is to model the national <b>level</b> <b>freight</b> generation at county level. Advance statistical models were used to overcome the lack-of-fit problem with ordinary linear models and incorporate the spatial dependency of freight generation. The spatial dependency of freight generation is reflected in (1) the spatial characteristics of the zone, such as distance to transportation hubs; and (2) the fact that zones in close spatial proximity tend to have similar freight production and economic activity. We incorporated the spatial dependency by introducing spatial variables to represent the characteristics of individual zones as well as using a spatial autoregressive model to account for the spatial correlations. The results indicate models that incorporate spatial dependency are a substantial improvement over non-spatial models. ^ The zone system for freight data collection and publishing has significant impacts on freight analyses and planning. However, the majority of existing freight zone systems are provided in an ad hoc way. There is an urgent need for creation of a national level optimal freight zone system. In the third part of the dissertation, a novel model-based optimal zone design method was proposed to design freight zones for the continental United States. This method seeks to directly optimize zone configurations with two components: (1) the optimal criterion which quantitatively represents the desired properties of an optimal zone system, and (2) the shape constraints governing the shape, size, and continuity of individual zones. The method was applied to the continental US with an inter-zonal distance weighted by freight flows as the optimization criterion. Several alternative optimal zone systems for nation-level freight transportation were developed. The comparison of the alternative freight zone systems indicates that a 300 -zone system provides an optimal balance between number of zones and the optimization criterion. The methodology and results from this study addressed several challenges related to zone design methodology issues and provide an important reference for national <b>level</b> <b>freight</b> data collection and publishing efforts. ...|$|E
30|$|Since {{this review}} is {{concerned}} with the current practice in urban logistics plans, the selected criteria systematically limit the conceptual framework and scope of the study [24]. The search to identify city plans, public documents and reports was completed between January and September 2016 and actioned through the Google Scholar and Google search engines. The scope of the article is limited to Scandinavia and the UK, where several urban freight plans are identified. It is valuable to compare Scandinavia with UK since they are organised similarly but UK is considered relatively more advanced when it comes to urban freight initiatives [27]. Comparisons are made across the Scandinavian countries, which share a common history and have developed relatively similar political, economic and social systems [28]. The review separates between: (i) regional and (ii) local and city level urban freight plans. The regional level are freight plans, which among other freight transport issues, includes sections on urban freight. These plans are implemented and/or developed in a county, metropolitan area or region. Local and city <b>level</b> <b>freight</b> plans focus explicitly on urban freight issues and are implemented and/or developed by a municipality or local district i.e. borough or city. 2 Logistics, or city/urban logistics, is seen as the system or strategy ensuring efficient urban freight movements, while urban freight is the transportation of goods in an urban area. The review focuses on goods distribution in an urban area or region compared to a rural area; hence the concept ‘freight’ is applied [29, 30].|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a survey of}} several models used in the U. S. to {{estimate}} the impact of GHG control strategies in the surface transport sector. The models chosen for review were selected to represent both the state-of-the-art, and the state-of-the practice. While this paper does not attempt to review all possible models in the U. S., it is quite comprehensive in its coverage of models that are widely used, or ones widely acknowledged as the state-of-the-art by leading researchers in the field. The categorization of models {{and the types of}} strategies that can be analyzed is necessary to provide a good comparative picture of modeling capabilities and model sophistication. Section 2 provides a description of one possible classification scheme that allows common descriptors to be used across of a variety of models and their capabilities to analyze different types of control strategies. Broadly speaking, the forecasts of surface transportation related GHG emissions need models capable of forecasting vehicle stock, fuel use, and travel. These topics are the subjects of Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The travel models are discussed in two sections, one that deals with travel at a national level and the second that deals with travel at a local and regional <b>level.</b> <b>Freight</b> travel models have not been traditionally coupled with personal travel models and are discussed separately in Section 7. Section 8 describes models that integrate information on all vehicles, fuel and travel to estimate total fuel demand and GHG emissions. Section 9 summarizes the capabilities of the different models reviewed to analyze alternative GHG control strategies. 2 -...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to discuss methods and techniques for a quantitative and descriptive analysis of future container transport demand at a global level. Information on future container transport flows is useful for various purposes. It is instrumental {{for the assessment of}} returns of investments in network infrastructure and fleets, the prediction of environmental impacts of transport and the analysis of success of governmental policies about maritime markets and hinterland transport systems. As the future development of global freight flows is unknown and quite uncertain, models are used to define plausible and consistent scenarios of the future performance of the sector. Models of global container transport demand can follow the generic architecture available for freight transport modelling. We describe the methods and techniques available by reviewing the literature with a specific focus on global <b>level</b> <b>freight</b> modelling and treat the subject in two main parts. One part involves modelling the demand for movement between regions, i. e. the outcome of the processes of production, consumption and trade. The second part involves the modelling of demand for transport services by mode and route of transport, including the demand for maritime and inland port services. In both parts we find that surprisingly little research has been conducted specifically for descriptive models of global container movements. Future work can focus on the linkages between container transport and supply chain management. This may include {{a better understanding of the}} contribution of shippers’ preferences to observed shipping choices. Also, future developments in geographic restructuring of supply chains because of changes in manufacturing locations or distribution structures, could be looked into. Finally, as global, integrative models do not yet exist, combining new trade and transport network models in a consistent way should provide new tools for long term forecasting and policy analysis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a procedure for statewide planning of truck commodity flows and apply it to the State of Iowa. The methodology utilizes available relevant data sources at the state level and state-of-the-art freight transportation planning tools. A case study consisting of two manufacturing sectors and a simplistic transportation network is developed for Iowa to demonstrate the procedure. Difficulties encountered in the modeling process are identified and categorized by cause into modeling capability or data related. Data deficiencies having the greatest impact on the modeling process and the accuracy of the results are identified. Some methods to improve freight data are offered as are estimates of the effort entailed in improving and developing new data;The procedure for the statewide distribution and assignment of truck commodity flows provides a practical tool for state <b>level</b> <b>freight</b> transportation planning. The procedure examines major commodity movements on dense corridors. The general scheme of the methodology is to: (1) identify major commodities shipped in the state; (2) identify producing and attracting zones of the major commodities in the state; (3) estimate truck shipments between origin-destination pairs; and (4) assign estimated truck trips onto the primary highways within the state;Analysis zones within Iowa represent counties, while external analysis zones represent states. The total zonal freight tonnage generated is estimated using socioeconomic indicators, employment and population. Produced manufacturing freight is correlated with employment rates. Attracted freight is allocated to industrial inputs by employment and to consumption using population size. The truck freight share is estimated as the total freight generated less the freight tonnage shipped by rail. A gravity model is used to distribute the estimated truck tonnage among major origin-destination pairs. The impedance factor in the gravity model is equal to the inverse of travel time on links. Estimated truck tonnage is converted to vehicle trips using typical vehicle equivalent weights. Truck trips are assigned to shortest paths calculated using a tree building algorithm. Estimated truck trips are validated against truck counts on selected highway links...|$|E
