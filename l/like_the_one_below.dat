His show was strictly targeting consumers/fans who were really interested in what one would call ‘underground hiphop’, specifically one that is hardcore.

40|$|In {{this second}} CFN (r) {{symposium}} I {{would like to}} stress the need to recover {{a way of thinking}} according to analogical logic as opposed to the (exhausted) univocal model of thinking that excludes science and refers to it only through the principle of non-contradiction (neo-positivism); and as opposed to the (inconsistent) equivocal model of thinking in which "anything goes", so long as it is upheld by some human group (postmodernism.) I will deal with three issues: 1) From the Scotist and nominalist criticisms to overcome the absolute omnipotence of God, the material substrate of the world becomes a meaningless power, ready for whatever human reason decides. Science is no longer knowledge at the service of intelligibility and will have no more unity than methodological unity; its resources will be: testing, experimenting, and quantifying within a logical argument that ensures the coherence of all these operations. This will also have ethical and moral implications; thus, the Kantian project, along the lines of Scotus and Luther, concentrates its efforts in proclaiming the autonomy of the moral world against the deterministic nature of physical laws. Nature ceases to be the bearer of values and goals - of dignity -, and, therefore, it is seen as corrupt nature (Luther, Calvin) which is entirely unable to entail legality, let alone to justify any moral standards that impose duties heteronomously to the consciousness. Aristotelian philosophy, analogical, takes into account unity in diversity. The exercise of human intelligence, of intelligibility, governs two key perspectives: 1) the purpose of intelligibility (practical philosophy) and 2) the form of intelligibility (theoretical philosophy, ontology or metaphysics in the Aristotelian sense, semiotics). The totality of knowledge {{has to do with the}} analogical unity of specifically diverse multiple notions. The analogical philosophy based on the Aristotelian model deactivates, consequently, the supposedly indefinite will of the subject; hazard, the principle of entities; the pure emergency, pure creativity. 2) Secondly, I will propose a model for consciousness. In a paper presented at Urbino (Italy), I showed that research on the brain is characterized by the absence of a theorem of consciousness. There is nothing similar to the "the double helix theory" in molecular biology. Vilanayur Ramachandran suggests that this role could be played by mirror cells: "I predict that mirror neurons will do for psychology What DNA did for biology. " But whether or not this is true, Ramachandran sets us on different path from standard programs: the theorem of consciousness must emerge not from the study of single brain and the physiological processes that occur within it, but from opening up to the investigation to the connection between two brains, at least. This proposal is inspired by the René Thom model to account for the predator/prey relationship. According to the biological interpretation of the model, a cat and a mouse are understood to form a topological unit or logos. These two actants [cat and mouse] are related in an irreversible manner, which implies the thesis of the unidirectional collision. The cat sees the mouse (J); it chases it (JRK); the mouse can escape or be eaten (bimodality); (K) and the cat sleeps, becoming its own prey (KSJ). The model is justified by appealing to the theory of stable singularities. The transformations of points from unstable to stable can be understood as the collision of a wave front on a plane. As the wave front propagates on the plane it sweeps an area of space-time. The surface, in turn, can be understood as another wave front. The complexity of the waves means that only certain sections can be studied. The intuitive strategy that we will be presenting begins with the representation of the elliptical umbilical with its four singular points; the space between phases is plotted formula V (x, y) = x ² and - and ³ / 3 and then we join the paths oriented according to the eigenvectors of the isolated points, so that we obtain a figure <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>below</b> where we can intuitively "see" how to connect all the attractors. The four actants that make up the morphology can be reduced by a smooth transformation to a maximum (the same applies to the hyperbolic umbilical). The question is whether one of the actants is interpreted as Subject or Instrument. I refer to Thom's interpretation of the indirect Messenger. 3) Thirdly, I will establish a wider philosophical hypothesis: original consciousness is plural, because there are, at least, four ways to make contact with the two (self) consciousnesses that block the resonance between the Subject and Instrument actants. This hypothesis spans from topological to neurological hermeneutics, via semantic hermeneutics according to the Thom-Petitot-Wildgen rule. Topological hermeneutics: The Elliptical umbilical, models the states of excitement, tension, and its opposite, resistance: E 1 : morphologies of tension and penetration. E 2 : The opposite, the morphology of resistance (cf. SSyM, 112, 207). The Hyperbolic umbilical models the states of inhibition, expulsion and relaxation. H 1 : the morphology of expulsion. H 2 : The opposite, the morphology of relaxation, of the vault (la voûte). Neuronal Hermeneutics. The consciousness appears. This purely topological approach, can be read now as a morphological field in which two recurrent dynamic systems interact, whose product A B is structurally unstable (two sets of attractors which collide and remain in a state of imbalance with respect to each other). This phenomenon is known as resonance (SSyM, 145). Thus the traditional model of consciousness (Crick, Korch [...] .) is displaced as the transition from the waking to the sleeping states and vice versa (the process of hysteresis) in favour of resonance or collision between two dynamic systems. Therefore we can now speak of "communicating brains". The four original forms of consciousness E. Elliptical consciousness-Instrumental E. 1. A consciousness that affirms its status as the sole Subject and everything else - including the Other Subject-, appears to it as Messengers/Instruments. The Messenger/Instrument actant identifies with the Other that is not the Subject. E. 2. A consciousness that resists becoming the Instrument and in turn affirms itself to be the sole Subject. The Instrument blends with the Subject. H. 	Hyperbolic consciousness – Corporal H. 1. A consciousness of the subject that begins to stabilize by absorbing the element that is blocking it. In order to capture the object using instrument I, emanation of the subject, it is necessary to collapse the area between the instrument and the object, M, the mediator of the subject. This is the consciousness of the excluded party. H. 2. If this part resists, M is protected by the other three actants. This is the all-encompassing and protective consciousness of the other actants...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This review gives a brief {{introduction}} to the physics {{and the structure of}} active galactic nuclei (AGN). The main topics that are being discussed are general accretion, the structure and the spectrum of various types of accretion disks, photoionization and recombination, energy balance and gas temperature, the spectrum of ionized gas including the effect of dust, and the dynamics of ionized gas in a strong radiation field. These principles are then applied to various AGN components including the broad and the narrow line regions, the ionized X-ray gas, the torus and the central disk. 1 Terminology, Classification and Abbreviations The study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) has produced many new terms and abbreviations. Only <b>the</b> most common <b>ones</b> will be used in this review, e. g., the narrow line region (NLR), the broad line region (BLR), the highly ionized gas (HIG) and the black hole (BH). I shall avoid, as much as possible, using names such as Seyfert 1 s, Seyfert 2 s and LINERs. Instead I shall refer to type-I AGN (those objects showing broad, strong optical-UV emission lines in their spectrum), and type-II AGN (those showing prominent narrow emission lines, very faint, if any, broad lines, and a large X-ray obscuring column). 2 Black Holes Black holes (BHs) of all sizes are very common in the universe. This has been known for many years. However, the understanding that most galaxies, especially early type galaxies, contain massive BHs is more recent. New studies compare BH mass and evolution in high redshift quasars to the evolution of early galaxies. It seems that massive BHs, as large as 10 9 M⊙, have already been present at z ≃ 6 [1]. Some of these sources seem to accrete matter at a very high rate. This raises important questions about the growth rate and the formation mechanism of those BHs. Any BH and accretion disk model, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> presented <b>below,</b> must be compatible with such observation.

5000|$|As for {{the next}} theory, much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that {{is thought to be}} a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, {{resembling}} the surface of a basketball. The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies. [...] Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An excellent view of this mantle is shown below in the picture of the Ptolemaeus Crater Rim, as seen by HiRISE.The ice-rich mantle {{may be the result of}} climate changes. Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor will condense on the particles, then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity, up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlatitudes. This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulating the remaining ice. [...] Measurements of altitudes and slopes of gullies support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow.Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude. [...] Very few gullies are found in the Thaumasia region; however, a few are present in <b>the</b> lower elevations <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> pictured <b>below</b> in Ross Crater.|$|R

I begin by recalling some standard results about planar graphs that we will assume. 9. 2 3 -Connected and Planar Graphs A graph G = (V,E) is 3 -connected if there is no set of two vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. That is, for every S ⊂ V with |S | ≥ |V | − 2, G(S) is connected. In a classical graph theory course, one usually {{spends a lot of time}} studying things like 3 -connectivity. Planar graphs are the special graphs that can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges. That is, every vertex v can be assigned a point z (v) ∈ IR 2. Every edge (u, v) can be drawn as a curve from z (u) to z (v) so that none of the curves touch except at their endpoints. Such a drawing of a graph in the plane divides the plane into connected regions called faces. Each face is identified with the vertices and edges on its boarder. In a 3 -connected planar graph, the vertices and edges identified with each face are fixed. There are planar graphs that are not 3 -connected, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> shown <b>below,</b> in which different planar drawings result in combinatorially different faces. We will only consider 3 -connected planar graphs...|$|R
