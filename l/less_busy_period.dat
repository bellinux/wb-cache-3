40|$|Very often, {{the preface}} of a volume like this {{contains}} details and anecdotes of the person's life, in whose honour it is collected. In this case, however, {{these will be}} called to our minds by Professor Dr. Gottfried Konecny's friends and colleagues, students, and research partners, who have spent much time with him on many occasions, and who {{will be able to}} tell and to write by far better stories than I ever could. Therefore I restrict myself to just writing down a few thoughts which pass through my mind when recalling the years I spent at the Institute for Photogrammetry and Engineering Surveys of the University of Hannover, whose Head Professor Konecny has been for the past 27 years. I have come to realize that Professor Konecny's way of teaching has been guided by the following important rules: To teach the fundamentals, give them deep roots, and then let them grow individually. I had the great pleasure to enjoy the effect of his rules during the past years. I could grow, developing my own methods, I could prepare and finish my doctoral thesis without any narrow regulations, and I could start my academic career together with a powerful and highly motivated team of colleagues at his University Institute. Today, after thirteen years of work at the Institute, I am proud to introduce so many interesting contributions to this volume in honour of Professor Konecny, and I remember another management rule, which could well have been developed by him: If you want to become a good scientist, then joint the existing best, listen to them, and practice what you have learned. During the past years numerous international workshops, seminars, and summer schools abroad have been organized, or visited, and many visitors and fellows {{from all over the world}} learned and worked under his care. So it has been very easy for all of us to join and listen to the best, to learn, and to practice. All these contacts have contributed to grow, and to get a foothold in the scientific community. All of our staff therefore wish to thank Professor Konecny most heartily for his initial launch, and we wish him all the best for the new, probably not much <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> in his amazingly active life.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{concrete}} methodology for saving energy in future and contemporary cellular networks. It {{is based on}} re-arranging the user-cell association so as to allow shutting down under-utilized parts of the network. We consider a hypothetical static case where we have complete knowledge of stationary user locations and thus the results represent an upper bound of potential energy savings. We formulate the problem as a binary integer programming problem, thus it is NP-hard, and we present a heuristic approximation method. We simulate the methodology on an example real cellular network topology with trafficand user distribution generated according to recently measured patterns. Further, we evaluate the energy savings, using realistic energy profiles, and {{the impact on the}} user-perceived network performance, represented by delay and throughput, at various times of day. The general findings conclude that up to 50 % energy may be saved in <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> <b>periods,</b> while the performance effects remain limited. We conclude that practical, real-time usercell re-allocation methodology, taking into account user mobility predictions, may thus be feasible and bring significant energy savings at acceptable performance impact.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithmic {{analysis of the}} <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> for the M/M/c queueing system. By setting the <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> equal to the time interval during which at least one server is busy, we develop a first step analysis which gives the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> as the solution of a finite system of linear equations. This approach is useful in obtaining a suitable recursive procedure for computing the moments {{of the length of}} a <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> and the number of customers served during it. The maximum entropy formalism is then used to analyse what is the influence of a given set of moments on the distribution of the <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> and to estimate the true <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> distribution. Our study supplements a recent work of Daley and Servi (1998) and other studies where the <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> of a multiserver queue follows a different definition, i. e., a <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> is the time interval during which all servers are engaged. ...|$|R
