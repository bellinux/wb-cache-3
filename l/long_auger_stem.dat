40|$|In {{quantum dots}} (QDs) the Auger {{recombination}} is a non-radiative process, where the electron-hole recombination energy {{is transferred to}} an additional carrier. It has been studied mostly in colloidal QDs, where the Auger recombination time is in the ps range and efficiently quenches the light emission. In self-assembled QDs, on the other hand, the influence of Auger recombination on the optical properties is in general neglected, assuming that it is masked by other processes such as spin and charge fluctuations. Here, we use time-resolved resonance fluorescence to analyze the Auger recombination and its influence on the optical properties of a single self-assembled QD. From excitation-power dependent measurements, we find a <b>long</b> <b>Auger</b> recombination time of about 500 ns and a quenching of the trion transition by about 80 percent. Furthermore, we observe a broadening of the trion transition linewidth by up to a factor of two. With a model based on rate equations, {{we are able to}} identify the interplay between tunneling and Auger rate as the underlying mechanism for the reduced intensity and the broadening of the linewidth. This demonstrates that self-assembled QDs can serve as an ideal model system to study how the charge recapture process, given by the band-structure surrounding the confined carriers, influences the Auger process. Our findings are not only relevant for improving the emission properties of colloidal QD-based emitters and dyes, which have recently entered the consumer market. They are also of interest for more visionary applications, such as quantum information technologies, based on self-assembled quantum dots...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of mid-wavelength infrared radiation (MWIR) {{is very important}} for many military, industrial and biomedical applications. Present-day commercially available uncooled IR sensors operating in MWIR region (2 - 5 µm) use microbolometric detectors which are inherently slow. Available photon detectors (mercury cadmium telluride (MCT), bulk InSb and quantum well infrared detectors (QWIPs)) overcome this limitation. However, there are some fundamental issues decreasing their performance and ability for high temperature operation, including fast Auger recombination rates and high thermal generation rate. These detectors operate at low temperatures (77 K- 200 K) in order to obtain high signal to noise ratio. The requirement of cooling limits the lifetime, increases the weight and the total cost, as well as the power budget, of the whole infrared system. In recent years, InAs/GaSb superlattice based detectors have appeared as an interesting alternative to the present-day IR detector systems. These heterostructures have a type-II band alignment such that the conduction band of InAs layer is lower than the valence band of GaSb layer. The effective bandgap of these structures can be adjusted from 0. 4 eV to values below 0. 1 eV by varying the thickness of constituent layers leading to an enormous range of detector cutoff wavelengths (3 - 30 µm). The InAs/GaSb SLs have a higher degree of uniformity than the MCT alloys, making them attractive for large area focal plane arrays. They provide a smaller leakage current due to larger effective electron mass, which suppresses tunneling. This material system is also characterized by high operating temperatures and <b>long</b> <b>Auger</b> recombination rates. This suggests the potential for using the SLs technology for realizing high operating temperature devices. This work is focused on the development of mid-IR InAs/GaSb SLs sensors with high-operating temperature. Contributions of this thesis include 1) development of growth and processing procedure for the n-on-p and p-on-n design of SL detectors leading to improved detector performance, 2) careful evaluation of characteristics of SL detectors, 3) methods of reduction of surface component of dark current passivation techniques).

40|$|Consumption of raw or lightly cooked alfalfa sprouts {{has been}} a concern of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in recent years due to {{connections}} between sprouts and foodborne illnesses. Researchers have identified, contaminated seeds as {{the primary source of}} alfalfa sprouts contamination. Contamination of alfalfa seeds can originate in the field, harvesting, storing, or sprouting. Two pathogens of particular concern on alfalfa seeds are Escherichia coli 0157 :H 7 (E. coli) and Salmonella. These pathogens are capable of producing biofilms that provide protection for individual cells and allow for survival in otherwise hostile environments, including some disinfectant washes. Other factors that contribute to contamination are the crevices of the seed surface, which provide opportunities for the protection of organisms. Various disinfection options have been evaluated and the use of a 20, 000 ppm calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl) 2)) solution is the most effective disinfectant for satisfying the requirements of Task 2. Continued outbreaks of food poisoning indicate current disinfecting procedures are inadequate. In an effort to improve disinfection procedures, three bench scale apparatuses were constructed and tested to provide options for the commercial range of seed sanitation rates (from about 75 to 600 lb/week). Experiments were conducted to determine the disinfecting effectiveness of the apparatuses, as well as the current sanitization practices in industry. Experiments included dye removal tests where non-uniform dye removal indicated ineffective contacting. Similar experiments were performed using E. coli inoculating and post-contacting culturing. One bench scale apparatus constructed was a model of the rotary drums widely used in industry. After a 30 minute treatment in the rotary drum, the seeds were found to be free of dye, indicating good contacting. The seeds were also sprouted showing sanitation did not damage the seeds. However, due to the capital expense of 14, 000, the drum is not a viable option for small-scale sprout producers. For sprout growers who currently own rotary drums, drum use is recommended for seed sanitation. Another bench scale apparatus was designed to improve the current industry practice of hand dunking seed-filled mesh draw-string bags. Through experimentation, it was determined. the current hand dunking procedure, with little or no agitation, produces inadequate, non-uniform contact of the seeds and sanitizer. Therefore, the hand dunking procedure was modified to include agitation to effectively suspend the seeds throughout the bag to obtain good contact of the sanitizer solution with the seeds. The agitation-in-bag method is recommended for use in small volume sprout facilities, which currently employ the hand dunking procedure for sanitizing. A modest investment of 113 is needed to implement the agitation-in-bag sanitizing method. Since no additional operating costs are accrued in implementation, no incremental costs are required. Finally, an auger system was designed to sanitize one ton per hour of alfalfa seeds. The one ton per hour rate exceeds the demand of any individual sprout producer. Thus, the auger system is applicable to a partnership of sprout growers. Individual sprout growers within the mung bean industry, with much larger production volumes than the alfalfa industry, could economically use the auger system. However, the auger system can be scaled to sanitize any feed rate. A 1 3 / 82 ̆ 2 diameter, 42 ̆ 7 <b>long</b> <b>auger</b> bench scale model was constructed and tested at 4. 5 lbs/hr rate with a contact time of 15 minutes. Scale-up of this bench scale sanitizer to a 2000 lb/hr rate requires a 162 ̆ 2 diameter by 202 ̆ 7 auger. The entire full-scale sanitizing system, which includes a vibrating screen washer, will handle 5, 000, 000 lb/yr of seeds, operating 8 2 ̆ 7 hr/day, with a capital investment of 227, 000 and an incremental operating cost (primarily labor) of 214, 000 /yr...|$|R
40|$|Dual wall reverse {{circulation}} (DWRC) drilling {{was used to}} drill 48 borings during a groundwater contaminant investigation at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Paducah, Kentucky. This method was selected {{as an alternative to}} conventional hollow <b>stem</b> <b>auger</b> drilling for a number of reasons, including the expectation of minimizing waste, increasing the drilling rate, and reducing the potential for cross contamination of aquifers. Groundwater samples were collected from several water-bearing zones during drilling of each borehole. The samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds using a field gas chromatograph. This approach allowed the investigation to be directed using near-real-time data. Use of downhole geophysical logging, in conjunction with lithologic descriptions of borehole cuttings, resulted in excellent correlation of the geology {{in the vicinity of the}} contaminant plume. The total volume of cuttings generated using the DWRC drilling method was less than half of what would have been produced by hollow stem augering; however, the cuttings were recovered in slurry form and had to be dewatered prior to disposal. The drilling rate was very rapid, often approaching 10 ft/min; however, frequent breaks to perform groundwater sampling resulted in an average drilling rate of < 1 ft/min. The time required for groundwater sampling could be shortened by changing the sampling methodology. Analytical results indicated that the drilling method successfully isolated the various water bearing zones and no cross contamination resulted from the investigation...|$|R
50|$|With {{the design}} complete, {{construction}} {{is the next}} step. Most soil nail wall construction follows a specific procedure. First a cut is excavated and temporary bracing is put in place if necessary. This is done with conventional earth moving equipment and hydraulic drills. Next, holes for the soil nails are drilled at predetermined locations as specified by the design engineer. The equipment used for this step {{is dependent on the}} stability of the material in which the soil nail wall is supporting. Rotary or rotary percussive methods using air flush or dry auger methods can be used with stable ground. For unstable ground, single tube and duplex rotary methods with air and water flush or hollow <b>stem</b> <b>auger</b> methods are used. With the holes drilled, {{the next step is to}} install and grout the nails into place. After all nails are inserted, a drainage system is put into place. Synthetic drainage mat is placed vertically between the nail heads, which are extended down to the base of the wall where they are most commonly connected to a footing drain. A layer of shotcrete is applied and bearing plates are installed before a final facing is put in place to complete the soil nail wall. Variations of the steps described above may be necessary to accommodate additional preparation tasks or supplementary activities for specific project conditions.|$|R

Ground improvement works were required to satisfy building performance criteria {{in the event of a}} design seismic event. Several ground improvement methods were evaluated and the Rapid Impact Compaction (RIC) method was selected based upon the specific site requirements. The influence depth of RIC is typically around 5 to 6 m (16 to 20 ft) although this is depending on several issues such as soil type, degree of saturation, soil stiffness and other factors. A RIC pilot program was carried out to assess the specifications for the RIC method to achieve the required ground improvement. Based upon the presence of significant amounts of more granular material (e. g. gravel sized sediments), the BPT was selected as the in-situ evaluative tool. The quality control BPT program carried out after completion of the RIC pilot program indicated that the RIC method could meet the requirement for ground improvement with influence depth extending to almost 9 m (30 ft). Based on the results of the RIC pilot program, the RIC method was used within the entire building footprint. The successful results of the RIC method within the proposed building footprint were confirmed by a...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{experimentally}} studied {{several aspects of}} two Coulomb processes that change the number of electrons and holes in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). Carrier Multiplication (CM) is the production of additional electron-hole pairs by collision of a highly excited carrier with valence electrons. Efficient CM would improve the performance of solar energy conversion devices, but it is weak in the bulk. Recent reports by several groups suggested highly efficient CM in semi-conductor NCs. We describe here our assessment of CM using transient photoluminescence in CdSe and lead chalcogenide NCs. Biexciton radiative and nonradiative rates were determined. In our study, no detectable CM was found in CdSe NCs photoexcited at a photon energy of up to 5. 9 eV, and the CM yields observed for PbSe NCs at 3. 1 eV were found consistent with bulk values. Reasons for the strong disagreement with prior measurements are discussed, and the low yields are theoretically accounted for. The {{second part of the}} thesis describes two studies of the "Auger" nonradiative recombination process whereby an electron-hole pair recombines while transferring its energy to a third particle. This mechanism is responsible for the short multiexciton lifetimes in NCs. In one study, we demonstrate a direct method for determining biexciton quantum yields in single nanocrystals by photon cross-correlation (antibunching) measurements. We find significant inhomogeneity in these values, indicating a previously obscured variation in Auger recombination rates. (cont.) Another set of experiments tests the conventional charging model of NC fluorescence intermittency ("blinking") which attributes off-state quenching to Auger decay, by studying single NCs with relatively <b>long</b> multiexciton <b>Auger</b> lifetimes. We find that off-state exciton quantum yields are significantly lower than the quantum yield of a biexciton and we demonstrate that multiexciton emission also shows strong intermittency. Both of these findings contradict the standard charging model. Alternatives are discussed. by Gautham Padmanabhan Nair. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Stardust, a NASA Discovery-class mission, was {{the first}} sample-return mission to return solid samples from beyond the Moon. Stardust was {{effectively}} two missions in one spacecraft: it returned the first materials from a known primitive solar system body, the Jupiter-family comet Wild 2; Stardust also returned a collector that was exposed to the contemporary interstellar dust stream for 200 days during the interplanetary cruise. Both collections present severe technical challenges in sample preparation and in analysis. By far the largest collection is the cometary one: approximately 300 micro g of material was returned from Wild 2, mostly consisting of approx. 1 ng particles embedded in aerogel or captured as residues in craters on aluminum foils. Because of their relatively large size, identification of the impacts of cometary particles in the collection media is straightforward. Reliable techniques {{have been developed for}} the extraction of these particles from aerogel. Coordinated analyses are also relatively straightforward, often beginning with synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence (S-XRF), X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectoscopy (XANES) and x-ray diffraction (S-XRD) analyses of particles while still embedded in small extracted wedges of aerogel called ``keystones'', followed by ultramicrotomy and TEM, Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) and ion microprobe analyses (e. g., Ogliore et al., 2010). Impacts in foils can be readily analyzed by SEM-EDX, and TEM analysis after FIB liftout sample preparation. In contrast, the interstellar dust collection is vastly more challenging. The sample size is approximately six orders of magnitude smaller in total mass. The largest particles are only a few pg in mass, of which there may be only approx. 10 in the entire collection. The technical challenges, however, are matched by the scientific importance of the collection. We formed a consortium carry out the Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE) to carry out an assessment of this collection, partly in order to characterize the collection in sufficient detail so that future investigators could make well-informed sample requests. The ISPE is the sixth PE on extraterrestrial collections carried out with NASA support. Some of the basic questions that we asked were: how many impacts are there in the collector, and what fraction of them have characteristics consistent with extraterrestrial materials? What is the elemental composition of the rock-forming elements? Is there crystalline material? Are there organics? Here we present coordinated microanalyses of particles captured in aerogel, using S-FTIR, S-XRF, STXM, S-XRD; and coordinated microanalyses of residues in aluminum foil, using SEMEDX, <b>Auger</b> spectroscopy, <b>STEM,</b> and ion microprobe. We discuss a novel approach that we employed for identification of tracks in aerogel, and new sample preparation techniques developed during the ISPE. We have identified seven particles - three in aerogel and four in foils - that are most consistent with an interstellar origin. The seven particles exhibit a large diversity in elemental composition. Dynamical evidence, supported supported by laboratory simulations of interstellar dust impacts in aerogel and foils, and numerical modeling of interstellar dust propagation in the heliosphere, suggests {{that at least some of}} the particles have high optical cross-section, perhaps due to an aggregate structure. However, the observations are most consistent with a variety of morphologie...|$|R
