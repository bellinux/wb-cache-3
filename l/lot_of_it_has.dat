2500|$|Another common term is [...] "Stud". A stud is a {{dominant}} lesbian, usually butch. They {{tend to be}} influenced by urban and hip-hop cultures and are often, but not always, Afro-American. In the New York City lesbian community a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary The Aggressives, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men. But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York are creating a new, insular scene that's largely cut {{off from the rest of}} the gay and lesbian community.

For me because {{childhood}} is so rich with metaphor, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to do with leaving that behind. Instead of a bigger than life villain, we had the nerd troika. Instead of drinking blood and doing spells as sexual metaphor, we had sex. Things became very literal and they lost some of their loveliness.

[...] The fabrics were taken from Boyce's own collection and fabric stores in Melbourne and Sydney. The designer admitted that parting with some of the fabric was difficult, as she had had some of them for around 25 years. Boyce told Smith that at the end of filming, the costumes that were hired were sent back to where they came from. The ones made from fabric bought by the ABC, went back to them and Boyce took the ones that were made from fabrics out of her own collection.|$|E

Barrowman, who initially pitched the series to DC Comics as another {{with the ability to}} tell Merlyn's backstory, said he [...] "had a backstory in my head for Malcolm from the beginning and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> made its way into our comic and onto the screen.

[...] Executive producers Guggenheim and Kreisberg helped the Barrowmans ensure the story would fit within the continuity of the series.

[...] Historian Michael Bliss, who {{published}} a survey of the Canadian Prime Ministers, wrote of Diefenbaker:From the distance of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced in the form of significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values ... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E

Should it not concern us that the Bible never uses the phrase, 'accept Jesus into your heart' or 'invite Christ into your life'?

Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap.
