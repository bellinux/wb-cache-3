25|$|In {{equation}} above, positive post-test probability {{is calculated}} using the <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> positive, {{and the negative}} post-test probability is calculated using the <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> negative.|$|E
25|$|In these cases, a posttest {{probability}} can {{be estimated}} more accurately by using a <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> for the test. <b>Likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> is calculated from sensitivity and specificity of the test, and thereby it {{does not depend on}} prevalence in the reference group, and, likewise, it does not change with changed pre-test probability, in contrast to positive or negative predictive values (which would change). Also, in effect, the validity of post-test probability determined from <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> is not vulnerable to sampling bias in regard to those with and without the condition in the population sample, and can be done as a case-control study that separately gathers those with and without the condition.|$|E

50|$|In {{evidence-based}} medicine, <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> {{are used}} for assessing the value of performing a diagnostic test.

The first description of the use of <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> for decision rules was made at a symposium on information theory in 1954.

25|$|The {{mnemonic}} 'POUND' helps {{distinguish between}} migraines and tension type headaches. POUND stands for Pulsatile quality, 4–72 hOurs in length, Unilateral location, Nausea or vomiting, Disabling intensity. One review article {{found that if}} 4–5 of the POUND characteristics are present, migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (<b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> 24). If 3 characteristics of POUND are present, migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (<b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> 3). If only 2 POUND characteristics are present, tension type headaches are 60% more likely (<b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio</b> 0.41). Another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension type headache: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, exacerbation by physical activity, unilateral, throbbing quality, chocolate as headache trigger, cheese as headache trigger.|$|E

40|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} (EBM), {{a relatively}} new paradigm for clinical practice, stresses the use of research evidence in diagnostic evaluations and therapeutic interventions. Financial and instrumental scarcities in developing countries require clinicians to visit patients under time constraints, especially in outpatient clinical settings. In this situation, clinicians need diagnostic approaches that reduce both diagnostic time and errors. This article discusses what EBM {{can do to help}} physicians in this regard. For quick history taking and physical examination, all physicians utilize certain "key pointers" (signs or symptoms or paraclinical tests that influence the pretest estimation of the disease prevalence). EBM emphasizes that these key pointers are nothing but signs or symptoms with significant <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios.</b> <b>Likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> are a practical means of interpreting clinical tests; physicians can derive <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> from critically appraised studies. The use of clinical tests with sizeable <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> and with <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> for key pointers from independent body systems may significantly decrease both diagnostic time and errors.

25|$|CT is {{only able}} to detect 76% of hollow viscous {{injuries}} and patients who have negative scans must often be observed and rechecked if they deteriorate. However, CT has been demonstrated to be useful in screening patients with certain forms of abdominal trauma {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary laparotomies, which can significantly increase the cost and length of hospitalizations. A meta-analysis of CT use in penetrating abdominal traumas demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy >= 95%, with a PPV of 85% and an NPV of 98%. This suggests that CT is excellent for avoiding unnecessary laparotomies but must be augmented by other clinical criteria to determine the need for surgical exploration (23.37 positive <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0.05 negative <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio).</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{spectrum}} {{effect was}} defined as differences in the sensitivity or specificity of a diagnostic test according to the patient's characteristics or disease features. A spectrum effect {{can lead to a}} spectrum bias when subgroup variations in sensitivity or specificity also affect the <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> and thus post-test probabilities. We propose and illustrate a methodological framework to distinguish spectrum effects from spectrum biases. Methods Data were collected for 1781 women having had a cervical smear test and colposcopy followed by biopsy if abnormalities were detected (the reference standard). Logistic models were constructed to evaluate both the sensitivity and specificity, and the <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios,</b> of the test and to identify factors independently affecting the test's characteristics. Results For both tests, human papillomavirus test, study setting and age affected sensitivity or specificity of the smear test (spectrum effect), but only human papillomavirus test and study setting modified the <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> (spectrum bias) for clinical reading, whereas only human papillomavirus test and age modified the <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> (spectrum bias) for "optimized" interpretation. Conclusion Fitting sensitivity, specificity and <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratios</b> simultaneously allows the identification of covariates that independently affect diagnostic or screening test results and distinguishes spectrum effect from spectrum bias. We recommend this approach for the development of new tests, and for reporting test accuracy for different patient populations. </p...|$|R

25|$|A {{major factor}} {{for such an}} {{absolute}} difference {{is the power of}} the test itself, such as can be described in terms of, for example, sensitivity and specificity or <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio.</b> Another factor is the pre-test probability, with a lower pre-test probability resulting in a lower absolute difference, with the consequence that even very powerful tests achieve a low absolute difference for very unlikely conditions in an individual (such as rare diseases {{in the absence of any}} other indicating sign), but on the other hand, that even tests with low power can make a great difference for highly suspected conditions.|$|E
25|$|Post-test probability, as {{estimated}} {{from the}} pre-test probability with <b>likelihood</b> <b>ratio,</b> should be handled with caution in individuals with other determinants (such as risk factors) {{than the general}} population, {{as well as in}} individuals that have undergone previous tests, because such determinants or tests may also influence the test itself in unpredictive ways, still causing inaccurate results. An example with the risk factor of obesity is that additional abdominal fat can make it difficult to palpate abdominal organs and decrease the resolution of abdominal ultrasonography, and similarly, remnant barium contrast from a previous radiography can interfere with subsequent abdominal examinations, in effect decreasing the sensitivities and specificities of such subsequent tests. On the other hand, the effect of interference can potentially improve the efficacy of subsequent tests as compared to usage in the reference group, such as some abdominal examinations being easier when performed on underweight people.|$|E
