40|$|As an {{indispensable}} actuator, the hydraulic cylinder has widespread industrial applications in mechanical engineering. The <b>cushion</b> characteristics <b>of</b> hydraulic cylinder directly affect its performance and reliability, especially the one utilized in hydraulic system with fast response, high flow rate, and instantaneous super power. In order {{to analyze the}} cushion characteristics, three different simulation models are established. Furthermore, experiments concerning the pressure characteristics of hydraulic cylinder are accomplished to verify the validation of simulation models. It {{was found that the}} integrated simulation model had the highest precision and CFD model showed better pattern <b>of</b> <b>cushion</b> process compared with other models. On the basis of the integrated simulation model, plunger structure and key structural parameters were studied in detail with optimal schemes given. The conical structure, proper design of the diameter <b>of</b> <b>cushion</b> hole, and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> plunger turned out to be effective in promoting the cushion performance. The proposed simulation models and research <b>of</b> <b>cushion</b> structure have scientific and engineering value to promote the innovative development of hydraulic cylinder...|$|R

To evaluate the perceived levels <b>of</b> <b>cushioning</b> during standing, walking, and running, 3 experiments were conducted with 20 participants in each experiment. A 7 -point subjective rating scale was used to rate the perceived levels <b>of</b> <b>cushioning.</b> At {{the end of the}} experiment, the subjective perceptions <b>of</b> <b>cushioning</b> were also recorded. During standing and running, the perceived level <b>of</b> <b>cushioning</b> can be predicted from the time to peak deceleration and/or stiffness (or compression). During walking, however, the magnitude of the peak deceleration on the impact tester appears to be a good predictor of PLC. Impact characterizations can reveal important differences between materials and how they are perceived during activity. In addition, the results seem to explain and link the differences that exist in the ergonomics and biomechanics literature on <b>cushioning.</b> Applications <b>of</b> this research include the design and selection of materials for footwear, floor mats, and other supporting surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Facilitation by nurse {{plants is}} one of the most {{commonly}} reported interactions between plants and is regarded as an important factor in structuring plant communities. We used a meta-analysis to examine the generality of these effects, focusing on cushion plants, a common life-form occurring in high-Andean ecosystems. We targeted the following questions: (1) is there a generalized positive effect <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> on other vascular plant species along the Andes? (2) do different species groups (i. e., annuals and perennials, natives and exotics) display different association responses to cushions? (3) does the nurse effect <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> increase with environmental severity? Results indicated that the overall effect <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> is positive, however these positive effects were more significant amongst exotic plants than in native plants; effects were only positive for perennial plants, and were notably negative for annuals. The positive effects <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> also increased with physical stress, but only for perennial plants. These results allow us to suggest that as a whole cushions may be acting as keystone species that maintain the structure and diversity of high-Andean plant communities. Nevertheless, since cushions also positively affect the performance of exotic plants, we should be aware of their potential role in promoting biological invasions...|$|R
40|$|Despite a large {{consensus}} on increasing facilitation among plants with increasing stress in alpine regions, {{a number of}} different outcomes of interaction have been observed, which impedes the generalisation of the ‘stress-gradient hypothesis’ (SGH). With the aim to reconcile the different viewpoints on the stress-interaction relationship in alpine environments we hypothesized that fine nurse variations within a single life form (cushion) may explain this pattern variability To test this hypothesis, we compared the magnitude of the stress-interaction relationship in a single study area with that observed in existing studies involving cushions, worldwide. We characterized the nurse effects <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> on the whole plant community at inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-individual levels along a stress gradient in the dry, alpine tropics of Bolivia (4400 m, 4700 m and 4900 m a. s. l). Using a relative index of interaction (RII) we included our data in a meta-analysis on the nurse effects <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> along alpine gradients, worldwide. At inter-specific level, the loose cushion Pycnophyllum was a better nurse than the compact Azorella compacta. However, at intra-individual level facilitation was higher at the periphery than at the centre <b>of</b> <b>cushions,</b> exceeding in magnitude the variation observed at inter-specific level. This pattern was associated with higher minimum temperature and lower mortality at the periphery <b>of</b> <b>cushions.</b> The net effects <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> on plant communities became more positive at higher elevation, corroborating the SGH. Within our single site in Bolivia, fine morphological nurse variations captured a similar variability in the stress-interaction relationship as that observed in a subset <b>of</b> studies on <b>cushions</b> on a worldwide scale. This suggests that fine variations in nurse traits, in general those not considered in protocols dealing with facilitation or in restoration/conservation management plans, explain in part the current discrepancies among SGH studies in alpine regions...|$|R

40|$|Questions What is the community-level {{consequence}} of biotic processes, {{in particular the}} importance of facilitation, in determining patterns of diversity in alpine plant communities of the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains? Does facilitation intensity change with environmental severity, and are these changes due to environmental severity or nurse trait effects? Location Eleven alpine plant communities dominated by cushion plants in the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains, within the mountain system of south-central China. Methods We determined plant species richness and abundance in habitats created by cushions and cushion-free areas, and assessed the cushion effects on species richness and abundance with rarefaction curves and the relative interaction index, respectively. We {{examined the relationship between}} cushion effects on diversity and habitat severity and tested if changes in the net cushion effects along the severity gradient were due to a change in the performance <b>of</b> species without <b>cushions</b> (environmental severity effect) and/or with cushions (nurse trait-mediated effect). Results The presence <b>of</b> <b>cushion</b> plants increased species richness and abundance in most studied plant communities. The net facilitation effect <b>of</b> <b>cushions</b> increased with increasing habitat severity, an effect that could be attributed mainly to a reduction in species richness in cushion-free areas with increasing severity. However, the changes in magnitude of facilitation <b>of</b> particular <b>cushion</b> species growing in high and low severity habitats could be attributed to both environmental severity and neighbour trait effects. Despite the overall positive effect <b>of</b> <b>cushion</b> plants on plant species richness, not all cushion species contributed to higher species richness. The deviation <b>of</b> individual <b>cushion</b> species from the general pattern of increasing facilitation with increasing severity indicated the species specificity of facilitation depends on the traits of nurse species. Conclusion The presence <b>of</b> <b>cushion</b> plants generally increased species richness in alpine plant communities of the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains, with the importance <b>of</b> the <b>cushion</b> effect increasing with habitat severity due to a buffering effect by <b>cushions</b> <b>of</b> the negative effect of habitat severity on species richness observed in cushion-free areas. This indicates the pivotal role of facilitative interactions among plant species in supporting high diversity in these severe environments...|$|R
