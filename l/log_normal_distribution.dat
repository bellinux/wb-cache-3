Among gravitationally bound binary star systems, there exists a so-called <b>log</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> of periods, {{with the majority of}} these systems orbiting with a period of about 100 years.

40|$|Sums of {{lognormal}} {{random variables}} (RVs) occur in many important problems in wireless communications especially in interferences calculation. Several {{methods have been}} proposed to approximate the lognormal sum distribution. Most of them requires lengthy Monte Carlo simulations, or advanced slowly converging numerical integrations for curve fitting and parameters estimation. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that the <b>log</b> skew <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> can offer a tight approximation to the lognormal sum distributed RVs. We propose a simple and accurate method for fitting the <b>log</b> skew <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> to lognormal sum distribution. We use moments and tails slope matching technique to find optimal <b>log</b> skew <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> parameters. We compare our method with those in literature in terms of complexity and accuracy. We conclude that our method has same accuracy than other methods but more simple. To further validate our approach, we provide an example for outage probability calculation in lognormal shadowing environment based on <b>log</b> skew <b>normal</b> approximation.

25|$|The uniform {{distribution}} {{as might be}} expected does not obey Benford's law. In contrast, the ratio distribution of two {{uniform distribution}}s is well described by Benford's law. Benford's law also describes the exponential distribution and the ratio distribution of two exponential distributions well. Although the half-normal distribution does not obey Benford's law, the ratio distribution of two half-normal distributions does. Neither the right-truncated <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> nor the ratio distribution of two right-truncated <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> are well described by Benford's law. This is not surprising as this distribution is weighted towards larger numbers. Neither the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> nor the ratio <b>distribution</b> of two <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> (the Cauchy distribution) obey Benford's law. The fit of chi square distribution depends on the degrees of freedom (df) with good agreement with df = 1 and decreasing agreement as the df increases. The F distribution is fitted well for low degrees of freedom. With increasing dfs the fit decreases but much more slowly than the chi square distribution. The fit of the log-normal distribution depends on the mean and the variance of the distribution. The variance has a much greater effect on the fit than does the mean. Larger values of both parameters result in better agreement with the law. The ratio of two <b>log</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> is a <b>log</b> <b>normal</b> so this <b>distribution</b> was not examined.|$|R

This procedure can be easily extended to use different numbers and types of constituent functions.

Sugihara used a triangular distribution to draw the random variables because the randomness of some natural populations matches a triangular distribution with a mean of 0.75.|$|E

Results using different statistics and shapes of probability distributions are examined. These include normal, truncated <b>normal,</b> and <b>log</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> with special treatment of the value zero. The uncertainty of the model's formulation is considered in addition to uncertainty of observations. The posterior distribution is multi-modal due to the model's formulation using a conditional expression. The dominant mode may be predicted as a non-precipitating state by the model, although the observation indicates precipitation is present. Means and modes of posterior distributions depend sensitively both on the assumed statistics and the shapes of the underlying distributions.
