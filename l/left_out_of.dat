5|$|In May 2016, several {{injuries}} in the Italian squad, {{as well as a}} lack of attacking options and Totti's run of good form as a substitute for Roma, led some in the media to call for manager Antonio Conte to include Totti as a reserve in Italy's Euro 2016 squad; however, he was later <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Conte's 30-man preliminary Italy squad for the final tournament.|$|E

5|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver mail {{to the post}} offices in these towns three times per week. Randolph was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the main route and put {{at the end of}} a branch route of the mail line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, the mail route roughly coincides with modern-day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road).|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> work.

5|$|Benzema is {{a former}} French youth {{international}} and has represented his nation from under-17 level onwards. Prior to playing for the senior team, he played on the under-17 team that won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.

Benzema has earned over 80 caps and represented France at three major international tournaments: the 2008 and 2012 editions of the UEFA European Football Championship and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, Benzema has twice been <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> major tournament squads: 2010 World Cup {{due to lack of}} playing time with Real Madrid and Euro 2016 after a highly publicised scandal.|$|E
5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity {{played only}} one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{played the}} {{formation}} {{typical of the}} era: two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards. With Tilson absent from the Manchester City line-up, Alec Herd moved across to Tilson's usual centre-forward position, and Bobby Marshall was selected at inside-right. For Everton, Albert Geldard who was injured for the semi-final was selected at outside right, and Ted Critchley who scored the winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final, was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the side.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain her {{position}} in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but {{was one of several}} players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but continued her efforts to make the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she had probably attempted to return too quickly) and low motivation.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013 Six Nations Championship, O'Gara {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on 10 February 2013, coming on as a replacement against England. He came off the bench against Scotland in Round 3, having lost out on the 10 jersey to Paddy Jackson after Jonathan Sexton's injury against England. O'Gara was dropped from the Ireland squad for the game against France, and was also <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the squad for Ireland's final game against Italy, which Ireland lost 22-15, their first-ever defeat to Italy in the Six Nations.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{was called}} into the Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, but in the warm-up match he bowled one only over, {{in which he was}} {{hammered}} for 23 runs. He then watched from the sidelines as India only fielded one spin bowler—Harbhajan—in the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.|$|E
