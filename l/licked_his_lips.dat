6000|$|... "Oh, my God!" [...] said Gerald, {{pressing}} {{both his}} hands to his forehead and sitting down again. He <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> with a dry tongue and moaned. [...] "Oh, I've got a headache!" ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly Junkie {{picked his}} way up the ragged path towards the gnarled tree. The leopard, {{scarcely}} believing in his good luck, <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> Rapidly the Bushman and his men descended the same path.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'm {{delighted to}} see you. Pray help yourself. All I have is at your service,' said the hospitable youth. And the ox lay down comfortably, <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and made a hearty meal.|$|R
60|$|He leaned forward, <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> nervously {{spreading}} {{and closing}} his fingers, while he watched Martin write a check. When {{it was passed}} over to him, {{he glanced at the}} amount-seven thousand dollars.|$|R
6000|$|Shefford wrung her hands. Joe <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{and found}} his voice: [...] "We'll come back later." [...] Then {{he led the way}} out and Shefford followed. They were silent {{all the way back to}} camp.|$|E
60|$|And {{removing}} his thumb, {{he sent a}} steady jet into his open mouth, and having drained the horn without drawing breath, <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> handed it to Philammon, and flew ravenously upon the fish and onions.|$|E
60|$|Leetle Cub {{seemed to}} have his mind running in the same direction, for he eyed the {{alligator}} with longing looks, and <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> expressively as they re-entered the canoe, shoved off, and directed the bow homeward.|$|E
60|$|A strange dog {{was sitting}} calmly among {{the ruins of}} the feast, <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> after basely eating up the last poor bits of bun, when he had bolted the cake, basket, and all, apparently.|$|R
60|$|Mike watched Ashe {{shape with}} a sinking heart. The wicket-keeper {{looked like a}} man who feels that his hour has come. Mike could see him <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> There was {{nervousness}} written all over him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Jack {{said there}} was a barrel of {{molasses}} in the house, so there would be enough for all to eat and some to carry away. They know how to do things handsomely;" [...] and the speaker <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> as if already tasting the feast in store for him.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Green {{still looked}} at him. He <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> thoughtfully, cat-like. [...] "What terms d'ye make?" [...] he inquired, but {{his tone was}} very cold.

6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] remarked Mr. Gladman, <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> {{which were}} dry, [...] "you won't get anything, Mr. Clodd--no, not even your three-hundred pounds, clever {{as you think}} yourself. My brother-in-law's money {{will go to the}} lawyers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] Peterson said, <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> [...] "Has it done anything? What harm has it done? I'm asking you. And anyhow, it's still mine. You have {{no right}} to shoot it. It doesn't belong to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Like the not inconsiderable {{majority}} of men, James relished {{a nice little}} bit of scandal, and would say, in a matter-of-fact tone, <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> [...] "Yes, yes--she and young Dyson; they tell me they're living at Monte Carlo!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, girls, fly {{round and}} get your chores done up; Ben, you go chop me some kindlings; and I'll make things tidy.

60|$|Such {{reasoning}} as {{she made}} use of she climaxed by an offer of no less a sum than a hundred pistoles. The captain <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and pulled at his mustachios.

6000|$|Now, {{the poor}} Simpleton was ashamed {{to show what}} was in it. However, he thought it best {{not to make a}} fuss, so he opened the satchel, and could {{scarcely}} believe his own eyes, for, instead of the hard crust, he saw two beautiful fresh rolls and some cold meat.

6000|$|... "Won't I, just!" [...] said Peterkin, <b>licking</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> as we {{took our}} station beside the cliff. [...] "I feel quite a tender affection for young pigs in my heart. Perhaps {{it would be more}} correct to say in my tum--" ...|$|R

Being undeceived, he departed in great wrath and barked all the way downstairs, to ease his wounded feelings.|$|E
6000|$|So Komba rose, {{and in his}} cold, precise voice narrated {{his share}} in the transaction, telling how he had visited Bausi, and all that had {{happened}} {{in connection with the}} embassy. Again the Motombo appeared to go to sleep, only opening his eyes once as Komba described how we had been searched for firearms, whereon he nodded his great head in approval and <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> with his thin red tongue. When Komba had done, he said: ...|$|E
