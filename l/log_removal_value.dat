Viral concentrations in permeate and retentate were determined using two different methods, namely plaque forming unit (PFU) counting, which reveals only infectious particles and quantitative RT-PCR which detects the total (infectious + inactivated) number of viral genomes regardless of their infectivity. From this experimental study, we propose guidelines for preparing the challenging solutions and measuring their concentration which ensure a reliable assessment of the membrane performance...|$|E

Treatment assessment included powdered activated carbon (PAC) and pre-chlorination of the MIEX-treated raw water. Floc particles were subjected to shear forces after settling and re-suspended to gauge bacterial release potential, floc breakage and re-aggregation. MIEX in conjunction with alum coagulation achieved improved coagulation as measured by PDA but did not increase bacterial <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>value</b> (LRV) in comparison with conventional coagulation.

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} forward osmosis (FO) membrane integrity loss during gypsum scaling {{with the}} presence of membrane spacer. The gypsum scalant had preferential accumulation adjacent to membrane spacer where the needle-shape gypsum potentially compromised polyamide thin-film composite FO membrane integrity. However, the loss of FO membrane integrity cannot be sensitively detected by in situ measurements of membrane water and salt (NaCl) permeability coefficients. We, for the first time, employed membrane integrity challenge tests to reveal the impaired FO membrane integrity by fluorescent Rhodamine WT tracer and amine-modified latex nanoparticles, respectively. Challenge tests using Rhodamine WT tracer showed that membrane <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>value</b> decreased to 3. 5 after three scaling–cleaning cycles, which corresponded to a pinhole size of 0. 06 μm 2 on the FO membrane. This result was further corroborated by challenge test using latex nanoparticle where the particle size distribution in the permeate became wider and the average particle size increased over the three scaling–cleaning cycles. Both challenge tests were sensitive enough to identify impaired FO membrane integrity. Results reported here have significant implications for achieving better membrane spacer and module design, as well as demanding periodical monitoring of FO membrane integrity in water reuse...|$|E
40|$|Particle counting, a {{sensitive}} indicator of water quality, is rapidly gaining acceptance {{as a tool}} for monitoring water treatment processes. In this paper, instrumentation specifications (particle count sensors and components for on-line particle counting networks) are described. Important installation and operating considerations, including monitoring frequencies and data collection formats, for on-line particle counting are also presented. At least 400 particles must be counted in order to achieve 10 percent precision during a particle count analysis. In on-line particle counting, a sensor should be selected that counts the number of particles required to achieve a desired precision within a reasonably short count interval. Turbidity and particle count results correspond, but the relationship is poorest in highly clarified water samples (less than 0. 1 ntu). Data presentation formats useful for treatment plant optimization include: total particle counts and differential counts in specific size ranges of interest. Differential particle counts in a specified size range provide information similar to that gleaned from total particle counts. Particle size distribution information is valuable for assessing the quality of the data and identifying over-concentration errors. Analysis of both source and finished water particle counts provides data for calculation of <b>log</b> <b>removal.</b> The main disadvantage of using <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> rather than total counts to evaluate treatment plant performance is that <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> are greatly influenced by the magnitude of particles in the source water. Lowest finished water particle counts are not necessarily associated with the best <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values.</b> Total particle counts greater than the lower size detection limit of the sensor proved to be the simplest and best data format to use as a treatment plant performance criterion...|$|R
40|$|Although {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) systems provide better removal of pathogens compared to conventional activated sludge processes, {{they do not}} achieve total <b>log</b> <b>removal.</b> The present study examines two MBR systems treating municipal wastewater, one a full-scale MBR plant {{and the other a}} lab-scale anaerobic MBR. Both of these systems were operated using microfiltration (MF) polymeric membranes. High-throughput sequencing and digital PCR quantification were utilized to monitor the <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> (LRVs) of associated pathogenic species and their abundance in the MBR effluents. Results showed that specific removal rates vary widely regardless of the system employed. Each of the two MBR effluents’ microbial communities contained genera associated with opportunistic pathogens (e. g., Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) {{with a wide range of}} log reduction values (5. 5). Digital PCR further confirmed that these bacterial groups included pathogenic species, in several instances at LRVs different than those for their respective genera. These results were used to evaluate the potential risks associated both with the reuse of the MBR effluents for irrigation purposes and with land application of the activated sludge from the full-scale MBR system...|$|R
40|$|At eight {{full-scale}} {{water treatment}} {{plants in the}} Netherlands the removal of spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia (SSRC) was determined. By sampling and processing large volumes of water (1 up to 500 litres) SSRC were detected after each stage of the treatment. This enabled {{the assessment of the}} removal efficiency of the full-scale unit processes for persistent micro-organisms. A comparison with literature data on the removal of Cryptosporidium and Giardia by the same type of processes revealed that SSRC can be considered as a potential surrogate. The average Decimal Elimination Capacity (DEC) of the overall treatment plants ranged from 1. 3 – 4. 3 log. The observed actual <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> of SSRC by the unit processes and the overall treatment at one of the studied locations showed that the level of variation in removal efficiency was approximately 2 log. Moreover, from the actual <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> it was observed that a low SSRC removal by one unit process is partly compensated by a higher removal by subsequent unit processes at this location. SSRC can be used for identification of the process conditions that cause variation in micro-organism removal which may lead to process optimization. Further research is necessary to determine the optimal use of SSRC in water quality monitoring for the production of microbiologically safe drinking water...|$|R
40|$|Aims: In this study, the {{efficiency}} of peracetic acid (PAA), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and combination of both disinfectants for disinfection of stabilization pond effluent was assessed. Materials and Methods: The samples was collected during four months. All samples were analyzed as triplicate according to the Standard Methods. Microbial tests were carried out to total coliform (TC), fecal coliform (FC) and fecal streptococci (FS). Also, the physical characteristics such as the total suspended solids, and also chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were analyzed. Results : In this study, the application of combined disinfectants lead to reduction of total coliform, fecal coliform and fecal streptococci from 2. 8 × 10 5, 2. 2 × 10 5 and 7. 1 × 10 4 to 1. 6 × 10 3, 5 × 10 1 and 1. 9 × 10 2 MPN/ 100 ml, correspondence to 2. 55, 3. 64 and 1. 83 <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>value</b> (LRV), respectively.

We previously reported both a novel copper-alginate bead, which quickly reduces pathogen loading in waste streams and the incorporation of these beads into a novel swirl flow bioreactor (SFB), of low capital and running costs and of simple construction from commercially available plumbing pipes and fittings. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to trial this system for pathogen reduction in waste streams from an operating Dewats system in Hinjewadi, Pune, India and in both simulated and real waste streams in Seattle, Washington, USA. The trials in India, showed a complete inactivation of coliforms in the discharged effluent (Mean <b>Log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>Value</b> (MLRV) = 3. 51), accompanied by a total inactivation of E. coli with a MLRV of 1. 95. The secondary clarifier effluent also showed a 4. 38 MLRV in viable coliforms during treatment. However, the system was slightly less effective in reducing E. coli viability, with a MLRV of 1. 80.

40|$|Under normal operation, {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) produce {{high quality}} effluent leading to common application in water recycling schemes. When hazardous events, outside of normal operation, occur strategies {{must be in}} place to ensure that microbially safe water is consistently produced. Limited literature is available to quantify the consequence of hazardous events on microorganism <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>value</b> (LRV) by MBRs. As a result, current MBR risk management practices cannot be based on sufficient quantitative evidence. In this study, MBRs were subjected to hazardous events designed to reflect a range of potential severe feed water variations and process failures. During these challenge events, removal of four microbial indicator organisms representing viruses, bacteria and protozoa were quantified. Hazardous event impacts were benchmarked against the 5 th percentile of normal process LRV, determined via probabilistic techniques. Severe feed water variation decreased the efficacy of bio-predation due to adversely affected activated sludge performance. However, overall LRV was preserved due to the onset of fouling, aiding rejection by the membrane. Overall FRNA bacteriophage LRV significantly decreased to 0. 3 log units below the 5 th percentile (LRV= 4. 1) after the NaCl shock, most likely due to inhibition of adsorption mechanisms. Fibre breakage resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} LRV, but was mitigated by suspended solids plugging the membrane lumen within 15 min. The findings presented here can inform risk management strategies for MBRs by permitting control strategy prioritisation according to quantified event consequences...|$|E
40|$|An {{anaerobic}} {{membrane bioreactor}} was retrofitted with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membrane units, {{each of which}} was fouled to a different extent. The membranes with different degrees of fouling were evaluated for their efficiencies in removing three antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), namely, blaNDM- 1 -positive Escherichia coli PI- 7, blaCTX-M- 15 -positive Klebsiella pneumoniae L 7, and blaOXA- 48 -positive E. coli UPEC-RIY- 4, {{as well as their}} associated plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The results showed that the <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> (LRVs) of ARGs correlated positively with the extent of membrane fouling and ranged from 1. 9 to 3. 9. New membranes with a minimal foulant layer could remove more than 5 log units of ARB. However, as the membranes progressed to subcritical fouling, the LRVs of ARB decreased at increasing operating transmembrane pressures (TMPs). The LRV recovered back to 5 when the membrane was critically fouled, and the achieved LRV remained stable at different operating TMPs. Furthermore, characterization of the surface attributed the removal of both the ARB and ARGs to adsorption, which was facilitated by an increasing hydrophobicity and a decreasing surface ζ potential as the membranes fouled. Our results indicate that both the TMP and the foulant layer synergistically affected ARB removal, but the foulant layer was the main factor that contributed to ARG removal...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the removal efficiency of microbial contaminants, including total cell counts, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs, e. g. tetO, tetZ, sul 1 and sul 2) and integrase genes (e. g. intl 1 and intl 2), by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operated on-site of two hospitals (i. e., SH WWTP and IH WWTP). Both SH and IH WWTPs utilize the conventional activated sludge process but differences in the removal efficiencies were observed. Over the 2 week sampling period, IH WWTP outperformed SH WWTP, and achieved an approximate 0. 388 to 2. 49 -log <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> (LRVs) for total cell counts compared to the 0. 010 to 0. 162 -log removal in SH WWTP. Although ARB {{were present in the}} hospital influent, the treatment process of both hospitals effectively removed ARB from most of the effluent samples. In instances where ARB were recovered in the effluent, none of the viable isolates were identified to be opportunistic pathogenic species based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. However, sul 1 and intl 1 genes remained detectable at up to 105 copies per mL or 8 x 10 (- 1) copies per 16 S rRNA gene in the treated effluent, with an LRV of less than 1. 2. When the treated effluent is discharged from hospital WWTPs into the public sewer for further treatment as per requirement in many countries, the detected amount of ARGs and integrase genes in the hospital effluent can become a potential source of horizontal gene dissemination in the municipal WWTP. Proper on-site wastewater treatment and surveillance of the effluent quality for emerging contaminants are therefore highly recommended...|$|R
40|$|An Advanced Water Treatment Plant (AWTP) for {{potable water}} {{recycling}} in Davis Station Antarctica was trialed using secondary effluent at Selfs Point in Hobart, Tasmania, for nine months. The trials demonstrated {{the reliability of}} performance of a seven barrier treatment process consisting of ozonation, ceramic microfiltration (MF), biologically activated carbon, reverse osmosis, ultra-violet disinfection, calcite contactor and chlorination. The seven treatment barriers were required to meet the high <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> (LRV) required for pathogens in small systems during disease outbreak, and on-line verification of process performance was required for operation with infrequent operator attention. On-line verification of pathogen LRVs, a low turbidity filtrate of approximately 0. 1 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit), no long-term fouling and no requirement for clean-in-place (CIP) was achieved with the ceramic MF. A pressure decay test was also reliably implemented on the reverse osmosis system to achieve a 2 LRV for protozoa, and this barrier required only 2 - 3 CIP treatments each year. The ozonation process achieved 2 LRV for bacteria and virus with no requirement for an ozone residual, provided the ozone dose was > 11. 7 mg/L. Extensive screening using multi-residue gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) database methods that can screen for more than 1200 chemicals found that few chemicals pass through the barriers to the final product and rejected (discharge) water streams. The AWTP plant required 1. 93 kWh/m 3 when operated in the mode required for Davis Station and was predicted to require 1. 27 kWh/m 3 if scaled up to 10 ML/day. The AWTP will be shipped to Davis Station for further trials before possible implementation for water recycling. The process may have application in other small remote communities...|$|R
40|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are {{increasingly}} applied to achieve pathogen removal in water recycling schemes. To date, MBRs have been validated in an arbitrary manner, {{which has led}} to accreditation varying on a scheme-by-scheme basis and consequently an inequitable treatment of potential health risk. The aim of this thesis is to provide the information required in order to successfully validate a MBR, including: 1) current understanding of the pathogen removal mechanisms, 2) quantitative information on pathogen removal performance and variability, 3) knowledge of how operation and hazardous events influence removal performance and 4) a strategy to assure removal performance continually, through the use of an online monitoring. Surrogate measures for pathogen removal including indicator microorganisms, physiochemical and operational parameters were collected over the course of 18 months during a rigorous sampling campaign of 11 full scale MBRs resulting in a data set with over 250 removal data points for each pathogen group, paired with operating data. Statistical analysis of this data set determined that higher removal was favoured under operation at low range transmembrane pressure, flux and suspended solids concentration and high range pH, temperature, solids retention time and hydraulic retention time. In addition, it was determined that MBRs could consistently achieve 5 th percentile <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> exceeding 1. 5, 4. 0 and 2. 0 for virus, bacteria and protozoa, respectively. High permeate turbidity was shown to correlate with lower removal performance at full scale and a site specific method was proposed and demonstrated at lab scale to calibrate permeate turbidity with removal to allow for continuous monitoring. Hazardous event scenarios, perceived to reduce removal performance, were also investigated. Chemical cleaning was found to have a slightly negative, but recoverable, impact on removal, depending on membrane pore size. Membrane breakage resulted in severely compromised removal, but was recoverable due to activated sludge plugging of defects in the hollow fibre membranes evaluated. Overall, this thesis provided detailed quantitative evidence to support creation of more appropriate and streamlined national validation guidelines for MBRs in Australia and, in doing so, has furthered the knowledge to support health risk management of MBRs internationally...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of household water treatment (HWT) at reducing diarrheal disease {{is related to}} the efficacy of the HWT method at removing pathogens, how people comply with HWT, and the relative contributions of other pathogen exposure routes. We define compliance with HWT as the proportion of drinking water treated by a community. Although many HWT methods are efficacious at removing or inactivating pathogens, their effectiveness within actual communities is decreased by imperfect compliance. However, the quantitative relationship between compliance and effectiveness is poorly understood. To assess the {{effectiveness of}} HWT on childhood diarrhea incidence via drinking water for three pathogen types (bacterial, viral, and protozoan), we developed a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model. We examined the relationship between <b>log</b> 10 <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> (LRVs) and compliance with HWT for scenarios varying by: baseline incidence of diarrhea; etiologic fraction of diarrhea by pathogen type; pattern of compliance within a community; and size of contamination spikes in source water. Benefits from increasing LRVs strongly depend on compliance. For perfect compliance, diarrheal incidence decreases as LRVs increase. However, if compliance is incomplete, there are diminishing returns from increasing LRVs in most of the scenarios we considered. Higher LRVs are more beneficial if: contamination spikes are large; contamination levels are generally high; or some people comply perfectly. The effectiveness of HWT interventions at the community level may be limited by imperfect compliance, such that the benefits of high LRVs are not realized. Compliance with HWT should be carefully measured during HWT field studies and HWT dissemination programs. Studies of pathogen concentrations in a variety of developing-country source waters are also needed. Guidelines are needed for measuring and promoting compliance with HWT...|$|R

In this study the effectiveness, economic parameters and costs of three selected HWTS systems were identified. The selected systems are SODIS, ceramic filter and biosand filter. These options were selected based on their accessibility, affordability and available scientific data. Data was obtained through peer-reviewed literature, reports, web-pages and informal sources. The findings show a wide dispersion for <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> of effectiveness of the HWTS systems.

Mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) is the most widely used process in the UK for stabilising sludge prior to agricultural recycling, but little is known about the fate of a number of enteric pathogens as the sludge passes through the treatment processes. The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of MAD in removing the bacterial enteric pathogens, Salmonella senftenberg, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni which were added as a spike to the digester feedstock, together with the die-off of indigenous Escherichia coli already present in the sludge.

The study had two main objectives: 1) to examine the occurrence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the Nakdong River; and 2) to evaluate their removal during water treatment. Occurrence of Giardia cysts was also examined. Average (arithmetic mean) numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts at the treatment intake site were 2. 6 l 21 and 4. 8 l 21, respectively. Generally, the number of Giardia cysts was higher than that of Cryptosporidium oocysts at more sites, but the difference was minimal. Comparison of tributaries indicated that livestock wastes were more serious pollutants than sewage in terms of protozoa contamination. In general, fewer oocysts and cysts were detected during winter. No correlation was found for such water quality parameters as T-N, T-P, TOC, DO, pH and temperature with the numbers of oocysts and cysts except for suspended solids, which showed the highest correlation (R 2 0. 55). Removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts was evaluated using a Cryptosporidium tracer, which has similar characteristics to Cryptosporidium oocysts. The tracer removal depended on turbidity removal. Coagulation followed by sedimentation resulted in 1. 2 – 1. 5 <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> of the tracer under optimal conditions.

40|$|Nonpoint source (NPS) {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the major sources of environmental contamination in the United States. Depending on the contaminant and its origin, NPS pollution can be introduced through atmospheric deposition or in the aqueous phase, for example through stormwater runoff. Here, both the atmospheric deposition of 16 EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was measured at six different sites in Rhode Island as well as their removal, including other contaminants, from stormwater runoff. For the first part of this study seasonal and spatial variation in atmospheric PAH deposition rates were quantified along with investigating the source of the PAHs. The atmospheric deposition of PAHs followed an urban-to-rural gradient with deposition rates significantly higher in urban areas (up to 2261 µg m- 2 yr- 1 ∑PAH 16) compared to rural areas (as low as 73. 6 µg m- 2 yr- 1 ∑PAH 16). In fall and winter, PAH deposition was up to 10 times higher compared to summer/spring. In part two of this study a stormwater best management practice (BMP) was evaluated for its contaminant treatment efficiency, with specific attention paid to PAH removal and microbial load reduction. Because many BMPs are not designed to treat bacteria specifically, a novel engineered material, amended red cedar wood chips with different loadings of two antimicrobial compounds: 3 -(trihydroxysilyl) propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride (TPA) and silver nanoparticles (AgNP), was developed and tested in the laboratory to target microbial load reduction and removal of stormwater co-contaminants, including PAH. Laboratory tests showed that E. coli inactivation, at 25 °C, can be achieved with <b>log</b> 10 <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> (LRV) up to 3. 71 ± 0. 38 (mean ± standard error) for TPA-red cedar and 2. 25 ± 1. 00 for AgNP-red cedar, while unmodified red cedar only achieved 0. 45 log 10. Similarly, PAH removal from the aqueous phase was 68. 9 times higher using TPA modified red cedar compared to the conventional shale used in the tree filter BMP. After the screening under laboratory conditions, bioactive TPA amended red cedar wood chips were tested in a pilot-scale field project using a tree filter BMP. The performance of the amended wood chips was compared to a commercially available tree filter BMP that contains a mixed sand/shale filtration matrix. Under pilot test conditions, the two filters performed similarly with regards to bacteria removal. But, the tree filter containing amended red cedar was significantly more effective at removing PAH. As demonstrated in the first part of this study, PAH influxes to stormwater are not limited to local sources, e. g. automobiles, but also have an atmospheric deposition component. Also, because PAH are just one of many contaminant classes present in stormwater runoff, it is therefore important that innovative BMP technologies have multi-contaminant treatment capabilities that can effectively prevent contaminants like PAHs, heavy metals, and/or bacteria from entering the environment. While this study has shown that tree filters can be modified to meet that expectation, more work is necessary to develop, improve and demonstrate a full-scale BMP device. ...|$|R

Prior to annual decant, the average concentration of E. coli was 1. 3 × 106 CFU/ 100 mL in the WSP, which exceeded discharge guidelines of 104 to 106 CFU/ 100 mL set by the Nunavut Water Board (NWB). Existing WSP disinfection models, which were typically designed for temperate or tropical regions, were selected to study their viability to predict the pathogen removal of Arctic WSPs. In general, the models over-predicted disinfection performance by {{an order of magnitude}} or more, and some were unable to replicate trends in the data. A modified model for northern WSPs should be developed in order to accurately predict disinfection performance...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{assessments}} and intervention trials {{have been used}} by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to estimate drinking water health risks. Seldom are both methods used concurrently. Between 2001 and 2003, illness data from a trial were collected simultaneously with exposure data, providing a unique opportunity to compare direct risk estimates of waterborne disease from the intervention trial with indirect estimates from a risk assessment. Comparing the group with water treatment (active) with that without water treatment (sham), the estimated annual attributable disease rate (cases per 10, 000 persons per year) from the trial provided no evidence of a significantly elevated drinking water risk [attributable risk = – 365 cases/year, sham minus active; 95 % confidence interval (CI), – 2, 555 to 1, 825]. The predicted mean rate of disease per 10, 000 persons per person-year from the risk assessment was 13. 9 (2. 5, 97. 5 percentiles: 1. 6, 37. 7) assuming 4 <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> due to viral disinfection and 5. 5 (2. 5, 97. 5 percentiles: 1. 4, 19. 2) assuming 6 <b>log</b> <b>removal.</b> Risk assessments are important under conditions of low risk when estimates are difficult to attain from trials. In particular, this assessment pointed toward the importance of attaining site-specific treatment data and the clear need for a better understanding of viral removal by disinfection. Trials provide direct risk estimates, and the upper confidence limit estimates, even if not statistically significant, are informative about possible upper estimate...|$|R
40|$|Acid phase {{digestion}} pretreatment {{resulted in}} an increase in biogas production and volatile solids (VS) removal at the West Camden plant which was fed with only waste activated sludge. Without the acid phase digesters, the specific methane yield of waste activated sludge (WAS) was 190 L/kgVSadded, whereas a specific methane yield of WAS of 231 L/kg VSadded was observed from sludge sampled from the acid phase digester. The specific methane yield obtained from BioWin® simulation was 331 L/kgVSadded and was slightly higher than that from BMP assessment (231 L/kgVSadded). In addition, the overall VS <b>removal</b> <b>values</b> obtained from BioWin® simulation (44 %) and biomethane potential (BMP) evaluation (49 %) were close to the actual VS <b>removal</b> <b>value</b> (45 %) achieved by the plant. The consistency between full scale evaluation data, BioWin® simulation, and BMP assessment suggests that BioWin® simulation and BMP study can be used to guide future design and optimisation of acid phase digestion pretreatment to intensify anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the relationship between}} tree biomass C stocks and stand age, changes in stand characteristics of tree density, mean DBH, canopy height and BA, were also manifest. Compared to young stands, old Japanese cedar stands feature the following characteristics: (1) lower tree densities, (2) larger stem DBH distributions across size classes, and (3) higher BA values and greater tree height, yet these two features become asymptotic when stand age exceed 60 years. Some other stand characteristics often found in natural old-growth forests, for example, understory reinitiation and coarse woody debris accumulation (Tyrrell and Crow, 1994), are not present in the older Japanese cedar plantations in Xitou, perhaps because of thinning, weeding or residual <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> that are practiced.|$|R

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this project funded by AWWARF and USEPA three very {{promising}} IMS's were identified for surface water treatment. This paper will cover some highlights of the research carried out by the Water Supply Company of North Holland and Kiwa on the combination ultrafiltration/ultra low pressure reverse osmosis. Productivity of the ultrafiltration proved to be stable for the first 6000 h. Then, at the end of summer, the backwash regime was not able to prevent accumulation of biofouling. Ths biofouling coincides with an increase in bacterial counts in the ultrafiltrate. Also the ultra low pressure reverse osmosis unit showed no significant fouling up to 6000 hours. Then a rapid decrease of the second stage MTC started caused by BaSO 4 precipitation, coinciding with an increase in feed-concentrate pressure drop caused by a severe biofouling. Ultrafiltration reduced the indicator organisms E. coli and spores of sulphite reducing Clostridia to under the detection limit. To determine the elimination capacity the feed of UF and ULPRO were spiked with MS- 2 phages. Generally UF showed a complete (> 5 <b>log)</b> <b>removal.</b> Once only a 2. 7 <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> was found caused by defects in UF-membranes. ULPRO showed a high (4. 7 - 4. 9 log) although no complete removal. The results show that integrity measurements and monitoring of both membrane steps are essential. UF-integrity is measured by a pressure hold test and monitored by particle counting. Integrity of ULPRO is measured by vacuum testing and monitored by in situ conductivity measurement and particle counting. ULPRO gives a very high precursor removal. Potential measurements (24 h, 20 °C, 1 - 2 mg/l Cl 2 -residual) showed > 95 % removal of THMFP and HAAFP. IMS with UF and ULPRO are exceptional tools for control of microbials and DBP-precursors. Crucial for application may be control of biofouling in the system...|$|R

Cement kiln dust (CKD) is useless byproduct from the cement industry and a significant resource value for lime substituting. In this paper work, CKD {{is used as a}} chemical precipitant for activated sludge process pilot plant without using primary settling at different temperature ranges (30 – 35)  °C and (15 – 20)  °C. For temp. ranges (30 – 35)  °C, CKD addition concentration was 1  g/l and the system achieved very good removal of 93. 5 %, 93. 3 %, 93. 6 % and 87 % for BOD 5 COD, TSS, and Ptotal, respectively. The system also achieved high removal efficiency for pathogenic indicators with 5 <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> units for Total Coli forms (Tc), Fecal coliforms (Fc), Escherichia coli (E. coli), respectively. For temperature ranges (15 – 20)  °C, different CKD addition concentration were used until reached 2  g/l which enabled the system to achieve high removal efficiencies of 94. 1 %, 94. 1 %, 94. 2 % and 87. 9 % for BOD 5 COD, TSS, and Ptotal, respectively. The system achieved 6 <b>log</b> <b>removal</b> units for Tc, Fc, and E. coli respectively. As a result of CKD additions of 1. 2  g/l for temperature ranges (30 – 35)  °C and (15 – 20)  °C, respectively to the used activated sludge process pilot plant without using primary settling, the system achieved high removal efficiencies of the chemical and bacteriological pollutants which enabled the system to achieve the permissible effluents of these pollutants to comply with the requirements of reuse limits of wastewater for agricultural purposes, Law 501 / 2005 limits...|$|R
