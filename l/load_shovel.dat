50|$|Quick {{couplers}} are devices {{installed at}} the outer end of the work equipment of various types of construction and earth-moving machines. They facilitate the rapid exchange of working tools or buckets. Quick couplers are most common on hydraulic excavators and compact excavators and on the backhoe equipment of backhoe loaders, but are also installed on telescopic handlers, wheel loaders (<b>loading</b> <b>shovels),</b> skid-steer loaders and the loader equipment of backhoe-loaders. They are also occasionally installed on attachments installed on agricultural tractors.Quick couplers do not normally have a specific function themselves in {{that they do not}} carry out handling or digging operations, but when installed on a machine they {{become a part of the}} overall system. They are usually mounted on the machine by means of the pins that would otherwise be the mountings for the bucket or attachment.This article concentrates on quick couplers installed on excavators and similar equipment.|$|R
50|$|Debswana (a 50-50 joint {{partnership}} of De Beers Centenary AG and the Government) accounted for all diamond production in Botswana from its four mines. Debswana continued its {{recovery from the}} labor unrest that had resulted in a 2-week strike in 2004. In 2005, Debswana treated about 31.2 million metric tons (Mt) of ore to yield 31890000 carat kg, which was a weight increase of more than 2% compared with 2004. Debswana’s diamond production included 148900000 carat kg from the 34-year-old Orapa Mine, which was a 7% decline compared with 2004; 15600000 carat kg from the 23-year-old Jwaneng Mine, which was a 14% increase compared with 2004; 1097000 carat kg from the 20-year-old Letlhakane Mine, which was a 6% increase compared with 2004; and 246278 carat kg from the 2-year-old Damtshaa Mine, which was a 27% decline from that of 2004. The production decline at Orapa was attributed {{to the loss of}} a haul road because of a ramp failure and a fire, which destroyed a <b>loading</b> <b>shovel.</b>|$|R

This system is being replaced with faster, less labor-intensive methods.Double-articulation cranes, which can load {{at a rate of}} 1,000 tons per hour, represent a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000 tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40 tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal, and to return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50 seconds.|$|R

40|$|Ground {{excavation}} {{constitutes a}} significant component of production costs in any surface mining operation. The excavation process entails material digging and removal {{in which the}} equipment motion is constrained by the workspace geometry. A major excavation problem is the variability of material properties, resulting in varying mechanical energy input and stress <b>loading</b> of <b>shovel</b> dipper-and-tooth assembly across the working bench. This variability has {{a huge impact on}} the shovel dipper and tooth assembly in hard formations. With this in mind, the primary objectives of the project were to (i) provide the theoretical basis to develop the Intelligent Shovel Excavation (ISE) technology to solve the problems associated with excavation in material formations; (ii) advance knowledge and frontiers in shovel excavation through intelligent navigation; and (iii) submit proposal for the design, development and implementation of the ISE technology for shovel excavation at experimental surface mining sites. The mathematical methods were used to (i) develop shovel's kinematics and dynamics, and (ii) establish the relationship between shovel parameters and the resistive forces from the material formation during excavation process. The ADAMS simulation environment was used to develop the hydraulic and cable shovel virtual prototypes. Two numerical examples are included to test the theoretical hypotheses and the obtained results are discussed. The area of sensor technology was studied. Application of specific wrist-mounted sensors to characterize the material, bucket and frame assembly was determined. Data acquisition, display and control system for <b>shovel</b> <b>loading</b> technology was adopted. The concept of data acquisition and control system was designed and a shovel boom stresses were simulated. A multi-partner collaboration between research organizations, shovel manufacturer, hardware and sensor technology companies, and surface mining companies is proposed to test design features, construct a field ready prototype and perform field testing at the surface mining sites. It is anticipated that 10 % in energy savings including electricity (cable shovel) and fuel (hydraulic shovel) will be achieved by implementation of ISE technology...|$|R

50|$|No sooner was {{the inlet}} open in 1918 {{than it was}} again filled with sand and debris. There {{were a number of}} {{influential}} citizens in the area who were steadfastly opposed to opening the Sebastian Inlet. Among them were grove owners such as A. B. Michael of Orchid. Michael was opposed to it for several reasons. One, he saw opening an inlet to the ocean as something that would forever change the fragile ecology of the Indian River Lagoon. At that time it was almost a body of fresh water. He was also concerned that the influx of salt water would ruin the fresh water wells essential for his groves. Cattlemen on the mainland nearby also shared a fear that their fresh water wells would be ruined, but the most powerful opponent to the opening was by far Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Rail Road that feared salt water in the lagoon would mean teredoes in the pilings of their rail road trestles that crossed the areas fresh water rivers. At any rate, it wasn't but {{a couple of days after}} the Sebastian Inlet was opened that someone organized several boatloads of men from the Narrows to Ft. Pierce into an Inlet destruction crew. One evening they <b>loaded</b> lanterns, <b>shovels,</b> saws, pick-axes, dynamite and chains, maybe even a mule or two, into boats and headed to the newly opened Sebastian Inlet. There they cut cabbage palms and any other tree they could find, dragged them into the cut and placed a lot of dynamite along the banks. Once the dynamite was set off it blew sand into the inlet sufficiently to plug it up.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{hard rock}} mining {{blasting}} {{is the most}} productive excavation technique applied to fragment insitu rock to the required size for efficient loading and crushing. In order to blast the insitu rock to the desired fragment size blast design parameter such as bench height hole diameter spacing burden hole length bottom charge specific charge and rock factor are considered. The research was carried out as a practical method on Nchanga Open Pits NOP ore Bench to optimize the blasting design parameters that can yield the required fragmentation size thereby reducing the <b>shovel</b> <b>loading</b> times and maximizing efficiency of the subsequent mining unit operations such as hauling and crushing. Fragmentation characteristics such as the mean fragment size were measured {{by means of a}} digital measuring tape and predicated using the Kuznetsov equation and rock factor value of ore bench was calculated using Lilly 1986 equations by means of rock characteristics. Traditional blasting design parameters were acquired for NOP and modified using Langerfors and Sharma P. A approaches. Several blast operations were conducted using both traditional and modified blasting design parameters on the same ore bench with the same geological conditions. Loading times of the shovel and fragment sizes were obtained after the blasts from ore bench where both the traditional and modified blasting design parameters were applied. Results show that mean fragment size and loading times were reduced from 51 cm and 12 minutes to 22 cm and 3 minutes where traditional and modified blasting design parameters were applied respectively...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} in blasting taconite are to produce broken rock that permits optimum digging and <b>shovel</b> <b>loading</b> rates with minimum secondary breakage and eliminates primary crusher delays. Since at least 1990, {{much of the}} blasting research by explosives companies, academics, and mining companies has been directed toward determining the downstream benefits of increased blast energy, particularly on crushing and coarse grinding. Several papers have been published that attempt {{to quantify the cost}} benefits. However, so many variables are involved that most benefits are only indicated or estimated. A report entitled "Effects of Blasting on Milling," by C. M. Lownds and D. A. Bocca of Viking Explosives & Supply, Inc., and K. Nielsen, Professor, Department of Geology and Mineral Resources Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, was presented at the 1997 Duluth, Minnesota, SME Annual Meeting. It describes a rather simple method of explosively loading taconite samples and of evaluating the explosive effects on grindability. 1 " The small-scale explosive tests were conducted on taconite rock pieces collected from the back of a muckpile instead of on diamond drill core or sawed and drilled cubes, as described in previous work. 2 · 3 The testwork described in the following report was proposed as a continuation of the tests on rock fragments to examine more extensively the effects of small-scale explosive tests on rock weakening.

40|$|Opencast and {{underground}} mining operations produce large quantities of dust as well noise due to increased mechanisation to augment production and enhance productivity {{to meet the demands}} of consumer industry. Exposure of miners to high concentrations of dust and noise may cause occupational health hazards like pneumoconiosis and noise induced hearing loss and other allied health risk. Health risk to miners from dust depends on dust size, concentration and duration of exposure whereas noise induced hearing loss depends on sound pressure level, frequency and exposure level of workers. Exposure of workers to dust concentrations and sound pressure levels beyond threshold limit values as prescribed limits by statutory enactments and guidelines may adversely affect the health of mine workers. To assess the status of dust concentrations and noise levels generated by various machines and exposure levels of workers, conduct of systematic dust and noise survey in mines is essential. It will help in assessing the situation vis-a-vis dust and noise standards so that effective dust and noise control strategies can be adopted to minimize their menace. Keeping this in view, this project work was undertaken to carry out dust and noise survey in an iron ore mine of SAIL. From dust and noise survey carried out in Bolani iron ore mines, it was observed that: -> The dust level at the mine site office was minimum (0. 14 mg/m 3) whereas the maximum dust level was found at the crusher plant area (3. 1 mg/m 3). The dust concentration at lump loading station, fine loading station, mine face and mine site office was less than safe working limit(3 mg/m 3) whereas at the washing plant and crusher plant area were found more than the safe working limit. -> The noise level at the secondary cone crusher was maximum (102. 2 dBA) whereas at the control room minimum (76. 2 dBA). The noise level at dumper, drill machine, drum scrubber, double deck screen and dewatering screen was more than 90 dBA which is maximum permissible limit for 8 hrs working period. Whereas the noise level at <b>loading</b> station, hopper, <b>shovel,</b> and control room was below the permissible limit 90 dBA. Hence we can say that the worker of the Iron Ore Mine, Bolani are working under high noise level more than the acceptable level. ->From the modelling of the Noise rating from Mamdani Fuzzy System, the noise rating for different machineries were determined and compared with the field data for the Noise Rating and it was found that the results were satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|A robust simulation-based {{optimization}} {{approach is}} proposed for truck-shovel systems in surface coal mines {{to maximize the}} expected value of revenue obtained from loading customer trains. To this end, a large surface coal mine in North America is considered as case study. A data-driven modeling framework is developed and then applied to automatically generate a highly detailed simulation model of the mine in Arena. The framework comprises a formal information model based on Unified Modeling Language (UML), {{which is used to}} input mine structural as well as production information. Petri net-based model generation procedures are applied to automatically generate the simulation model based on the whole set of simulation inputs. Then, factors encountered in material handling operations that may affect the robustness of revenue are then classified into 1) controllable; and 2) uncontrollable categories. While controllable factors are trucks locked to routes, uncontrollable factors are inverses of summation over truck haul, and <b>shovel</b> <b>loading</b> and truck-dumping times for each route. Historical production data of the mine contained in a data warehouse is used to derive probability distributions for the uncontrollable factors. The data warehouse is implemented in Microsoft SQL, and contains snapshots of historical equipment statuses and production outputs taken at regular intervals in each shift of the mine. Response Surface Methodology is applied to derive an expression for the variance of revenue as a function of controllable and uncontrollable factors. More specifically, 1) first order and second order effects for controllable factors, 2) first order effects for uncontrollable factors, and 3) two factor interactions for controllable and uncontrollable factors are considered. Latin Hypercube Sampling method is applied for setting controllable factors and the means of uncontrollable factors. Also, Common Random Numbers method is applied to generate the sequence of pseudo-random numbers for uncontrollable factors in simulation experiments for variance reduction between different design points of the metamodel. The variance of the metamodel is validated using leave-one-out cross validation. It is later applied as an additional constraint to the mathematical formulation to maximize revenue in the simulation model using OptQuest. The decision variables in this formulation are truck locks only. Revenue {{is a function of the}} actual quality of coal delivered to each customer and their corresponding quality specifications for premiums and penalties. OptQuest is an optimization add-on for Arena that uses Tabu search and Scatter search algorithms to arrive at the optimal solution. The upper bound on the variance as a constraint is varied to obtain different sets of expected value as well as variance of optimal revenue. After comparison with results using OptQuest with random sampling and without variance expression of metamodel, it has been shown that the proposed approach can be applied to obtain the decision variable set that not only results in a higher expected value but also a narrower confidence interval for optimum revenue. According to the best of our knowledge, there are two major contributions from this research: 1) It is theoretically demonstrated using 2 -point and orthonormal k-point response surfaces that Common Random Numbers reduces the error in estimation of variance of metamodel of simulation model. 2) A data-driven modeling and simulation framework has been proposed for automatically generating discrete-event simulation model of large surface coal mines to reduce modeling time, expenditure, as well as human errors associated with manual development...|$|R
