In her first four terms in office she emerged as the council's prominent defender of affordable housing.

Shiller voted to sustain Daley's veto.|$|E

40|$|Poverty among {{workers is}} a {{perennial}} problem. Recently {{there has been}} much interest in the idea of <b>living</b> <b>wages.</b> As mechanisms to increase wages above the ‘poverty line’, <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> present an alternative to New Labour’s ‘making work pay’ strategy; a combination of minimum wage regulation and means-tested, in-work relief. Through a comparison of <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> and the ‘making work pay’ strategy this paper critically examines both by focusing upon the aims of the two strategies, their ability to deliver higher incomes to workers and their families, and the assumptions upon which the two strategies are based. The paper demonstrates that while the ‘making work pay’ strategy is more sensitive to need than <b>living</b> <b>wages,</b> outside of wider changes in the social relations of capital and gender, the two strategies are similar in buttressing capitalism and institutionalizing stereotypes of women as dependants and carers...|$|R
5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a <b>living</b> <b>wage,</b> social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E
5|$|Khan's {{selection}} {{as a candidate}} was {{seen as part of}} a wider move towards the left in Labour that emerged during the 2015 leadership election that followed Miliband's resignation. Key policies that Khan proposed included a London 'living rent'; a quota system for ethnic minority officers in the Metropolitan Police; increased home building; and a campaign for a London <b>Living</b> <b>Wage.</b> Commentators raised Khan's Muslim religion as a potential barrier to election, after a poll (not mentioning Khan by name) suggested that 31% of Londoners would be 'uncomfortable' with a Muslim mayor. Khan, who was London's first Muslim MP, argued that the election of a Muslim could encourage London to become recognised as a more cosmopolitan city. While Khan had stated that he would serve a full term as MP for Tooting if he were to become Mayor of London, he later announced that would stand down as MP for Tooting if he were elected Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Since 1863, Verne {{had been}} under {{contract}} with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who published each of his novels, beginning with Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and continuing {{through the rest of}} his books to form the novel sequence Hetzel called the Voyages Extraordinaires. The arrangement gave Verne prominence as a novelist and a certain amount of financial stability, but {{under the terms of the}} contract Verne's profits barely earned him a <b>living</b> <b>wage.</b> Verne's fortunes changed markedly in 1874, when the stage adaptation of his novel Around the World in Eighty Days was a smash hit, running for 415 performances in its original production and quickly making Verne wealthy as well as famous as a playwright. Adapted with the collaboration of the showman d'Ennery, the play invented and codified the pièce de grand spectacle, an extravagant theatrical genre that became intensely popular in Paris throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Verne and d'Ennery went on to adapt two other Verne novels, The Children of Captain Grant and Michael Strogoff, as similarly spectacular plays.|$|E

3000|$|... 35 This {{same point}} {{helps explain why}} it {{is in no way}} {{contradictory}} to find that <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> reduce poverty (as reported below) but minimum wages do not (Wu et al., 2006; Neumark et al., 2005). The gains and losses from <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> may be of different magnitudes, affect different workers, and fall at different points in the distribution of family income than do the gains and losses from minimum wages.|$|R
30|$|Second, <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> may not {{effectively}} target low-income families. Broadly speaking, low-wage {{workers in}} the United States have large shares from two groups. The first is very young workers {{who have not yet}} acquired many labor market skills but who are likely to escape low-wage work as they acquire skills. The second is low-skilled adults who remain mired in low-wage jobs and who – as adults – {{are much more likely to}} be in poor families. 5 Thus, whether <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> help reduce poverty depends on wage gains and employment losses, and the extent to which the gains from <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> (the wage increases) as opposed to the costs (job loss) fall on individuals in poor families. There is also an issue of the interaction between changes in labor market earnings and changes in government benefits, which we take up in this paper.|$|R
25|$|The {{encyclical}} {{also contains}} {{a proposal for a}} <b>living</b> <b>wage,</b> though not called by that name in the text itself (“Wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well-behaved wage-earner.”) The U.S. theologian Msgr.
