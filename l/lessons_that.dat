5|$|The {{gameplay}} of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach {{consists of}} the player completing <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> introduce new vocabulary and then focus on mastering the words through several puzzle games. As the player progresses through the game, the words increase in difficulty. When first starting the game, the player takes an introductory test that gauges their initial comprehension level of the French or Spanish language. The player is then placed into a level reflective of the score they received on the test. A player who scores highly {{will be able to}} skip many of the initial levels and more basic concepts. When starting a lesson, the player is shown ten new words, which include nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, as well as their meanings and proper enunciation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{experimental}} group who are exposed to DVD Video <b>Lesson</b> <b>that</b> uses code switching language has an average mean score in the pretest of 1. 56, and this increased to an average mean of 3. 50 in the posttest. The control group that uses DVD Video <b>Lesson</b> <b>that</b> uses purely English language got an average mean of 1. 06 in the pretest and increased to 1. 53 in the posttest. Based {{on the results of}} the performance posttest taken by the two groups, the experimental group has a dramatic increase in scores from the pretest to posttest. Although both groups had increased in their performance scores from pretest to posttest, the experimental group (code switching language) performs well in the posttest than the control group. As revealed in this findings, there is {{a significant difference in the}} posttest scores between the experimental group who are exposed to DVD <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> uses code switching as a medium of instruction and the control group who are exposed to DVD <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> uses English. The students who are exposed to the Video <b>Lesson</b> <b>that</b> uses code switching perform well than those students who are exposed in DVD video <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> uses purely English language. DVD Video <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> uses code switching as a medium of instruction in teaching social dance is the useful approach in teaching Grade 10 Special Program in the Art students. The language used (code switching) is the powerful medium of instruction that enhances the learning outcomes of the students to perform well. This paper could be an eye opener to the Department of Education to inculcate the used of first language/local language or MTB-MLE, not only in Grade I to III but all level in K to 12 programs, since education is a key factor for building a better nation...|$|R

25|$|Indeed, as {{a result}} of the war and the <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> were learned about the {{potential}} of airpower in the region, following the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard, proposed controlling the frontier by air power alone. This plan had proved highly successful in Mesopotamia, Aden and the Transjordan, however, due to the uniqueness of the North-West Frontier and also due to inter-service politics the plan was not accepted until later. In 1937, it was eventually decided that should another war break out with Afghanistan, or in the event of a major tribal uprising, the RAF would take the offensive, while the ground forces would act defensively.|$|E
25|$|Dragonetti {{was born}} in Venice, Italy of Pietro Dragonetti, a barber and amateur musician, and Caterina Calegari. He began playing the guitar and the double bass by himself on his father's instruments. He was soon noticed by Doretti, a violinist and {{composer}} of ball music, who took him along for public performance in Venice. At the age of twelve, he was placed under the tuition of Berini, the best master for the double bass in Venice, who decided after only eleven <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> he could not teach the boy anything more. At the age of thirteen, Dragonetti was appointed principal player at the Opera Buffa in Venice. At fourteen he was appointed principal double bass player in the Grand Opera Seria at the San Benedetto theatre.|$|E

Crick was witness to the kinds of errors that his co-workers made in their failed attempts to make a correct molecular model of the alpha helix; these turned out to be important <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> could be applied, in the future, to the helical structure of DNA. For example, he learned the importance of the structural rigidity that double bonds confer on molecular structures which is relevant both to peptide bonds in proteins and the structure of nucleotides in DNA.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second Balkan War the Bulgarian Army was demobilized {{and brought}} to a peacetime level of 5,220 {{officers}} and 80,079 soldiers. The Bulgarian General Staff initially drafted several mobilization plans that required the armed forces to be deployed in times of war much {{in the same manner as}} in the First Balkan War in regards to their structure and organization. However, the analysis of the army's performance during the Balkan Wars yielded several <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> served as the basis for several important structural changes in the planned wartime organization of the army and its units. Specifically, some of the infantry regiments were reformed to include three battalions instead of the usual four, new Etappe regiments were created (each army and division had one attached to it), and the two artillery regiments of each division formed an artillery brigade.|$|E
25|$|Atholl {{was ordered}} 2 January 1942 {{as part of}} the 1942-43 {{modified}} Flower-class building programme. This programme was known as the Increased Endurance (IE). Many changes were made, all from <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> had been learned in previous versions of the Flower-class. The bridge was made a full deck higher and built to naval standards instead of the more civilian-like bridges of previous versions. The platform for the 4-inch main gun was raised to minimize the amount of spray over it and to provide a better field of fire. It was also connected to the wheelhouse by a wide platform that was now the base for the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar that this version was armed with. Along with the new Hedgehog, this version got the new QF 4-inch Mk XIX main gun, which was semi-automatic, used fixed ammunition and had the ability to elevate higher giving it an anti-aircraft ability.|$|E
25|$|During the Vietnam War the RAE {{maintained}} {{a force of}} about 1,000 personnel in South Vietnam where they served {{as part of the}} 1st Australian Task Force. Following {{the end of the war}} the size of the Australian Army was decreased in line with the abolition of the national service scheme and as a consequence of this and a number of <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> came out of the deployment to Vietnam the RAE underwent a series of changes. One of the most significant changes came in 1972 and was the decision to establish full regimental sized engineer units, as opposed to squadron or company sized units. These units were initially known as Field Regiments, but have subsequently become known as Combat Engineer Regiments. As a part of this restructuring the RAE was reorganised to raise one regiment for each brigade and the Corps lost its responsibility for maintaining water transport and engineering stores.|$|E

25|$|She also befriended a {{woman by}} the name of Henrietta Jessup, who went by the codename Sojourner. Though Sojourner did not have any warrior skills to speak of, Artemis stood by her friend and tutored her as a novice Amazon. For unknown reasons Artemis left the Hellenders and aided Diana in Gateway City as a fellow crime fighter. She also became close friends with Cassie Sandsmark. Artemis' {{previous}} teacher/mentor relationship with Sojourner was later expanded as Wonder Woman asked Artemis to take Cassie on as a new pupil. It was with Artemis' Amazon training <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> Cassie was able to hone her skills in becoming the new Wonder Girl. Later still, Artemis' teacher/mentor resume would expand even more to even include the combat training of Supergirl. It was during the initial meeting with Supergirl that Artemis would gain her revenge against Batman for his hostile attitude towards her when she attempted to join the Justice League. Artemis pinned Batman in hand-to-hand combat, but was eventually subdued with one of Batman's tranquilizer darts.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, O'Keeffe {{began her}} serious formal art {{training}} at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then the Art Students League of New York, but she felt constrained by her <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> focused on recreating or copying what was in nature. In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then spent seven years between 1911 and 1918 teaching in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and {{was introduced to the}} principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow, who espoused created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way she felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1916. Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July, Archduke Charles {{finally decided}} not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground {{overlooking}} the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was {{not strong enough to}} occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in open order formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. But above all, the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling to take the risk of committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he {{would have a hard time}} extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position for weeks and this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.|$|E
