The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E

However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E

40|$|Children’s social {{interactions}} {{with their peers}} influence their psychosocial adjustment; consequently, the relationship between class-wide peer liking, same-gender peer <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment was explored in two age groups. Peer liking was analysed using the social relations model (SRM). In Study 1, 205 children (103 female and 102 male, Mage = 7. 15, SD = 7 months) completed measures of peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment, and teachers completed the Short-Form TRSSA. In Study 2, 197 children (98 female and 90 male, Mage = 9. 87, SD = 5. 9 months) completed measures of peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment. Both studies yielded evidence of reciprocal <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> individual differences in the ratings of <b>liking</b> awarded to, <b>and</b> elicited from, both peer groups. Multigroup path analysis, with groups created according to gender, revealed that elements of liking predicted different aspects of school adjustment with some variation according to age and gender. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} the SRM can be used to examine peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> underscore the importance of children’s peers for school adjustment...|$|R

5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto remarked that Sasuke was the most memorable character for him to design. Kishimoto has remarked that Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability. He also considered Sasuke his most challenging character to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look <b>like,</b> <b>and</b> his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character {{the same age as}} Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E

Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the relations among children’s effortful control, school <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> academic competence {{with a sample}} of 240 7 - to 12 -year-old children.

Significant positive correlations existed between children’s effortful control, school <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> academic competence. Consistent with predictions, and while controlling for the effects of parents’ education and family income, school liking mediated the relation between effortful control and academic competence. Implications include a focus on proximal processes such as enhancing school <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> encouraging social relationships when designing interventions to promote academic competence...|$|R

Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} probably became extinct {{sometime between}} the 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance {{coincided with the}} tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750; traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, {{as he had been}} assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. Though trying for 18 months, and offering large rewards, none could be found. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was due to hunting by humans instead. Alexandre Guy Pingré did not encounter any solitaires when he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, although he had been assured they survived. His friend Pierre Charles Le Monnier named the constellation Turdus Solitarius after the bird to commemorate the journey. Although the Rodrigues solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation named for it, celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked <b>like</b> <b>and</b> star maps depict other birds.|$|E

40|$|Current {{train of}} thought in {{appetite}} research is favouring an interest in non-homeostatic or hedonic (reward) mechanisms in relation to overconsumption and energy balance. This tendency is supported by advances in neurobiology that precede {{the emergence of a}} new conceptual approach to reward where affect <b>and</b> motivation (<b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting) can be seen as the major force in guiding human eating behaviour. In this review, current progress in applying processes of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting to the study of human appetite are examined by discussing the following issues: How can these concepts be operationalised for use in human research to reflect the neural mechanisms by which they may be influenced? Do <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting operate independently to produce functionally significant changes in behaviour? Can <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting be truly experimentally separated or will an expression of one inevitably contain elements of the other? The review contains a re-examination of selected human appetite research before exploring more recent methodological approaches to the study of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting in appetite control. In addition, some theoretical developments are described in four diverse models that may enhance current understanding of the role of these processes in guiding ingestive behaviour. Finally, the implications of a dual process modulation of food reward for weight gain and obesity are discussed. The review concludes that processes of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting are likely to have independent roles in characterising susceptibility to weight gain. Further research into the dissociation of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting through implicit and explicit levels of processing would help to disclose the relative importance of these components of reward for appetite control and weight regulation...|$|R

40|$|Because early {{childhood}} {{is the most}} important time for establishing eating habits, controlling the <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes of children is significant. This study investigated the relationship between mothers’ food preferences as well as their attitudes toward food and their children’s preferences. A questionnaire was answered by 244 mothers of children aged 3 - 5 years who attended a private kindergarten in Japan. The mothers were asked questions relating to their own current food preferences and those during their childhoods, their eating and cooking habits, <b>and</b> the <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes of their children. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relative importance of mothers’ preferences and habits for their children’s <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes. The children’s preferences were significantly related to their mothers’ <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes during childhood, rather than to their current preferences, and to the children’s breakfast times during holidays and the frequency with which the mothers used takeout meals. This suggests that mothers’ <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes during childhood and their food habits affect their children’s preferences. Therefore, to improve children’s food preferences, mothers may need to improve their food habits and consider their own food preferences during childhood...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{research}} {{suggested that}} mimicry increases <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> trust in other people. Because people respond socially to technology and mimicry leads to increased liking of virtual agents, {{we expected that}} a mimicking virtual agent would be <b>liked</b> <b>and</b> trusted more than a non-mimicking one. We investigated this expectation in an automotive setting. We performed an experiment in which participants played an investment game and a route planner game, to measure their behavioral trust in two virtual agents. These agents either mimicked participant’s head movements or not. <b>Liking</b> <b>and</b> trust of these virtual agents were measured with questionnaires. Results suggested that for the investment game, mimicry did not increase liking or trust. For the route planner game however, a mimicking virtual agent was <b>liked</b> <b>and</b> trusted more than a non-mimicking virtual agent. These results suggest that mimicry could be a useful tool to persuade users to trust a virtual agent...|$|R
