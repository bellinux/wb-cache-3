5|$|Neon is monatomic, {{making it}} <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> {{molecules}} of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form {{the bulk of}} Earth's atmosphere; a balloon filled with neon will rise in air, albeit more slowly than a helium balloon.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E

5|$|The {{isotopes}} of ytterbium {{range in}} atomic weight from 147.9674 {{atomic mass unit}} (u) for 148Yb to 180.9562u for 181Yb. The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> most abundant stable isotope, 174Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than 174Yb are thulium isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are lutetium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Niobium in the Earth's crust {{comprises}} one stable isotope, 93Nb. By 2003, {{at least}} 32 radioisotopes had been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113. The most stable {{of these is}} 92Nb with a half-life of 34.7million years. One of the least stable is 113Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. Isotopes that are <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> stable 93Nb tend to decay by β+ decay, {{and those that are}} heavier tend to decay by β− decay, with some exceptions. 81Nb, 82Nb, and 84Nb have minor β+ delayed proton emission decay paths, 91Nb decays by electron capture and positron emission, and 92Nb decays by both β+ and β− decay.|$|E

5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
5|$|Released in , {{four years}} after the launch of the {{original}} PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In , Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter. In , Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled internal design incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.|$|E
5|$|The civil weight {{systems were}} {{generally}} {{very similar to}} the apothecaries' system, and since the libbra (or the libbra sottile, where different systems were in use for light and heavy goods) generally had a suitable weight for an apothecaries' pound it was often used for this purpose. Extreme cases were Rome and Genoa, where the same system was used for everything, including medicine. On the other hand, there were relatively large differences even between two cities in the same state. E.g. Bologna (in the Papal States) had an apothecaries' pound that was less than the local civil pound, and 4% <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> pound used in Rome.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotters}} {{were initially}} equipped with Teleradio 3A sets and amateur equipment; however, many outstations later had these replaced by improved 3B and 3BZ sets to provide higher power communications. This occurred following {{a decision to}} standardise on the 3B following {{the formation of the}} NGAWW. In addition, some teams operating in more difficult jungle and mountain terrain, such as that closer to Port Moresby, were equipped with RAAF supplied ATR-2 radios which were <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Teleradio 3A sets provided to the more distant outstations.|$|E
5|$|To date, 32 {{synthetic}} radioisotopes of {{the element}} have been characterized, ranging in mass from 149.973 (lutetium-150) to 183.961 (lutetium-184); {{the most stable}} such isotopes are lutetium-174 with a half-life of 3.31 years, and lutetium-173 with a half-life of 1.37 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 9 days, {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives that are less than half an hour. Isotopes <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> stable lutetium-175 decay via electron capture (to produce isotopes of ytterbium), with some alpha and positron emission; the heavier isotopes decay primarily via beta decay, producing hafnium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{meeting the needs}} of the British forces, Project E affected the design and development of British nuclear weapons. Interim designs like Violet Club were no longer required, as Project E weapons could do the job pending the development of a British weapon. The British designers were particularly impressed by the Mark 28, which was not only <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> British Green Grass warhead used in Yellow Sun, but remarkably more economical in its use of expensive fissile material. An Anglicised version of the Mark 28 was developed, known as Red Snow, and a Yellow Sun Mark 2 using Red Snow cost £500,000 compared with £1,200,000 for the Mark 1 with Green Grass.|$|E

5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore <b>lighter,</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat was}} a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, {{which was not}} contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The {{forehead}} was brown, darker than the face, and the upper lip and patch {{in front of the}} eyes were <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is 154Dy, with a {{half-life}} of approximately 3years, followed by 159Dy with a half-life of 144.4days. The least stable is 138Dy, with a half-life of 200ms. As a general rule, isotopes that are <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
