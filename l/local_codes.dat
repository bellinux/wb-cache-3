25|$|In new construction, minimum {{requirements}} are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked {{directly to the}} electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup. In addition, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every bedroom, depending on <b>local</b> <b>codes.</b> Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, {{but the sound of}} the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require smoke detectors in stairways, main hallways and garages.|$|E
25|$|About fifty {{investigators}} in all {{were assigned to}} the investigation, including the City of Charleston Police Department, the Charleston County Sheriff's Office, the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division, and the ATF national response team. The ATF confirmed on June 23 that the fire originated in the covered loading dock area situated between the showroom and warehouse buildings, in a pile of trash near an area where employees were known to take smoking breaks. Neither of the destroyed buildings had sprinklers, nor were they required by <b>local</b> <b>codes</b> to have them.|$|E
25|$|Mounting options: The bailout {{cylinder}} may {{be mounted}} with the valve {{at the top}} or at the bottom, depending on <b>local</b> <b>codes</b> of practice. A generally used arrangement is to mount the cylinder with the valve up, as this is better protected while kitting up, and the cylinder valve is left fully open while the diver is in the water. This means that the regulator and supply hose to the bailout block will be pressurised during the dive, and ready for immediate use by opening the bailout valve on the harness or helmet.|$|E

25|$|That summer, he and Bronsky became {{involved}} in a local zoning controversy involving their gym. On August 17, local building inspector Peter Kropf sent a certified letter to Keith Boyer and the four people leasing the building that the building had numerous violations and that Boyers had 45 days to bring it into compliance with state and <b>local</b> <b>codes</b> or face daily fines of up to $1,000. Kropf also claimed that Boyer never secured a necessary permit when he opened a gym in the former silk mill in 1983. The three-story brick building housed a furniture-stripping business {{as well as the}} gym. Town officials raised concerns that the building may be unsafe, such as the absence of proper fire exits, to accommodate the hundreds of people that the gym was bringing in on the weekends. Yasinsky was the first to sign and acknowledge the town's letter.|$|E

2500|$|The Dupont Plaza Hotel {{fire and}} other fires {{of the era}} gave rise to several {{amendments}} to security policies in hotels around the world. One {{of the biggest problems}} at the time was the lack of standard fire safety requirements. The hotel included an unsprinklered 17-story tower that housed 423 guest rooms. The fire alarm system in the tower was not working, and many guests were not aware of the fire until they saw or smelled it, heard someone shouting [...] "Fire", or heard firefighters responding. In 1987, there were four major fire codes across the United States with over 1,800 variations because of <b>local</b> <b>codes</b> and ordinances, with one code having significant fire protection requirements, and another having nothing.|$|E
