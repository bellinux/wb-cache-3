40|$|The {{presence}} of pathogenic Leptospira spp. {{in the environment}} poses threats to human health. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect and characterize Leptospira spp. from environmental samples. A total of 144 samples comprised of 72 soil and 72 water samples were collected from markets and recreational areas in a north-eastern state in Malaysia. Samples were cultured on Ellinghausen and McCullough modified by Johnson and Harris media. Leptospires were positive in 22. 9 % (n= 33) of the isolates. Based on partial sequences of 16 S rRNA, a pathogenic <b>leptospire,</b> Leptospira alstonii (n= 1 / 33), was identified in 3 % of the isolates followed by intermediate <b>leptospire</b> (L. wolffii, n= 1 / 33, and L. licerasiae, n= 7 / 33) and nonpathogenic <b>leptospire,</b> L. meyeri (n= 22 / 33) in 24. 2 % and 66. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} virulent Leptospira interrogans strain Teramo, serotype icterohemorrhagiae, on the adherence of human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC). Selective pretreatment of HEC with intact or sonicated leptospires caused a dose- and time-dependent increase of HEC-PMN adhesion (13. 2 % +/- 2. 5 % adherence to untreated HEC versus 46. 3 % +/- 5. 6 % adherence to HEC pretreated for 4 h with 10 (8) intact leptospires per ml [mean +/- standard error of six experiments; P < 0. 001]). In contrast, selective <b>leptospire</b> pretreatment of PMN or the addition of leptospires during the adherence assay did not alter HEC-PMN adherence. <b>Leptospire</b> induction of endothelial-cell adhesiveness occurred without detectable HEC damage and was prevented by RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors and by monoclonal antibodies to the CD 11 /CD 18 adhesion complex of neutrophils and to the endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM- 1) of endothelial cells. Similar results were obtained with pretreatment of HEC with interleukin- 1 or with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The possibility that contamination by the LPS of gram-negative bacteria could be involved in the induction of HEC adhesiveness was ruled out by the observation that the LPS inhibitor polymyxin B, which abolished the proadhesive effect of E. coli LPS, was ineffective in inhibiting leptospire- as well as interleukin- 1 -induced adherence. Similarly, <b>leptospire</b> LPSs seemed to have no role in the increase of endothelial-cell adhesiveness, since pretreatment of HEC with a <b>leptospire</b> LPS extract (phenol-water method) or with a <b>leptospire</b> total lipid extract failed to induce the proadhesive phenotype for neutrophils. Instead, peptidoglycans extracted from our leptospires actively stimulated the endothelial proadhesive activity for neutrophils (16. 5 % +/- 2. 1 % adherence to untreated HEC versus 51. 2 % +/- 2. 9 % adherence to HEC pretreated for 4 h with 1 microgram of peptidoglycan per ml; [mean +/- standard error of four experiments; P < 0. 001]). This peptidoglycan-induced activity was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to the CD 11 /CD 18 adhesion complex and to ELAM- 1 but not by polymyxin B. We conclude that peptidoglycans from pathogenic leptospires are among the molecules that can directly activate vascular endothelial cells to increase their adhesiveness for neutrophilic granulocytes. These observations may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms whereby non-gram-negative bacteria modulate the local and systemic inflammatory reaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{polymorphonuclear}} neutrophils (PMN) {{in defense}} against <b>leptospires</b> has not been adequately studied, in part, because of difficulty in quantitating pathogenic <b>leptospires.</b> By using pour plates to quantitate nonpathogenic <b>leptospires</b> and the most-probable-number procedure to quantitate the pathogenic <b>leptospires,</b> we examined the interactions of nonpathogenic Leptospira biflexa and pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohemorrhagiae with human neutrophils. Phase-contrast, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopic observations were made. <b>Leptospires</b> were incubated with PMN at 37 degrees C and tumbled together. There was no ingestion or killing of nonpathogenic <b>leptospires</b> (with no serum) or of pathogenic organisms (with 10 % normal serum). However, when <b>leptospires</b> were incubated with PMN (without serum) in a pellet and then resuspended, 91 +/- 6 % of nonpathogenic <b>leptospires</b> {{were removed from the}} supernatant, and 93 +/- 4 % of these organisms were killed. The pathogenic <b>leptospires</b> became cell associated in a pellet, but were not killed by PMN even in the presence of 10 % normal serum. Observations of morphological interactions indicated that PMN phagocytized the nonpathogenic <b>leptospires</b> in the absence of serum and that the pathogenic <b>leptospires</b> attached to but were not ingested by neutrophils in the presence of 10 % normal serum. PMN {{do not seem to be}} an efficient defense factor for pathogenic <b>leptospires</b> in nonimmune hosts. The virulence of <b>leptospires</b> appears to be related to their ability to resist killing by serum and to resist ingestion and killing by neutrophils...|$|R
40|$|The minimal growth {{temperature}} of the pathogenic <b>leptospires</b> is between 13 and 15 C.

40|$|The genus Leptospira can {{be divided}} into three groups based on purine {{analogue}} sensitivity and lipase (trioleinase) activity. Group 1 contains members of the “parasitic complex” of <b>leptospires</b> which initially cannot grow in media containing 10 μg of 2, 6 -diaminopurine (DAP) per ml or 200 μg of 8 -azaguanine per ml. In addition, <b>leptospires</b> in this group possess lipase activity. Group 2 also contains members of the “parasitic complex” of <b>leptospires.</b> Although these <b>leptospires</b> are similarly sensitive to 8 -azaguanine, they differ from group 1 <b>leptospires</b> in that they grow in media containing 10 μg of DAP per ml, and they do not possess detectable lipase activity.

40|$|Leptospirosis {{severity}} may be increasing, with pulmonary involvement {{becoming more}} frequent. Does this increase result from an intense immune response to <b>leptospire?</b> Notice that renal failure, thrombocytopenia and pulmonary complications are found during the immune phase. Thirty-five hospitalized patients with Weil’s disease had 5 blood samples drawn, from the 15 th {{day to the}} 12 th month of symptoms, for ELISA-IgM,-IgG and-IgA specific antibody detection. According their 1 st IgG titer, the patients were divided into: group 1 (n = 13) titer> 1 : 400 (positive) and group 2 (n = 22) titer 1 : 400 (negative). Early IgG antibodies in group 1 showed high avidity which may indicate reinfection. Group 1 was older, had worse pulmonary and renal function, and fever {{for a longer period}} than group 2. Throughout the study, IgG and IgA titers remained higher in group 1.

40|$|The antigens of Leptospira (biflexa, Waz) were investigated. The {{work was}} divided into four sections: Section 1. The whole <b>leptospire.</b> Section 2. The trypsin {{extractable}} antigens of the <b>leptospire.</b> Section 3. Separation of precipitating antigens of the leptospiral trypsin extract. Section 4. Monospecific antisera to individual precipitating antigens of the <b>leptospire.</b> Section 1. The whole <b>leptospire</b> Normal and trypsinized leptospires each gave rise to approximately {{the same level of}} agglutinating antibodies in rabbits. The early agglutinins were all 2 -Me sensitive but in hyperimmune sera only 50 % of agglutinating activity was destroyed with 2 -Me. The 2 -Me sensitive agglutinin was shown to be IgM while the 2 -Me insensitive agglutinin was associated with a ¥ migrating 7 S immunoglobulin, probably IgG. By immunizing with whole leptospires, precipitating antibodies against the axial filament were produced concurrently with agglutinating antibodies. Rabbit antileptospiral agglutinating sera always contained axial filament precipitins without which the serum did not agglutinate whole leptospires. This suggests that the axial filament is an agglutinating antigen of the whole <b>leptospire.</b> The early bleed axial filament precipitins were 2 -Me sensitive but became 2 -Me insensitive after day 6 when they were found in both 19 S and 7 S gel filtration fractions. Precipitating antibodies against other leptospiral trypsin extract (LTE) antigens did not appear until many days later and then usually not without further immunization. Their time of appearance varied between individual rabbits, as did the specificity of the various precipitating antibodies produced by different rabbits. The leptospiral microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was investigated for factors other than the serum antibody level which affected the agglutination titre of the serum. Both the concentration of leptospires and the percentage of viable cells in the antigen suspension affected the endpoint of the titration. However the age of the leptospiral suspension and the incubation time for the reaction mixture did not affect the endpoint of the titration. Section 2. The trypsin extractable antigens of the <b>leptospire.</b> Virtually all the agglutinating activity of rabbit antileptospiral serum could be removed by absorption with LTE. The LTE as an immunogen stimulated the same level of agglutinating antibodies in rabbits as did whole leptospires. Precipitating antibodies (including those against axial filaments and other antigens) were also produced. One particular rabbit antileptospiral serum (R 198 - 72) produced 3 strong precipitin bands in immunodiffusion against LTE; 'axial filament', 'd' and 'e'. The LTE represented about 20 % of the dry weight of the whole <b>leptospire.</b> About 1 / 5 th of the LTE, including the precipitating antigens, was not dialysable. The LTE was mainly protein (73 - 101 %) but contained considerable amounts of carbohydrate (10 - 12 %). Extracts from different batches of cells showed substantial differences in chemical composition. No enzyme activity was detected in the LTE. Young leptospiral cultures (2 - 6 days) were marginally more susceptible to trypsin extraction (26 - 30 % of dry weight extracted) than were older cultures (8 - 14 days) (19 - 22 % of dry weight extracted). Furthermore, antigens 'd' and 'e' could be detected only in stationary phase leptospires and not in logarithmically growing cells. These antigens could not be detected in concentrated culture supernatants of either young or old cultures. Purified antigen 'd' was shown to be mainly protein and contained only 3 % carbohydrate. Antigen 'd' was destroyed by papain, but not by trypsin, 'pronase' or lipase. Antigens 'e' and 'axial filament' could not be destroyed with any of these four enzymes. Antigens 'd' and 'e' were heat labile (100 °C for 1 hour). Neither 'd' nor 'e' precipitin band stained specifically for lipid or polysaccharide. Trypsinized leptospires and the LTE were examined by by electron microscopy. Trypsin caused release of axial filaments and an uneven loss of outer cell wall material from the whole <b>leptospire.</b> Section 3. Separation of Precipitating antigens of the leptospiral trypsin extract. Gel-filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, electrophoresis, !so-electric point precipitation, ammonium sulphate fractionation and immunoadsorption were used in attempts to separate mixtures of precipitating antigens. Antigen 'd' was prepared in a purified form, free from other antigens, but antigen 'e' was not. Antigen 'd' was shown by gel-filtration to have a molecular weight of about 500, 000. Section 4. Monospecific antisera to individual antigens of the <b>leptospire.</b> Monospecific antisera to individual precipitating antigens were usually prepared by immunizing rabbits with the washed immune precipitate in agar. Other methods involved immunizing with gel-filtration-column fractions and with antigens eluted from immunoadsorbents. Rabbit antibodies produced against antigens 'd' and 'e' were initially 19 S but later production changed to 7 S, without any 19 S component. This suggested that the antigens were protein rather than polysaccharide. Monospecific antisera against antigens 'd' and 'e' would not agglutinate whole leptospires, nor would they fix a detectable amount of complement when reacted with normal, trypsinized or sonicated leptospires. Anti-'d' and anti-'e' antibodies could be absorbed from serum with. whole leptospires from stationary phase cultures. When anti-'d' and anti-'e' sera were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate they specifically stained alcohol fixed leptospires on glass slides, but not unfixed leptospires in test tubes. Fluorescein labeled anti' whole leptospire' serum stained under both conditions. Leptospires pretreated with rabbit anti-'d' serum or rabbit anti-'e' serum could not be cross-linked (agglutinated) with goat anti-rabbit serum. However, leptospires treated with rabbit anti-'whole leptospire' serum could be further agglutinated with goat anti-rabbit serum. This was interpreted as indicating that antigens 'd' and 'e' were sub-surface protein antigens not involved in whole cell interactions. Further support for the hypothesis of a sub-surface location of antigens 'd' and 'e' was given by the inability of fluorescent anti-'d' or anti-'e' antisera to react with whole leptospires (unfixed) and their inability to agglutinate whole leptaspires. Antigens 'd' and 'e' of Leptospira (biflexa Waz) were detected by immunodiffusion in other leptospiral biflexa (saprophytic) serotypes, but not in pathogenic serotypes. A survey of other leptospiral serotypes with fluorescent anti-'d' serum showed extensive crossreaction. Reasons for this are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Pathogenic {{species of}} Leptospira cause leptospirosis, a global {{zoonotic}} disease. Our previous work showed that <b>leptospires</b> survive and replicate in human macrophages but are killed in murine macrophages. However, the mechanism {{responsible for the}} different intracellular fates of <b>leptospires</b> within the macrophages of different hosts remains unclear. The present study demonstrates that infection with Leptospira interrogans caused significant up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide in J 774 A. 1 cells but did so {{to a lesser extent}} in THP- 1 cells. The up-regulation of ROS and superoxide was significantly inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. The damaged <b>leptospires</b> and remnants of <b>leptospires</b> within membrane-bound vacuoles were significantly inhibited by apocynin in J 774 A. 1 cells but were less inhibited in THP- 1 cells. In addition, apocynin significantly prevented damage to <b>leptospires</b> and the co-localization of L. interrogans with lysosomes in J 774 A. 1 cells but did so to a lesser extent in THP- 1 cells. Furthermore, the relative fluorescence intensity levels of intracellular <b>leptospires</b> and the viability of the intracellular <b>leptospires</b> increased in apocynin pretreated J 774 A. 1 and THP- 1 cells after 2 h of infection.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{microbiological}} {{diagnosis of}} leptospirosis comprises bacteriological and serological methods. The former ones allow the direct detection of leptospires and are considered presumptive {{with the exception}} of culture. Therefore, they constitute invaluable tools for rapid diagnosis, mainly in samples from deceased subjects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a modified Fontana silver staining method in experimentally infected samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human and animal (hamster) urine samples were experimentally infected with different strains of Leptospira interrogans sensu lato. Liquid culture medium, leptospira cultures, experimentally infected and non-infected human urine samples, clarified and non-clarified imprints, and clarified and non-clarified suspension smears from tissues of experimentally infected and non-infected hamsters were applied for the ass essment of silver staining. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was compared with dark field microscopy and culture. Other bacterial and fungi species were also used. RESULTS: The modified Fontana silver staining allowed the accurate observation of the well-defined <b>leptospire</b> helical structure. On <b>leptospire</b> cultures from infected human samples, we could observe until (1 - 10) × 10 ³ leptospires/ml, higher sensitivity in comparison with direct dark field microscopy and lower in comparison with culture. The best results in tissues were obtained on clarified imprints and non-clarified suspension smears. Morphological and stainable structures compatible with leptospires were not observed in the samples without them. CONCLUSION: This procedure allowed differentiating the characteristic morphology of leptospires.

40|$|Background: Leptospira interrogans are {{bacterial}} pathogens {{of animal}} that cause zoonotic infections in human. Outer membrane proteins of <b>leptospire</b> {{are among the}} most effective antigens which can stimulate remarkable immune responses during the infection processes, and thus are currently considered leading candidate vaccine antigens. The objective of the present study is to predict and confirm major combined B and T cell epitopes of leptospiral outer membrane proteins OmpL 1 and LipL 41, as well as to evaluate their capacity in the induction of immune responses in BALB/c mice. Results: In this study, four epitopes from OmpL 1 and four from LipL 41 conserved regions were evaluated for their potential utilization in <b>leptospire</b> vaccines. Firstly, combined B and T cell epitopes were predicted by softwares and expressed using a phage display system. OmpL 1 residues 87 - 98 and 173 - 191 (OmpL 187 - 98 and OmpL 1173 - 191) and LipL 4130 - 48, LipL 41233 - 256 of LipL 41 were identified as immunodominant B cell epitopes by Western blot.

40|$|Leptospira (L.) interrogans are {{bacteria}} {{responsible for}} a worldwide reemerging zoonosis. Some animals asymptomatically carry L. interrogans in their kidneys and excrete bacteria in their urine, which contaminates the environment. Humans are infected through skin contact with <b>leptospires</b> and develop mild to severe leptospirosis. Previous attempts to construct fluorescent or bioluminescent <b>leptospires,</b> which would permit in vivo visualization and investigation of host defense mechanisms during infection, have been unsuccessful. Using a firefly luciferase cassette and random transposition tools, we constructed bioluminescent chromosomal transformants in saprophytic and pathogenic <b>leptospires.</b> The kinetics of leptospiral dissemination in mice, after intraperitoneal inoculation with a pathogenic transformant, was tracked by bioluminescence using live imaging. For infective doses of 106 to 107 bacteria, we observed dissemination and exponential growth of <b>leptospires</b> in the blood, followed by apparent clearance of bacteria. However, with 2 × 108 bacteria, the septicemia led {{to the death of}} mice within 3 days post-infection. In surviving mice, one week after infection, pathogenic <b>leptospires</b> reemerged only in the kidneys, where they multiplied and reached a steady state, leading to a sustained chronic renal infection. These experiments reveal that a fraction of the leptospiral population escapes the potent blood defense, and colonizes a defined number of niches in the kidneys, proportional to the infective dose. Antibiotic treatments failed to eradicate <b>leptospires</b> that colonized the kidneys, although they were effective against L. interrogans if administered before or early after infection. To conclude, mice infected with bioluminescent L. interrogans proved to be a novel model to study both acute and chronic leptospirosis, and revealed that, in the kidneys, <b>leptospires</b> are protected from antibiotics. These bioluminescent <b>leptospires</b> represent a powerful new tool to challenge mice treated with drugs or vaccines, and test the survival, dissemination, and transmission of <b>leptospires</b> between environment and hosts...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{prospective}} study of leptospirosis and biodiversity of Leptospira in the Peruvian Amazon, a new Leptospira species was isolated from humans with acute febrile illness. Field trapping identified this <b>leptospire</b> in peridomestic rats (Rattus norvegicus, six isolates; R. rattus, two isolates) obtained in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas of the Iquitos region. Novelty of this species was proven by serological typing, 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. We have named this species ‘‘Leptospira licerasiae’ ’ serovar Varillal, and have determined that it is phylogenetically related to, but genetically distinct from, other intermediate Leptospira such as L. fainei and L. inadai. The type strain is serovar Varillal strain VAR 010 T, which has been deposited into internationally accessible culture collections. By microscopic agglutination test, ‘‘Leptospira licerasiae’ ’ serovar Varillal was antigenicall...|$|E
40|$|Bats {{have been}} implicated as {{potential}} carriers of Leptospira {{as a result}} of surveys, mostly in Australia and South America. We measured the prevalence of pathogenic leptospires in kidneys of bats from Kansas and Nebraska. From 7 August 2012 to 21 August 2012, we extracted DNA from kidneys of 98 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) submitted and found negative for rabies. The DNA was processed in a two-step, seminested PCR assay with a dual-labeled Taqman probe specific for pathogenic leptospires. As a negative control, we used a saprophytic <b>leptospire</b> (Leptospira biflexa Patoc) and, as a pathogenic control, Leptospira interrogans Canicola. All bat kidneys were negative for pathogenic leptospires, suggesting that {{it is unlikely that the}} big brown bat, one of the most prevalent bat species in North America, is a reservoir for transmission of leptospires to dogs or humans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Leptospira interrogans are {{bacterial}} pathogens {{of animal}} that cause zoonotic infections in human. Outer membrane proteins of <b>leptospire</b> {{are among the}} most effective antigens which can stimulate remarkable immune responses during the infection processes, and thus are currently considered leading candidate vaccine antigens. The objective of the present study is to predict and confirm major combined B and T cell epitopes of leptospiral outer membrane proteins OmpL 1 and LipL 41, as well as to evaluate their capacity in the induction of immune responses in BALB/c mice. Results In this study, four epitopes from OmpL 1 and four from LipL 41 conserved regions were evaluated for their potential utilization in <b>leptospire</b> vaccines. Firstly, combined B and T cell epitopes were predicted by softwares and expressed using a phage display system. OmpL 1 residues 87 - 98 and 173 - 191 (OmpL 1 87 - 98 and OmpL 1 173 - 191) and LipL 41 30 - 48, LipL 41 233 - 256 of LipL 41 were identified as immunodominant B cell epitopes by Western blot. Epitopes OmpL 1 173 - 191, OmpL 1 297 - 320 of OmpL 1 and LipL 41 233 - 256, LipL 41 263 - 282 of LipL 41 were identified as immunodominant CD 4 + T cell epitopes through proliferation analysis of splenocytes from recombinant OmpL 1 (rOmpL 1) or recombinant LipL 41 (rLipL 41) -immunized BALB/c (H- 2 d) mice. These epitopes induced responses of CD 4 + T cells and Th 1 (T helper cells) type cytokine responses during the infection. Conclusion This work identified combined T and B cell immunodominant epitopes in outer membrane proteins OmpL 1 and LipL 41 of Leptospira interrogans. OmpL 1 173 - 191 of OmpL 1 and LipL 41 233 - 256 of LipL 41 could be useful in a vaccine against Leptospira. The findings could also {{contribute to the development of}} effective cross-protective vaccine strategies for leptospirosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Leptospirosis {{is caused}} by {{pathogenic}} spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. The bacteria enter the human body via abraded skin or mucous membranes and may disseminate throughout. In general the clinical picture is mild but some patients develop rapidly progressive, severe disease with a high case fatality rate. Not much {{is known about the}} innate immune response to <b>leptospires</b> during haematogenous dissemination. Previous work showed that a human THP- 1 cell line recognized heat-killed <b>leptospires</b> and leptospiral LPS through TLR 2 instead of TLR 4. The LPS of virulent <b>leptospires</b> displayed a lower potency to trigger TNF production by THP- 1 cells compared to LPS of non-virulent <b>leptospires.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated the host response and killing of virulent and non-virulent Leptospira of different serovars by human THP- 1 cells, human PBMC's and human whole blood. Virulence of each leptospiral strain was tested in a well accepted standard guinea pig model. Virulent <b>leptospires</b> displayed complement resistance in human serum and whole blood while in-vitro attenuated non-virulent <b>leptospires</b> were rapidly killed in a complement dependent manner. In vitro stimulation of THP- 1 and PBMC's with heat-killed and living <b>leptospires</b> showed differential serovar and cell type dependence of cytokine induction. However, at low, physiological, leptospiral dose, living virulent complement resistant strains were consistently more potent in whole blood stimulations than the corresponding non-virulent complement sensitive strains. At higher dose living virulent and non-virulent <b>leptospires</b> were equipotent in whole blood. Inhibition of different TLRs indicated that both TLR 2 and TLR 4 as well as TLR 5 {{play a role in the}} whole blood cytokine response to living <b>leptospires.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Thus, in a minimally altered system as human whole blood, highly virulent Leptospira are potent inducers of the cytokine response...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{products}} of autolysis on Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona was investigated in bovine kidney tissues and urine inoculated with this organism. No viable <b>leptospires</b> were found at 24 h or subsequently after inoculation of kidney tissues or urine. <b>Leptospires</b> and their soluble antigens were rapidly destroyed in tissues stored at 20 degrees C {{and could not be}} detected by the fluorescent-antibody test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. On the other hand, <b>leptospires</b> were detectable by dark-field microscopy and fluorescent-antibody test 38 days after addition to urine. The rate of destruction proceeded less rapidly in tissues stored at 4 degrees C. Under the conditions of this study, soluble leptospiral antigen levels decreased less rapidly than did the number of detectable <b>leptospires.</b> Similarly, breakdown of <b>leptospires,</b> demonstrated by dark-field microscopy and fluorescent-antibody test, progressed during the first 5 days after inoculation of urine, when levels of soluble leptospiral antigen remained constant. Although the number of intact <b>leptospires</b> was markedly reduced after freezing of tissues at - 20 degrees C, soluble leptospiral antigen levels remained unaltered. Neither intact <b>leptospires</b> nor their soluble antigens were detected after preservation of tissues in Formalin. However, formolization of urine delayed the destruction of <b>leptospires</b> and increased the levels of soluble leptospiral antigen during at least the first 5 days after inoculation. These results indicate that assays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay should be useful for the detection of soluble leptospiral antigens in urine and in autolyzing tissues such as those taken from a bovine fetus aborted as a result of leptospiral infection...|$|R

40|$|Rats {{are known}} to be the most {{important}} reservoirs of Leptospira spp. However, the lep-tospiral dose and age at which rats become resistant to Leptospira infection are not yet wellelucidated. Aimed to characterize leptospirosis in rat pups, we found that suckling pups (4 -, 7 -, and 14 -day old) are susceptible to leptospires and resistance starts from the weaningage (23 -day old). Susceptibility of rat pups was also affected by the infecting dose of theorganisms. Jaundice, decrease in body weight, and neurological symptoms prior to mori-bundity was evident in infected suckling pups. However, 23 -day-old infected pups did notmanifest any pathological changes and were able to survive the infection similar to adultrats. Based on these results, we propose the suckling rat pup as a novel animal model ofhuman leptospirosis to investigate pathogenesis, development of host resistance, and themechanisms involved in rats becoming maintenance hosts for <b>leptospire...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Leptospirosis and {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal {{syndrome}} are public health problems in Croatia. Diagnosis and epidemiology of these diseases are complicated because these two diseases are sympatric in certain areas. We describe a natural dual infection of Puumala virus and a <b>leptospire</b> {{in a bank}} vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Hantaviruses, which {{are members of a}} genus within the family Bunyaviridae, can cause either of two human zoonoses: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). 1 Leptospirosis, also a zoonotic infection, is caused by pathogenic members of the bacterial genus Leptospira. 2 Both etiologic agents are rodent-borne and are maintained in persistently infected small ro-dents. Transmission from reservoir hosts to humans is pos-sible through inhalation of virus-contaminated aerosol of ro-dent excreta (hantaviruses) 1 or direct or indirect contact with contaminated environment (leptospira). 3 Farmers, soldiers, hunters, campers, hikers, veterinarians, and laboratory work...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 66 serovars of {{potentially}} pathogenic Leptospira species were examined by slot blot hybridization, and 57 of these serovars were classified in six DNA homology groups. In {{cases in which}} common serovars were studied, the results were in general agreement {{with the results of}} previous workers, who used different DNA homology methods. However, we propose a new species, Leptospira kirschneri, comprising the following serovars: bulgarica, butembo, cynopteri, dania, grippotyphosa, kabura, kambale, ramisi, and tsaratsovo. Seven of these serovars have not had their DNAs studied by other workers. Differentiation of strains within Leptospira species based upon variations in antigenic composition was introduced nearly 40 years ago. A total of 223 Leptospira serovars have been identified, and for convenience these serovars are grouped into 23 serogroups (10).

40|$|Leptospirosis is {{a global}} {{zoonotic}} disease. The causative agent, pathogenic Leptospira species, survives in the renal tubules of chronically infected hosts, from where <b>leptospires</b> are shed via urine into the environment. Infection of new hosts can present as an array of acute and chronic disease processes reflecting variations in host-pathogen interactions. The present {{study was designed to}} reproduce the carrier phase of infection in Rattus norvegicus, thus facilitating shedding of <b>leptospires</b> in urine. <b>Leptospires</b> shed in urine were collected for proteomic analysis because these organisms reflect a naturally virulent form of Leptospira associated with infection of new hosts. Experimentally infected rats remained clinically asymptomatic but shed <b>leptospires</b> in urine for several months at concentrations of up to 107 leptospires/ml of urine. Proteomic analysis of rat urine-isolated <b>leptospires</b> compared to in vitro-cultivated <b>leptospires</b> confirmed differential protein and antigen expression, as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Furthermore, while serum from chronically infected rats reacted with many antigens of in vitro-cultivated Leptospira, few antigens of rat urine-isolated Leptospira were reactive. Results confirm that differential protein expression by Leptospira during chronic infection facilitates its persistence {{in the presence of a}} specific host antibody response...|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} zoonoses in the world, and its most severe form in humans, "Weil's disease," may lead to jaundice, hemorrhage, renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome, and sometimes,fatal multiple organ failure. Although the mechanisms underlying jaundice in leptospirosis have been gradually unraveled, the pathophysiology and distribution of <b>leptospires</b> during the early stage of infection are not well understood. Therefore, we investigated the hamster leptospirosis model, which is the accepted animal model of human Weil's disease, by using an in vivo imaging system to observe the whole bodies of animals infected with Leptospira interrogans and to identify the colonization and growth sites of the <b>leptospires</b> during the early phase of infection. Hamsters, infected subcutaneously with 104 bioluminescent <b>leptospires,</b> were analyzed by in vivo imaging, organ culture, and microscopy. The results showed that the luminescence from the <b>leptospires</b> spread through each hamster's body sequentially. The luminescence was first detected at the injection site only, and finally spread to the central abdomen, in the liver area. Additionally, the luminescence observed in the adipose tissue was the earliest detectable compared with the other organs, indicating that the <b>leptospires</b> colonized the adipose tissue at the early stage of leptospirosis. Adipose tissue cultures of the <b>leptospires</b> became positive earlier than the blood cultures. Microscopic analysis revealed that the <b>leptospires</b> colonized the inner walls of the blood vessels in the adipose tissue. In conclusion, this is the first study to report that adipose tissue is an important colonization site for <b>leptospires,</b> as demonstrated by microscopy and culture analyses of adipose tissue in the hamster model of Weil's disease...|$|R
40|$|The lipid {{composition}} of five parasitic and six saprophytic <b>leptospires</b> was compared. Lipids comprise 18 to 26 % {{of the dry}} weight of the cells after chloroform-methanol extraction. No residual (bound) lipid was found after acid or alkaline hydrolysis of the extracted residue. The total lipid was composed of 60 to 70 % phospholipid, and the remaining lipid was free fatty acids. The phospholipid fraction contained phosphatidylethanolamine as the major component, and phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol were minor components with traces of lysophatidylethanolamine sometimes found. The major fatty acids of <b>leptospires</b> were hexadecanoic, hexadecenoic, and octadecenoic acids. Both the unusual cis- 11 -hexadecenoic acid and the more common cis- 9 -hexadecenoic acid were synthesized by the <b>leptospires.</b> Neither the parasitic nor the saprophytic <b>leptospires</b> can chain elongate fatty acids. However, they were capable of β-oxidation of fatty acids. Both groups of <b>leptospires</b> desaturate fatty acids by an aerobic pathway. When the parasite canicola was cultivated on octadecanoic acid, 87 % of the hexadecenoic acid was the 11 isomer, whereas the saprophyte semeranga consisted of 10 % of this isomer. In addition, the saprophytic <b>leptospires</b> contained more tetradecanoic acid than the parasites.
