40|$|International audienceogic {{trees have}} become a popular tool in seismic hazard studies. Commonly, the models {{corresponding}} to the end branches of the complete <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> in a probabalistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) are treated separately until the final calculation of the set of hazard curves. This comes at the price that information regarding sensitivities and uncertainties in the ground-motion sections of the <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> are only obtainable after disaggregation. Furthermore, from this end-branch model perspective even the designers of the <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> cannot directly tell what ground-motion scenarios most likely would result from their logic trees for a given earthquake at a particular distance, nor how uncertain these scenarios might be or how they {{would be affected by}} the choices of the hazard analyst. On the other hand, all this information is already implicitly present in the <b>logic</b> <b>tree.</b> Therefore, with the ground-motion perspective that we propose in the present article, we treat the ground-motion sections of a complete <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> for seismic hazard as a single composite model representing the complete state-of-knowledge-and-belief of a particular analyst on ground motion in a particular target region.

Quantiles of the composite model also provide an easy way to analyze the sensitivities and uncertainties related to a given logic-tree model.

Furthermore, archaeoseismology provides the opportunity to study past earthquakes in regions where limited instrumental and historical data are available. Therefore, this approach contributes to a regional assessment of seismic hazard. The increasing application and importance of archaeoseismology requires a comprehensive and systematic approach. The <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> methodology for archaeoseismology is an evaluation method which offers a standard procedure to identify and evaluate archaeoseismological information and to provide comparable values for seismic hazard assessment. This study tests the <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> methodology for archaeoseismology to Pınara to assess the city’s potential to have recorded earthquakes, and the methodology’s value. The ancient city of Pınara (SW Turkey, 500 BC– 900 AD) is situated in the Eşen basin in the southern extremity of the seismically active Fethiye-Burdur fault zone. The present seismic quiescence of the Eşen basin contradicts the geological and historical records which indicate that fault and earthquake activity must have been recurrent.

Pınara’s preferred end solution (Pes 1) of 0. 06 and the AQF of 0. 12 are obtained by the <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> method and reflect the high probability of recorded palaeoearthquakes in Pınara.

In this context, a <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> for ground-motion prediction in Europe has been constructed. Groundmotion prediction equations (GMPEs) and weights have been determined so that the <b>logic</b> <b>tree</b> captures epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion prediction for six di erent tectonic regimes in Europe. Here we present the strategy that we adopted to build such a <b>logic</b> <b>tree.</b> This strategy has the particularity of combining two complementary and independent approaches: expert judgment and data testing. A set of six experts was asked to weight pre-selected GMPEs while the ability of these GMPEs to predict available data was evaluated with the method of Scherbaum et al. (2009). Results of both approaches were taken into account to commonly select the smallest set of GMPEs to capture the uncertainty in ground-motion prediction in Europe. For stable continental regions, two models, both from Eastern North America, have been selected for shields and three GMPEs from active shallow crustal regions have been added for continental crust. For subduction zones, four models, all non-European have been chosen. Finally, for active shallow crustal regions, we selected four models, each of them from a di erent host region but only {{two of them were}} kept for long periods. In most cases, a common agreement has been also reached for the weights.
