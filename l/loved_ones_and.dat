5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E

The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of Singaporeans pre-booking niches at private crematoria, even though some people consider talking about death and pre-booking a final resting place inauspicious. Reasons for pre-booking include wanting one's ashes to be close to those of <b>loved</b> <b>ones,</b> <b>and</b> hedging against higher prices for niches in future. The bodies of foreigners (regardless of where they die) can be cremated in Singapore, but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria. There are also irregular instances of Singaporeans dying overseas, such as the 2015 accident surrounding Huang Lin Davina, a high-profile demise of a Singaporean abroad.|$|E

5|$|Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: Though at {{an early}} age he is deemed to have a below average IQ of 75, he has an endearing {{character}} and shows devotion to his <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> duties, character traits which bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Tom's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across the U.S. Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest (Michael Conner Humphreys) sit next to her. John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role, and admits passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role. Sean Penn stated in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after {{an hour and a half}} of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks agreed to take the role only on the condition that the film was historically accurate.|$|E

25|$|During {{the fall}} of Troy, Helen's role is ambiguous. In Virgil's Aeneid, Deiphobus gives an account of Helen's treacherous stance: when the Trojan Horse was {{admitted}} into the city, she feigned Bacchic rites, leading a chorus of Trojan women, and, holding a torch among them, she signaled to the Greeks from the city's central tower. In Odyssey, however, Homer narrates a different story: Helen circled the Horse three times, and she imitated {{the voices of the}} Greek women left behind at home—she thus tortured the men inside (including Odysseus and Menelaus) with the memory of their <b>loved</b> <b>ones,</b> <b>and</b> brought them to the brink of destruction.* Hughes, Helen of Troy, 220; Suzuki, Metamorphoses of Helen, 99–100.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Merkerson {{became the}} host of the show Find Our Missing which {{highlights}} the search for missing people of color. It is designed to put names and faces to people of color who have disappeared without a trace. Each episode {{tells the story of the}} missing person or persons, beginning with the day they vanished and the frantic searches by <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> investigators to find them. Find Our Missing provides insight into these victims’ lives–their hopes and dreams, what makes them tick, and how they have touched those around them—from the people who know them best. The episodes chronicle the investigations into their disappearances, and why the search for them so far has only turned up dead ends.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the First World War, the British (as well as {{continental}} European) {{tradition was}} to bury officers {{who died on}} the battlefield in individual graves and common soldiers in mass graves. The Great War changed this sentiment, {{as it was a}} total war, one in which nations engaged in the complete mobilization of all available resources, modes of production, and population in order to fight. Subsequently, as the war continued, there was a growing expectation among the people of the United Kingdom that foot soldiers as well as officers should not only be buried singly but commemorated. Many British families had already tried to visit the graves of <b>loved</b> <b>ones,</b> <b>and</b> could not locate them. Numerous letters appeared in newspapers decrying the problem, and Ware realized the British war effort was heading toward a public relations disaster. Ware, too, felt that the experience of war in the trenches was reducing socio-economic and class barriers. He firmly believed that British policy should be to treat all war dead alike, regardless of class or ability to pay. Wealthy families should not be able to repatriate their dead, inter remains privately in France, nor erect ornate memorials over their loved ones.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 18th and 19th centuries {{the belief in}} vampires was {{widespread}} in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. There are many documented cases of families disinterring <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> removing their hearts {{in the belief that}} the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term [...] "vampire" [...] was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease tuberculosis, or [...] "consumption" [...] as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations {{on the part of a}} dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old Mercy Brown, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death, cut out her heart and burned it to ashes.|$|E
500|$|The {{impact of}} 9/11 extends beyond {{geopolitics}} into {{society and culture}} in general. Immediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of flags. The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative or thematic elements in film, television, music and literature. Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected post-9/11 cultural concerns. [...] 9/11 conspiracy theories have become social phenomena, despite lack of support from expert scientists, engineers, and historians. 9/11 has also had {{a major impact on}} the religious faith of many individuals; for some it strengthened, to find consolation to cope with the loss of <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> overcome their grief; others started to question their faith or lost it entirely, because they could not reconcile it with their view of religion.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{consists}} of four stanzas, each with twelve lines. [...] Riley dedicated his poem [...] "to all the little ones," [...] which served as an introduction to draw the attention of his audience when read aloud. The alliteration, parallels, phonetic intensifiers and onomatopoeia add effects to the rhymes that become more detectable when read aloud. The exclamatory refrain ending each stanza is spoken with more emphasis. The poem is written {{in the first person}} and in a regular iambic meter. It begins by introducing Annie, and then sets a mood of excitement by describing the children eagerly gathering to hear her stories. The next three stanzas are each a story which Annie tells the children. Each story tells of a bad child who is snatched away by goblins and has an underlying moral which is announced in the final stanza, encouraging children to obey their parents and teachers, help their <b>loved</b> <b>ones,</b> <b>and</b> care for the poor and disadvantaged.|$|E

500|$|The Loogaroo is {{an example}} of how a vampire belief can result from a {{combination}} of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or voodoo. The term Loogaroo possibly comes from the French loup-garou (meaning 'werewolf') and is common in the culture of Mauritius. However, the stories of the Loogaroo are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States.
