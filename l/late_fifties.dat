5|$|Frank McLintock, a noted {{player for}} seven years for Leicester in a {{successful}} period from the <b>late</b> <b>Fifties</b> to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. City were relegated {{at the end of}} the 1977–78 season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in 1980. Unfortunately, Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down.|$|E

40|$|The {{changes to}} {{software}} are inevitable as new requirements emerge {{with the use}} of the software. The change is necessary in terms of correcting errors, improving the performance and reliability of the system. The changes corresponding to corrective, preventive, adaptive and perfective maintenance leads to evolution of software. Software product is an evolving entity which starts with an initial implementation of a set of requirements and from then onwards software undergoes frequent modifications generally for the purpose of increasing its functionality, performance or in order to adapt to a changed environment. Software evolution refers to the phenomenon of software change and growth. The environment where software has to operate changes over time and software itself must adapt to this changing environment. The software does not change by itself but changed by the development and maintenance teams. In this study the evolution of Mozilla Firefox Open Source Software (OSS) was analysed empirically on <b>latest</b> <b>fifty</b> versions. The applicability of Lehman’s Law of software evolution was investigated on Mozilla Firefox using different software metrics. The Resource Standard Metrics (RSM) software metrics tool was used to get the values of the size and complexity measures of the software. It is evident from the results of the study that the evolution of the Mozilla Firefox for the <b>latest</b> <b>fifty</b> versions was in accordance with Lehman’s laws of continuing change, increasing complexity, continuing growth and declining quality...|$|R

The second sums up the <b>latest</b> <b>fifty</b> years of planning in Italy, which is undergoing today a complex and innovatory change. The third examines some keywords relating to cities and metropolitan areas. They refer to the recent notion of "governo del territorio", which calls for a redefinition {{of the relationship between the}} technical-instrumental dimension of urbanism (design oriented and based on new structural and operational plans) and the socio-political dimension of planning, responsible for the coordination of new urban policies and governance processes.

25|$|The {{municipality}} {{also has}} a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this {{is dependent on the}} actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their <b>late</b> <b>fifties</b> or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around {{the same time as the}} People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.|$|E
25|$|The Fire Prevention Bureau was {{established}} in the early fifties, because of the increasing number of fires in homes and businesses, along with the city's Fire Prevention Week. Early functions of the Bureau included the Fire Prevention Parade and a contest to select Miss Flame, a beauty queen to reign over the weeks activities. All contestants in the competition were required to have red hair in the earlier years. The Fire Prevention Parade was held the first Monday in October, and a tradition that is carried on today since the fifties. Fire Departments from West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky participate annually in Huntington's Fire Prevention Parade. The Huntington Fire Department implemented the School Fire Patrol Program in the city in 1950. This programs said {{to be one of the}} oldest in the nation today.

25|$|Liquid {{crystals}} made of rod-like molecules {{had been}} discovered in 1888, and many compounds had been synthesized at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in the 1920s and 30s. Some physical studies had been undertaken by the German and Russian schools during that era, but the subject later languished till the mid-fifties. Starting in the <b>late</b> <b>fifties,</b> the systematic synthetic effort by George William Gray in the UK and the physical studies by Wilhelm Maier in Germany (including the well-known Maier–Saupe or MS theory) started {{a revival of the}} subject. Chandrasekhar and his co-workers made contributions to the application of the dynamical theory of reflections to study the fascinating optical properties of cholesteric liquid crystals which have a helical structure with a pitch which is usually ~ 0.5mm, and to the extensions of the molecular theory of nematic liquid crystals beyond the MS model. Chandrasekhar was invited to establish a liquid crystal laboratory in RRI after the Department of Science and Technology started supporting it in 1971. The move had a highly positive impact on his productivity. Along with a couple of former students who moved with him to RRI, in a short time, he developed a laboratory with all the essential facilities needed for research in the chosen area. Realizing that cutting-edge research would not be possible without an in-house capacity to produce new materials, a synthetic organic chemistry laboratory was set up. Soon many new experimental and a few theoretical results emerged and the Liquid Crystal Laboratory at RRI became one of the leading centres of research in the world. The twisted nematic liquid crystal display was invented in Europe in 1971 and recently, LCDs have displaced CRTs as commercially the most important displays. In cooperation with Chandrasekhar and his colleagues, the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore, developed indigenous know-how for the manufacture of simple LCDs for the domestic market.|$|E

500|$|Berry was {{religious}} {{as well as}} worldly, {{and collected}} relics as keenly as other types of objects. [...] By 1397 both of his sons had died, {{he was in his}} <b>late</b> <b>fifties,</b> and he had begun to think of his tomb, finally deciding to build a new [...] "Sainte Chapelle" [...] in his capital of Bourges to house it. [...] His collection of relics included objects claimed to be the wedding ring of the Virgin Mary, a cup used at the Wedding at Cana, a piece of the Burning Bush and many others. [...] However the provenance of the Holy Thorn, as well as its centrality to the Passion of Christ must have given it a special status. [...] The crown from which the thorn came had been bought in 1239 by Louis IX, both a saint and King of France, from the Latin Emperor in Constantinople, Baldwin II, along with a portion of the True Cross. [...] Both had been in Constantinople since the Muslim Conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century, and may very well be the same relics that Bishop Paulinus of Nola saw in Jerusalem in 409.

40|$|Current social {{problems}} are multiscale-order deficiencies, which cannot be fixed {{by the traditional}} hierarchical approach alone, by doing what we do better or more intensely, but rather by changing the way we do. As the experiences in the <b>latest</b> <b>fifty</b> years showed, unpredictable changes can be very disorienting at enterprise level. In a continuously changing operational environment, even if operational parameters cannot be closely pre-defined at system planning and design level, {{we need to be}} able to plan and to design self-organizing, self-regulating and self-adapting system quite easily anyway. Attempts to optimize hierarchical systems in the traditional top-down way will be less and less effective, and cannot be done in real time. In fact, current human made application and system can be quite fragile to unexpected perturbation because Statistics by itself can fool you, unfortunately. What Nassim Taleb has identified and calls "antifragility" is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish and proposes that systems be built in an antifragility manner. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragility gets better and better. To face the problem of social multiscale ontological uncertainty management we need application resilience and antifragility at system level first. No anticipation, no learning and no antifragility. With antifragility system homeostatic operating equilibria can emerge out of a self-organizing landscape of self-structuring attractor points. The present contribution offers an innovative and original solution proposal to the problem of social multiscale ontological uncertainty management. Due to its intrinsic self-scaling properties, this system approach can be applied at any system scale: from single quantum system to full system governance strategic assessment policies and beyond. The reason for this is the postulate that society is an arbitrary complex multiscale system of purposive actors within continuous change...|$|R

Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the <b>late</b> <b>Fifties</b> in a skyscraper and is about Big Business.
