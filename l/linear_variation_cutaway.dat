40|$|International audienceFerroelectric {{materials}} are interesting for their switching polarization and present a non <b>linear</b> <b>variation</b> of their permittivity which {{is due to}} domain wall motion. Currently, this variation of permittivity is described by the Rayleigh law for fields above a threshold field or by a power law in the case of soft ferroelectrics. In this study we propose a hyperbolic law based on domain wall motions and which includes these two classic approaches. The hyperbolic law allows to clearly define the threshold field by considering the reversible and irreversible components of the permittivity. All expressions are illustrated by the experimental data on hard ferroelectric thin films which present a <b>linear</b> <b>variation</b> of its permittivity at low field...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} OFDM peak {{to average}} power ratio (PAPR) reduction method using <b>linear</b> phase <b>variation</b> is proposed. Applying <b>linear</b> phase <b>variations</b> to subblocks of subcarriers {{is equal to}} cyclic shifting the corresponding time signals and thus can prevent “peak collisions”. This method differs from conventional partial transmit sequence (PTS) techniques in that PTS applies constant phase variations to subblocks. Performance comparison of <b>linear</b> phase <b>variation,</b> constant phase variation and tone reservation with {{the same number of}} redundant bits is conducted with 8, 52, and 128 -subcarrier QPSK-OFDM signals. <b>Linear</b> phase <b>variation</b> achieves the best PAPR reduction performance in our simulations. Exhaustive test in the 8 -subcarrier case when the subcarriers are partitioned into two equal-sized subblocks of consecutive subcarriers shows that all quaternary length 8 Golay sequences are selected with <b>linear</b> phase <b>variation</b> whereas 1 / 4 are selected for constant phase variation.

30|$|The {{additivity}} of {{the distortion}} {{due to the}} frequency selectivity and to the time variation of the channel can also be corroborated by concentrating in the SDR values for N = 211, where the power of both terms is similar. As seen, the difference between curve d, which assumes additivity, and curve e, which makes no assumption, is about 1.4 dB. However, this error is almost exclusively due to the <b>linear</b> <b>variation</b> approximation employed to obtain curve d. This can be verified just by noting that 1.4 dB is the error between curve a, which uses the <b>linear</b> <b>variation</b> approximation but {{in which there is}} only one distortion term, and curve b, which makes no approximation and which there is also only one distortion term.|$|R
40|$|Propagation {{of water}} waves in coastal zones is mainly {{affected}} by the influence of currents and bathymetry variations. Models describing wave propagation in coastal zones are often based on the numerical solution of theMild Slope equation (Kirby, 1984).

The present approach is based on the asymptotic expansion of the depth-integrated lagrangian, assuming the <b>linear</b> <b>variation</b> of the background currentwith depth.

Electromagnetic scattering problems involving conducting targets with arbitrary geometries, closed surfaces, and planar triangulations are considered. Specifically, two functions with <b>linear</b> <b>variations</b> along the triangulation edges in both tangential and normal directions (linear normal and linear tangential (LN-LT) type) are defined. They are compared to the previously employed divergence-conforming Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) and curl-conforming n̂ × RWG functions. Examples are presented to demonstrate the significant improvement in the accuracy of the MFIE and the CFIE gained by replacing the commonly used RWG functions with the LN-LT type functions.
