25|$|Based {{on these}} findings, Mabus {{considered}} a court-martial for Toussaint but ultimately decided against it, {{because of the}} amount of time that had passed between the incidents and the report, the previous review of the incidents and the short amount of time between Toussaint's return from an overseas deployment and the end of his enlistment. On October 21, the Navy announced that Toussaint would be reassigned to Naval Special Warfare Group 2 in Norfolk, Virginia where he would have no command responsibilities. He received a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b> His planned re-enlistment was denied and he was forced to retire in January 2010. Roughead has also ordered the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to re-examine the case. Sestak has called for Congressional hearings into the hazing allegations.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{separate}} trial, Captain Medina denied giving the orders {{that led to}} the massacre, and was acquitted of all charges, effectively negating the prosecution's theory of [...] "command responsibility", now referred to as the [...] "Medina standard". Several months after his acquittal, however, Medina admitted that he had suppressed evidence and had lied to Colonel Henderson about the number of civilian deaths. Captain Kotouc, an intelligence officer from 11th Brigade, was also court-martialed and found not guilty. Major General Koster was demoted to brigadier general and lost his position as the Superintendent of West Point.

6000|$|In 1718, {{the celebrated}} lawyer, Robert Dundas of Arniston, then King's Advocate, wrote a severe <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> to the Sheriff-depute of Caithness, {{in the first}} place, as having {{neglected}} to communicate officially certain precognitions which he had led respecting some recent practices of witchcraft in his county. The Advocate reminded this local judge that the duty of inferior magistrates, in such cases, was to advise with the King's Counsel, first, whether they should be made subject of a trial or not; and if so, before what court, and in what manner, it should take place. He also called the magistrate's attention to a report, that he, the Sheriff-depute, intended to judge in the case himself; [...] "a thing of too great difficulty to be tried without very deliberate advice, and beyond the jurisdiction of an inferior court." [...] The Sheriff-depute sends, with his apology, the precognition[83] of the affair, {{which is one of}} the most nonsensical in this nonsensical department of the law. A certain carpenter, named William Montgomery, was so infested with cats, which, as his servant-maid reported, [...] "spoke among themselves," [...] that he fell in a rage upon a party of these animals which had assembled in his house at irregular hours, and betwixt his Highland arms of knife, dirk, and broadsword, and his professional weapon of an axe, he made such a dispersion that they were quiet for the night. In consequence of his blows, two witches were said to have died. The case of a third, named Nin-Gilbert, was still more remarkable. Her leg being broken, the injured limb withered, pined, and finally fell off; on which the hag was enclosed in prison, where she also died; and the question which remained was, whether any process should be directed against persons whom, in her compelled confession, she had, as usual, informed against. The Lord Advocate, as may be supposed, quashed all further procedure.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This letter responds to allegations of improper conduct by senior Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) personnel in connection with an October 1997 retirement dinner for former FBI Assistant Director Larry Potts. The allegations asserted that a conference was scheduled at the FBI Training Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to provide a reason for senior FBI personnel to travel to Mr. Potts' retirement dinner in Arlington, Virginia, at government expense. GAO determined that the October 1997 FBI investigation of the alleged improper scheduling of a training conference was thorough. FBI and Justice Department investigators reviewed the actions of eight FBI Senior Executive Service (SES) employees. The FBI's Deputy Director issued <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> to three <b>of</b> the eight. Two individuals retired before receiving proposed <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b> The three remaining individuals were not disciplined because they either had attended both the training conference and the retirement dinner or had some other explanation for traveling to Washington, D. C. The FBI's Law Enforcement Ethics Unit did a study in September 1999 that concluded that a perception existed of a double standard in disciplining SES and non-SES employees. The travel cost to the government for individuals who attended the Potts retirement party was $ 3, 217. ...|$|R

5000|$|Historian López-Calderón, {{contemporary}} of Olivares, recounts several anecdotes {{representative of}} the battles between ambassador Olivares and Pope Pius V.

Olivares would not cease and the matter took larger proportions. The ambassador of France also protested against Olivares and the Pope sent him a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b> Olivares was received by the pope three times regarding this matter and grew more impatient every time. He replied that Spain was the largest and most powerful Catholic empire and contributed to Rome more than any other kingdom and demanded he be allowed to continue using the bell to call his servants. He finished his tirade by calling the pope [...] "vuestra ingratitud" [...] (your ingratitude) instead of [...] "vuestra beatitud" [...] (your piousness).|$|E
