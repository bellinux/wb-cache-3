5|$|Several older star {{players who}} were left unprotected, {{including}} Danny Tartabull, Jack Morris, and Shawon Dunston, were not selected due to their high salaries and advanced age.

The Rockies' payroll appeared to be $4 million, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> the Marlins would pay Bryan Harvey.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{treatment}} of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment {{not only on}} the team, but in the entire Bay Area community. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and was considered to be their single most important player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> some teams' third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league's top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000, which he said would make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams' agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse's offer was substantially <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season's first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did not want him, and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League.|$|E

5|$|No Code sold 366,500copies in {{its first}} week of release, topping the Billboard 200, but falling short of analysts' {{predictions}} of at least 535,000 copies. This was significantly <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> the band's previous two albums sold in their respective first weeks of release. It was, however, the seventh biggest-selling debut of what was a slow year for the industry. It stayed at number one for two weeks, and was Pearl Jam's last album to debut at {{number one on the}} album chart until Backspacer was released in 2009. No Code was the band's first album to not reach multi-platinum status, being certified platinum by the RIAA, and, as of 2013, has sold 1.75 millioncopies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|New {{research}} indicates that many white dwarfs—at least in certain types of galaxies—may not approach that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated {{that at least some}} of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the X-rays produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as standard candles in determining distances.|$|E
