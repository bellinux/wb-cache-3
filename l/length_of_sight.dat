A poet is no rattlebrain, saying what comes uppermost and, because he says everything, saying, at last, something good; but a heart in unison with his time and country. There is nothing whimsical and fantastic in his production, but sweet and sad earnest, freighted with the weightiest convictions, and pointed with the most determined aim which any man or class knows of in his times.|$|E

The first part represents the basic characteristics of the light as an electromagnetic wave acoording to the law of refraction. The second part presents the refraction as a measurement error, which shows up in geodetical measurements. The practical part presents the reading of the horizontal refraction, based on the field measurement. Our goal was to describe the influence under different circumstances, such as: the temperature, the distance <b>of</b> line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> from the object, the distance of the object from the instrument, and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> line <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> The object <b>of</b> our measurement was an automobile.

50|$|The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sighting</b> {{telescope}} seems remarkable, {{given the}} small size of the telescopes on modern instruments. This was likely Newton's choice of a way to reduce chromatic aberrations. Short-focal length telescopes, prior to the development of achromatic lenses, produced an objectionable degree of aberration, so much so that it could affect the perception of a star's position. Long focal lengths were the solution, and this telescope would likely have had both a long-focal length objective lens and a long-focal length eyepiece. This would decrease aberrations without excessive magnification.|$|R

40|$|I {{investigate}} statistical {{properties of}} one-dimensional {{fields in the}} universe such as the Lyα forest (Lyα absorptions in the quasar spectrum) and inverted line-of-sight densities. The Lyα forest has opened a great window for studying the large-scale structure of the universe, because it can probe the cosmic density field {{over a wide range}} of redshift at relatively high resolution, which has not been easily accessible with other types of observations. The power spectrum completely characterizes Gaussian random fields. However, because of gravitational clustering, the cosmic density field is already quite non-Gaussian on scales below 10 h⁻¹Mpc at redshift z = 3. I analyze the covariance of the one-dimensional mass power spectrum, which involves a fourth-order statistic, the trispectrum. The covariance indicates that Fourier modes in the cosmic density field are highly correlated and that the variance of the measured one-dimensional mass power spectrum is much higher than the expectation for Gaussian random fields. It is found that rare high-density structures contribute significantly to the covariance. The window function due to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> introduces additional correlations between different Fourier modes. In practice, one observes quasar spectra instead of one-dimensional density fields. As such, flux power spectrum has been the basis of many works. I show that the nonlinear transform between density and flux quenches the fluctuations so that the flux power spectrum is less sensitive to cosmological parameters than the one-dimensional mass power spectrum. The covariance of the flux power spectrum is nearly Gaussian, which suggests that higher-order statistics may be less effective for the flux. Finally, I provide a method for inverting Lyα forests and obtaining line-of-sight densities, so that statistics can be measured from one-dimensional density fields directly...|$|R

5000|$|SLRs {{could be}} {{modified}} at unit level {{to take two}} additional sighting systems. The first was the [...] "Hythe sight," [...] formally known as the [...] "Conversion Kit, 7.62mm Rifle Sight, Trilux, L5A1" [...] (L5A2 and L5A3 variants with different foresight inserts also existed) and intended for use in close range and in poor lighting conditions. The sight incorporated two rear sight aperture leaves and a permanently glowing tritium foresight insert for improved night visibility, {{which had to be}} replaced after a period of time due to radioactive decay. The first rear sight leaf had a 7 mm aperture which could be used alone for night shooting or the second leaf could be raised in front of it, superimposing a 2 mm aperture for day shooting. The second sight was the L2A1 [...] "Sight Unit, Infantry, Trilux" [...] (SUIT), a 4× optical sight which mounted on a rail welded to a top cover. Issued to the British Infantry, Royal Marines and RAF Regiment, the SUIT featured a prismatic offset design, which reduced the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sight</b> and improved clearance around the action. Also, the SUIT helped to reduce parallax errors and heat mirage from the barrel as it heated up during firing. The aiming mark was an inverted, tapered perspex pillar ending in a point which could be illuminated by a tritium element for use in low light conditions. The inverted sight post allowed rapid target re-acquisition after the recoil of the firearm raised the muzzle. The scope was somewhat heavy, but due to its solid construction was durable and robust.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of structure in rotation measure (RM) {{across the sky}} based on the RM catalog of Taylor et al. (2009) is presented. Several resolved RM structures are identified with structure in the local ISM, including radio loops I, II, and III, the Gum nebula, and the Orion-Eridanus super bubble. Structure functions (SFs) of RM are presented for selected areas, and maps of SF amplitude and slope across the sky are compared with H-alpha intensity and diffuse polarized intensity. RM variance on an angular scale of 1 degree is correlated with <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> through the Galaxy, with a contribution from local structures. The slope of the SFs is less concentrated to the Galactic plane and less correlated with <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> through the Galaxy, suggesting a more local origin for RM structure on angular scales ~ 10 degrees. The RM variance is a factor ~ 2 higher towards the SGP than towards the NGP, reflecting a more wide-spread asymmetry between {{the northern and southern}} Galactic hemispheres. Depolarization of diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission at latitudes < 30 degrees can be explained largely by Faraday dispersion related to small-scale variance in RM, but the errors allow a significant contribution from differential Faraday rotation along the line <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 14 figures.

To better understand potential attributes that may affect the trajectory of the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> constructs, I take a social cognitive approach to suggest five potential moderators (i. e., locus of control, interaction quality, valence, learning goal orientation, self-efficacy) based on the five core concepts of social cognitive theory (i. e., agency, observational learning, valued outcomes, goals, self-efficacy). Additionally, I propose a potential trajectory for behavioral alignment, based on a theory of change momentum; and, I examine the potential moderating effects of learning on the behavioral alignment trajectory. I also examine a potential pathway in which line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions mediate the relationship between line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives and behavioral alignment with the same five social cognitive facets as proposed moderators.
