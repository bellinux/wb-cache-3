For a p-fold cover M → S^ 3, branched over a hyperbolic link L, we assign the complexity p Vol(S^ 3 minus L) (where Vol is the hyperbolic volume). We define an invariant of 3 -manifolds, called the <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> and denoted LV, that assigns to a 3 -manifold M the infimum {{of the complexities}} of all possible covers M → S^ 3, where the only constraint is that the branch set is a hyperbolic link.

The problem of finding a set of travel plans which realizes a set of CDR trajectories and {{is consistent with a}} set of <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> counts is rephrased in terms of calibrating a choice model.

40|$|At present, in practice, most traffic {{assignment}} tasks are performed by using deterministic network (DN) models, which {{assume that the}} link travel time is uniquely determined by the <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> and link capacity. In reality, for the same <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> and link capacity, a link may have different travel times. However, the corresponding stochastic network (SN) models are not widely used because {{they are much more}} computationally complex than the DN models. In the past research, it was shown that in the important particular case, when the link travel time follows Gamma distribution, the {{traffic assignment}} problem for SN can be reformulated in terms of deterministic equivalent link disutility function. Thus in this case the traffic assignment can be solved by the standard Frank-Wolfe algorithm. In this paper, we show that a similar equivalent link disutility function exists in the general case of an arbitrary distribution of link travel time.

40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} traffic lights on traffic flow using ordinary differential equation (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE) models. I consider several different cases. First, I assume constant inflow and outflow of traffic on a single link with a traffic light at one end. This model allows the traffic volume to increase without limit. Then, I consider cases where the <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> is limited on a single link without traffic light, a one-link system with a traffic light, and a two-link system with a traffic light. I compare these ODE models to a PDE model. Both ODE and PDE models {{are found to be}} able to adequately predict whether the link(s) would jam, given information on inflow and red/green light length. The ODE models provide overall information such as <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> at any time and time of jamming, while the PDE model is better at showing detailed situations at specific locations of the link(s), such as the jam length, when and where the waiting queue will be cleared and cars released can catch up with the previous line of cars.

40|$|Most {{research}} and applications of network equilibrium models {{are based on}} the assumption that traffic volumes on roadways are virtually certain to be at or near their equilibrium values if the equilibrium volumes exist and are unique. However, it has long been known that this assumption can be violated in deterministic models. This paper presents an investigation of the stability of stochastic equilibrium in a two-link network. The stability of deterministic equilibrium also is discussed briefly. Equilibrium is defined to be stable if it is unique and the <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> converge over time to their equilibrium values regardless of the initial conditions. Three models of route choice decision-making over time are formulated, and the stability of equilibrium is investigated for each. It is shown that even when equilibrium is unique, <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> may converge to their equilibrium values, oscillate about equilibrium perpetually, or converge to values that may be considerably different from the equilibrium ones, depending on the details of the route choice decision-making process. Moreover, even when convergence of <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> to equilibrium is assured, the convergence may be too slow to justify the standard assumption that these volumes are usually at or near their equilibrium values. When <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> converge to non-equilibrium values, the levels at which the volumes stabilize typically depend on the initial <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> or perceptions of travel costs. Conditions sufficient to assure convergence to equilibrium in two of the three models of route choice decision-making are presented, and these conditions are interpreted in terms of the route choice decision-making process. ...|$|R

40|$|On {{simulating}} {{an existing}} highway network, traffic engineers and planners use existing traffic counts {{which may be}} collected during different times and days. On simulating a future highway network, they use future intersection volumes post-processed from projected counts or travel demand models. For both cases, an up <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> is usually not balanced with a down <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> in a highway network. To have more reasonable traffic operation simulation results, we should use mathematical techniques for balancing all intersection up link and down link volumes, {{as well as an}} intersection arrival and departure volumes. This presentation introduces two different techniques of balancing intersection volumes in a highway network – a successive link averaging with doubly constraint origin-destination balancing technique and VISUM T-Flow Fuzzy technique. Using intersection level doubly constraint origin-destination balancing technique, we may lose the balance in volumes between up and down links in the highway network. Therefore, both link level volume balancing by successive averaging and intersection level volume balancing using doubly constraint will need to be run concurrently and iteratively until the system reaches its defined convergence criteria. T-Flow Fuzzy technique in VISUM travel demand modeling software is also introduced and compared in resolving the balancing issue. Statistical analyses of goodness of fit are used to compare the balanced intersection volumes with the unbalanced ones by both techniques. The successive averaging with doubly constraint O-D balancing technique shows better statistical fit to the unbalanced volumes than the T-Flow Fuzzy. This method also keeps the total of the balanced volumes in network {{the same as that of}} unbalanced volume, not losing volumes like T-flow Fuzzy technique. A balanced network with more reasonable intersection volumes will provide engineers, planners and policy makers more confidence in network operational or simulation results...|$|E
40|$|This paper formulates {{the problem}} of finding the most likely {{distribution}} of origin-destination (O-D) specific <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> (called "link uses") from equilibrium assignment. Although an equilibrium assignment is unique in terms of aggregate <b>link</b> <b>volumes,</b> trips between different O-D pairs assigned to alternative paths between any node pair can be swapped among these paths such that total <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> remain unchanged. Alternative link uses that yield identical aggregate <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> can affect O-D specific estimates of fuel consumption, pollution emissions or development impacts. Equilibrium assignments found by methods of linear combinations, such as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, may not represent most likely link uses. The problem of finding maximum entropy link uses (MELU) formulated herein is a multi-commodity optimum flow (max-flow at min-cost) problem with nonlinear flow-dependent link use costs. MELU does not require path enumeration or knowledge of used paths between zones, but it is NP-hard to solve and very sizable for large networks. An approximate solution technique is presented that finds likely link uses for realistic size problems. The method is to linearly combine successive F-W solutions using step sizes that seek a maximum entropy mix. The examples include other comparisons of trial link uses that indicate {{the extent to which}} they differ. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a simple transit ridership estimation model system for short-range planning. The main feature of the model system is that it exploits knowledge of transit <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> which are obtained readily from on-off counts. Extensive use is made of default values for model parameters, taken directly from the transportation literature. The remaining parameters can be derived easily from generally available land-use and socioeconomic data. Expensive household surveys and time-consuming model calibrations are not required. A sequence of simple trip generation, trip distribution and modal split models generate trip-purpose specific transit trip tables, denoted as "trial" trip tables. These trip tables and observed transit <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> are used in a linear programming model which serves as a correction mechanism. The gain in accuracy is achieved by using the ridership information contained in the transit <b>link</b> <b>volumes.</b> The corrected trip tables may be used in a pivot-point analysis to estimate changes in ridership and revenue. The results of a test application of the model system indicate that it can generate accurate ridership estimates when reliable transit <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> are available from on-off counts, and when the trial transit trip tables as derived from the first three component models are reasonably accurate. ...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of motorists' {{origin-destination}} (OD) {{travel information}} {{is necessary for}} a wide range of transportation planning activities. The high cost of manpower and other expenses associated with conventional survey techniques for OD estimation have motivated the development of models that can inexpensively estimate these flows from easily available traffic link volumes. In this paper, we develop an approach for synthesizing these OD flows based on only a partial set of <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> information. This consideration introduces nonlinearities in the cost function of the model because of the dependence of link travel costs on link volumes, and requires the determination of a fixed-point (rather than an optimal) solution to the proposed model. Such a fixed point is determined heuristically by iteratively approximating the nonlinear model using a sequence of linear programs. Computational results on three sample networks from the literature are presented to evaluate the method and to provide insights into its performance relative to some maximum entropy and bilevel programming approaches. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} nonproportional-assignment, user-equilibrium motivated, linear {{programming}} model for estimating origin-destination (O-D) trip tables from available data on link traffic volumes. The model {{is designed to}} determine a traffic equilibrium network flow solution that reproduces the <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> data, if such a solution exists. However, it recognizes that due to incomplete information, the traffic may not conform to an equilibrium flow pattern, and moreover, there might be inconsistencies in the observed link flow data. Accordingly, the model permits violations in the equilibrium conditions as well as deviations from the observed link flows but at suitable incurred penalties in the objective function. A column generation solution technique is presented to optimally solve the problem. This methodology is extended {{to the situation in}} which a specified prior target trip table is available and one is required to find a solution that also has a tendency to match this table as closely as possible. Implementation strategies are discussed and the proposed method is illustrated using some sample test networks from the literature. ...|$|E

Next, we adjusted the regional O-D matrices excluding TCS O-D matrices in order to reflect the observed volumes considering the express bus and the assigned <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> as additional ones. The assigned volumes with the estimated traffic-zonal O-D matrices produced the only 17. 9 % error all over the freeways when they were compared to the real traffic volumes and the difference between assigned <b>link</b> <b>volumes</b> and counted ones is reduced very much all over the counted links...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} travel {{on a network}} is usually rep-resented by an {{origin-destination}} (OD) trip table or matrix. OD trip tables are typically estimated with synthetic techniques that use observed data from the traffic system, such as <b>link</b> <b>volume</b> counts from intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as input. A potential problem with current estimation tech-niques is that many ITS volume counters have a rel-atively high error rate. The focus {{of this paper is}} on the development of estimators explicitly designed to be robust to outliers typically encountered in ITS. Equally important, standard errors are devel-oped so that the parameter reliability can be quantified. This paper first presents a constrained robust method for estimating OD split proportions, which are used to identify the trip table, for a network. The proposed approach is based on a recently developed statistical procedure known in the liter-ature as the L 2 error (L 2 E). Subsequently, a closed-form solution for calculating the asymptotic variance associated with the multivariate estimator is derived. Because the solution is closed form, the computation time is significantly reduced as com-pared with computer-intensive standard error cal-culation methods (e. g., bootstrap methods), an...|$|E

The popular DNL models widely used in literature of DTA are Point-Queue (PQ) and Linear Travel Time (LTT) models because they fulfil of all the required desirable properties and require lesser computational cost.

40|$|Cheu et al. 2 Abstract: Most traffic {{assignment}} tasks in practice are performed by using deterministic network (DN) models, which {{assume that the}} link travel time is uniquely determined by a link performance function. In reality, link travel time, at a given <b>link</b> <b>volume,</b> is a random variable. Such stochastic network (SN) models are not widely used because the stochastic {{traffic assignment}} algorithms are relatively more difficult to understand by practitioners. In this paper, we derive an equivalent link disutility (ELD) function, for the case of risk averse drivers in a SN, without assuming any distribution of link travel time. We further derive a simpler form of the ELD function in a SN which can be easily implemented in deterministic user equilibrium traffic assignment algorithms like a DN. By comparing our two derived ELD functions, the bound of the coefficient of the simpler ELD functions is obtained, so that drivers will make the same risk averse route choice decisions. A method to estimate the coefficient of the simpler ELD function has been proposed and demonstrated with questionnaire survey data gathered in El Paso, Texas. The results of user equilibrium traffic assignments in a test network using the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) function and the simpler ELD function are then compared. Our simpler EL...|$|E
