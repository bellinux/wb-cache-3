500|$|Several {{journalists and}} singers have made public {{their views on}} the song and the result. Irish entrant and three-time winner of Eurovision Johnny Logan complimented Tyler, but argued that the song wasn't strong enough. He continued, [...] "If you're going to win Eurovision, to go through some of the {{incredible}} voting I've noticed over the last few years, you have to have something that's going to stand out above everything else. Otherwise you're just going to hope to pick up 10 or 11 votes." [...] Similarly, Nathan Moore agreed that the song was not strong enough, but said [...] "It was a great idea to get Bonnie involved, there's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> for Bonnie out there." [...] Mick Dalley (of Yahoo! News) agreed that [...] "although Tyler herself was on form, singing beautifully and rousing the crowd with her podiumed finale, [...] "Believe in Me" [...] was simply not good enough as a song".|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E

Bose told a writer from Inside Soap that his character is a [...] "serial monogamist" [...] and [...] "has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> to give". Ivan is the opposite and he has [...] "been cracking on to all {{the girls in the}} village and Paul can't relate to that". His bisexuality and secretive nature becomes an issue for Paul; Ivan cannot offer Paul [...] "100 per cent – physically, emotionally or spiritually, no matter how much they like each other". Paul attempts {{to come to terms with}} the situation and tries to dump him. The next time they are around each other they struggle to keep their flirtation hidden. Bose added that Ivan still [...] "wants to do everything on the quiet", which is a [...] "real hardship" [...] for Paul.

500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters.

[...] PlayStation Universe also chose Claire in her original outfit from Resident Evil 2 as one of the five characters they wanted to appear in Resident Evil 6s Mercenaries mode as she [...] "is long overdue a canonical appearance in the series." [...] In 2012, RE6 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi wrote they have [...] "heard a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> for Jill and Claire recently and people asking if they’ll be in the next Resident Evil." [...] Including Claire among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history, GamesRadar staff commented in 2013: [...] "Sadly she's fallen into the background of the series, which makes sense she avoided work as a government zombie hunter, but we hope Capcom has plans for her in the future. Here's a suggestion: a co-op focused RE that teams Claire up with the almost as underused Jill. It's your move Capcom." [...] Reacting to Claire's return in Revelations 2 IGN's Mitch Dyer wrote: [...] "The Resident Evil series places women in prominent, powerful, playable roles. Jill Valentine, Rebecca Chambers, Sheva Alomar, and Ada Wong, to name a few. Still, they're often opposite a male lead. This is the first time a Resident Evil game has revolved around the story of two women. It's fun to get to play as Claire again." [...] According to a CVG preview of Revelations 2, [...] "she's older, calmer and more capable, but she still retains everything that made her compelling in the first place. Where Rachael from the first [...] was part centrefold, part melted-ice cream, Claire feels distinct from many women in the Resi universe in that there's more to her than lady-lumps and lycra. She's the perfect choice for the game's brand of isolated horror." ...|$|E
