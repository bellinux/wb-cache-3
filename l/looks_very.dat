5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> {{much like}} a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' is tied to and the nearly identical performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E
5|$|To further {{add to his}} confusion, he {{encountered}} a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> similar to the Key West Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor's team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for {{what he thought was}} west, but in reality was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the hands and arms (remiges) and tail (rectrices), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated bumps on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> much like Archaeopteryx.|$|E

5|$|At the {{dormitory}} lives an energetic first-year student named Yukari Kamioka. She {{is on the}} track and field team along with Mariya, who is her , and has low confidence in her ability to run. Another first-year at {{the dormitory}} named Kana Suoin meets Mizuho {{on the day he}} moves in, and soon after Mizuho becomes her Oneesama. Kana is more than happy to serve Mizuho any way she can, since she admires him immensely. A hyperactive ghost resides in Mizuho's room named Ichiko Takashima and is shown to speak very fast when excited. She says that Mizuho <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> much like her previous Elder love interest, who turns out to be Mizuho's deceased mother. The student council president at Seio is Takako Itsukushima who tends to have a serious personality.|$|E
5|$|The second {{elliptical}} {{building was}} built on top foundations of the first, and although the architect must {{have been aware of}} the exact layout of the previous building, the design of the second was slightly modified. Although the it <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> similar to the first, it used different diameters of arc to achieve a slightly 'fatter' design. The second 'elliptical' building was not constructed until about AD 220, and this was confirmed by a coin of Emperor Elagabalus under one of the pavement slabs. It is thought that the second building may have survived until the end of Roman rule and influence in Britain.|$|E
5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry, after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E
60|$|The {{other one}} {{sat on a}} tuft of grass, eating {{something}} that <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> nice; but, all of a sudden, she dropped her bowl, and ran away, <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> much frightened.|$|R

5|$|Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator, dreams of being interviewed {{by a woman}} off-camera, where he reveals that he is 90 years old, and that unlike other vampires, he has {{standards}} and does not hunt women, children or innocents. Mick's job leads him {{to the scene of}} the murder of a young woman, where Beth, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, notices two large puncture wounds on the woman's neck. While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> familiar, but he insists that they do not know each other. Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death. Mick then comes across Beth at the dead woman's apartment, where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside.|$|E

25|$|The girls team is {{also very}} strong with respectable {{finishes}} at the Canadian Henley in both 2004 and 2005. The girls varsity 8+ <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> promising for the Detroit Boat Club.

25|$|According to Dina Krishna Joshi, {{the word}} may have {{origins in the}} tribal word Kittung of the Sora people (Savaras). This {{hypothesis}} states that the Vedic people as they settled into tribal regions adopted the tribal words and called the deity Jagannath. According to O.M. Starza, this is unlikely because Kittung is phonetically unrelated, and the Kittung tribal deity is produced from burnt wood and <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> different from Jagannath.|$|E

25|$|Pearce's {{formulation}} <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> {{different from}} the original definition of a stable model. Instead of reducts, it refers to equilibrium logic— a system of nonmonotonic logic based on Kripke models. Ferraris's formulation, on the other hand, is based on reducts, although the process of constructing the reduct that it uses differs from the one described above. The two approaches to defining stable models for sets of propositional formulas are equivalent to each other.|$|E
25|$|The citrus {{mealybug}} <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> {{similar to the}} vine mealybug (Planococcus ficus), and the two species are mainly distinguished by the arrangement of pores and tubular ducts on the tiny body of the female. This similarity can pose a problem in agriculture. For example, when growers are ready to attempt biological pest control of either mealybug, the use of molecular analysis is recommended to confirm {{the identity of the}} species so an appropriate parasitoid can be employed.|$|E
25|$|From a distance, the BWR design <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> {{different}} from PWR designs because usually a square building {{is used for}} containment. Also, because {{there is only one}} loop through the turbines and reactor, and the steam going through the turbines is also slightly radioactive, the turbine building has to be considerably shielded as well. This leads to two buildings of similar construction with the taller one housing the reactor and the short long one housing the turbine hall and supporting structures.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{definition}} of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions? This is especially interesting for matrices over rings. Indeed, algorithms with run-time proportional to n4 exist. An algorithm of Mahajan and Vinay, and Berkowitz is based on closed ordered walks (short clow). It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently. The final algorithm <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> much like an iterated product of triangular matrices.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} comment in the Press box {{as to the}} {{legitimacy}} of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated {{a considerable amount of}} pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it is something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.|$|E
25|$|The Mercedes-Benz OH and Hino RG {{air-conditioned}} buses {{are painted}} red and yellow, {{with a picture}} of a young brahminy kite, which <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> similar to a bald eagle grasping a tree branch with three snakefruit on it. The buses use special fuel which is (a mix of diesel and biodiesel). For Corridor 2 (bus colors: blue and white) and 3 (bus colors: yellow and red), the buses are CNG-fueled Daewoo buses imported from South Korea. Due to various coachbuilders being involved and design tweaks applied over time, the exterior and interior appearance, quality, and comfort varies between buses operating in the same corridor.|$|E
