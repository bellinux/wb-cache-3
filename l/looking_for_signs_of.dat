25|$|Coastal Command Spitfires and Lockheed Hudsons of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit {{flew from}} Norway to the Spanish border to {{photograph}} German-occupied ports, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> invasion preparations. Nothing was revealed {{until the second}} week of August, when accumulations of barges were found and interpreted as an invasion preparation. In the meantime, Bomber Command sent its bombers nightly against the German ports, aircraft industry and airfields when unable to bomb the primary target. The Blenheims of 2 Group made daylight attacks on airfields occupied by the Luftwaffe. In July ports and shipping were made the priority target but until the ports filled with invasion craft in August, Bomber Command continued to attack industry and Luftwaffe ground facilities. The Germans had 400 airfields available and dispersed aircraft around them, making bombing ineffectual. These targets were defended by large concentrations of anti-aircraft artillery, making ground strafing too risky. The Blenheims were vulnerable to fighter attack and the crews had orders to abandon raids unless there was 7/10ths cloud {{and by the end of}} June, 90 percent of sorties were cancelled. The Blenheims—with some Fairey Battles returned from France—began to fly on moonlit nights. In July 1940, Bomber Command lost 72 aircraft carrying out these operations.|$|E

Derby finished fourth in 1969–70, and then strengthened again from a player Taylor had scouted, signing midfielder Archie Gemmill from Preston North End for £64,000. Most signings involved scouting from Taylor, with the only two transfers he had played no part in being Clough's former Sunderland teammates Colin Todd and John O'Hare. Following a ninth-place finish in 1970–71, Derby {{went on to win}} the League Championship in 1971–72 – the first in the club's history. Clough and Taylor continued to strengthen the club in the transfer market however, with Taylor noting that [...] "a manager should always be <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> disintegration in a winning side and then sell the players responsible before their deterioration is noticed by possible buyers".|$|E

The last British troops departed from Lancashire Landing around 04:00 on 8 January 1916. The Newfoundland Regiment was part of the rearguard and withdrew on 9 January 1916.

2500|$|On 3 May, British {{aircraft}} were detailed {{for special}} counter-attack reconnaissance, after {{the experience of}} the new German tactics of lightly holding the front line and counter-attacking with reserves and Eingreif divisions. The British aircraft flew low over the battlefield behind captured positions, from dawn to nightfall <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> German counter-attacks, to report them immediately to the British artillery. Bombardments from both sides and infantry attacks and counter-attacks, made the battlefield so chaotic that observers were not able to see clearly, except for those of 43 Squadron, who saw German troops massing opposite the XIII Corps front. Five Sopwith 1½ Strutters were sent from the squadron to attack the German infantry and machine-gunned them from low-altitude attacks on other bodies of troops were carried out in the afternoon. Tactical bombing took place, with attacks on the stations at Don, Busigny Junction, Brebières and the aerodrome at Eswars. After dark bombing continued on trains and three were hit by low-level attacks of the night-bombing specialists of 100 Squadron, along with railway junctions and Tourmignies airfield.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi was {{extremely}} unhappy {{with his life}} as a virtual prisoner in the Salt Tax Palace, and his moods became erratic, swinging from hours of passivity staring into space to indulging his sadism by having his servants beaten. The fact {{that the vast majority of}} Puyi's [...] "loving subjects" [...] hated him obsessed Puyi, and as Behr observed it was [...] "...the knowledge that he was an object of hatred and derision that drove Puyi to the brink of madness." [...] Puyi always had a strong cruel streak, and he imposed harsh [...] "house rules" [...] on his staff; servants were flogged in the basement for such offenses as [...] "irresponsible conversations". The phrase [...] "Take him downstairs" [...] was much feared by Puyi's servants as he had at least one flogging performed a day, and everyone in the Salt Tax Palace was caned at one point or another except for the Empress and Puyi's siblings and their spouses.

On the way they had to cross a ravine which lately had been full of water, but now was quite dry. The weavers, however, were accustomed to swim over this ravine; therefore, regardless of the fact that this time it was dry, they stripped, and, tying their clothes on their heads, they proceeded to swim across the dry sand and rocks that formed the bed of the ravine. Thus they got to the other side without further damage than bruised knees and elbows, and {{as soon as they were}} over, one of them began to count the party to make sure that all were safe there. He counted all except himself, and then cried out that somebody was missing! This set each of them counting; but each made the same mistake of counting all except himself, so that they became certain that one of their party was missing! They ran up and down the bank of the ravine wringing their hands in great distress and <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> their lost comrade.
