40|$|Abstract: Fungal biofilters attain higher toluene {{elimination}} rates {{compared to}} bacterial systems. However, strong mycelia growth can cause clogging. In the present work, toluene biofiltration with the fungus Paecilomyces variotii CBS 115145 was tested with two rigid packing materials that allow high mycelia growth. The reactor had two 4. 25 <b>L</b> <b>sections,</b> each packed with ceramic Raschig rings differing in water retention capacity and internal porosity. After optimizing nutrient solution delivery, an overall maximum elimination capacity of 245 g/m 3 /h was obtained. Higher elimination capacity � 290 g/m 3 /h � {{was measured in}} the ceramic ring with lower water content, indicating the interest of such packing material for treating hydrophobic pollutants in fungal biofilters. Additional experiments with this support in a 2 L biofilter showed bacterial contamination, but the fungal activity was responsible for about 70 % of the total removal. The support with less humidity showed greater aerial growth, which possibly improves removal efficiency by favoring the direct transfer of pollutants from the gas phase to the microorganism...|$|E

It is motivated by an increasing use or even the prevalent use of both the introduction and <b>L</b> <b>sections</b> in the opening phase of empirical research articles in many disciplines {{and the lack of}} systematic genre-based investigation of introductions with a following L section. Based on a detailed examination of 30 introductions with a subsequent L section in Applied Linguistics, this study found that they generally can be classified into two categories according to their communicative functions and structures. They are the traditional CARS type that largely follows the classic “Create a Research Space ” (CARS) model and the innovative Two-move Orientation type. Some featured elements used in the introductions with a subsequent L are identified and the “Two-move Orientation ” approach is formulated for the rhetorical structure of this new type of introductions. The interesting links between introduction and L are also suggested. The study contributes {{to our understanding of the}} structure and function of this important part-genre in a new generic context (that is, introductions being followed by an independent L section) and illuminates the current genre-based teaching of introduction writing...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{intends to}} analyse the {{different}} attitudes of residents {{in urban areas}} in regard to annoyance induced by traffic noise, account taken {{of the effects of}} the street configuration and of the presence of specific public transport modes in the definition of the dose-response curves. People's annoyance was investigated through a campaign of noise and traffic measurements and an epidemiological survey, administered to a sample of 830 residents in the buildings close to the measurement points. An ordinal regression model taking into account environmental and urban characteristics was used to identify a dose-response relationship. The cumulative probabilities allowed to define two cut points on the dose-response curves (60 and 75 dB(A)), grouping people in three classes and making the representation of the dose-response relationships different from those traditionally defined that use only the percentage of highly annoyed people. The results show different people's attitudes towards the annoyance in the urban sites while the dose-response relationship shows that the correlation between annoyance and noise is low. For the same value of day equivalent level, 10 % more people are annoyed in <b>L</b> <b>sections</b> (broad streets) than in U sections (narrow streets). Furthermore, all the dose-response curves show a higher sensitivity of people living in L sections; this difference can be measured as a shift of about 4 dB(A). Noise levels are, arguably, a useful indicator, but they are not reliable enough to define the discomfort of the residents, while the site characteristics could shed light on annoyance variabilit...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{is made of}} different submerged arc welding processes, that is ones using singlewire, twin-wire and triple-wire electrodes, applied to welding of two webs consisting of <b>L</b> <b>sections</b> 16 x 90 x 4100 mm in size. Experimental welding, measurement of welding parameters, calculation of the melting rate, measurement and calculation of shielding flux consumption, a visual examination of the welds made, an analysis of macro sections, and an economic calculation of the respective {{total cost of the}} welding processes using single-wire, twin-wire and triple-wire electrodes were performed {{in order to make a}} comparative analysis of the processes concerned. The experimental results obtained showed that high quality welded joints could be produced using two wires or three wires, i. e. the twin- or triple-wire electrode, in a joint contact tube in submerged arc welding. The calculation of the cost-effectiveness of welding, including personnel, materials, overheads and other costs, showed that welding with the twin-wire electrode cuts the costs by 20 % and welding with the triple-wire electrode by around 30 %. Submerged arc welding with a triple-wire electrode is a new welding process variant suitable for thick and long workpieces and in cases where a larger quantity of the molten filler material is required. Three wires in a joint contact tube can be arranged in a line or in the shape of a triangle optionally with long sides depending on the shape of the joint assembly and the weld shape desired. Although this procedure is highly efficient and shows numerous advantages over welding with a single-wire electrode, it has not been established in practice yet...|$|E
