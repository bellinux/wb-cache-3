500|$|Less {{than half}} of the {{protected}} areas of the Albany Pine Bush (42%, or [...] ) are currently pitch pine-scrub oak barrens, with an additional [...] of disturbed areas with invasive plant growth. As this area is now under protection, it can be restored to the status of pine barrens, especially with the use of controlled burning. The remaining pine barrens are dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida), a tall shrub layer consisting of bear oak and dwarf chestnut oak (Quercus ilicifolia and Quercus prinoides), and a low shrub layer composed of lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium and Vaccinium pallidum), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and sweet fern (Comptonia peregrina). Between areas of pitch pine-scrub oak barrens are small patches of grassland dominated by prairie grasses, including big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), as well as small trees like the shrubby willows (Salix humilis and Salix tristis). Characteristic flowering plants include bush clover (<b>Lespedeza</b> capitata), goat's-rue (Tephrosia virginiana), and wild lupine (Lupinus perennis).|$|E

40|$|Modified {{polyacrylamide}} gel and SDS-{{polyacrylamide gel}} electrophoretic systems using a low molarity tris-HCl buffer and equal pH of homogenizing buffer and stacking gel provided improved stacking {{for separation of}} soluble proteins from Heterodera schachtii, H. trifolii, H. <b>lespedezae,</b> and H. glycines races 1, 2, 3, and 4, compared with previous studies with cyst nematodes, The four Heterodera species were easily distinguished using the polyacrylamide gel system, but H. trifolii and H. <b>lespedezae</b> had similar protein patterns. H. glycines races were not separable by that system. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel system produced different protein patterns for all four Heterodera species although H. trifolii and H. <b>lespedezae</b> differed by only a single band, suggesting that these two may be subspecifically related. A protein band unique to H. glycines races 3 and 4 was not detected in SDS-polyacrylamide gel profiles from races 1 and 2. Molecular weight determinations were 55, 000 for distinctive proteins in profiles of H. trifolii and 75, 000 for H. glycines races 3 and 4...|$|R

40|$|Vulval cones of four {{closely related}} Heterodera species - H. glycines (races 1 - 5), H. <b>lespedezae,</b> H. schachtii, and H. trifolii - were {{examined}} using scanning electron microscopy. Numbers of dorsal and ventral radial ridges, total radial ridges, perineal ridges, and preanal ridges were useful in differentiating the five races of H. glycines {{and the other}} three species. Most of the populations differed significantly (P < 0. 01) using the Waller-Duncan k-ratio t-test for mean separation of the five characters. H. glycines races 2, 4, and 5 were most similar. H. schachtii and H. trifolii were most dissimilar {{to each other and to}} H. <b>lespedezae</b> and H. glycines. Two additional qualitative characters were also useful in differentiating the populations. The shallower, shorter radial ridges of H. glycines provided a basis for separation from the other three species.

40|$|A filamentous, nonsporulating fungus, {{designated}} Arkansas Fungus 18 (ARF 18), {{was isolated}} from 9 of 95 populations of Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode, in Arkansas. In petri dishes, ARF 18 parasitized 89 % of H. glycines eggs in cysts. The fungus also infected eggs of Meloidogyne incognita and eggs in cysts of Cactodera betulae, H. graminophila, H. <b>lespedezae,</b> H. leuceilyma, H. schachtii, and H. trifolii. In pot tests, reproduction of SCN was 70 % less in untreated field soil that was naturally infested by ARF 18 than in autoclaved field soil. Although ARF 18 grew well at 25 C on cornmeal agar {{over a wide}} pH range, it did not sporulate on 28 media and thus could not be identified to genus or species...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-five {{populations of}} Heterodera glycines and populations of 15 other Heterodera, Globodera, and Punctodera species were studied morphometrically {{and some were}} {{compared}} serologically. There was {{a wide range of}} each measurement within each nematode population. Except for one soybean cyst nematode population from Indiana, which was a tetraploid and considerably larger than the others, morphometric measurements overlapped. In a discriminant function comparison most of the populations were closely grouped but at least three were rather distinctly separated. Morphometrically H. fici, H. cruciferae, H. schachtii, and H. trifolii were closely associated with H. glycines. Serology indicated a close relationship between H. glycines, H. <b>lespedezae,</b> H. trifolii, H. schachtii, and the Heterodera sp. from Rumex, while H. betulae appeared to be more distantly related...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lespedeza</b> capitata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Fabaceae, or legume family, and is known by the common name roundhead bushclover, or roundhead <b>lespedeza.</b> It is native to eastern North America, including eastern Canada and {{the eastern half of}} the United States.|$|E
40|$|Morphological changes {{occurring}} during post-infection {{development and}} the influence of temperature on the life cycle of Heterodera <b>lespedezae</b> are reported. Morphological development was similar to that of H. schachtii. Each post-infection stage had a distinct styler, and fed actively. Detailed observations were made of cuticle formation and markings, esophageal glands, and reproductive system. Certain developmental phases, such as matrix deposition and oviposition, appeared to be correlated with color changes of the adult female body. The effect of temperature on nematode development was observed in a phytotron at day/night temperatures of 18 / 14, 18 / 18, 22 / 18, 26 / 22, 26 / 26, and 30 / 26 C; the optimum was 26 / 26 C. More time was required to complete the life cycle at the three lower temperatures than at the three higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Light and {{transmission}} electron microscopy were used to investigate the life cycle and ultrastructure of an undescribed isolate of Pasteuria that parasitizes the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. Studies also were conducted to determine the host specificity of Pasteuria. The endospores that attached to the cuticle of second-stage juveniles (J 2) of H. glycines in soil did not germinate until the encumbered nematodes invaded soybean roots. Thereafter, the bacterium developed and completed its life cycle only in females. The stages of endosporogenesis were typical of Pasteuria spp. The mature endospore, like that of P. nishizawae, the only other Pasteuria known to infect H. glycines, produces an epicortical layer that completely surrounds the cortex, an outer spore coat that tapers progressively from the top {{to the base of}} the central body, and a double basal adhesion layer. However, subtle differences exist between the Pasteuria from North America and P. nishizawae with regard to size of the central body, nature and function of the mesosomes observed in the earlier stages of endosporogenesis, and appearance of the fibers lining the basal adhesion layer and the exosporium of the mature endospore. Endospores of the North American Pasteuria attached to J 2 of H. schachtii, H. trifolii, and H. <b>lespedezae</b> but not to Meloidogyne arenaria race 1, Tylenchorhynchus nudus, and Labronema sp. Results from this study indicate that the North American Pasteuria is more similar to P. nishizawae than to any other known member of the genus. Additional evidence from comparative analysis of 16 S rDNA sequences is needed to clarify whether these two Pasteuria belong to the same species...|$|R
