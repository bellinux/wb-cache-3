Design is supported by cfd- 1 d engine simulations, using an experimentally calibrated model. The goal of the supercharging system is to deliver the required values of boost pressure at steady operating conditions, and to maintain or improve the full size engine response during acceleration (one of the most critical issues for downsized engines). Two options have been considered: 1) two-stage turbocharging, with two small turbochargers as a high-pressure stage, and one big turbo as <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> (referred to as "TRITURBO"; 2) two-stage supercharging made up of one <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> turbocharger and one electric supercharger (referred to as "E-SUPER"). It was found that both configurations not only allow the downsized engine to comply with the performance targets at wide open throttle, steady conditions, but they are also able to improve the transient response in comparison to the full size engine.

The clearance heights in the last <b>stages</b> (high <b>pressure</b> <b>stages)</b> of a gas turbine compressor are very large in comparison to the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> due to mechanical constraints and small blade heights.

40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} blades with {{integral}} shrouds, for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as also for the long blades of the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> sections. The blades are inserted with their root into the seat on the shaft {{in such a way}} that the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds. In long blades of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> the forcing can be obtained by the untwisting of twisted blades due to the effect of the huge centrifugal forces. The dynamic behavior of these blade rows is difficult to predict due to the nonlinear effect of the contact forces and due to friction. Different models for the contact are proposed and compared. The resulting natural frequencies of the blade row as a function of the different nodal diameter mode shapes are highly depending on the assumed models. For avoiding resonant conditions with engine order excitations, the natural frequencies must be calculated with good accuracy. Some of the modes of the blade row, typically for the last <b>stage</b> of the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbine, can couple with some vibration modes of the rotor: flexural vibrations of the shaft couple with 1 nodal diameter mode shape of the row in axial direction and torsional vibrations of the shaft couple with the 0 nodal diameter mode in tangential direction.

40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{expenses}} in CO 2 capture is the transport and disposal of waste from the amine reclaimer, and top up of fresh amine KIP. The main {{reason for this is}} because the waste stream contains quite large amounts of fresh amine, and the sheer volume of waste. If amount of MEA in waste could be reduced, both the volume of waste would be reduced, which lowers the transport and disposal cost, and the amount of amine for top up would be reduced. In other words, the total operational cost of the system could be considerably lowered. This study investigated the possibility of reducing the amine (MEA) in the waste stream by looking at a two stage reclaiming process. A model based on the work done by Linn Christine Loe Haaversen was developed to include several new features, including a second stage. This model was the basis of cost optimization. The cost optimization took several factors into account. The cost of waste transportation and handling, top up amine cost, cost of compressing low pressure lean amine to the pressure of main system and heat input to reclaimer vessels all were included the objective function subject to minimization. The unconstrained variables in this optimization were heat entered into both stages, and pressure in second stage.

The latest fluid (5 – 24 wt % NaCl equiv.) was trapped during the waning stages of hydrothermal activity. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of the fluid (d 18 OSMOW 9 : 4 – 4 : 8 ‰; dDSMOW 245 to 2 49 ‰) of quartz and the sulfur isotopic compositions ðd 34 SCDT 20 : 3 to 0 : 9 ‰Þ of sulfide minerals cementing the breccia fragments, are consistent with a magmatic origin for the hydrothermal fluids. Fluid inclusion data and stable isotopic compositions suggest that Ilkwang Cu–W mineralization and alteration are products of orthomagmatic hydrothermal processes that were strongly pipe-controlled. The various types of fluid inclusions in the Ilkwang deposit reflect the evolution from a high pressure to a low pressure magmatic system.

40|$|Steam {{condensation}} phenomenon {{plays an}} important role in many industrial applications. Especially in energy sector this process requires deep understanding. When noncondensable gases are taken into consideration description of the entire phenomenon becomes more complicated. If the surface condensation is taken into consideration this additional species accumulates and creates noncondensable layer near the surface on water vapour condenses. Due to this effect heat and mass transfer rates from gas mixture decreases. Also volume condensation (if it occurs) is affected by the presence of inert gases. Several examples where the phenomena described above are important can be taken into consideration: studies of accidents in the nuclear power plants where condensation in the volume and condensation on the cold containment’s structures occurs after steam is released due to the pipe brake in the primary loop (especially this is important for PWR’s containments which in normal operation conditions are filled with air or nitrogen); condensation of steam in the pipe systems of BWR reactors where some amount of hydrogen can be accumulated due to the water vapour condensation in nonvented pipes; condensation of steam in the condensers after <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> turbine; etc. Also in other fields, e. g. chemistry or meteorology, the condensation of water vapour in presence of noncondensable species plays very important role. Diffusion surface condensation model and its implementation into CFX – 4 CFD code has been described in this licentiate thesis. Three different situations have been taken into account: surface condensation of water vapour in presence of air on the vertical wall (computational results have been compared with several commonly used correlations), surface condensation of water vapour in presence of air on the horizontal wall (results have been compared with experimental data), volume condensation in presence of air (known also as spontaneous condensation) – principle of the model has been described and calculation example has been presented and analysed.

40|$|The Laboratory of Industrial Energy {{systems has}} {{evaluated}} {{a series of}} high performance air-water heat pump concepts with the aim to retrofit existing fuel fired boilers for residential hydronic heating systems. The results are published {{within the framework of}} the Swiss Retrofit Heat Pump project, which is conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The two-stage heat pump cycle has shown the best efficiency prospects. Oil migration between the upper stage and lower stage compressors is the main obstacle for commercialization in the low heat rate range. The oil mass concentration is measured by the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrospopy (FTIR) method with an attenuated total reflection cell (ATR). This method was calibrated on a separated test loop and compared to measurements of mass-sampling and of density by a Coriolis effect densitymeter. Infrared analysis gives a precision of < 0. 1 % of oil concentration and the detection limit was identified at about 0. 3 %. Density measurements cannot be used in the ordinary temperature range of the liquid line in the heat pump. Mass sampling and the FT-IR measurements give corresponding results. An air-water heat pump (10 kWth, R- 407 C) was build in the laboratory to perform comparison tests in the single-stage and two-stage heating modes. The main elements of the heat pump are: two scroll type compressors, a brazed plate condenser, a finned tube evaporator, an economizer heat exchanger and two electronic expansion valves. Defrosting is done by cycle inversion with a 4 -way reversing valve. Measured improvements on the two-stage heating mode of 30 % for the COP and 24 % for the heat output comparing to the corresponding test point (A- 7 /W 50) in the single stage configuration have been shown. Important reductions of the maximum system temperature at the outlet of the compressors enable an extended range of application (including the point A- 12 /W 65). In the two-stage heating mode an oil transfer rate of 5 - 10 g/min from the high pressure stage to the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> compressor was detected in all tested conditions, which is strongly limiting the continuous service of the heat pump. For long term running tests an additional balancing system composed of an oil pump and an oil vessel has been installed. The circulating oil concentration is between 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % for the two-stage configuration as measured with the FT-IR method. In single-stage mode the concentration is lower than 0. 2 % and only the mass sampling technique provided reliable results. Sensibility analysis in changing the regulation parameters did not give concluding results in order to design a stable configuration of the two-stage heat pump. In absence of integrated two-stage scroll compressors intermediate solutions have to be considered. These consist in the implementation of a booster compressor or the implementation of an oil separator at the outlet of the high pressure stage compressor coupled with a oil return management or a periodic shut down of the heat pump with external balancing of the oil level in the crankcase. An adapted heat transfer model for refrigerant-oil mixtures was developed, in order to investigate the theoretical impact of oil in the evaporator...|$|E

Past attempts to employ metal vapour conversion cycles for power generation are surveyed. After selecting potassium and cesium as possible candidate fluids, the binary cycle is optimized taking as variables the top temperature, the number of condensaztion levels of the metal vapour cycle, and the characteristics of the bottoming steam cycle. At vaporization temperatures in the range of 750 - 850 °C, metal vapour cycle efficiencies of about 20 - 24 per cent and binary cycle efficiencies of 57 - 61 per cent seem achivable. A survey of available building materials in the steel and in the super-alloy class showed that top temperatures of 800 - 850 °C coluld be reached with state-of-the-art alloys.

NASAs Mars Technology Program has funded refinement and testing of a miniature piston pump, powered by reacted propellant. A pump-fed bipropellant rocket stage remains to be developed. The technology could also benefit other future lunar and planetary science programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{condensation}} {{process in}} a steam turbine is in reality an essentially unsteady phenomenon. There are differences between steady and time-accurate calculations introduced by the large-scale temperature fluctuations which are caused by the segmentation of blade wakes by successive blade rows. Consequently, {{it is important to}} consider the additional losses caused by condensation in unsteady simulations. In this work a time-accurate Eulerian-Lagrangian two-phase model is presented. The algorithm is applied to the compressible Navier-Stokes solver TRACE to predict the influence of spontaneous homogeneous nucleation using source terms for heat, mass and momentum transfer between the phases. In simulations presented in this work the capability of the two-phase model is demonstrated through comparisons with one and two dimensional experiments of nozzles and a cascade blade from literature. Unsteady phenomena are described in detail for an industrial <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbine <b>stage...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} of performance degradation for an aeronautical {{gas turbine engine}} (Honeywell T 55 L 712) is presented. The effects of turbine (<b>low</b> and high <b>pressure</b> <b>stages)</b> erosion on the engine performance have been investigated in some detail. The behavior of the engine has been simulated using a dynamic model implemented in Matlab-Simulink. Using a throughflow code the LPT and HPT have been simulated and their performance maps have been obtained {{with a high level}} of accuracy. In order to understand the effects of turbine erosion nine degradation levels have been introduced and the LPT and HPT performance have been computed using the abovementioned throughflow code. The degradation levels have been based on stator erosion effects (increase of throat section and blade thickness reduction) only according to the experimental evidence from the engine tests from Piaggio Aero Industries. The introduction of the modified turbine characteristics into the Matlab-Simulink model has allowed the degradation effects on the overall engine performance to be tested and discussed. Finally, using experimental data from the industrial maintenance database, the link of each level of degradation with the number of the engine operational time (hours) has been obtained...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{data from}} jet-engine tests have {{indicated}} that unsteady blade row (wake) interactions and separation can {{have a significant impact}} on the efficiency of turbine stages. The effects of these interactions can be intensified in low-pressure turbine stages because of the low Reynolds number operating environment. Measured turbine efficiencies at takeoff can be as much as two points higher than those at cruise conditions. Thus, during the last decade a significant amount of effort has been put into determining the effects of transition and turbulence on the performance of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine <b>stages.</b> Experimental investigations have been performed, for example, by Hodson et al. and Halstead et al. These investigations have helped identify/clarify the roles that factors such as the Reynolds number, free stream turbulence intensity, pressure gradient and curvature have in the generation of losses. In parallel to the experimental investigations, there have been significant analytical efforts to improve the modeling of transition. Examples of such efforts include the works of Mayle and Gostelow et al. These newer models show promise of providing accurate transition predictions over a wide range of flow conditions, although they have yet to be implemented into the numerical flow analyses used by the turbine design community. Some recent computational investigations of interest include the works of Chernobrovkin and Lakshminarayana and Eulitz and Engel. The focus of the current effort has been to -use a viscous, unsteady quasi-three-dimensional Navier-Stokes analysis to study boundary layer development in a two-stage low-pressure turbine. A two-layer algebraic turbulence model, along with a natural transition model and a bubble transition model, have been used, The geometry used in the simulations has been the subject of extensive experiments. The predicted results have been compared with experimental data, including airfoil loadings and time-averaged/unsteady integral boundary layer quantities...|$|R
