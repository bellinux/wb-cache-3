5000|$|Skyglow is the {{illumination}} of {{the night}} sky or parts of it, resembling an orange [...] "smog". It occurs from both natural and human-made sources. Artificial skyglow is caused by the over-illumination of the sky from large city centres, shopping centres, or stadiums. It consists of light that is either emitted directly upward or reflected from the ground that is then scattered by dust and gas molecules in the atmosphere, producing a luminous background or <b>light</b> <b>dome.</b> These artificial skyglows cause the sky to be 5-10 times brighter in urban areas than a naturally dark sky that is unaffected by artificial light.

40|$|The Portable <b>Light</b> <b>Dome</b> Systems aim {{to create}} {{interactive}} images by reflecting white light, infra-red and ultra violet light spectra on {{the surfaces of}} ancient artefacts. These high quality virtual images avoid future handling and facilitate their detailed study. The texture/colour values on these 2 D+ and 3 D models are interactive datasets based on a recording process with multiple light sources. The main devices for this task are the so-called minidomes, these are acquisition systems which make sequences of images of a surface all with a different lighting angle: by 2015 the project has developed a version with white light LEDs and a version with 5 different spectral LEDs; the Portable <b>Light</b> <b>Dome</b> (PLD) and the Multispectral PLD, respectively. Software tools and enhancement filters have been developed which {{can deal with the}} different wavelengths in real-time. They ensure the multispectral 3 D digitalization and visualization of fragile objects, bearing inscriptions or remnants of pigments on ostraca, tablets, papyri, etc.; all preserved on/in clay, wood, stone, parchment, papyrus or paper. This leads to an easy and cost-effective methodology, which combines the whether or not multi-spectral images with the actual relief characteristics and properties of the physical object. In addition, creating a registration system that requires minimal handling but delivers maximal output for research and conservation purposes, must be seen as most welcoming in working with the numerous fragile objects safeguarded in cultural heritage collections and excavated during archaeological missions. The system presents itself as an easy by scholars to use tool and transportable to any collection or excavation in the field. Over the years several thousands of archaeological objects have been recorded with the PLD devices, these include thousands of cuneiform tablets, seal impressions and many other types of archaeological artefacts. The result of these many scans has been used for ongoing research projects, general imaging efforts in collections and for assignments in conservation sciences...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} presents {{insights into}} the ongoing evolution of new visualization techniques relevant for the fields of archaeology and, particularly, Assyriology. We focus on systems and methods facilitating the reading of texts and sealings impressed on clay tablets. Making high resolution 3 D models of archaeological objects seems an attractive and fulfilling solution, {{but in most cases}} the acquisition of these models is complex and their manipulation is demanding for both computer and researcher. Research groups across the world are working on these issues. In the presented survey, special attention goes to the results developed by Ancient Near Eastern scholars and engineers of Leuven University - Belgium, who built a Portable <b>Light</b> <b>Dome</b> related to the PTM-technology, which supplies schol¬ars with so-called 2 D+ images of digitally recorded objects. These virtual artifacts allow a detailed dynamic study {{of a wide variety of}} archaeological finds. For the field of cuneiform studies, the outcome is revolutionizing the approach how in a combined way the tablet, the text or any other kind of impressions on its surface can be visualized all together. The new visualization techniques present themselves as excellent digital safeguards and have proven to be high quality aids when used during a study process as well as for consultation after publication. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities, in {{collaboration}} with the University Library, is pleased to host Lieve Watteeuw and Hendrik Hameeuw (KU Leuven) who will be demonstrating the Portable <b>Light</b> <b>Dome</b> (PLD) on an object from the UB's special collection. The PLD is an automated interactive digitizing solution, developed by the KU Leuven. It consists of a small, light-weight dome equipped with various light sources and a high end digital camera. The approach is geared towards an easy-to-use solution for the virtual inspection of objects, where both the 2 D aspects (color, reflectance, intensity, or other representations through filtering and relighting) as well as the 3 D aspects (by estimating the surface orientations and characteristics) are being imaged and calculated. The results allow for photorealistic virtual re-lighting and non-photorealistic rendering of the objects in real-time through the use of programmable graphics hardware. The lecture will showcase the use of the PLD system for the documentation of small, inscribed and illuminated artefacts, such as seals, bookbindings, illuminations, archeology artefacts, cuneiform tablets and even mummy masks. The selected examples will demonstrate how the interactive datasets produced with the PLD can support various types of research questions, facilitate technical art-historical challenges and provide solution for curatorial documentation and safeguarding.

A multispectral, multidirectional, portable and dome-shaped acquisition system is developed {{within the framework}} of the research projects RICH (KU Leuven) and EES (RMAH, Brussels) in collaboration with the ESAT-VISICS research group (KU Leuven). The Multispectral Portable <b>Light</b> <b>Dome</b> (MS PLD) consists of a hemispherical structure, an overhead camera and LEDs emitting in five parts of the electromagnetic spectrum regularly covering the dome’s inside surface. With the associated software solution, virtual relighting and enhancements can be applied in a real-time, interactive manner. The system extracts genuine 3 D and shading information based on a photometric stereo algorithm. This innovative approach allows for instantaneous alternations between the computations in the infrared, red, green, blue and ultraviolet spectra. The MS PLD system has been tested for research ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to ancient Egyptian artefacts. Preliminary results have shown it documents and measures the 3 D surface structure of objects, re-visualises underdrawings, faded pigments and inscriptions, and examines the MS results in combination with the actual relief characteristics of the physical object. Newly developed features are reflection maps and histograms, analytic visualisations of the reflection properties of all separate LEDs or selected areas. In its capacity as imaging technology, the system acts as a tool for the analysis of surface materials (e. g. identification of blue pigments, gold and metallic surfaces). Besides offering support in answering questions of attribution and monitoring changes and decay of materials, the PLD also contributes to the identification of materials; all essential factors when making decisions in the conservation protocol. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} years, 3 D imaging has {{found his way}} into the world of Egyptology. This lecture will present two case studies where 3 D technology is used for the documentation of hieratic inscriptions. The inscriptions, painted in (red) ochre or black paint, were applied on different carriers, and required a different methodology. The Egyptian collection of the Royal Museums of Art and History (RMAH Brussels) contains a large number of small decorated and/or inscribed objects. Some of these objects are currently in a bad condition - any operation carried on them can result in considerable material losses -, making it necessary to document them {{in such a way that}} it allows future scholars to study them in detail without handling them. The EES Project therefore aims to create multispectral 3 D images of these fragile objects with a multispectral ‘minidome’ acquisition system, based on the already existing system of the multi-light Portable <b>Light</b> <b>Dome</b> (PLD). The texture/colour values on the created 2 D+ and 3 D models are interactive data based on a recording process with infrared, red, green, blue, and ultraviolet light spectra. Software tools and enhancement filters have been developed which can deal with the different wavelengths in real-time. This leads to an easy and cost-effective methodology which combines multispectral imaging with the actual relief characteristics and properties of the physical object. The system is transportable to any collection or excavation in the field. As a case study, the well-known Brussels “Execration Figurines” (Middle Kingdom, c. 1900 BC) were chosen. These figurines are made of unbaked clay and covered with hieratic texts, listing names of foreign countries and rulers. The study of this type of collections is mostly hampered by the poor state of conservation of the objects, but also by the only partial preservation of the ink traces in visible light. The method has also been applied to other decorated objects of the RMAH collection, such as a Fayoum portrait, ostraca and decorated objects made of stone, wood and ceramics. The final goal will be to publish the newly created multispectral 3 D images on Carmentis (www. carmentis. be), the online catalogue of the RMAH collection, making them accessible to scholars all over the world. The second case study presents the quarry inscriptions of the New Kingdom limestone quarries at Dayr Abu Hinnis (Middle Egypt). These gallery quarries contain hundreds of hieratic inscriptions, written on the ceiling. The texts are mainly related to the general administration of the quarry area. In documenting the abundance of ceiling inscriptions and other graffiti, we had to decide upon a practice that would allow not only to capture the "content", but also to document the location and orientation of each record. Every inscription can be photographed in detail, but this is insufficient to provide the reader access to vital information concerning the spatial distribution of the inscriptions, which may, for instance, relate to the progress of work. After experimenting with a variety of other methods, we adopted a photogrammetric software for 3 D modelling photographs of the quarry ceilings, AGISOFT PHOTOSCAN, which uses structure from motion (SFM) algorithms to create three-dimensional images based on a series of overlapping two-dimensional images. The ultimate goal of this whole labour-intensive process in the quarries is not the creation of pure three-dimensional models, but rather to generate an orthophoto of the entire ceiling of a quarry. Based on these images, each graffito could be analysed in context.
