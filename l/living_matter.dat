25|$|And {{thus the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>living</b> <b>matter</b> always arises by the agency of pre-existing <b>living</b> <b>matter,</b> took definite shape; and had, henceforward, {{a right to be}} considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of <b>living</b> <b>matter</b> in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that <b>living</b> <b>matter</b> may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of Abiogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} {{of the origin of}} man's body from pre-existing and <b>living</b> <b>matter</b> is a legitimate matter of inquiry for natural science.

25|$|A word of {{explanation}} seems necessary {{with regard to}} the introduction of the new term Archebiosis. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word Biogenesis to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word Biogenesis has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist , who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word Abiogenesis. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced {{the use of the word}} Biogenesis, and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which <b>living</b> <b>matter</b> is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing <b>living</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

Jiang once had a run-in with Liu Ju after arresting one of the crown prince's assistants for improper use of an imperial road, and feared that Liu Ju would seek payback after ascending to the throne.

25|$|A debate {{took place}} at the 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in March 2006 in Houston, Texas over the {{postulate}} that carbon-rich content within the pores of the rocks consisted of the remains of <b>living</b> <b>matter.</b> Because carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe (after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen), the presence of shapes resembling living organisms was considered insufficient by most attendees to prove that bacteria once lived on Mars. A team concluded in 2014 that although the abiotic scenario is considered to be the most reasonable explanation for the shapes in this meteorite, it is evident that the Martian subsurface contains niche environments where life could develop.|$|E
25|$|All {{life forms}} require certain core {{chemical}} elements needed for biochemical functioning. These include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—the elemental macronutrients for all organisms—often {{represented by the}} acronym CHNOPS. Together these make up nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, the bulk of <b>living</b> <b>matter.</b> Five of these six elements comprise the chemical components of DNA, the exception being sulfur. The latter is {{a component of the}} amino acids cysteine and methionine. The most biologically abundant of these elements is carbon, which has the desirable attribute of forming multiple, stable covalent bonds. This allows carbon-based (organic) molecules to form an immense variety of chemical arrangements. Alternative hypothetical types of biochemistry have been proposed that eliminate {{one or more of these}} elements, swap out an element for one not on the list, or change required chiralities or other chemical properties.|$|E

This brought him to challenge the two-millennium-old theory of spontaneous generation, using remarkably well-designed experiments.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have pointed out}} a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism. According to Aristotle, a <b>living</b> thing's <b>matter</b> is its body, which needs a soul {{in order to be}} alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death. However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death. Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive. But if a <b>living</b> thing's <b>matter</b> is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.|$|R

500|$|For {{decades the}} Roman Catholic Church avoided {{official}} refutation of evolution. However, it would rein in Catholics who proposed that evolution could {{be reconciled with}} the Bible, as this conflicted with the First Vatican Council's (1869–70) finding that everything was created out of nothing by God, and to deny that finding could lead to excommunication. In 1950, the encyclical Humani generis of Pope Pius XII first mentioned evolution directly and officially. It allowed one to enquire into the concept of humans coming from pre-existing <b>living</b> <b>matter,</b> but not to question Adam and Eve or {{the creation of the}} soul. In 1996, Pope John Paul II said that evolution is [...] "more than a hypothesis" [...] and acknowledged the large body of work accumulated in its support, but reiterated that any attempt to give a material explanation of the human soul is [...] "incompatible with the truth about man." [...] Pope Benedict XVI has reiterated the conviction that human beings [...] "are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us {{is the result of a}} thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary." [...] At the same time, he has promoted the study of the relationship between the concepts of creation and evolution, based on the conviction that there cannot be a contradiction between faith and reason. Along these lines, the research project Thomistic Evolution, run by a team of Dominican scholars, endeavours to reconcile the scientific evidence on evolution with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E

In our recent study (Nakaoka and Wakamoto, 2017), we developed a microfluidics-based platform to track multiple single cell lineages until death. The system enabled us to monitor both cell growth and death in controlled steady environments, and we confirmed the absence of replicative aging in fission yeast old-pole cell lineages by showing remarkable constancy both in cell division and mortality rates. Furthermore, we revealed a growth-death trade-off relation in non-stressed conditions. The phenomenological law that constrains macroscopic physiological parameters could provide a new quantitative insight into possible balanced-growth states in various environments...|$|R
