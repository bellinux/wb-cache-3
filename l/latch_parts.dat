40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{deploying}} time (or response time) {{of an active}} hood lift system (AHLS) of a passenger vehicle activated by gunpowder actuator. In this work, this is accomplished by changing principal design parameters of the <b>latch</b> <b>part</b> mechanism of the hood system. After briefly introducing the working principle of the AHLS operated by the gunpowder actuator, the governing equations of the AHLS are formulated for each different deploying motion. Subsequently, using the governing equations, the response time for deploying the hold lift system is determined by changing several geometric distances such as {{the distance from the}} rotational center of the pop-up guide to the point of the latch in the axial and vertical directions. Then, a comparison is made of the total response time to completely deploy the hood lift system with the existing conventional AHLS and proposed AHLS. In addition, the workable driving speed of the proposed AHLS is compared with the conventional one by changing the powder volume of the actuator...|$|R
5000|$|Draw Latch is a two <b>part</b> <b>latch</b> {{where one}} side has an arm that can clasp {{to the other}} half, and as it closes the clasp pulls the two parts together. Frequently used on tool boxes, chests, crates and windows. Doesn't need to be fully closed to secure both halves.|$|R

Invented in 1847, the <b>latch</b> needle was <b>part</b> of a knitting machine that wrapped yarn around the latch and pushed through a canvas before pulling it through and knotting the yarn to the canvas. In the 1920s, the tool was created by combining the hand hook with the latch.|$|R

5000|$|Latchbolt or Latch bolt An {{extremely}} common <b>latch</b> type, typically <b>part</b> of a lockset, it is a spring-loaded bolt with an angled edge. When {{the door}} is pushed closed, the angled edge of the latchbolt engages with {{the lip of the}} strike plate; a spring allows the bolt to retract. Once {{the door is}} fully closed, the bolt automatically extends into the strike plate, holding the door closed. The latchbolt is disengaged (retracted) typically when the user turns the door handle, which via the lockset's mechanism, manually retracts the latchbolt, allowing the door to open.|$|R
5000|$|Fullers have {{a variety}} of uses beyond bladesmithing. They are often used for [...] "drawing out" [...] steel, which {{consists}} of hammering a short block into a long bar. The fullers will often be used to notch the block or bar. If the fullers are longer than the block is wide, they will tend to elongate the block rather than raise bulges from the surface. After notching, the block is hammered smooth, elongating it further, and this process is repeated until the bar becomes the correct length and thickness. Fullers are also used for many other shaping processes in blacksmithing, from making hinges and <b>latches</b> to plow <b>parts</b> and horseshoes.|$|R

50|$|An {{evolution}} of EDO DRAM, Burst EDO DRAM, could process four memory addresses in one burst, for {{a maximum of}} 5‐1‐1‐1, saving an additional three clocks over optimally designed EDO memory. It was done by adding an address counter on the chip {{to keep track of}} the next address. BEDO also added a pipeline stage allowing page-access cycle to be divided into two parts. During a memory-read operation, the first part accessed the data from the memory array to the output stage (second <b>latch).</b> The second <b>part</b> drove the data bus from this latch at the appropriate logic level. Since the data is already in the output buffer, quicker access time is achieved (up to 50% for large blocks of data) than with traditional EDO.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{negative}} logic selector bail that is {{displaced by the}} interposer in turn pulls a latch interposer and link which causes a selector latch near the cycle shaft to be {{pulled away from the}} latch bail. The latches pulled away in this manner are disengaged {{for the rest of the}} cycle, while the remaining <b>latches</b> take <b>part</b> in character selection, hence the term [...] "{{negative logic}}". The minus five selector bail pulls an interposer and link which causes a latch to disengage from a cam, allowing it to move an additional input into the whiffletree that subtracts five units of rotation from any negative logic inputs. An additional [...] "low velocity" [...] selector latch is also engaged by certain keys, such as '.' and '_', which require a reduced striking force so as not to cut the paper; this selector latch engages the low velocity control cam follower, which pulls the low velocity cable connected to the cam in the carrier, causing the low velocity lobe to be used instead of the usual high velocity lobe. Additionally, punctuation marks are deliberately placed about the ball so the maximum amount of energy is used to position the element prior to striking, further reducing the impact.|$|R

Whereas GTO turn-off failure {{has already been}} analysed extensively in the past, in this paper a novel turn-on failure mechanism at low tempera-tures is analysed. The turn-on failure {{is due to a}} decreased carrier lifetime at low temperature with resulting increased latching current. As a consequence at low load current and low triggering current large parts of the device area do not <b>Latch</b> while other <b>parts</b> with somewhat higher carrier lifetime or deviating doping concentration have to sustain a very high current density at high volt-ages.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{program of}} inhole geophysical measurements, implementing the Gearhart-Owen logging package and Uyeda temperature probe, was planned {{in support of}} the drilling program. These measurements were designed to aid in predicting in situ physical property variations of lower, middle, and upper slope sediments. Correlation of these variations with the extensive seismic reflection grid would aid in interpreting sediment response to the dynamic effects of subduction. In situ temperature measurements may help to substantiate the gas hydrate reflection as the phase boundary between hydrated and nonhydrated sediments. Unfortunately, Murphy's laws prevailed, and equipment malfunctions related to sand in the bit release mechanism thwarted our attempt to release the bit and log the open hole at all sites. In addition, incorrect assembly of the Uyeda tool and related bottom <b>latching</b> problems degraded <b>part</b> of the temperature data collected with this device...|$|R
40|$|The ADM 1070 is a {{negative}} voltage hot swap controller that allows a board to be safely inserted and removed from a live – 48 V backplane. The part achieves this by providing robust current limiting, protection against transient and nontransient short circuits and overvoltage and undervoltage conditions. The ADM 1070 typically operates from {{a negative}} voltage of up to – 80 V and can tolerate transient voltages of up to – 200 V. In-rush current {{is limited to a}} programmable value by controlling the gate drive of an external N-channel FET. The current limit can be controlled by the choice of the sense resistor, RSENSE. Added control of the in-rush current is provided by an on-chip timer that uses pulsewidth modulation to allow the maximum current to flow for only 3 % of the time. An autorestart occurs after a current limit timeout. After seven successive autorestarts, the fault will be <b>latched</b> and the <b>part</b> goes int...|$|R
30|$|Overall, the {{operation}} of the circuit is to select input DATA and pass it on the output channel, Q. As it is illustrated in Fig. 1, the circuit is a synchronous multiplexer that can transmit multiple data simultaneously to output Q based on both edges of CLOCK pulse. In close view, to analyse the performance of circuit, two NMOSs of M 17 and M 18 were connected to each inverter module (one is M 13 and M 14, the other is M 15 and M 16) in order to boost their outputs. Back to back connected inverters keep the data when transmission gate is off. At the same time multiplexer transmits this latched data to the inverter to pass the correct DATA on the output line Q. Based on Fig. 1, when the CLOCK is low the MOSFETs M 3, M 4 and M 18 are all on while M 5, M 6 and M 17 are all off. Hence DATA is hold by negative latch and is passed to output line Q. In contrast, whenever CLOCK is high then the MOSFETs M 5, M 6 and M 17 will be on but the MOSFETs M 3, M 4 and M 18 will be off. In this state, DATA is passed on the output channel Q. So that, in dual edge-triggered D flip-flip DATA is put forward to output through both low and high states of CLOCK. Before the next CLOCK, if DATA alters this new amount of DATA is held by positive edge <b>latch</b> data PELD <b>part</b> and whenever next CLOCK comes and changes from Low to High this DATA is conveyed to the output channel Q. On the contrary, before the following CLOCK, if DATA changes this new DATA is hold by Negative Edge <b>Latch</b> Data NELD <b>part</b> and once next CLOCK arrives and alters from High to Low the DATA reach to the output channel Q. Without using M 19, M 20, M 21, M 22, M 23, and M 24 the output does not reach to the standard value of high or low level and there will be some transient time states for output signals. They should be a series of standard pulses since the input data is in fact a series of standard pulses.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Different {{types of}} dental restorations {{are used for}} the therapy of {{unilateral}} free-end saddle edentulism. Unilateral complex partial denture {{is one of the}} indications for the Kennedy class II partial edentulism. The abscence of major connector and denture plate is an advantage compared to the conventional restorations, because of better comfort and shorter period of adaptation. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the influence of free-end saddle length change on the behaviour of unilateral complex partial denture supporting structures. Methods. Stress levels of the canine and the first premolar as retentional teeth and the attachments were tested under the influence of physiological forces with the loading point shifting distally in relation to the saddle length change. A virtual real size 3 D model of the fixed part of the restoration (the canine and the first premolar with milled crowns) was created using the CATIA computer program. It was connected to the mobile part of partial denture with the SD snap in <b>latch</b> attachment. Mobile <b>part</b> of the restoration was designed in the region of 2, 3 and 4 lateral teeth (second premolar, first, second and third molar). By using the finite element method (FEM) stress levels analysis was performed under the load of physiological forces of 150 N in the free-end saddle teeth zone. Results. The results of analysis show that physiological forces cause a different stress distribution on the abutment teeth and the attachment, depending on the saddle length. Conclusion. The stress level values obtained for the abutment teeth as well as the attachment are far lower than the marginal ones. The behaviour of the system changes under this defined stress, but no plastic deformation occurs...|$|R
