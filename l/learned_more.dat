5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris felt that the NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also {{felt that he was}} defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis felt that there was nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Macartney and {{his family}} moved from Maitland to Sydney. In his school cricketing career Macartney {{distinguished}} himself as an all-rounder at Woollahra Superior and Chatswood public schools, before briefly attending Fort Street High School. Macartney asserted that school cricket was insignificant in his development, believing that he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> about cricket during informal summer cricket games with his brother at the local park, with their dog acting as a fielder. It was during his school career that Macartney was noticed by incumbent Australian captain Monty Noble, who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article.|$|E
5|$|Vanbiesbrouck {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan to a Belgian {{immigrant}} bricklayer, Robert Vanbiesbrouck, and an Italian immigrant Sara. He grew-up with two brothers; the oldest, Frank, {{who was also a}} goaltender in youth hockey. He inspired Vanbiesbrouck to play goaltender. John later noted that he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> about goaltending just from watching Frank than any coaching could, adding that no one ever helped him more to become the player he was.|$|E

5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Carnivàle {{takes place}} in the 1930s Dust Bowl and {{revolves}} around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher. Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season, 15 were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to 13 main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers are benefited with more flexibility in story decisions. The backgrounds of most characters were fully developed before the filming of Carnivàle began but were not part of the show's visible structure. The audience therefore only <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> about the characters as a natural aspect in the story.|$|E
5|$|When the United States entered World War I, Truman {{rejoined the}} National Guard; he helped recruit new {{soldiers}} as his unit expanded, and his success led {{the men of}} his battery to elect him as their first lieutenant. Before deployment to France, Truman was sent for training to Camp Doniphan, Fort Sill, near Lawton, Oklahoma when his regiment was federalized as the 129th Field Artillery. The regimental commander during its training was Robert M. Danford, who later served as the Army's Chief of Field Artillery. Truman later said he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> practical, useful information from Danford in six weeks than from six months of formal Army instruction, and when Truman later served as an artillery instructor, he consciously patterned his approach on Danford's.|$|E
40|$|This study {{described}} {{the level of}} skills, and interests in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about, selected teaching activities and educational technologies among faculty with teaching appointments in the College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas. As part of a United States Department of Agriculture grant, the study served as a needs assessmentfor designingfaculty development activities. Teaching faculty perceived that they had relatively high levels of skills in traditional classroom teaching areas such as lecture and discussion methods. However, they had high levels of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about these skills. Their self-perceived levels of skills were low in such non-traditional areas as case studies, discovery learning, and peer observation, and they expressed little interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about these topics. There was little relationship between their level of skill and level of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about teaching methods. These faculty rated their levels of skill in educational technologies lower than for the teaching methods. However, they expressedgenerally high levels of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about the technologies. A substantial positive relationship was found between level of skill and interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about educational technologies...|$|R

5|$|Early {{during the}} {{development}} of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. (The New York Times reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least The Winds of Winter before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published {{before the start of the}} sixth season of the HBO series.|$|E
5|$|In 1923–24, Himmler, while {{searching for}} a world view, came to abandon Catholicism {{and focused on the}} occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, {{reinforced}} by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the NSDAP appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of Führer worship. However, as he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the NSDAP, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest {{in the wake of the}} Beer Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the NSDAP under Hitler when the party was re-founded in February 1925.|$|E
5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E
