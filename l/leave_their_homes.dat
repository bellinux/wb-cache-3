They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> or the country.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Two-E was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico. It {{was the only}} cyclone during the month in the eastern North Pacific Ocean, forming on June3 from a tropical wave.

It remained a tropical depression, weakening due to land interaction and wind shear, and on June5 it dissipated just off the coast. Rainfall from the depression peaked at 19.1inches (486mm) in Acapulco, which resulted in mudslides and flooding. A total of 42houses were flooded, and 72people were forced to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> due to the storm; no deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{control of}} Nakhichevan {{passed to the}} Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its {{geographic}} position, it frequently suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> {{and move to the}} Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to Nakhichevan, while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province.|$|E
