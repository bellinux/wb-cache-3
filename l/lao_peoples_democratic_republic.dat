40|$|In the post-SARS era, we have {{witnessed}} {{the development of a}} multi-actor framework for disease control, global disease governance. This framework includes states, international organisations, non-governmental organisations and many others besides. Their actions have been codified in international law (International Health Regulations 2005) and through increasing normative understandings of global disease control. However, decisions about how to manage an outbreak remain a sovereign prerogative. This thesis considers the tensions that might occur between the normative and legislative goals of global disease governance and state conceptions of sovereignty. Sovereignty has, to date, been considered an analytical given in global health, and it is often used as an explanation for a state?s lack of compliance with global disease governance, without further consideration. However, as this thesis will show, sovereignty is not exogenous to the system of global disease governance, but it finds new meaning in this health context, which is produced through interaction between states and non-state actors at the international and global levels. This thesis considers the tensions between sovereignty and global disease governance in three case study states, the United Kingdom, Thailand and <b>Lao</b> <b>People?s</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic.</b> Through empirical analysis, it will show when states embody the ideals of global disease governance, and when they prioritise their sovereign demands. Through this, a more considered understanding of sovereignty will be shown, depending on context, allowing states to reinterpret what sovereignty means to them in global disease control. APR...|$|E
40|$|The {{district}} of Champone {{is located in}} the southern region of the <b>Lao</b> <b>Peoples</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic,</b> some forty kilometers east of the town of Savannakhet. Rain fed subsistence agriculture and irrigated rice paddy cultivation are the main activities in Champone but there is also small-scale refining of rock salt for local consumption. Champone is a lowland area forming part of the Xe Champone drainage system which discharges into the Mekong River. The Huai Phaleng and Huai Thuat rivers are tributaries of the Xe Champone, draining westward from the mountains to the east of the catchment. The alluvial plain of the Huay Souay system around Ban Keng Kok contains wetlands which are also augmented by eastward drainage from the Huay Bak. During the wet season this area can be subject to severe flooding, but irrigation is required in the dry season to maintain agricultural production. There are 16 reservoirs, a diversion weir and associated canals for irrigation in the Savannakhet region and a dam is under construction on the Huay Phaleng river for irrigation and flood control. These two dams are part of a major proposed expansion of irrigation in the Champone district, and there are concerns that the small existing area of saline soils may be affected by the development. It is postulated that the salinity is the result of deep groundwater flow across the underlying evaporite formations from the recharge areas in th...|$|E

Engineering education has suffered a shift in focus between research led fundamental engineering and vocational training that has resulted in many graduate engineers equipped without a thorough grasp of either skill set. Furthermore the belief that these two components of education can be explicitly separated appears to undermine the notion of what a graduate engineer is. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline the development of a research informed, undergraduate, module that incorporates the principles of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed approach to engineering education where the core components of study are formed around the concept of CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate). We outline our initial starting concept for the taught module and systematically break down the CDIO approach, applying the outcomes of this process to the design of the engineering module. The resultant module structure incorporates the majority of the CDIO principles, and highlights the mechanisms by which research can inform undergraduate teaching without straying away from the development of practical skills required by the graduate engineer. This work suggests that the CDIO approach, with minor modification, can be tailored to a single isolated module structure as well as a whole curriculum provided that there is a clear objective outlined at the start...|$|E

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{challenged}} Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as inoperable and technocratic {{for the issues}} surrounding water resources known as contemporary water resource politics. As a result, new methods and analytical frameworks have been suggested for IWRM that have been qualified as interdisciplinary water research. Interdisciplinary water research is proposed to be context-based and focused on politics and management. Thus, principles underlying IWRM, such as public participation are gaining more attention because those principles enable sustainable water resource decisions to achieve socio-economic and ecological equity. 	This exploratory case study examines public participation in IWRM by looking at two villages in <b>Lao</b> <b>Peoples</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (Lao PDR). Participatory activities used to incorporate villages into water resource decisions are evaluated {{at different levels of}} government up to an international river basin organization known as the Mekong River Commission (MRC). The study uses a critical Third World political ecology perspective to elucidate water resource politics surrounding low levels of participation found among IWRM institutions in Lao PDR. Findings also reveal public participation in water resource decisions is politically complex. The participation of villages in water resource development decisions was related to issues surrounding national policies such as poverty alleviation, land allocations, resettlement, and swidden agriculture. Meanwhile, other types of participation were found in which villages could maintain control over their water interests. The study concludes more research is required surrounding water resource politics to better identify more effective and genuine participation of people whose livelihoods are dependent on water resources...|$|E
40|$|Rapid typing of Leptospira is {{currently}} impaired by requiring time consuming culture of leptospires. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop an assay that provides multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data direct from patient specimens while minimising costs for subsequent sequencing. An existing PCR based MLST scheme was modified by designing nested primers including anchors for facilitated subsequent sequencing. The assay was applied to various specimen types from patients diagnosed with leptospirosis between 2014 and 2015 in the United Kingdom (UK) and the <b>Lao</b> <b>Peoples</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (Lao PDR). Of 44 clinical samples (23 serum, 6 whole blood, 3 buffy coat, 12 urine) PCR positive for pathogenic Leptospira spp. at least one allele was amplified in 22 samples (50 %) and used for phylogenetic inference. Full allelic profiles were obtained from ten specimens, representing all sample types (23 %). No nonspecific amplicons were observed in any of the samples. Of twelve PCR positive urine specimens three gave full allelic profiles (25 %) and two a partial profile. Phylogenetic analysis allowed for species assignment. The predominant species detected was L. interrogans (10 / 14 and 7 / 8 from UK and Lao PDR, respectively). All other species were detected in samples from only one country (Lao PDR: L. borgpetersenii [1 / 8]; UK: L. kirschneri [1 / 14], L. santarosai [1 / 14], L. weilii [2 / 14]). Typing information of pathogenic Leptospira spp. was obtained directly from a variety of clinical samples using a modified MLST assay. This assay negates the need for time-consuming culture of Leptospira prior to typing and will be of use both in surveillance, as single alleles enable species determination, and outbreaks for the rapid identification of clusters...|$|E

Health Impact Assessment for Sustainable Water Management is a {{pioneering}} international text, exploring and developing this emerging discipline. It {{is the first}} to take an international perspective seeking to draw generic lessons from both the developed and developing nations' experience in this new area of activity. The approach is being applied in policy development to strengthen the 'evidence-base' and across a wide spectrum of resource developments, industrial and urban infrastructure projects and in 'aid' projects in developing countries. This book illustrates the importance of considering health in water management developments and demonstrates the role of health impact assessment (HIA) in this process. Case-studies illustrate a range of management approaches to different system implementation issues and scale factors, ranging from domestic rainwater harvesting for the supply of non-potable water to a large-scale hydroelectric project. The concept, objectives, terminology and challenges of HIA are introduced and illustrated by case studies including rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, sustainable drainage and evaluations of the health impacts of flooding. Developing country case studies include a small-scale irrigation project in Zimbabwe, a large hydro-electric scheme in <b>Lao</b> (<b>Peoples</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic)</b> and the implementation issues surrounding the use of domestic wastewater as a resource in demand by agricultural enterprises in Pakistan. The case studies illustrate different HIA approaches, including the use of quantitative and qualitative information and provide benchmarks of current practice for practitioners seeking to apply HIA in the emerging agendas in both developed and developing nations. The critical appraisals within each chapter offer both best practice exemplars as well as explanations of problems and mistakes of past project implementation, and define the requirements for the policy communities who will be increasingly required to accommodate HIA information in resource allocation decisions. As a result, this book will be of interest to planners, developers, policy makers, public health, environmental and water utility scientists and practitioners...|$|E
