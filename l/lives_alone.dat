40|$|The {{growth in}} single-person {{households}} is a pervasive behavioral {{phenomenon in the}} United States in the post-war period. In this paper we investigate determinants of the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone,</b> using 1970 data across states for single men and women ages 25 to 34 and for elderly widows. Income level {{appears to be a}} major determinant of the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> The estimated cross-state equations track about three-quarters of the increase in the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> between 1950 â€” 1976 and suggest that income growth has been the principal identified influence. Other variables found to affect (positively) the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> include mobility, schooling level, and for young people a measure of social climate; non-whites appear to have a somewhat lower propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; {{there is a direct}} quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and <b>lives</b> <b>alone</b> as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem does not have any of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery {{with the idea of a}} dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E
5|$|Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a {{survivor}} who lives just outside Boston, {{and is a}} business partner of Joel and Tess. A paranoid, aggressive and distrustful {{man in his late}} forties, Bill <b>lives</b> <b>alone</b> in a heavily fortified town, laden with booby traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds Bill in the hope that he will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for them to drive to Tommy's, but Bill insists that the only working car battery is in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging there, and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally <b>lives</b> <b>alone</b> or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E
5|$|Towers A and B {{are very}} similar to each other. All rooms in both towers are doubles, meaning that two people share each room. There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor, {{containing}} a large television and several couches and tables for studying. Communal and university-sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers. Every floor shares a communal bathroom, with several shower and restroom stalls. Each floor has twenty rooms, except for the lounge floors, which only have seventeen. Each floor's resident assistant <b>lives</b> <b>alone</b> in their respective room, meaning each floor houses 39 people. On the ground floor of Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weight equipment. A fully functioning post office and all student mailboxes are located {{on the ground floor of}} Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students, they are both designated as alcohol-free. Its distribution, sale, and consumption, is punished if discovered.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} the UK population <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> Little is known about deliberate self-harm (DSH) patients who <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> We conducted {{a study of the}} characteristics of DSH patients who <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> using data from the Oxford Monitoring System for Attempted Suicide. METHOD: Data on patients presenting to the general hospital in Oxford with an episode of DSH between 1993 and 2006 were analysed by gender and age group (15 - 24  years, 25 - 54  years and 55 + years) and according to whether or not they <b>lived</b> <b>alone.</b> RESULTS: In total, 1, 163 / 7, 865 (14. 8 %) patients <b>lived</b> <b>alone.</b> Having a problem with social isolation was more common in those living alone compared with those living with others, especially in those aged 55 + years. In the 25 - 54  years age group several variables concerning psychiatric problems were more common in those living alone, as was higher suicide intent associated with the current DSH episode and past DSH, and for females, repetition of DSH within 12  months. In patients aged 55 + years those living alone {{were more likely to have}} problems due to bereavement. Significantly more individuals living alone died from any cause. More also died by suicide, although the difference between the groups was non-significant after adjusting for age. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for psychiatric services assessing DSH patients who <b>live</b> <b>alone,</b> since, depending on the patient's age and living circumstances, different psychiatric and social interventions may be needed. Middle-aged DSH patients who <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> appear to be particularly vulnerable. DSH patients who <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> may not have supportive social networks and may be at increased risk of repetition of DSH and suicide...|$|R

Both of these novels had protagonists (Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus) who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated in a cave and living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy <b>lives</b> <b>alone</b> on the desert island for most of the story in Philosophus Autodidactus, the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in Theologus Autodidactus, developing into the first example of a science fiction novel.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{increasing}} numbers of older patients with advanced cancer <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> {{but there is little}} research on how well health services meet their needs. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the experiences and future preferences for care between two groups of older people with cancer in their last year of life; those who <b>live</b> <b>alone,</b> and those who live with co-resident carers. Methods: in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 32 people aged between 70 and 95 years who were living with cancer. They were recruited from general practices and hospice day care, when the responsible health professional answered no to the question, of whether they would be surprised if the patient died within twelve months. Twenty participants <b>lived</b> <b>alone.</b> Interviews were recorded and transcribed and the data analysed using a Framework approach, focussing on the differences and commonalities between the two groups. Results: many experiences were common to all participants, but had broader consequences for people who <b>lived</b> <b>alone.</b> Five themes are presented from the data: a perception that it is a disadvantage to <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> as a patient, the importance of relational continuity with health professionals, informal appraisal of care, place of care and future plans. People who <b>lived</b> <b>alone</b> perceived emotional and practical barriers to accessing care, and many shared an anxiety that they would have to move into a care home. Participants were concerned with remaining life, and all who <b>lived</b> <b>alone</b> had made plans for death but not for dying. Uncertainty of timescales and a desire to wait until they knew that death was imminent were some of the reasons given for not planning for future care needs. Conclusions: older people who <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> with cancer have emotional and practical concerns that are overlooked by their professional carers. Discussion and planning for the future, along with continuity in primary care may hold the key to enhancing end-of-life care for this group of patient...|$|R
