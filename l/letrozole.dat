5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, <b>letrozole,</b> megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Hormone therapies are a {{topic of}} current {{research}} in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include tamoxifen, <b>letrozole,</b> and anastrozole. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in {{a small number of}} people with advanced ovarian cancer. <b>Letrozole</b> may help to slow or stop growth of estrogen receptor positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.|$|E
500|$|There is also {{research}} in progress on more genes and biomarkers {{that may be}} linked to endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated. Preliminary research has shown that the levonorgestrel IUD placed for a year, combined with 6monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women. An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors. [...] Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer, including use of aromatase inhibitors, is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer. One such drug is anastrozole, which is currently being researched in hormone-positive recurrences after chemotherapy. Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well. It includes trials of drugs like mifepristone, a progestin antagonist, and aminoglutethimide and <b>letrozole,</b> two aromatase inhibitors.|$|E
2500|$|Some cancer {{treatments}} like bexarotene, busulfan, chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, <b>letrozole,</b> lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecan ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that 60% of ovarian tumors have {{estrogen}} receptors, ovarian cancer is only rarely responsive to hormonal treatments. Estrogen alone {{does not have an}} effect on the cancer, and tamoxifen and <b>letrozole</b> are rarely effective. [...] "Some women with borderline malignancy ovarian cancer and stromal ovarian cancer may receive hormonal therapy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some breast cancers require {{estrogen}} {{to continue}} growing. They {{can be identified}} {{by the presence of}} estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. tamoxifen, or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an aromatase inhibitor, e.g. anastrozole or <b>letrozole.</b> The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. <b>Letrozole</b> is recommended for 5 years. [...] Aromatase inhibitors are only suitable for women after menopause; however, in this group, they appear better than tamoxifen. This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors should not be given to premenopausal women with intact ovarian function (unless they are also on treatment to stop their ovaries from working).|$|E
2500|$|Aromatase is {{an enzyme}} which {{converts}} some enones with a six membered ring to aromatic rings - specifically testosterone to estradiol and androstenedione to estrone. [...] Each of these aromatizations involves the oxidation of the C-19 methyl group to formic acid {{to allow for}} the formation of the aromatic system, conversions which are necessary parts of estrogen tumorogenesis in the development of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women and gynecomastia in men. Aromatase inhibitors like exemestane (which forms a permanent and deactivating bond with the aromatase enzyme) and anastrozole and <b>letrozole</b> (which compete for the enzyme) {{have been shown to be}} more effective than anti-estrogen medications such as tamoxifen likely because they prevent the formation of estradiol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Letrozole</b> {{has been}} used for ovarian {{stimulation}} by fertility doctors since 2001 because it has fewer side-effects than clomiphene (Clomid) and less chance of multiple gestation. A study of 150 babies following treatment with <b>letrozole</b> or <b>letrozole</b> and gonadotropins presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine 2005 Conference found no difference in overall abnormalities but did find a significantly higher rate of locomotor and cardiac abnormalities among the group having taken <b>letrozole</b> compared to natural conception. A larger, follow-up study with 911 babies compared those born following treatment with <b>letrozole</b> to those born following treatment with clomiphene. That study also found {{no significant difference in the}} rate of overall abnormalities, but found that congenital cardiac anomalies was significantly higher in the clomiphene group compared to the <b>letrozole</b> group. Despite this, India banned the usage of <b>letrozole</b> in 2011, citing potential risks to infants. In 2012, an Indian parliamentary committee said that the drug controller office colluded with letrozole's makers to approve the drug for infertility in India and also stated that letrozole's use for infertility was illegal worldwide; however, such off-label uses are legal in many countries such as the US and UK.|$|E
5000|$|One of Pritchard’s self-proclaimed “eureka” moments {{was in a}} {{clinical}} trial concerning {{the use of the}} drug <b>Letrozole</b> as an adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women who had taken tamoxifen for five years as a primary breast cancer treatment. <b>Letrozole</b> is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces estrogen production, which is necessary for tumor growth. Pritchard followed over 5,000 postmenopausal women that had taken tamoxifen for their breast cancer and treated them with either <b>Letrozole</b> or a placebo. <b>Letrozole</b> treatment reduced {{the risk of breast cancer}} recurrence by over 40%. The study ended early because of overwhelmingly positive results. The drug also prevented metastasis of the cancer to other regions of the body. Results from this clinical study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2003, and two years later the therapy was approved by Health Canada. Later studies suggested that extending treatment with an aromatase inhibitor like <b>Letrozole</b> to ten years further increases disease-free survival rates. [...] Another study looked at the effects of adjuvant therapies like <b>Letrozole</b> in women of different ages, both premenopausal and postmenopausal. Pritchard found that <b>Letrozole</b> favorably impacted women in both groups but was overall more effective in premenopausal women that had been previously treated with tamoxifen. The overarching conclusion from this study was that anti-estrogen treatments like <b>Letrozole</b> generally benefit patients when administered anytime after the primary treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Letrozole</b> {{prevents}} the aromatase from producing estrogens by competitive, reversible binding to the heme of its cytochrome P450 unit. The action is specific, and <b>letrozole</b> does not reduce production of mineralo- or corticosteroids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Letrozole</b> {{has also}} been shown to delay the fusing of the growth plates in mice. When used in {{combination}} with growth hormone, <b>letrozole</b> has been shown effective in one adolescent boy with a short stature.|$|E
50|$|Aromatase inhibitors show {{promising}} results.
