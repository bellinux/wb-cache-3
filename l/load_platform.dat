50|$|Control of the 12-15 cwt {{model was}} by a bar-type {{accelerator}} pedal, which controlled {{the operation of}} several electro-magnetic contactors. Series resistances were used to limit the current {{on the first two}} stages of the controller. The front hubs were mounted on taper roller bearings, while the back axle included double-reduction gearing and a removable differential, to assist maintenance. The transmission between the motor and the rear axle was by a shaft fitted with two Hardy Spicer universal joints. The brakes were manufactured by the Bendix Corporation, and both the foot and hand brakes operated on all four wheels. Although all models seemed to be classified as 12-15 cwt, the standard design had a <b>load</b> <b>platform</b> which was 8 ft long, while short chassis and long chassis variants were also produced, with platforms of 7.25 ft and 9 ft.|$|E
50|$|The High Dive ride {{is located}} in the Spanish Castle portion of the park. The <b>load</b> <b>platform</b> and {{splashdown}} pool are located outdoors, below the castle, with an observation deck/splash zone overhead. The ride vehicles ascend into the building, through an automated guillotine door, and into a spiraling fog vortex. Once at the top, the vehicle splashes down into a flume, which curves through the upper story of the building. This is the dark ride portion, which features a number of special effects including fog, blacklight effects, wind, animated figures and a 20 foot high parting waterfall. The vehicles then exit the building and curve around the rear of the castle before being released down the 65 foot slide into the splash pool. The ride system is by Arrow Dynamics. The ride is shown in the photograph reproduced to the right.|$|E

5000|$|The facelifted model, never {{offered in}} New Zealand, had twin {{headlamps}} as standard {{and a more}} integrated dash panel. Floor shift, rather than column change, was also standard.In January 1967 domestic market deliveries began of the Vauxhall Cresta estate car. This vehicle resulted from a conversion by Martin Walter of Folkestone, a firm better known for their (primarily Bedford based) Dormobile motorhome conversions. [...] The estate version was 2+1/2 in higher than the saloon due {{to a combination of}} heavy-duty rear suspension, an increase in the outer diameter of the tyres (to 7.00-14 in from 5.90-14in) and the modified roof line. The Cresta estate was initially offered in the UK at £1,507, which represented a price premium of around 40% over the equivalent saloon. [...] The long established Humber Hawk estate and recently introduced Ford Zephyr estate carried UK sales prices of £1,342 and £1,379 respectively. The Cresta estate offered a <b>load</b> <b>platform</b> length of 47 in which increased to an impressive 76 in when the back seat was folded down, but Vauxhall's contender was never priced to be a big seller and the last estate cars were made in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|BREM-2 (BREM {{stands for}} bronirovannaya remonto-evakuatsionnaya mashina - armored maintenance-recovery vehicle) - The turret {{has been removed}} and {{replaced}} by an armored plate. The vehicle is fitted with a <b>load</b> <b>platform</b> with a capacity of 1.5 tonnes, a crane with a 1.5-tonne capacity (7 tonnes with additional outfit), which is placed {{on top of the}} hull and a pull winch with a 6.5-tonne capacity (19.5 tonnes with block pulley), which is placed inside. It also carries additional repair and recovery equipment on the top and sides of the hull. This equipment includes a tow bar, 200 meters of rope, heavy tools, electric welding equipment and excavating tools. There is a dozer blade {{at the front of the}} hull which is used to brace the BREM-2 while it is using its crane. The vehicle was developed in 1982. Its primary role of is the repair and recovery of IFVs from the BMP family of vehicles under field conditions. It is armed with a PKT machine gun for which it carries 1,000 rounds and has six 81 mm 902V [...] "Tucha" [...] smoke grenade launchers (in addition to the standard TDA thermal smoke generator). It weighs 13.6 tonnes and has a crew of three. Late BREM-2 ARVs have flotation sides-skirts/mudguards from the BMP-2. Some BMP-1s have been converted into BREM-2 ARVs by tank repair workshops of the Ministry of Defense from 1986 onwards.|$|E

40|$|Globally, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} cyanobacterial toxins, in blooms from fresh and brackish waters, are the cyclic peptide toxins of the microcystin family. The need for on-site algal-toxin monitoring has become increasingly urgent due to the amplified demand for fresh-water and for safe, ‘toxinfree’ shellfish and fish stocks. Along with routine testing of shellfish stocks for biotoxins including microcystin, the EU also require routine monitoring {{for the presence of}} the causative algal species. Herein, we describe a novel, Lab-On-A-Disc (<b>LOAD)</b> <b>platform</b> which has been developed to assess microcystin toxin levels in-situ. Using recombinant antibody technology, the <b>LOAD</b> <b>platform</b> combines immunofluorescence with centrifugally driven microfluidic liquid handling to achieve a next-generation disposable device for high throughput sampling. A low-complexity, ‘LED-Photodiode’ based optical sensing system was tailor-made for the system, which allows the fluorescence signal of the microcystin-specific reaction to be quantified. This system can rapidly and accurately detect the presence of microcystin in less than 10 minutes with minimum user interaction and maximum reproducibility. This method provides a low cost diagnostic alternative to the current laborious and costly methods used for toxin monitoring...|$|E

40|$|A multi-marker {{approach}} is increasingly considered in diagnosis {{of prostate cancer}} to minimize the number of unnecessary biopsies [1].

In order to avoid interference during absorbance measurement from the solid phase in this heterogeneous assay format, it is pivotal that the intermediate reaction product is eventually forwarded from the incubation chamber to a distinct optical measurement chamber. To this end we have devised routing of flows by lipophilic film valves (LFVs) which remain intact in aqueous and selectively dissolve when exposed to an ancillary, oleophilic solvent...|$|E

The physical modelling of the system consists in simulating fictional soft soil settlement through downward displacement of a perforated tray above a network of rigid piles placed in the centrifuge swinging basket.

Elasto-plastic and hypoplastic constitutive models have been used to predict the behaviour of the granular mattress, which simulates a <b>Load</b> <b>Platform</b> Transfer (LPT). A two-dimensional, axisymmetrical model has been adopted, which fulfils the validation on the experimental test and the time needed for calculation.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} high {{precision}} leveling control of an underwater heavy <b>load</b> <b>platform,</b> which {{is viewed as}} an underwater parallel robot {{on the basis of}} its work pattern. The kinematic of platform with deformation is analyzed and the dynamics model of joint space is established. An adaptive backstepping controller according to Lyapunov's function is proposed for leveling control of platform based on joint space. Furthermore, the “lowest point fixed angle error” leveling scheme called “chase” is chosen for leveling control of platform. The digital simulation and practical experiment of single joint space actuator are carried out, and the results show high precision servo control of joint space. On the basis of this, the platform leveling control simulation relies on the hardware-in-loop system. The results indicate that the proposed controller can effectively restrain the influence from system parameter uncertainties and external disturbance to realize high precision leveling control of the underwater platform...|$|E
