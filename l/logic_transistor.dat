40|$|Abstract—Recently {{there has}} been {{tremendous}} progress made in the research of novel nanotechnology for future nanoelectronic applications. In particular, several emerging nanoelectronic de-vices such as carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors (FETs), Si nanowire FETs, and planar III–V compound semiconductor (e. g., InSb, InAs) FETs, all hold promise as potential device candidates to be integrated onto the silicon platform for enhancing circuit functionality and also for extending Moore’s Law. For high-perfor-mance and low-power <b>logic</b> <b>transistor</b> applications, {{it is important that}} these research devices are frequently benchmarked against the existing Si <b>logic</b> <b>transistor</b> data in order to gauge the progress of research. In this paper, we use four key device metrics to com-pare these emerging nanoelectronic devices to the state-of-the-art planar and nonplanar Si logic transistors. These four metrics include: 1) or intrinsic gate delay versus physical gate length; 2) energy-delay product versus; 3) subthreshold slope versus; and 4) versus on-to-off-state current ratio ON OFF. The results of this benchmarking exercise indicate that while these novel nanoelectronic devices show promise and opportunities for future logic applications, there still remain shortcomings in the device characteristics and electrostatics that need to be overcome. We believe that benchmarking is a key element in accelerating the progress of nanotechnology research for <b>logic</b> <b>transistor</b> applications.

40|$|As {{transistor}} {{switching speed}} improves, synchronizing a global clock increasingly degrades system performance. Therefore, self-timed asynchronous logic becomes potentially faster than synchronous logic.

Most techniques {{can be applied}} equally well to asynchronous logic, indeed phase alignment is easier; but combining dynamic and asynchronous logic is more difficult.

40|$|Abstract — The {{complexity}} in timing optimization of highperformance microprocessors {{has been increasing}} {{with the number of}} channel-connected transistors in various paths of dynamic CMOS circuits and the rising magnitude of process variations in nanometer CMOS process. In this paper, a process variation aware transistor sizing algorithm for dynamic CMOS circuits while considering the Load Balance of Multiple Paths (LBMP) is proposed. The proposed iterative optimization algorithm is a deterministic approach and is illustrated first by a 2 -b weighted binary-tothermometric converter (WBTC) and of which the critical path was optimized from an initial delay of 355 ps to an optimal delay of 157 ps, which accounts for a 55. 77 % delay improvement. A 4 -b unity weight binary-to-thermometric converter (UWBTC) was also designed and of which the critical path was optimized from an initial delay of 152 ps to an optimal delay of 103 ps, which accounts for a 32. 23 % delay improvement.

III-V materials in general have significantly higher electron mobility than Si and can potentially {{play a major role}} along with Si in future high-speed, low-power computing. The major potential advantage of using a III-V quantum-well field-effect transistor as a <b>logic</b> <b>transistor</b> is that it can be operated under very low supply voltage (e. g., 0. 5 V), and hence, lower power dissipation while still achieving very high speed. Compared to other emerging high-mobility materials, such as, carbon nanotubes and semiconductor nanowires, which require “bottom-up ” chemical synthesis for formation and suffer from the fundamental placement problem, III-V materials are far more practical in terms of patterning. However, many significant challenges remain to be overcome before III-V materials become applicable for future high-speed, low-power logic applications. These include (i) finding a compatible high-κ gate dielectric on III-Vs, (ii) demonstrating gate length scalability below 35 nm with acceptable ION/IOFF ratio, (iii) improving the hole mobility in III-Vs or finding the right p-channel FET for the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) configuration, and (iv) integrating III-V materials onto the Si substrate.

40|$|AbstractÐThe {{semiconductor}} industry roadmap projects that advances in VLSI technology will permit {{more than one}} billion transistors on a chip by the year 2010. The MIT Raw microprocessor is a proposed architecture that strives to exploit these chip-level resources by implementing thousands of tiles, each comprising a processing element and {{a small amount of}} memory, coupled by a static two-dimensional interconnect. A compiler partitions fine-grain instruction-level parallelism across the tiles and statically schedules intertile communication over the interconnect. Because Raw microprocessors fully expose their internal hardware structure to the software, they {{can be viewed as a}} gigantic FPGA with coarse-grained tiles in which software orchestrates communication over static interconnections. One open challenge in Raw architectures is to determine their optimal grain size and balance. The grain size is the area of each tile and the balance is the proportion of area in each tile devoted to memory, processing, communication, and off-chip global I/O. If the total chip area is fixed, higher processing power per tile requires large tiles and hence reduces the total number of tiles on the chip. This paper presents SimpleFit, a novel analytical framework that designers can use to reason about the design space of Raw microprocessors. Our model is also generalizable to multiprocessors on a chip. Based on an architectural model, an application model, and a VLSI cost analysis, the framework computes the performance of applications and uses an optimization process to identify designs that will execute these applications most cost-effectively. Although the optimal machine configurations obtained vary for different applications, problem sizes, and budgets, the general trends for various applications are similar. Accordingly, for the applications studied, assuming a onr billion <b>logic</b> <b>transistor</b> equivalent area, we recommend building a Raw chip wit...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{theoretical}} and experimental concentration and temperature dependent band gap narrowing in uncompensated n-type silicon is studied. Electron-electron and electron-impurity interaction energies {{are used to}} calculate the theoretical band gap narrowing in the plasmon-pole approximation. These reveal an increase of 14 meV in the band gap narrowing at 300 K for a donor concentration of 3. 10 (^ 19) cm(^- 3) above the zero temperature value of 95 meV. For higher concentrations the degeneracy deepens and the zero and finite temperature band gap narrowing curves converge. Localized states in the band gap resulting from local fluctuations in the electron-impurity interaction, a result of the random position of the impurities, are also considered. When the analysis includes the effect on the host band of the electron-impurity interactions calculated above the resulting density of states in the band tail of uncompensated silicon is found to be ten times smaller than is usually imagined.

However, these inorganic materials have faced two different fundamental limitations, flexibility for wearable applications and scaling limitation as logic transistors. As a result, the organic and two dimensional have been studied intentionally for various fields. In the present dissertation, three different studies will be presented with followed order; (1) the chemical response of organic semiconductor in NO 2 exposure. (2) The surface and stability of WSe 2 in ambient air. (3) Deposition of dielectric on two dimensional materials using organometallic seeding layer. The organic molecules rely on the van der Waals interaction during growth of thin films, contrast to covalent bond inorganic semiconductors. Therefore, the morphology and electronic property at surface of organic semiconductor in micro scale is more sensitive to change in gaseous conditions. In addition, metal phthalocyanine, {{which is one of}} organic semiconductor materials, change their electronic property as reaction with gaseous analytes, suggesting as potential chemical sensing platforms. In the present part, the growth behavior of metal phthalocyanine and surface response to gaseous condition will be elucidated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In second part, the surface of layered transition metal dichalcogenides and their chemical response to exposure ambient air will be investigated, using STM. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted widespread attention in the scientific community for electronic device applications because improved electrostatic gate control and suppression of short channel leakage resulted from their atomic thin body. To fabricate the transistor based on TMDs, TMDs should be exposed to ambient conditions, while the effect of air exposure has not been understood fully. In this part, the effect of ambient air on TMDs will be investigated and partial oxidation of TMDs. In the last part, uniform deposition of dielectric layers on 2 D materials will be presented, employing organic seedling layer. Although 2 D materials have been expected as next generation semiconductor platform, direct deposition of dielectric is still challenging and induces leakage current commonly, because inertness of their surface resulted from absent of dangling bond.
