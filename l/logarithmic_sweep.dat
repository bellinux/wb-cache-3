Novel wavelets constructed to extract modal damping and frequency explicitly from the data are introduced. The so-called Haley and Laplace wavelets are used to track time-varying modal damping and frequency in a matching pursuit algorithm.

With the levels of processing that are available today, some very sophisticated solutions are available in RF network analyzers. Here the reflection and transmission data is formatted to enable the information to be interpreted as easily as possible. Most RF network analyzers incorporate features including linear and <b>logarithmic</b> <b>sweeps,</b> linear and log formats, polar plots, Smith charts, etc. Trace markers, limit lines and also pass / fail criteria may also be added in many instances.|$|R

The parameter number_of_harmonics sets {{the number of}} harmonic components to plot in the analysis phase, so that value 3, for example, would correspond to the linear response and the 2 nd and 3 rd harmonic distortion components to be drawn. As a rule of thumb, the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) decreases with increasing harmonic numbers, so it is often not advisable to try to analyze a large number of harmonics (e.g., > 6), unless long excitation signals (several seconds) are used.|$|E
40|$|Time-frequency signal {{representations}} {{combined with}} subspace identification methods {{were used to}} analyze aeroelastic flight data from the F/A- 18 Systems Research Aircraft (SRA) and aeroservoelastic data from the F/A- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). The F/A- 18 SRA data were produced from a wingtip excitation system that generated linear frequency chirps and <b>logarithmic</b> <b>sweeps.</b> HARV data were acquired from digital Schroeder-phased and sinc pulse excitation signals to actuator commands. Nondilated continuous Morlet wavelets implemented as a filter bank were chosen for the time-frequency analysis to eliminate phase distortion as it occurs with sliding window discrete Fourier transform techniques. Wavelet coefficients were filtered to reduce effects of noise and nonlinear distortions identically in all inputs and outputs. Cleaned reconstructed time domain signals were used to compute improved transfer functions. Time and frequency domain subspace identification methods were applied to enhanced reconstructed time domain data and improved transfer functions, respectively. Time domain subspace performed poorly, even with the enhanced data, compared with frequency domain techniques. A frequency domain subspace method is shown to produce better results with the data processed using the Morlet time-frequency technique. NOMENCLATURE a wavelet scaling paramete...|$|R
40|$|Open plan classrooms, {{where several}} class bases {{share the same}} space, have {{recently}} re-emerged in Australian primary schools. This study compared the acoustics of four different Kindergarten classrooms: an enclosed classroom with 25 students, a double classroom with 44 students, a linear fully open plan triple classroom with 91 students, and a semi-open plan K- 6 classroom with 205 students. Ambient noise levels, intrusive noise levels, occupied background noise levels, and teacher’s speech levels were recorded during different activities. Room impulse responses using <b>logarithmic</b> <b>sweeps</b> were also recorded for different teaching scenarios. From these recordings, signal-to-noise ratios, speech transmission index scores, and reverberation times were calculated. The results revealed much higher intrusive noise levels in the two largest open plan classrooms, resulting in signal-to-noise ratios and speech transmission index scores to be well below those recommended in classrooms with students of this age. Additionally, occupied background noise levels in all classrooms were well above recommended levels. These results suggest noise in classrooms needs to be better controlled, and open plan classrooms {{are unlikely to be}} appropriate learning environments for young children due to their high intrusive noise levels. The impact of noise on children’s learning and teacher’s vocal health are discussed. 11 page(s...|$|R
30|$|The logsweep {{analysis}} {{technique is}} an ingenious device for analyzing static harmonic distortion {{as a function}} of frequency. Introduced by Farina in 2000 [2], the basic idea behind the logsweep analysis technique is to insert a <b>logarithmic</b> sine <b>sweep</b> signal with fixed amplitude to the system, and then convolve the time-reversed and amplitude weighted excitation signal with the system response. As a result, one obtains an impulse response signal, where the response of each harmonic distortion component is separated in time from the linear response and each other. If the duration of the logsweep signal is long enough, the time separation between the harmonic impulse responses is clear and it is straightforward to cut the individual harmonic responses and represent them in the frequency domain. As a result, one obtains magnitude response plots for the linear response and each harmonic distortion component.|$|R
40|$|In present work, an {{acoustic}} characterisation of the University of Genoa cavitation tunnel is presented, {{with the aim}} to obtain suitable transfer functions {{in order to take}} into account (at least partially) the effects of the confined environment, particularly important for small-scale facility like the one considered. The acoustic characterisation is performed considering two hydrophones in significantly different positions (inside the tunnel and in an external tank), typical, for different reasons, of noise measurements in cavitation tunnel; the procedure is based on the <b>logarithmic</b> sine <b>sweep</b> signal. The obtained transfer functions have been applied to a series of measurements of model propellers in correspondence to considerably different functioning conditions, in terms of cavitation number and propeller loading, showing the applicability of the procedure and the improvement of the measurement quality, in view of predictions in full scale...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Techniques {{based on}} {{impulsive}} sources are used {{since the beginning}} of the Underwater Acoustic science, to evaluate the distance of objects and to plot the profile of the sea bottom. In this paper the authors investigate the behavior of three not-impulsive techniques for the measurement of impulse responses: MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) signal, linear sine <b>sweep</b> and <b>logarithmic</b> sine <b>sweep.</b> This work will focus the attention on advantages and defects of these tree different methods, in comparison with the traditional pulse-based sonar techniques. The mathematical theory for the generation of the MLS, sine sweep signals and for the deconvolution of the system’s impulse response are first described. Then a software implementation of the measurement methods, based on the creation of plug-ins for a shareware waveform editor, running on a low cost PC is demonstrated. Some experiments conducted under controlled conditions and in the sea show that the proposed techniques produce images of the bottom profile with higher signal-to-noise ratio and better spatial resolution than those obtainable with the impulsive technique. Moreover signal-to-noise ratio increases using sine sweep signal instead of MLS one. The new techniques seem superior also for some practical aspects connected with their very nature, which make them almost inaudible and makes the sound source barely localizable: this is very important for military applications...|$|R
40|$|Frequency modulations {{occur in}} many natural sounds, {{including}} vocalizations. The neuronal response to frequency modulated (FM) stimuli {{has been studied}} extensively in different brain areas, {{with an emphasis on}} the auditory cortex and the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. Here, we measured the responses to FM sweeps in whole-cell recordings from neurons in the dorsal cortex of the mouse inferior colliculus. Both up- and downward <b>logarithmic</b> FM <b>sweeps</b> were presented at two different speeds to both the ipsi- and the contralateral ear. Based on the number of action potentials that were fired, between 10 - 24 % of cells were selective for rate or direction of the FM sweeps. A somewhat lower percentage of cells, 6 - 21 %, showed selectivity based on EPSP size. To study the mechanisms underlying the generation of FM selectivity, we compared FM responses with responses to simple tones in the same cells. We found that if pairs of neurons responded in a similar way to simple tones, they generally also responded in a similar way to FM sweeps. Further evidence that FM selectivity can be generated within the dorsal cortex was obtained by reconstructing FM sweeps from the response to simple tones using three different models. In about half of the direction selective neurons the selectivity was generated by spectrally asymmetric synaptic inhibition. In addition, evidence for direction selectivity based on the timing of excitatory responses was also obtained in some cells. No clear evidence for the local generation of rate selectivity was obtained. We conclude that FM direction selectivity can be generated within the dorsal cortex of the mouse inferior colliculus by multiple mechanisms...|$|R

The admittance characteristics of both wafers {{indicate the presence}} of defect states within the oxide, in common {{with a number of}} other oxides on In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As. The two wafers studied have not been hydrogen annealed, but do show some similar features to FGA treated oxides on n+ substrates. We discuss how the possible presence of residual hydroxyl ions in as-grown Al 2 O 3 may explain these similarities and also account for many of the changes in the properties of FGA treated n+ samples. The issues around the comparison of subthreshold swing (SS) results and the impact of transistor design parameters on the energy portion of the defect state distribution affecting efficient device switching are discussed. The interface state model is applied to low source-drain voltage SS data to extract an effective interface state density (Dit) that includes interface and oxide traps. The <b>logarithmic</b> gate voltage <b>sweep</b> rate dependence of the SS Dit is used to extract an oxide trap density (Dot) and a simple method is used to estimate the Fermi level position within the band gap, Et.
