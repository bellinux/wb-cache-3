Despite that we not include complex ice shelf physics or grounding <b>line</b> <b>mechanics</b> in our model and treat the process of marine melting in a simple manner, our experiments are the necessary first steps toward providing a comprehensive reconstruction of the former ice-sheet/ice-shelf system in the Arctic Ocean. A series of model runs was performed where ice shelf mass balance and ice shelf strain per unit time (strain rate) were adjusted. The mass balance and shelf ice strain rate are the key model parameters that govern the flux of ice into the Arctic Ocean. Grounding on the Lomonosov Ridge was not modeled when the ice shelf strain rate was 0. 005 year- 1 (i. e. a free flowing ice shelf). Even with low rates (3 ̆c 10 cm/year) of basal melting, the ice shelf thickness was always less than 100 m over {{the central part of the}} ridge. Our experiment suggests that grounding on the Lomonosov Ridge by a free-flowing ice shelf is not possible. When the strain rate in the shelf ice was reduced to zero, however, the shelf thickness increased substantially. Such conditions are likely only to have occurred during periods of large-scale glaciation if substantial stagnant and thickened sea ice was present in the ocean, buttressing the ice shelf flowing from the Barents Sea. A comprehensive study using a coupled icesheet/ shelf/sea-ice model would build on these preliminary results and have the potential to further constrain the history of circum-Arctic Ocean ice sheets...|$|R

Since motion is {{by its very nature}} a directed phenomenon, it seems puzzling that two scalar quantities should be sufficient to entirely describe motion. Yet {{it is a fact that}} these two scalar quantities contain the complete dynamics of even the most complicated system, when used with one of the most fundamental physical principlles, the principle of "least action".

40|$|Wrinkling {{has been}} {{employed}} by many organisms to form unique topography, such as fingerprints, gut villi, and surface of flower petal cells. The wavy wrinkle structure provides friction enhancement, surface area increase, optical, and wetting properties improvement. Inspired by Nature, scientists have created wrinkles synthetically and proposed numerous uses for them. However, wrinkling surfaces encounters limitations on achieving massive area and high amplitude-to-wavelength ratio (aspect ratio). The three phase contact line wrinkling technique creates well-defined wrinkles {{in a continuous}} fashion, and has great potential to scale-up for massive production. In addition to the velocity dependent adhesion force, we find the film deformed by the surface tension also contributes to the wrinkle amplitude and pattern. We refine the contact <b>line</b> <b>mechanics</b> with the material properties for the wrinkle aspect ratio and the pattern. (Chapter 2) It has been known the aspect ratio of wrinkles {{is a function of}} the square root of applied strain until the wrinkling transitions into the strain localization modes. The localization modes, e. g. folding, have very different topographical structures and distinct properties to the wrinkles, and are undesired for wrinkling applications. This restricts the aspect ratio of the wrinkles reported in literature to be less than 0. 3, limiting the functionalities of the wrinkling surfaces. To understand the transition to the localization mode, we create inhomogeneous wrinkled surfaces that have alternating flat and wrinkling regions, and study the distribution of applied global strain. We find that the distribution of the applied strain is neither localized nor homogenized by the initial inhomogeneity. (Chapter 3) We further explore the limitation of the aspect ratio. In this thesis, delaying the localization transition to larger strains is the main strategy to access high aspect ratio wrinkles. We use two approaches to influence the onset of the strain localization. The first approach is the substrate prestretch, a practical method as it is also popular to create wrinkles. The amount of prestretch is found to delay localizations, and appropriate material properties are selected to avoid surface fractures. (Chapter 4) The second approach demonstrated a concept inspired from living organisms, which stabilizes wrinkles by reducing the stress. We rearranging the crosslinking network to minimize the traction forces during the growth of aspect ratio. This is described by the reduction of the strain energy in the substrate. (Chapter 5) These approaches allow us to achieve an aspect ratio three times larger (0. 9) than that reported previously in the literature...|$|R

The current program aims to develop and verify models of crack growth in high level waste tanks under accidental overloads such as ground settlement, earthquakes and airplane crashes based on extending current fracture mechanics methods. While studies in fracture have advanced, the mechanics have not included extensive crack growth. For problems at the INEEL, Savannah River Site and Hanford there are serious limitations to current theories regarding growth of surface cracks through the thickness and the extension of through-thickness cracks. We propose to further develop and extend slip <b>line</b> fracture <b>mechanics</b> (SLFM, a ductile fracture modeling methodology) and, if need be, other ductile fracture characterizing approaches {{with the goal of}} predicting growth of surface cracks to the point o f penetration of the opposing surface.

These objectives will build the groundwork for a reliable predictive model of fracture in the HLW storage tanks that will also be applicable to standardized spent nuclear fuel storage canisters.
