This is required for sailboats to move in directions other than downwind, since {{the force of the}} sail is never closer than 45 degrees to the apparent wind. Since most sailboats are symmetric along their axis of motion, when sailing upright, the lateral force can come from either side, which means that centreboards must use symmetric foil shapes so they will operate with equal efficiency on either tack. The more a yacht heels the more asymmetric its hull shape becomes.|$|R

In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the centrifugal force plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered, but that is not so. A turntable for which the Coriolis force is the only factor is the parabolic turntable.

40|$|Two {{competing}} {{models have}} been presented {{to explain how the}} heterocercal tail functions during locomotion in sharks. First, the classical model of locomotion in sharks proposes that the heterocercal tail functions by transmitting posteroventral momentum to the water during steady horizontal swimming, thereby producing an anterodorsal reaction force (Alexander, 1965; Ferry and Lauder, 1996; Lauder, 2000). Since this reaction force is directed above the center of mass, it produces a torque around the center of mass that must be counteracted by lift forces generated at the anterior end of the body. According to the classical model, the pectoral fins are thought to be upwardly inclined and are believed to generate the <b>lift</b> forces <b>countering</b> the torque produced by the heterocercal tail in order to achieve rotational equilibrium. Wilga and Lauder (2000, 2001) have shown experimentally that the pectoral fins of two species of shark do not in fact generate lift forces during steady horizontal locomotion, although they do play an active hydrodynamic role during maneuvering.

When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction.|$|R
2500|$|Another problem {{discovered}} by the jet fighters was unexpectedly dropping a wing at high speeds and high altitudes. This was traced to manufacturing defects in the wings that made no difference at low speeds and altitudes, but meant that each wing had a slightly different airfoil and hence, a different amount of <b>lift.</b> To <b>counter</b> this Sergey Ilyushin and his team developed a new manufacturing technique that reversed the traditional practice where the internal supporting members were affixed to the assembly jig and the aircraft's skin panels were then attached. This new method meant that the skin panels {{were placed in the}} jigs where the correct curvature and shape could be guaranteed and the internal structure was then fastened to them. This required that manufacturing joints be used along the chord lines of the wings and tail surfaces, which split the spars and ribs in half. [...] Similarly, the fuselage was built the same way, although it was split vertically along the centerline. This new technique did impose a small weight penalty, but had the unexpected advantage of greatly accelerating the assembly process as the internal equipment could be installed before the halves were joined together. This allowed several teams to work on a single sub-assembly before they were mated.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} incorporation of a twin-stream fan into the CIRSTEL tail boom. The Combined Infra-Red Suppression and Tail rotor Elimination (CIRSTEL) tail boom is a system designed to replace the tail rotor on a conventional helicopter. It relies on the Coanda effect to create circulation around the helicopter tail boom when exposed to the rotor downwash. This generates sideways-directed <b>lift</b> to <b>counter</b> the main rotor torque, and a tail thruster adds extra torque and directional control. A twin-stream fan supplies separate air streams {{to each of the}} Coanda and tail thruster sections. The first section of the study {{describes the}} experimental tests done on an 83 % scale demonstrator of the twin-stream fan with the objective to verify the concept and determine the fan section efficiencies. Subsequent modifications done to the fan stator blades are also evaluated. The efficiencies of the design were shown to exceed the targets in both sections. The section concludes with design recommendations for a future fan, based on the findings of the experiments. A brief analysis of the CIRSTEL system is presented and by using optimisation techniques the predicted power demand of the system could be significantly reduced from a conventional tail rotor. The second section of the study details the conceptual design and CFD evaluation of air intakes for the fan that can be fitted to the helicopter. The objective here was to study the flow affecting helicopter intakes as well as to establish design considerations for a fan intake. A basic intake concept was developed for the Alouette III/CIRSTEL combination and modified according to results based on the CFD simulations. The intake design was evolved to the point were it was shown that the concept is feasible. These CFD simulations were an initial effort to design the fan intakes {{with the help of a}} simplified rotor flow field. The investigation was subsequently extended to investigate helicopter intake design considerations in the presence of a representative rotor, which was modelled as an actuator disk in the CFD simulations. In this investigation top and side mounted intake concepts were compared and analysed for suitability as a fan intake. Each intake concept showed its own advantages. Due to the proximity of the rotor hub to the intake, distortion and total pressure levels at the fan face are influenced negatively. The report is concluded with design recommendations for the intake as applied to the current Alouette III configuration, as well as for implementation on helicopters in general...|$|R

40|$|Background: Handball is a {{physical}} contact sport that includes frequent overhead throwing, and this combination leads to {{a high rate of}} shoulder injuries. Several factors have been associated with shoulder injuries in overhead athletes, but strong scientific evidence is lacking for most suggested risk factors. We therefore designed the Karolinska Handball Study (KHAST) with the aim to identify risk factors for shoulder injuries in adolescent male and female elite handball players studying at handball-profiled secondary schools in Sweden. Secondary objectives are to investigate whether shoulder function changes during the competition season and whether the physical profile of the players changes during their time in secondary school. Methods: Players aged 15 to 19 years were included during the pre-season period of the 2014 - 2015 and the 2015 - 2016 seasons. At inclusion, players signed informed consent and filled in a questionnaire regarding playing position, playing level, previous handball experience, history of shoulder problems and athletic identity. Players also completed a detailed test battery at baseline evaluating the shoulder, neck and trunk. Players were then prospectively monitored weekly during the 2014 - 2015 and/or 2015 - 2016 competitive seasons regarding injuries and training/match workload. Results from the annual routine physical tests in the secondary school curriculum including bench press, deep squat, hand grip strength, clean <b>lifts,</b> squat jumps, <b>counter</b> movement jumps, amp;lt; 30 m sprints, chins, dips and Coopers test will be collected {{until the end of the}} competitive season 2017 - 2018. The primary outcome is the incidence of shoulder injuries and shoulder problems. The secondary outcome is the prevalence of shoulder injuries and shoulder problems. Discussion: Shoulder problems are frequent among handball players and a reduction of these injuries is therefore warranted. However, in order to introduce appropriate preventive measures, a detailed understanding of the underlying risk factors is needed. Our study has a high potential to identify important risk factors for shoulder injuries in adolescent elite handball players owing to a large study sample, a high response rate, data collection during consecutive seasons, and recording of potential confounding factors.

40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} understanding {{the relation between}} aerodynamic drag and aerodynamic lift in modern passenger cars and explores what effect these forces have on a vehicle. Modern cars are capable of exceptionally high speed and are subjected to large destabilizing lift forces at these speeds. To counteract the effects of positive lift, various aerodynamic devices and body design details {{are included in the}} typical car design. These devices often increase the vehicles aerodynamic drag, reducing energy efficiency as speed increases. The problem that this project aims to address is that at typical commuting speeds where lift forces are low these <b>counter</b> <b>lift</b> devices are not required, however because these devices are fixed the losses associated with their increased drag is still incurred. The devices can however not be excluded from the design as they are required on occasions that the vehicle is driven at abnormally high speed and lift forces become large. The losses associated with the increased drag of such devices are incurred over the vehicles full range of speeds even though the devices are only required at higher speed. The objective of this project is to develop an aerodynamic system that allows the vehicle to continuously and autonomously adjust its drag vs. lift properties to an optimal compromise that suits the vehicles instantaneous aerodynamic requirements. The system offers improvements in both handling and breaking performance as well as increased energy efficiency. The feasibility and effectiveness of the developed system is compared against the performance of a standard test vehicle and against the same test vehicle equipped with various traditional fixed aerodynamic devices. The methods used to develop, analyse and compare the various test models include both practical testing of a physical vehicle and computer based simulation using a digitized model of the same vehicle. Practical testing was conducted at Gerotek test facilities in Pretoria, South Africa and includes measuring the flow rate through the engine cooling system to determine the drag contribution of the cooling system to total vehicle drag. Coast-down testing is used to characterise the test vehicles rolling resistance and skid-pan or circuit tests are used to characterise the vehicles handling properties. Acceleration and breaking tests are also performed. Data from these tests are recorded through various on-board data logging units with pitot tube, GPS and accelerometer devices as inputs. A 3 D model of the test vehicle is compiled using photogrammetry software to capture the profile and dimensions of the test vehicle into digital form. A 3 D CAD model is developed from the vehicle scan and is used for CFD simulations to solve for the vehicles aerodynamic properties and to assist in the design and incorporation of the various adjustable aerodynamic devices required for the project. The data accumulated through computer simulation and practical testing is combined to form a statistical computer model of the standard vehicle. Research is conducted on existing aerodynamic devices common to passenger cars and suitable devices are adapted to three additional computer models: One with an adaptive aerodynamic system and two with fixed aerodynamic configurations of different intensities. The performance and energy efficiency of the four models are analytically simulated and the results are compared directly. The study shows that in terms of sporting performance around a theoretical road circuit, the adaptive model outperforms both the standard vehicle and fixed configuration models by a small degree, +- 2. 3 %. The standard vehicle is found to have a lift coefficient CL= 0. 43 with a drag coefficient of Cd= 0. 31. The dynamic model is able to realize combinations of low drag or low lift between the limits of Cd= 0. 3, CL= 0. 34 and Cd= 0. 32, CL= 0. 03. The variable aerodynamic properties allow for a 5. 5 % increase in maximum cornering speed and a 20 % improvement in acceleration time from standstill to terminal speed. The percentage improved lap time would be greater if the effects of breaking from the higher terminal speed achieved by the dynamic model were ignored for the simulation [...] ...|$|R
