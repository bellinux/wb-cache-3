500|$|GamesTM editors {{noted that}} the game is [...] "heavily steeped in RPG tradition, however, its appeal {{stretches}} far beyond the hardcore RPG demographic thanks to its ease of play, boundless ambition and focused attention to detail". Scott Tobias of The A.V.

500|$|Critics {{were not}} {{unanimous}} in their praise. The Phoenixs Jeffrey Gantz felt that character was unoriginal, inaccurate and Westernized, writing, [...] " [...] costumes (particularly the kimono and obi Mulan wears to the Matchmaker) and hairdos look Japanese... Give Mulan Native American features {{and you have}} Pocahontas." [...] Similarly, James Berardinelli of ReelViews felt that the character's depiction was too [...] "familiar," [...] reviewing, [...] "Although she <b>looks</b> <b>different</b> from Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Pocahontas, Mulan {{is very much the}} same type of individual: a woman with a strong, independent streak who is unwilling to bend to the customs of her culture, which decree that the role of the female is to be ornamental. The film isn't very subtle in reinforcing the idea of equality between the sexes". Additionally, some critics, such as Alex von Tunzelmann of The Guardian, have criticized Mulan for her violence, writing, [...] "Disney struggles to make Mulan both a killer and a heroine... Gingerly, the film attempts to tread a middle path, implying that Mulan annihilates most of the Hun army by causing an avalanche, and having her dispatch Shan Yu with a load of fireworks. Very pretty. But still technically killing." [...] However, von Tunzelmann did conclude more positively, [...] "as Disney heroines go, Mulan herself is a clear improvement on the standard-issue drippy princess." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{large-scale}} {{structure of}} the Universe also <b>looks</b> <b>different</b> if one only uses redshift to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be {{if there were no}} cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a [...] "finger of God" [...] the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.|$|E

60|$|The {{shape of}} the table is no better. We {{are all in the}} habit of judging as to the 'real' shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that we come to think we {{actually}} see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we all have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing <b>looks</b> <b>different</b> in shape from every different point of view. If our table is 'really' rectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had two acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposite sides are parallel, they will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator; if they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were longer. All these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table, because experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the apparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as practical men. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred from what we see. And what we see is constantly changing in shape as we move about the room; so that here again the senses seem not to give us the truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the table.|$|E

6000|$|On this false basis a vast {{structure}} is erected. All prices, provided that competition is free, {{are made to}} appear as the necessary result of natural forces. They are [...] "natural" [...] or [...] "normal" [...] prices. All wages are explained, and low wages are exonerated, on {{what seems to be}} an undeniable ground of fact. They are what they are. You may wish them otherwise, but they are not. As a philanthropist, you may feel sorry that a humble laborer should work through a long day to receive two dollars, but as an economist you console yourself with the reflection that that is all he produces. You may at times, as a sentimentalist, wonder whether the vast sums drawn as interest on capital are consistent with social fairness; but if it is shown that interest is simply the [...] "natural price" [...] of capital representing the actual [...] "productive power" [...] of the capital, there is nothing further to say. You may have similar qualms over rent and the rightness and wrongness of it. The enormous [...] "unearned increment" [...] that accrues for the fortunate owner of land who toils not neither spins to obtain it, may seem difficult of justification. But after all, land is only one particular case of ownership under the one and the same system. The rent for which the owner can lease it, emerges simply {{as a consequence of the}} existing state of wages and prices. High rent, says the economist, does not make big prices: it merely follows as a consequence or result of them. Dear bread is not caused by the high rents paid by tenant farmers for the land: the train of cause and effect runs in the contrary direction. And the selling price of land is merely a consequence of its rental value, a simple case of capitalization of annual return into a present sum. City land, though it <b>looks</b> <b>different</b> from farm land, is seen in the light of this same analysis, to earn its rent in just the same way. The high rent of a Broadway store, says the economist, does not add a single cent to the price of the things sold in it. It is because prices are what they are that the rent is and can be paid. Hence on examination the same canon of social justice that covers and explains prices, wages, and interest applies with perfect propriety to rent.|$|E
