40|$|The Indonesian Labor Law {{prohibits the}} {{employment}} of children. In reality, however, there are many children working as <b>labors</b> <b>in</b> the sand mine. This particular issue must be resolved. Thus, this study discusses two problems. The first one is the obstacles which have been hindering legal protection for child <b>labors</b> <b>in</b> Sleman Regency’s sand mine. The second one is the government’s effort to eliminate child labors from Sleman Regency’s sand mine. This is a juridical empirical study which employs primary and secondary data. Therefore, it is a literature review and field study. To analyze the data obtained, this study uses a qualitative approach. The result of the study shows {{that there are many}} obstacles to uphold the legal protection for child <b>labors</b> <b>in</b> Sleman’s sand mine and that the government has enacted PPA-PKH (Reducing Child Labors to Support Family Hope Program) to eliminate child <b>labors</b> <b>in</b> Sleman’s sand mine...|$|R

5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to <b>labor</b> <b>in</b> state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E

The federal government spent $1.3 million on the CPS program. The men performed $6 million of unpaid <b>labor</b> <b>in</b> return.|$|E

5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division of <b>labor</b> <b>in</b> metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E
