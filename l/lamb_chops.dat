25|$|The seafood safari episode {{saw many}} firsts for the Great BBQ Challenge. The first dessert to be cooked {{entirely on the}} BBQ, the first entree and the first tears of the series. Restaurateur Fenton shocked the judges with his {{signature}} dish, the great Aussie pavlova with boozy summer fruits. Darwin cook Lisette served up antipasto and Perth IT professional Laz had all the right flavours with his stir fry vegetables and <b>lamb</b> <b>chops.</b> During the screen test Fenton's explosive nature impressed Mark and Julia while Laz came out on top with his clear delivery and knowledge base. The final challenge was to cook up a seafood feast. Laz's cook in the bag technique came under criticism from Ben as he didn't clean the flat plate between courses and mixed his meal with the charred remains of the previous dish. Fenton's Moreton Bay bugs prepared with Asian flavours, secured the win from the judges and moved him to tears and into the semi finals.|$|E
500|$|... "West Side" [...] beefsteaks, on {{the other}} hand, were often thrown at [...] "gentlemen-only" [...] establishments {{centered}} on Eleventh Avenue and 23rd Street. West Side beefsteaks tended more toward expansive menus, with courses including crab meat, <b>lamb</b> <b>chops,</b> and baked potatoes {{to go along with}} the beef loin. Diners at West Side beefsteaks were allowed to use disposable forks for some courses, but were expected to eat the beef course with their fingers.|$|E

500|$|... "East Side" [...] beefsteaks {{were largely}} patronized by the working-class and immigrants, {{and the center}} of the East Side beefsteak world was at FirstAvenue and NineteenthStreet in Manhattan. East Side beefsteaks were heavily meat-centered, with courses {{consisting}} of items like sliced beef short loin, beef kidneys, and ground beef trimmings (referred to as [...] "hamburgers"). One East Side beefsteak was reported to have consisted of [...] " [...] of steak, [...] of <b>lamb</b> <b>chops,</b> [...] of hamburger and [...] of kidneys wrapped with bacon." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpson family {{visits a}} petting zoo, where Lisa is enraptured by a cute lamb. That night, Marge serves <b>lamb</b> <b>chops</b> for dinner, but Lisa is {{troubled by the}} {{connection}} between the dish and its living counterpart, and announces that she will no longer eat meat. In response, her brother Bart and her father Homer mock her relentlessly. Reaction at school is no better; when Lisa requests a vegetarian alternative to the cafeteria food, Principal Skinner labels her an [...] "agitator". The students are then forced to watch a Meat Council propaganda film, starring Troy McClure, which criticizes vegetarianism. Lisa is unimpressed by the film, but her classmates tease her.|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, {{the nations}} {{with the highest}} {{consumption}} of sheep meat are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland. These countries eat 14–40lbs (3–18kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum. Sheep meat is also popular in France, Africa (especially the Maghreb), the Caribbean, {{the rest of the}} Middle East, India, and parts of China. This often reflects a history of sheep production. In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional. Sheep testicles—called animelles or lamb fries—are considered a delicacy {{in many parts of the}} world. Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach. [...] In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5kg), with Americans eating 50pounds (22kg) of pork and 65pounds (29kg) of beef. In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly <b>lamb</b> <b>chops</b> and leg of lamb.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, her Emmy-winning show <b>Lamb</b> <b>Chop's</b> Play-Along began {{a five-year}} run on PBS.

5000|$|Tarcher {{worked closely}} with her mother as {{producer}} of <b>Lamb</b> <b>Chop's</b> Play-Along. Jeremy Tarcher had also been part of Shari Lewis's show on PBS. After her mother's death in 1998, {{on the advice of}} family friend the late Dom DeLuise, Tarcher decided that <b>Lamb</b> <b>Chop</b> should live on for her many fans and has begun performing with <b>Lamb</b> <b>Chop.</b> It was during this time that she changed her surname to her mother's, of Lewis; as an homage. While <b>Lamb</b> <b>Chop</b> may be described as [...] "sassy", [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you" [...] are part of the repertoire. Lewis has the same hand size as her mother.|$|R
2500|$|The {{elaborate}} dinner offerings generally included caviar {{and other}} delicacies, cold salads, grilled and sauteéd fish, sirloin steaks and filet mignon, <b>lamb</b> <b>chops,</b> and the like. For discerning palates, elegant champagne dinners were an option. One of the Super Chiefs most popular signature dishes was the AT version of pain perdu, simply and appropriately named [...] "Santa Fe French Toast".|$|E
2500|$|The {{possibility}} of T. gondii transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was first proposed by D. Weinman and A.H Chandler in 1954. [...] In 1960, the cyst wall of tissue cysts {{was shown to}} dissolve in the proteolytic enzymes found in the stomach, releasing infectious [...] bradyzoites into the stomach (and subsequently into the intestine). The hypothesis of transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was tested in an orphanage in Paris in 1965; yearly acquisition rates of T. gondii rose from 10% to 50% after adding two portions of barely cooked beef or horse meat to the orphans' daily diets, and to 100% after adding barely cooked <b>lamb</b> <b>chops.</b> Such an experiment would nowadays be considered unethical.|$|E

60|$|Sir Hugh {{had spent}} the {{greatest}} part of this day at home, immersed among his guns and rods, and their various appurtenances. He also had breakfasted at his club, but had ordered his luncheon {{to be prepared for}} him at home. He had arranged to leave Berkeley Square at four, and had directed that his <b>lamb</b> <b>chops</b> should be brought to him exactly at three. He was himself a little late in coming down stairs, and it was ten minutes past the hour when he desired that the chops might be put on the table, saying that he himself would be in the drawing-room in time to meet them. He was a man solicitous about his <b>lamb</b> <b>chops,</b> and careful that the asparagus should be hot--solicitous also as to that bottle of Lafitte by which those comestibles were to be accompanied, and which was, of its own nature, too good to be shared with his brother Archie. But as he was on the landing by the drawing-room door, descending quickly, conscious that, in obedience to his orders, the chops had been already served, he was met by a servant who, with disturbed face and quick voice, told him that there was a lady waiting for him in the hall.|$|E

60|$|She had, she meditated, {{passed through}} the novelty of seeing the town and meeting people, of skating and sliding and hunting. Bea was competent; there was no {{household}} labor except sewing and darning and gossipy assistance to Bea in bed-making. She couldn't satisfy her ingenuity in planning meals. At Dahl & Oleson's Meat Market you didn't give orders--you wofully inquired whether there was anything today besides steak and pork and ham. The cuts of beef were not cuts. They were hacks. <b>Lamb</b> <b>chops</b> were as exotic as sharks' fins. The meat-dealers shipped their best to the city, with its higher prices.|$|E

There was a piece of dough upon a floury board, and when Anita went to lay the table the Alsatian fairly flew upon the dough. It was astonishing to see with what rapidity he manipulated it.

Billy stood there, but a different Billy from the one she had parted from so short a time before. A small boy, beside him, held his hat. His face had been fresh-washed, or, rather, drenched, for his shirt and shoulders were wet. His pale hair lay damp and plastered against his forehead, and was darkened by oozing blood. Both arms hung limply by his side. But his face was composed, and he even grinned.|$|E
