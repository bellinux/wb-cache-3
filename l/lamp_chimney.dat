60|$|He {{sat up in}} {{his chair}} with a start. The fire had become merely a handful of grey ashes, his limbs were numb and stiff. The lamp was {{flickering}} out. He had been dozing, how long he had no idea. Something had awakened him abruptly. There was a cold draught blowing through the room. He turned his head, his hands still gripping {{the sides of his}} chair. His heart gave a leap. The outer door was a few inches open, was being held open by some invisible force. There was some one there, some one on the point of entering stealthily. Even as he watched, the crack became a little wider. He sat with his eyes riveted upon that opening space. The unseen hand was still at work. Every instant he expected to see a face thrust forward. The sensation of absolute physical fear by which he was oppressed was a revelation to him. He found himself wishing almost feverishly that he was armed. The physical strength in which he had trusted seemed to him at that instant a valueless and impotent thing. There was a splash of spray or raindrops against the window and through the crack in the door. The <b>lamp</b> <b>chimney</b> hissed and spluttered and finally the light went out. The room was in sudden darkness. Hamel sprang then to his feet. Silence had become an intolerable thing. He felt the close presence of another human being creeping in upon him.|$|E

50|$|The Bridgeport <b>Lamp</b> <b>Chimney</b> Company Bowstring Concrete Arch Bridge {{is located}} between Mechanic Street and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks in Bridgeport, West Virginia. The bridge was {{constructed}} in 1924, designed by Frank McEnteer. This elegant bowstring reinforced concrete arch bridge represents a traditional bridge type which was readily adapted to what was essentially a new construction material: reinforced concrete. Unlike a rail or road bridge, this bridge can be considered an unusual pedestrian bridge {{in that it was}} built by the Bridgeport <b>Lamp</b> <b>Chimney</b> Company in 1924 to provide access from the glass plant to a warehouse {{on the other side of}} Simpson Creek. The bridge was designed to carry hand carts with glass products across the river to the warehouse. The bridge remains the only evidence of the original works, and its successor, Master Glass Company. Thus the bridge stands in splendid isolation from any other structure.|$|E
5000|$|Mantle lamps {{are nearly}} always {{bright enough to}} benefit from a {{lampshade}} and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather. Mantle lamps, because of the higher temperature at which they operate, do not produce much odor, except when first lit or extinguished. Like flat- and round-wick lamps, they can be adjusted for brightness; however, caution must be used, because if set too high the <b>lamp</b> <b>chimney</b> and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot. A lamp set too high will burn off its soot harmlessly if quickly turned down, but if not caught soon enough the soot itself can ignite and a [...] "runaway lamp" [...] condition can result.|$|E
50|$|In 1888 {{the company}} opened its first glass {{manufacturing}} facility in Muncie. On February 18 fires were {{started in the}} new factory's furnace; on March 1 its first glass products were made. The first products to be manufactured in the new factory in Muncie were oil containers and <b>lamp</b> <b>chimneys,</b> not fruit jars. By 1889 the Ball company's headquarters and its glass and metal manufacturing operations had relocated to Muncie. The other Ball brothers moved to Indiana in the 1890s. George relocated to Muncie in 1893, William arrived in 1897, and Lucius, a company shareholder and a physician, moved to Muncie in 1894.|$|R

The museum is located in the Kirkbride Building but it is operated by a non-profit organization that is separate from the hospital administration. It includes history about many of the discontinued practices that are no longer considered proper treatment for mental illnesses as well as updates on current practices.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of small-ions and aerosols in the diameter range 0. 4 nm to 1. 1 µm, produced during burning of paraffin wax tea-light candles, were investigated using a custom-built aspiration condenser ion mobility spectrometer (ACIMS) and a sequential mobility particle sizer and counter (SMPS+C) system. Peaks {{in the number}} concentration were observed at diameters 10 - 30 nm and 100 - 300 nm, consistent with ‘normal ’ and ‘sooting ’ burn modes. In addition, a smaller mode in the size range 2. 5 - 9 nm was observed, interpreted as a soot-precursor species. When a fan was placed behind the burning candle a ‘modified small-ion ’ signal was seen at sizes 1. 1 - 2. 0 nm. This was not observed without the fan present or when a <b>lamp</b> <b>chimney</b> was used. During burning, aerosol concentration was elevated and small-ion counts were low. However after extinction of the flame, this trend was reversed {{and the number of}} small-ions increased to levels higher than those observed prior to burning, remaining so for several hours...|$|E
40|$|The {{castor bean}} belongs to {{that group of}} seeds that contain large {{quantities}} of fat and no carbohydrate before germination. As germination proceeds the fat stores decrease and carbohydrate appears (Green, 1890) (see also Paper III following). The purpose {{of this investigation was}} {{to determine whether or not}} the combustion respiratory quotient rose with succeeding stages of germination, thus indicating a change from an oxygen-poor to an oxygen-rich substance. Apparatus By combining the Benedict and Fox (1925) oxycalorimeter and the Benedict universal metabolism apparatus and introducing a more effective cooler, one is enabled to obtain accurate respiratory quotients upon the combustion of small amounts of thoroughly dried plant or animal material. Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of the arrangement. The cooler is made from a hot water heater coil installed in a large metal can filled with cold water. The water bottle preceding the spirometer is inserted in order partially to control the temperature of the air. If one is very careful to keep drafts from the spirometer bell and quickly cool the Pyrex <b>lamp</b> <b>chimney</b> with a cold wet cloth immediately following the combustion, there is no difficulty in keeping the temperature of the air in the spirometer at the same point as it was before combustion. This eliminates temperature change corrections. In order to check the accuracy of the apparatus e. P. sucrose was used. Checks with sugar were also made at various intervals during the experiments on the castor beans. Table I is representative of the values obtained for sucrose...|$|E
50|$|Sam Ruggles (3 August 1770 - 27 May 1843) {{started the}} first {{commercial}} mica mine in the United States at the site that bears his name. Mica {{at the time was}} used to make, among other things, <b>lamp</b> <b>chimneys</b> and stove windows. Ruggles began as a grocer and was merchant of West India goods in Boston, Massachusetts. He was never a resident of New Hampshire (he was born, lived and died in Boston), and hired local workers in Grafton to operate the mine. Local lore states that the mine was started in 1803, but there is no documented evidence that supports the claim. Ruggles' first purchase of property on Isinglass Hill in Grafton was on 5 July 1805. He made subsequent purchases of adjoining properties in 1806 and 1810. His first advertisement for mica ("sheet isinglass") appeared in the Boston Semi-Weekly Advertiser on 9 November 1825. By 1831 his occupation was listed in the Boston Directory as a merchant of sheet isinglass. He had a storefront and warehouse in Boston where he sold mica.|$|R

6000|$|Meanwhile at {{any rate}} there was Caterham to stare at, and one could stand and study the distant {{prospect}} of the great man's features. He was easy to draw was this man, and already the world had him to study at leisure on <b>lamp</b> <b>chimneys</b> and children's plates, on Anti-Boomfood medals and Anti-Boomfood flags, on the selvedges of Caterham silks and cottons and in the linings of Good Old English Caterham hats. He pervades all the caricature of that time. One sees him as a sailor standing to an old-fashioned gun, a port-fire labelled [...] "New Boomfood Laws" [...] in his hand; while in the sea wallows that huge, ugly, threatening monster, [...] "Boomfood;" [...] or he is cap-a-pie in armour, St. George's cross on shield and helm, and a cowardly titanic Caliban sitting amidst desecrations {{at the mouth of}} a horrid cave declines his gauntlet of the [...] "New Boomfood Regulations;" [...] or he comes flying down as Perseus and rescues a chained and beautiful Andromeda (labelled distinctly about her belt as [...] "Civilisation") from a wallowing waste of sea monster bearing upon its various necks and claws [...] "Irreligion," [...] "Trampling Egotism," [...] "Mechanism," [...] "Monstrosity," [...] and the like.

40|$|The scene {{opens in}} the kitchen which is strewn with cooking utensils, {{indicating}} that grandma is busy preparing the Christmas pastry. Two bad boys of the red headed, freckled face type, enter. The mischievous expressions on their faces indicate that they have already planned a huge joke on grandma. One of the boys climbs to {{the kitchen table and}} takes down the old kitchen bracket lamp, which is equipped with a very large chimney, the other goes to the flour barrel and scoops out a quantity of flour, pouring it into the chimney of the lamp until it is filled to the top and packed down solidly. The lamp is then replaced in the bracket. Grandma, who is very near sighted enters, scratches a match, removes the <b>lamp</b> <b>chimney</b> for the purpose of lighting up for the evening, when a large quantity of flour falls upon her head, instantly changing her old gingham wrapper into a snow white frock and giving her a general ghost-like appearance. The flour sticks in her hair and fills her eyes, but this is where she turns the tables. Suspecting the bad boys, she immediately looks for them under the old kitchen table where she finds them, as they thought, safely hidden away and enjoying the joke. She grabs them by the heels, and throws them one after the other, head first into the flour barrel. She then sits them down upon the floor very forcibly with their faces toward the audience and they present a very ludicrous appearance in the mad scramble to remove the flour from their eyes and hair.

50|$|Opium lamps were crafted {{mainly in}} China before the {{communist}} revolution in 1949 brought opium smoking {{to an abrupt}} halt there. Small-scale production of opium lamps continued in Hong Kong and parts of Southeast Asia including Vietnam until the mid-1960s.Opium lamps were usually crafted from one or more types of metal such as silver, brass or paktong, an alloy also known as nickel silver. Often the metal parts of the lamp were adorned with cloisonné. The opium <b>lamp's</b> distinctive <b>chimney</b> was made from glass. Inexpensive lamps made entirely of molded glass were mass-produced and pieces of them are commonly found at historic Chinese settlements, such as the sites of former Chinese camps in the California goldfields. Examples of opium lamps crafted from Peking glass are sought after by collectors.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{portion of}} the <b>lamp</b> uses a <b>chimney</b> like Mueseler and Morgan lamps. The rising gases pass up the chimney and through a gauze.

The gases then start to rise up the intermediate chimney before exiting through another gauze. Gas finally passes down between the outermost chimney and the intermediate chimney, exiting a little above the glass. The outer chimney is therefore effectively a shield.|$|R

In each murder, the victims were hacked to death with an axe and the mirrors in the homes were covered. A burning <b>lamp</b> with the <b>chimney</b> off was left at the foot of the bed and a basin in which the murderer washed was found in the kitchen.

5000|$|George Stephenson {{came from}} a mining family and by 1804 had secured the post of brakesman at Killingworth colliery. He was present at both the 1806 and 1809 explosions in the pit. By 1810, he was {{engineman}} and responsible for machinery both above and below ground. [...] The pit was a gassy pit and Stephenson {{took the lead in}} work to extinguish a fire in 1814. For some years prior to 1815 he had been experimenting on the blowers or fissures from which gas erupted. He reasoned that a <b>lamp</b> in a <b>chimney</b> could create a sufficient updraft that firedamp would not penetrate down the chimney. Further observations of the speed of flame fronts in fissures and passageways led him to design a lamp with fine tubes admitting the air.|$|R
50|$|In the Geordie lamp {{the inlet}} and {{exhausts}} are kept separate. Restrictions in the inlet ensure that only just enough air for combustion {{passes through the}} <b>lamp.</b> A tall <b>chimney</b> contains the spent gases above the flame. If the percentage of firedamp starts to rise, less oxygen {{is available in the}} air and combustion is diminished or extinguished. Early Geordie lamps had a simple pierced copper cap over the chimney to further restrict the flow and to ensure that the vital spent gas did not escape too quickly. Later designs used gauze for the same purpose and also as a barrier in itself. The inlet is through a number of fine tubes (early) or through a gallery (later). In the case of the gallery system air passes through a number of small holes into the gallery and through gauze to the lamp. The tubes both restrict the flow and ensure that any back flow is cooled. The flame front travels more slowly in narrow tubes (a key Stephenson observation) and allows the tubes to effectively stop such a flow.|$|R
5000|$|A {{heavy rain}} {{prevents}} Jess from working outdoors.

One is a damaged globe of a <b>chimney</b> <b>lamp</b> whose history Eliza reflects on during the rain. Part of its rim cracked off when struck by a splatter of cold water when they were newlyweds, and she repaired it with putty. Spellbound by dreams of a lifetime of happiness together, a summer morning inspires 17-year-old Eliza to begin decorating it with swans as a vase. Jess had broken its spell later by asking for his breakfast and she had set it aside unfinished for many years. Then, one November, to console herself after her young daughter Sarah had died, she began working on it again. She had only completed the outline of another swan when Jess, still grieving, came to her for comfort. He chides her for [...] "playing with thy paints" [...] forcing her to set it aside for good, though still incomplete. Yet, it becomes her most treasured link, after a fashion, to her husband.|$|R
