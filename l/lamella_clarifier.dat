50|$|Another design variation, which {{improves}} {{the efficiency of}} the separation unit is the way the effluent enters the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier.</b> Standard clarifier design has the effluent entering {{at the bottom of the}} inclined plates, colliding with the sludge sliding down the plates. This mixing region renders the bottom 20% of the inclined plates unusable for settling. By designing the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> so that the effluent enters the inclined plates without interfering with the downward slurry flow the capacity of the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> can be improved by 25%.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{tendency}} with lamella clarifiers for algae to grow on the inclined plates and {{this can be a}} problem especially if the overflow is being discharged to the environment or if the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> is being utilised as pre-treatment for a membrane filtration unit. In either of these cases the overflow requires post-treatment such as an anthracite-sand filter to prevent the algae from spreading downstream of the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier.</b> As the inclined plates in the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> are made of steel it is not recommended that chlorine be used to control the biological growth as it could accelerate the corrosion of the plates.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> or {{inclined}} plate settler (IPS) {{is a type}} of settler {{designed to}} remove particulates from liquids.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> {{are also}} used in the {{municipal}} wastewater treatment processes. The most common wastewater application for <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> is {{as part of the}} tertiary treatment stage. <b>Lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> can be integrated into the treatment process or stand-alone units can be used to increase the flow through existing water treatment plants. One option for integrating <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> into existing plants is for conventional or sludge blanket clarifiers to be upgraded by attaching a bundle of inclined plates or tubes before the overflow in the so-called [...] "clear water zone". This can increase the settling area by two-fold resulting in a decrease in the solids loading in the overflow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> {{can be used}} in a {{range of}} {{industries}} including mining and metal finishing, as well as used to treat groundwater, industrial process water and backwash from sand filters. <b>Lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> are ideal for applications where the solids loading is variable and solids sizing is fine and are more common than conventional clarifiers at many industrial sites due to their smaller footprint.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> {{can handle}} a maximum feed water {{concentration}} of 10000 mg/L of grease and 3000 mg/L of solids. Expected separation efficiencies for a typical unit are: ...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{proprietary}} <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> designs. Inclined plates may be based on circular, hexagonal or rectangular tubes. Some possible design characteristics include: ...|$|E
50|$|Initial {{investment}} {{required for}} a typical <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> varies from US$750 to US$2500 per cubic meter of water to be treated, depending {{on the design of}} the clarifier.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> {{performance}} {{can be improved}} {{by the addition of}} flocculants and coagulants. These chemicals optimise the settling process and cause a higher purity of overflow water by ensuring all smaller solids are settled into the sludge underflow.|$|E
50|$|Commercially {{available}} <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> require different concrete basin {{geometry and}} structural support to conventional clarifications system {{widely used in}} industry, thus increasing the cost of installing a new (lamellar) clarification system.|$|R
50|$|One {{specific}} {{application is}} as pre-treatment stage for effluent entering membrane filters. <b>Lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> {{are considered to}} be one of the best options for pre-treatment ahead of membrane filters. Their all steel design means there is a low chance that part of the inclined plate will chip off and be carried over into membrane, especially when compared to tube settlers which are constructed of plastic. Further <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifiers</b> are able to maintain the required water quality to the membrane without the use of chemicals. This is a cost saving measure both in purchasing chemicals and limiting damage to the membrane, as membranes do not work well with the large particles contained in flocculants and coagulants.|$|R
5000|$|Plate angle: The general {{consensus}} is that plates should be inclined at a 50-70° angle from the horizontal to allow for self-cleaning. This results in the projected plate area of the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> taking up approximately 50% of {{the space of a}} conventional clarifier.|$|E
50|$|For the {{treatment}} of potable water the overflow from the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> will require further treatment to remove organic molecules as well as disinfection to remove bacteria. It will also be passed {{through a series of}} polishing units to remove the odour and improve the colour of the water.|$|E
50|$|The surface {{loading rate}} (also known as surface {{overflow}} rate or surface settling rate) for a <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> falls between 10-25 m/h. For these settling rates, the retention time in the clarifier is low, at around 20 minutes or less, with operating capacities tending to range from 1-3 m3/hour/m2 (of projected area).|$|E
50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> is its distinct absence of mechanical, moving parts. The system therefore requires no energy input except for the influent pump and has a much lower propensity for mechanical failure than other clarifiers. This advantage extends to safety considerations when operating the plant. The absence of mechanical parts results in a safer working environment, with less possibility for injury.|$|E
50|$|Whilst the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> has {{overcome}} many difficulties encountered {{by the use}} of more traditional clarifiers, there are still some disadvantages involved with the configuration and running of the equipment. Lamella clarifiers are unable to treat most raw feed mixtures, which require some pre-treatment to remove materials that could decrease separation efficiency. The feed requires initial processing in advanced fine screening and grit and grease removal to ensure the influent mixture is of an appropriate composition.|$|E
50|$|The {{post-treatment}} {{required for}} the overflow stream depends both {{on the nature of}} the inlet stream and what the overflow will be used for. For example, if the fluid being put through the <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> comes from a heavy industrial plant it may require post-treatment to remove oil and grease especially if the effluent is going to be discharged to the environment. A separation process unit such as a coalescer is often used to physically trigger a separation of the water and the oils.|$|E
50|$|Both the {{overflow}} stream and the underflow stream from a <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> will often require post-treatment. The underflow stream is often put through a dewatering process {{such as a}} thickener or a belt press filter to increase the density of slurry. This is an important post-treatment as the underflow slurry is often not able to be recycled back into the process. In such a case it often needs to be transported to a disposal plant, {{and the cost of}} this transport depends on the volume and weight of the slurry. Hence an efficient dewatering process can result in a substantial cost saving. Where the slurry can be recycled through the process it often needs to be dried, and dewatering again is an important step in this process.|$|E
50|$|One {{variation}} on the standard design of a <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> being developed {{is the way the}} effluent is collected {{at the top of the}} inclined plates. Rather than the effluent flowing over the top of the inclined plates to the outlet channel it flows through orifices at the top of the plates. This design allows for more consistent back pressure in the channels between the plates and hence a more consistent flow profile develops. Obviously this design only works for relatively clean effluent streams as the orifices would quickly become blocked with deposits which would severely reduce the efficiency of the unit. Another new design includes an adjustable upper portion of the vessel so that vessel height can be changed. This height adjustment is relative to a deflector, which directs the inlet stream. This design intended to be used for decanting storm water.|$|E
50|$|Typical <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> design {{consists}} {{of a series of}} inclined plates inside a vessel, see first figure. The untreated feed water stream enters {{from the top of the}} vessel and flows down a feed channel underneath the inclined plates. Water then flows up inside the clarifier between the inclined plates. During this time solids settle onto the plates and eventually fall to the bottom of the vessel. The route a particle takes will be dependent upon the flow rate of the suspension and the settling rate of the particle and can be seen in the second figure. At the bottom of the vessel a hopper or funnel collects these particles as sludge. Sludge may be continuously or intermittently discharged. Above the inclined plates all particles have settled and clarified water is produced which is drawn off into an outlet channel. The clarified water exits the system in an outlet stream.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of lamella clarifiers over other clarifying systems {{is the large}} effective settling area caused {{by the use of}} inclined plates, which improves the operating conditions of the clarifiers in a number of ways. The unit is more compact usually requiring only 65-80 % of the area of clarifiers operating without inclined plates. [...] Therefore, where site footprint constraints are of concern a <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> system is preferred. The reduced required area allows the possibility for the clarifiers to be located and operated inside, reducing some of the common problems of algae growth, clogging due to blowing debris accumulation and odour control, that occur when the machinery is outdoors. Operation within an enclosed space also allows for a better control of operating temperature and pressure conditions. The inclined plates mean the clarifier can operate with overflow rates 2 to 4 times that of traditional clarifiers which allow a greater influent flow rate and thus a more time efficient clarification process. Lamella clarifiers also offer a simple design without requiring the use of chemicals. They are therefore able to act as pre-treatment for delicate membrane processes. Where necessary flocculants may be added to promote efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Overflow {{rainwater}} is {{a serious}} environmental problem nowadays, which attracted the most researchers ’ attentions. Accordingly, effective and economic treatment of overflow rainwater is highly required. This study aimed to design a high-loaded clarifier equipment and developed an innovative overflow rainwater treatment. The high-loaded clarifier equipment was consisted of grid, pump, coagulant, reactor, {{and the most important}} part of <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier</b> with serried metal plates. The removal of pollutants in overflow rainwater with the high-loaded clarifier equipment was evaluated. The pollutions removal rate of overflow rainwater was investigated with 65 % COD and 90 % SS, approximately...|$|E
40|$|Sludge {{occurs in}} many waste water and {{drinking}} water treatment processes. The numeric modeling of sludge is therefore crucial for developing and optimizing water treatment processes. Numeric single-phase sludge models mainly include settling and viscoplastic behavior. Even though many investigators {{emphasize the importance}} of modeling the rheology of sludge for good simulation results, it is difficult to measure, because of settling and the viscoplastic behavior. In this thesis, a new method is developed that combines rheological measurements with a process-viscometer and numeric simulations, in order to produce flow curves that most probably display the real viscoplastic behavior of sludge below a concentration of 10 g/l. The settling velocity is determined with a hybrid approach combining standard measurements and numeric simulations of the measurements. This is called the hybrid sludge model, which finally demonstrates its power by simulating a complex <b>lamella</b> <b>clarifier.</b> The results of the simulation fit the measurements and observations of the testing plant well. This demonstrates that the hybrid sludge model contributes {{to the development of a}} numerical model that requires a minimum of measurements and computational effort, in order to simulate water treatment plants. Finally, sludge properties (settling and viscoplastic behavior) from different waste water treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants are compared, with remarkable results. This thesis provides efficient tools for including numeric modeling in the design and optimization processes of water treatment plants...|$|E
