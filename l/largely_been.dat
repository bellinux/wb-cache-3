5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> lost. Another possibility is that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Harbour was the {{original}} Port of Bristol, but as ships and their cargo have increased in size, it has now <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by docks at Avonmouth and Portbury. These are located 7miles (11.3km) downstream {{at the mouth of}} the River Avon.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} days, the city's {{economic}} base comprised the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. Today, that has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by tourism, education, government, and transportation. Some {{of the larger}} employers in Flagstaff are Northern Arizona University, the Flagstaff Medical Center, and the Flagstaff Unified School District. Tourism is a large contributor to the economy, as the city receives over 5 million visitors per year.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has {{an active}} program of {{organized}} amateur and professional sports. Tourism {{has become an}} important industry, especially in the Lake region. In the North Country, what had been an industrial area focused on mining and timber has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> transformed into a vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and environmentalism, added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} cultivars of blackcurrant. 'Baldwin' was the {{mainstay}} of the industry for many years but it has now <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work {{has been carried out}} {{in order to reduce the}} plant's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centred especially on Russia, Sweden and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{hazardous}} nature of lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} preference for using alternatives in industrial applications. In the formerly major application of lead paints, it has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E
5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E

5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E
5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the Allies {{landed at}} Arawe on New Britain on 15 December, while the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade, having {{commenced}} its advance {{up the coast}} from Gusika on 3 December, continued on passing through Bald Hill, Lakona and Kiligia {{on its way to}} Fortification Point as it led the opening phase of the Australian advance towards Sio. In late December, the 20th Infantry Brigade, which had <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> rested during the advance on Wareo, took over from the 4th. After sweeping up the coast quickly against light Japanese resistance, they captured Sio in early January 1944, having suffered only very light casualties.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E
5|$|Hollywood, a {{northern}} district of Los Angeles, California, {{is one of}} the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.|$|E

5|$|Ivanović was {{inspired}} to create the painting upon reading a book titled History of the Serb People while studying at the Munich Academy. The painting was poorly received by Belgrade's art critics. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson suggests {{this was due to}} its poor compositional and spatial conception. By the 1870s, Ivanović's works had <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> forgotten in Serbia. The Conquest of Belgrade was one of four paintings offered by Ivanović to the Gallery of Historical Portraits in 1874. The Gallery went on to form the nucleus of what was to become the National Museum of Serbia. The painting is currently in the possession of the National Museum.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> ignored.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Turgut Reis shelled Bulgarian troops around Tekirdağ. On 17 November, she {{supported}} the Ottoman III Corps by bombarding the attacking Bulgarian forces. The ship was aided by artillery observers ashore. The battleship's gunnery was largely ineffective, though {{it provided a}} morale boost for the besieged Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca. By 17:00, the Bulgarian infantry had <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> forced back to their starting positions, {{in part due to}} the psychological effect of the battleships' bombardment. On 22 November, Turgut Reis sortied from the Bosporus to cover the withdrawal of Hamidiye, which had been torpedoed by a Bulgarian torpedo boat earlier that morning.|$|E
