500|$|Supernovae {{in other}} galaxies cannot be {{predicted}} with any meaningful accuracy. Normally, {{when they are}} discovered, they are already in progress. [...] Most scientific interest in supernovae—as standard candles for measuring distance, for example—require an observation of their peak luminosity. It is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum. Amateur astronomers, who greatly outnumber professional astronomers, have {{played an important role}} in finding supernovae, typically by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs.|$|E

During the episode [...] "The Broken Reflection", he comes to visit after 25 years, to the disdain of Victor. Alfred is an eccentric character, often walking around with his hat on fire, and bringing over his and Victor's great-grandfather's skull. He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table {{all over the floor}} when he stands up, and breaking a mirror {{in the middle of the}} night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone. He is not seen again, but keeps in touch with the Meldrews, as Victor is seen <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> photographs Alfred had sent over in [...] "The Trial".|$|E

500|$|... {{is one of}} two aliens {{who come}} to Earth to aid Quiche after Quiche {{continues}} losing to the Mew Mews. Energetic and often childish, Tart taunts Quiche for losing to the Mew Mews by saying he is weak. He primarily fights using physical attacks and chimera animals, but is also capable of manipulating plants to bind people and attacking with an energy beam. Tartu shows a distinct dislike for Ichigo and refers to her as an [...] "old woman" [...] when they encounter one another, only to be called a [...] "midget" [...] in return. Midway through the series, Tart and Pie capture Bu-Ling and hold her hostage under the Tokyo Dome. While guarding her, Tart appears to be bewildered by her refusal to be scared and her attempts to befriend him. After she is freed by the others, he laughs while <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> candy she gave him. The anime adaptation expands this incident by having Tart save Bu-Ling's life when she starts to suffocate after the cavern is sealed off. At the end of the manga Bu-Ling kisses him and he tells Bu-Ling that he might return to get another candy drop from her, and leaves for his own world. In the anime adaptation, Tart is killed by Pie when he tries to protect the Mew Mews, and revived by the final release of Mew Aqua {{at the end of the}} series.|$|E

2500|$|In this context, Bai Juyi overstepped his minor {{position}} by memorializing the emperor. As Assistant Secretary to the Prince's Tutor, Bai's memorial was {{a breach of}} protocol — he should have waited for those of censorial authority {{to take the lead}} before offering his own criticism. This was not the only charge which his opponents used against him. [...] His mother had died, apparently caused by falling into a well while <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> flowers, and two poems written by Bai Juyi — the titles of which Waley translates as [...] "In Praise of Flowers" [...] and [...] "The New Well" [...] — were used against him as a sign of lack of Filial Piety, one of the Confucian ideals. [...] The result was exile. Bai Juyi was demoted to the rank of Sub-Prefect and banished from the court and the capital city to Jiujiang, then known as Xun Yang, on the southern shores of the Yangtze River in northwest Jiangxi Province. After three years, he was sent as Governor of a remote place in Sichuan. At the time, the main travel route there was up the Yangzi River. This trip allowed Bai Juyi a few days to visit his friend Yuan Zhen, who was also in exile and with whom he explored the rock caves located at Yichang. Bai Juyi was delighted by the flowers and trees for which his new location was noted. [...] In 819, he was recalled back to the capital, ending his exile.|$|E
