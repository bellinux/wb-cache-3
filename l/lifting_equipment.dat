5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E

25|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} 12:37. It caused {{the collapse of}} the western half of the southern wing of the hotel. Soon after the explosion, rescuers from the Royal Engineers arrived with heavy <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> Later that night, the sappers were formed into three groups, with each working an eight-hour shift. The rescue operation lasted for the next three days and 2,000 lorry loads of rubble were removed. From the wreckage and rubble the rescuers managed to extract six survivors. The last to be found alive was Assistant Secretary Downing C. Thompson, 31 hours after the explosion, but he died just over a week later.|$|E

Exceptions for certain less dangerous appliances were laid down in a decree of June 1982. In regards to the agricultural sector, a decree of 8 March 1982 laid down the conditions attached to the approval of electrical installations in agricultural undertakings and specified which offices are authorized to test these installations. In 1983, leave was introduced for setting up businesses and sabbatical leave for wage-earners, and in June that year, a law was passed that completed the incorporation into French Law of a 1977 European Council Directive on the approximation {{of the laws of}} the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses.|$|E
500|$|Specific industries, {{such as the}} airline, {{healthcare}} and food industries, have special concerns. Due to rising rates of obesity, airlines face higher fuel costs and pressures to increase seating width. In 2000, the extra weight of obese passengers cost airlines US$275million. [...] The healthcare industry has had to invest in special facilities for handling severely obese patients, including special <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> and bariatric ambulances. Costs for restaurants are increased by litigation accusing them of causing obesity. In 2005 the US Congress discussed legislation to prevent civil lawsuits against the food industry in relation to obesity; however, it did not become law.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A current {{development}} {{trend of}} the industrial equipment is ultra-large scale. The construction, transportation, and installation of these equipments require ultra-large tonnage <b>lifting</b> <b>equipments.</b> At present, domestic ultra-large tonnage <b>lifting</b> <b>equipments,</b> particularly for special purpose are still immature, unable to meet requirements of the lifting of ultra-large structures. Based on the need of ultra-large steel structures (offshore oil platforms) lifting, using strength theory and finite element analysis, a continuous lifting mechanism for the lifting of ultra-large structures was designed in this article. The continuous lifting mechanism consists of two parts: the mechanical support structures which was designed in this article, and the hydraulic system. The main characteristics of the mechanism are: the framing truss structure assures large height lifting; and the accumulated of synchronous blocks achieves large height lifting...|$|R
40|$|Nursing {{staff have}} {{a high risk of}} on the job injury from patient {{handling}} and movement. Safe Patient Handling and Movement programs help reduce injury through education and training to employees. Programs need to be evaluated regularly to determine if the goals are being met. When a program is not meeting its projected goals, modifications are needed to improve the program and its outcomes. The purpose of this project was to evaluate a continued safe patient handling program. The goals were to provide best evidence from research. Use best evidence to enhance the program. Promote positive behaviors from employees. Reduce healthcare workers injuries related to patient handling and movement. The objectives were to determine if modifications would decrease safe patient injuries. To promote safe patient handling and movement behaviors that is positive from employees. Increase employees comfort, knowledge, and use of minimal <b>lift</b> <b>equipment</b> during patient handling and movement. The outcomes of the program are successful in meeting the goals and objectives. Modifications to the program were introduced and injuries from patient handling decreased by 50 % during the implementation period when compared to the post implementation period. Positive behaviors were witnessed and expressed from employees. Employees also expressed they felt they had increased knowledge of the minimal <b>lift</b> <b>equipment</b> and increased comfort with use of the minimal <b>lift</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|R

Giant 4 had to be completely modified to retrieve and carry the sub underneath. To raise {{the remainder of the}} ship, the salvage team planned an extremely complex operation that required them to design and build custom <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> and employ new technologies. They wrote custom software that would automatically compensate for the effects of wave motion due to the rough Barents Sea, which could sever the cables suspending the sub beneath the barge.|$|E
