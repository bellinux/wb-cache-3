5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved <b>liquifying</b> cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation.

50|$|A finery forge is a hearth used to fine (i.e., produce, refine) wrought iron, {{through the}} {{decarburization}} of the pig iron.
