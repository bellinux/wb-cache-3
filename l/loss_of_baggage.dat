25|$|The case {{concerned}} the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>baggage</b> on the voyage of the First Fleet from England to Botany Bay and Port Jackson, {{now known as}} Sydney. After hearing evidence, the court found in favour of the plaintiff and awarded damages against the ship’s master. Bruce Kercher notes that this decision goes against the then English principles of law relating to “convict attaint” which provides that a prisoner under sentence of death was unable to sue or hold property. Henry and Susannah Cable both were sentenced to death but had their sentence commuted to transportation, so under law, they were not entitled to sue.|$|E

At {{the railway}} station {{occurred}} our first <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>baggage.</b> As W. was making {{change in the}} baggage room, he missed the basket containing our books and sundries. Unfortunately the particular word for basket had just then stepped out. [...] "Wo ist mein--pannier?" [...] exclaimed he, giving them the French synonyme. They shook their heads. [...] "Wo ist mein--basket?" [...] he cried, giving them English; they shook their heads still harder. [...] "Wo ist mein-- --" [...] "Whew--w!"

"JUNE 4th, 1742 [day BEFORE that of Belleisle's [...] "Wig" [...] at Maleschau, had Belleisle known it!]--Prince Karl, being {{now free}} of the Prussians, and ready for new work, issued {{suddenly}} from Budweis; suddenly stept across the Moldau,--by the Bridge of Moldau-Tein, sweeping away the French that lay there. Prince Karl swept away this first French Post, by the mere sight and sound of him; swept away, in like fashion, the second and all following posts; swept Broglio himself, almost without shot fired, and in huge flurry, home to Prag, double-quick, night and day,--with much <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>baggage,</b> artillery, prisoners, and total loss of one's presence of mind. 'Poor man, he was born for surprises' [said Friedrich's Doggerel long ago]! Manoeuvred consummately [he asserts] at different points, behind rivers and the like; but nowhere could he call halt, and resolutely stand still. Which undoubtedly he could and should have done, say Valori and all judges;--nothing quite immediate being upon him, except the waste-howling tagraggery of Croats, whom it had been good to quench a little, before going farther. On the third night, June 7th, he arrived at Pisek; marched again before daybreak, leaving a garrison of 1,200,--who surrendered to Prince Karl next day, without shot fired. Broglio tumbling on ahead, double-quick, with the tagraggery of Croats continually worrying at his heels, baggage-wagons sticking fast, country people massacring all stragglers, panted home to Prag on the 13th; with 'the Gross of the Army saved, don't you observe!' And thinks it an excellent retreat, he if no one-else. [Guerre de Boheme, ii. 122, &c.; [...] Campagnes, v. 167 (his own Despatch).] ...|$|E

25|$|The second ship, Amelia Thompson, arrived off the Taranaki coast on 3 September and sat {{off shore}} {{for five weeks}} because its captain feared Ngamotu's {{reputation}} as a dangerous shipping area.

The ship's precious food cargo, including flour and salted meat, was finally brought ashore for New Plymouth's starving residents on 30 September. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> its <b>baggage</b> ship, the Regina, which was blown ashore on to a reef, contributed to New Plymouth's reputation as a dangerous area for shipping, discouraging other vessels from berthing.|$|R

Washington resolved, therefore, to avoid any attack from the enemy, though, by so doing, he must leave a fine and fertile region open to their ravages; or a plentiful store-house, from which they would draw voluntary supplies. A second move was necessary, again to avoid the danger of being enclosed between two rivers. Leaving three regiments, therefore, to guard the passes of the Hackensack, and serve as covering parties, he again decamped, and threw himself on {{the west bank of the}} Passaic, in the neighborhood of Newark.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the current}} {{problems}} in the airport sector is the baggage losses at the various points of the airport logistics infrastructure. In fact, more than 6 suitcases for each 1, 000 passengers are lost. Altogether, a total of 23 million bags are lost each year. This is an unsustainable situation of 2. 3 million euros in expenses associated with handling claims and the payment of financial compensations. Therefore, {{one of the main}} weaknesses in airport systems is the usage of manual mechanisms for the baggage identification. In other words, luggage inspection is carried out with visual inspection or using barcode readers, both of which require a direct field of view. This causes delays in the identification of suitcases and customer dissatisfaction in the resolution of the problem. With this problem, it's proposed to build a platform adapted to satisfy the current needs using the latest technologies available. It consists in a Web portal, a mobile application, and lastly, a web server that allows the management and query the database. The web portal will support system administrators and airport operators, meanwhile, the mobile application will provide baggage tracking for end-users. The main innovation of the project consists in the utilization of RFID technology. Each baggage incorporates an RFID tag that identifies the suitcase with the data stored in the system's database. Unlike previous systems, the reading is done without visual contact and allows to automate the process. Also, it is developed a reader device using a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with an RFID module with the purpose of reading the tags as antenna receiver inside the platform. In conclusion, the project's objective is to offer a platform that allows the management <b>of</b> <b>baggages</b> with RFID keys in order to reduce economic expenses, a general improvement on the resolution of problems and avoid the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>baggages...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} topical issues of {{international}} air law, namely international regulation of air carrier's liability in carriage <b>of</b> passengers, <b>baggage</b> and cargo. The first multilateral treaty to consider and unify this topic was the Warsaw Convention in 1929. It prescribed the main {{requirements of the}} documents of carriage, i. e. the passenger ticket, the baggage check and the air waybill. In particular, the air carrier is liable for personal injury or death <b>of</b> passengers, <b>loss</b> or damage <b>of</b> <b>baggage</b> or cargo and for damage resulting from delay. The key points of the liability regime governed by the Warsaw Convention are presumptive liability and the maximum liability limits expressed in French Gold Francs. Due to the subsequent development of air transport these rules had to be modernized. The Warsaw Convention was amended with several Protocols and a Supplementary Convention, which together create the so-called "Warsaw system". The purpose of these documents was, amongst other things, to tighten up the liability regime while trying to establish strict liability and raise the liability limits. In 1999 a further unification of air carrier's liability took place {{with the creation of}} the Montreal Convention. Although it adopted some key liability provisions from previous documents, it stipulated [...] ...|$|R

The royalist forces defeated, in May 1643, the Earl of Stamford {{at the battle of}} Stratton, with great <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>baggage</b> and artillery, and pursued him as far as Wells. In this affair Sir John {{distinguished}} himself, and was now made commander-in-chief of all the royalist forces in Devon. He sat down before Exeter, into which the Earl of Stamford had withdrawn, and which was further defended by the fleet under Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. Berkeley succeeded in maintaining a blockade, beating off the Earl of Warwick with a loss of three ships, and on 4 September 1643 the Earl of Stamford was compelled to surrender. In 1644 Berkeley was present at the baptism of Henrietta Maria, the king's daughter, who was born at Exeter. The same year Hopton and Berkeley joined their forces to oppose Sir William Waller's westward advance, but were badly beaten at the Battle of Cheriton near Alresford in Hampshire on 29 March. In April 1645 he superseded Sir Richard Grenville, being made colonel-general of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, took Wellington House, near Taunton, by assault, and then proceeded to invest Taunton. The advance of Thomas Fairfax westward in the autumn of the year changed the aspect of affairs. In January 1646 Fairfax was able to concentrate on Exeter, which Berkeley was forced (13 April) to surrender, on honourable terms.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the transport of passengers on international routes and the legal regime set down by the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and reinforced by the Montréal Convention of 1999. These Conventions regulate commercial aviation by detailing a set of minimum standardised procedures for flight safety, such as standards for air navigation systems, amongst others, to ensure safe and efficient air travel. The legal regime also regulates the possible claims that may be made against airlines {{for the death of}} or harm to passengers, as well as relating to damage to and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>baggage.</b> The regime not only limits claims temporally and by location, but it also excludes the application of national legal regimes. With regard to claims of harm to dignity the regime disallows such claims to be brought within the restrictions placed by the legal regimes or on any other basis. The contribution does not address the full coverage of these Conventions, only the exclusion of mental / emotional injuries. The Convention excludes emotional harm from the definition of death and physical harm. However claimants have brought claims to undermine the main exclusion of claims with regard to compensation for emotional harm. This contribution explores the exclusion of claims in the Warsaw and Montréal Conventions and thereafter analyses two court decisions in common law countries where this exclusion of claims was challenged and the challenge failed. ...|$|E

Before doing this, however, it would be necessary to dislodge the Americans from their posts on his left. Leaving the camp under the command of General Hamilton, Burgoyne advanced with fifteen hundred men against them. But scarcely had the detachment started when the enemy made a furious attack on the British left. Major Ackland, with the grenadiers, was posted here, and for a time defended himself with great bravery. The light infantry and Twenty-fourth were sent to their assistance, but, overpowered by numbers, the left wing was forced to retreat into their intrenchments. These the enemy, led by General Arnold, at once attacked with great impetuosity. For a long time the result was doubtful, and {{it was not until the}} American leader was wounded that the attack ceased.
