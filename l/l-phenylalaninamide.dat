40|$|The {{effects of}} 18 -crown- 6 on the {{synthesis}} of peptides catalyzed by α-chymotrypsin are reported. Lyophilization of the enzyme {{in the presence of}} 50 equivalents of 18 -crown- 6 results in a 425 -fold enhanced activity when the reaction between the 2 -chloroethylester of N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine and <b>L-phenylalaninamide</b> is carried out in acetonitrile. Addition of crown ether renders the dipeptide synthesis in nonaqueous solvents catalyzed by α-chymotrypsin possible on a preparative scale. The acceleration is observed in different solvents and for various peptide precursors...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} enantioseparation of both active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients and bio molecules such as amino acids {{became more and}} more necessary because in most cases the two stereo forms exhibit different pharmacological effects. This article deals with the chiral separation of dansylated amino acids by ligand-exchange capillary electrophoresis using <b>L-phenylalaninamide,</b> L-lysine and L-threonine as chiral selectors. Experiments with different central metal ions such as Cu(II), Co(II), Cd(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) were carried out. Optimal conditions were found out by studying the effect of the pH and the selector molarity on the chiral resolution. Best separation was obtained for the Cu(II) /L-lysine complex, showing a chiral resolution up to 17 for Dns-DL-Met. (doi: 10. 5562 /cca 1762...|$|E
40|$|In earlier studies" 2 on the {{purification}} and {{properties of}} beef spleen cathepsin C, {{it was found}} that at pH 5 this proteolytic enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis, not only of the CO-NH bonds of sensitive substrates, but also of the ester linkage of a-L-glutamyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester. In view of the subsequent finding 4 that cathepsin C exhibits pronounced specificity toward dipeptide derivatives (e. g., glycyl-L-phenylalaninamide [GPA]), but does not act on related amino acid amides (e. g., <b>L-phenylalaninamide)</b> or tripeptide amides (e. g., glycylglycyl-L-phenylalaninamide), it seemed of interest to examine more closely the action of the enzyme upon several dipeptide esters both at pH 5 and at pH 7. 5. Previous work 9 had shown that at pH 5 the predominant reaction is one of hydrolysis at the sensitive amide bond of substrates such as GPA; at pH values near 7. 5, the major reaction is one of transamidation ' leading to the synthesis of long-chain polypeptides. Thus, at pH 7. 5, GPA is converted by the enzyme to a polymeric product that is, on the average, an octapeptide composed of alternating glycyl an...|$|E
