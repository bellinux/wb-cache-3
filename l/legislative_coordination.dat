40|$|IN THE DISCUSSIONS ON BREXIT, {{analysts and}} {{political}} observers tend to presume that negotiations {{on a new}} framework {{for the relationship between}} the European Union and the United Kingdom will revolve around a compromise that would allow the UK to limit the free circulation of EU workers, while maintaining access to the EU single market, especially for services, more or less under the current rules. [1] Pisani-Ferry et al. (2016) have {{gone so far as to}} propose a Continental Partnership (CP), in which the UK would not only be able to limit the free movement of persons, but would also have a seat in a ‘Council’ in charge of <b>legislative</b> <b>coordination</b> between the UK and the EU with the power to propose amendments to draft European legislation (although the European Parliament would not be obliged to accept them).

40|$|Electoral {{coordination}} {{refers to}} the use by political parties of a concerted strategy that makes most effective use of electoral rules to maximize their interests in <b>legislative</b> elections. <b>Coordination</b> requires both strategic thinking and political discipline, however, and in relatively new democracies these conditions may not exist. In this study I examine electoral coordination in the Hungarian legislative elections of 1998, the country’s third since its transition to democracy in 1989. Not only was there extensive electoral coordination among political parties aware of the strategic incentives presented by the complex electoral rules, but voters also responded to the cues signaled by party leaders, leading to the general success of the strategy. Coordination took two forms: joint party sponsorship of candidacies and the strategic withdrawal of candidates between the second and first rounds of voting in the single member districts, known in Hungarian as “stepping back. ” Careful selection and control of candidacies explains the bizarre aggregate result of that election, when the MSZP with the most total votes in each of three separate rounds of voting received only the second most seats. In addition, despite the expectation that contamination effects of its mixed-member system’s PR component would produce and sustain multipartism, Hungary’s party system has been steadily converging towards a two parties. Strategic coordination explains these outcomes as parties and voters employed the stepping back strategy to consolidate their forces around two poles...|$|R

The authors put a special emphasis on bringing the IT-staff training system {{in line with the}} labor market demands both in quantitative and qualitative terms. Based on the object-oriented approach, the authors explore the reasons behind the existing imbalance between the markets of IT-education services and IT-specialists in Azerbaijan, the challenges facing the IT education and specificity of the IT-specialists market being described. For overcoming the above gap between the IT labor market supply and demand, the authors put forward a model of professional competences, reflecting the real-life requirements for a specialist’s quality. Additionally, the paper outlines the recommended trends of IT-sector development in Azerbaijan, which include organization of innovative research and education centers for specialists’ training and retraining, <b>legislative</b> and institutional <b>coordination</b> of the IT industry and education, development of new educational standards, {{increase in the number of}} IT-profile students. </p...|$|R

Nowadays {{the spread of the}} facts concerning unlawful collection and use of information, unauthorized access to information resources and others is of serious concern. The issues of guaranteeing information security have become very important for Ukraine, which faced a hybrid information war. The objective of this research paper is to detect and analyze the main directions of state information policy aiming at protection of the national information space, as well as to reveal the sources of threats to information security of Ukraine and to find the ways to ensure information security of Ukraine at the present stage of social development. Information security of Ukraine as {{an important component of the}} national security system provides preventive activities of state authorities to provide guarantees of information security to individuals, social groups and society in the whole and is aimed at achieving sufficient level of spiritual and intellectual potential for the development of the state and social progress. Active cooperation between Ukraine and NATO in the field of information security is noted. It is reasonably determined that an important group of measures of guaranteeing information security are measures to protect the national information space from unauthorized interventions, as well as control over the formation of mass consciousness. As a result it is indicated that the formation and implementation of state policy for the protection of national interests against the threats in the information sphere, the adoption of relevant <b>legislative</b> acts, <b>coordination</b> of the activities of state authorities in the field of ensuring information security will consistently contribute to bringing Ukrainian national information security system in line with international standards in this area. ??????????? ???????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????, ???????? ?? ??????????, ????????? ????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????, ???? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????? ?? ??????????? ????? ????????????? ????????...|$|R
40|$|Do {{political}} and legislative ties matter {{as much as}} conventional partisan or institutional factors for parties, candidates, and legislative voting? Scholars frequently think of parties as more or less discrete, stable political entities which form and compete in elections. Similarly, {{when they talk about}} influence between legislators, they tend to talk about institutional sources of influence - such as leadership influence, constituent influence, or party influence; but scholars often ignore social sources of influence - influence due to actors 2 ̆ 7 embeddedness in social networks. In this dissertation, I develop theories of legislative network formation and legislative influence; and leverage network-analytic techniques to empirically test them. I address the causes and consequences of legislative networks for parties and legislative processes in four ways. First, I develop a theory of legislative network formation and use network survey data to test it. Second, I develop a theory of legislative influence and utilize mixed effects logistic regression tests to assess its validity with network survey and legislative voting data. Third, I develop a theory of party recruitment, and use records of party-switches over 20 years to test it. Finally, I develop a theory of the long-term effects of political networks on political party success, and apply duration modeling and regression techniques to assess it. Overall, I find that {{political and}} legislative networks have sizable effects on <b>legislative</b> <b>coordination</b> and party success, and that the root causes of political network formation lie in heretofore unmeasured sociopolitical processes...|$|E
