25|$|The fearful stayed home. The actual {{migrants}} looked beyond {{fears of}} the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west {{was to find a}} better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to face many challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and tornadoes that rain down snakes, fish and frogs, as well as the occasional range disputes. Homesteaders have to build their homes with sod, which were called as Sod Houses. One of the greatest plague that hit the homesteaders was the 1874 <b>Locust</b> <b>Plague</b> which devastated the Great Plains. These challenges hardened these settlers in taming the frontier.|$|E

Continuing agglomerations of upsurges on a regional level originating {{from a number of}} entirely separate breeding locations are known as [...] "plagues". During outbreaks and the early stages of upsurges, only part of the locust population becomes gregarious, with scattered bands of hoppers spread out over a large area.

When ginseng was discovered in the hardwood forests near Wayzata, the town became a distribution center for roots collected around the lake.

30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was divided into}} three groups, which were defined with actual locust infestation {{during the past several}} years according to the local government's records: slight <b>locust</b> <b>plagues,</b> 5 individuals per box (0.5  m 3); moderate <b>locust</b> <b>plagues,</b> 25 individuals per box (0.5  m 3); and heavy <b>locust</b> <b>plagues,</b> 50 individuals per box (0.5  m 3). Within 2  months of collection, we recorded the calling songs of both males and females in our lab as sound files using a digital voice recorder (PCM-D 50 Digital Recorder, Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The sampling rate was 96  kHz, and the recorder was placed {{in the center of the}} box. It was reported that the acoustic behaviors and the traits of songs changed with temperature (von Helversen [1972]), so the temperature was taken under natural sunlight during recording. Each recording sample took 1  h, which was divided into six 10 -min samples; each density got 30 samples, and thus, a total of 90 samples were obtained. Thereinto, 45 samples were used as training samples to train the BP neural network, and the remaining 45 samples were used as testing samples to test the system we built. The width of the pulses, the intervals between pulses and pulses groups, the normalized amplitude of pulses, and the amplitude ratio between pulses were analyzed using Cool Edit (Cool Edit pro V 2.1, Adobe Systems) and Matlab (Matlab 7.0, Mathworks) with at least 16 different individuals.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{introduced}} to control <b>locust</b> <b>plagues,</b> the Indian myna breeds prolifically in urban environments {{in the eastern}} states. The myna poses a serious threat (such {{that it has been}} listed in the World Conservation Union's world's 100 worst invasive species).

5000|$|Not {{long after}} the end of the Byzantine-Sasanian War of 572-591, a <b>locust</b> <b>plague</b> ravaged the {{countryside}} of the province from 591 to 595, in which locusts are said to have destroyed crops and fouled water supplies. The ensuing food shortages and famine caused many to migrate to neighbouring regions, whilst those less able were forced to resort to begging in nearby cities. This led to the abandonment of many villages and hamlets throughout Arbayistan. Some survived the plague by collecting and eating the locusts or by planting [...] "small vegetables" [...] such as summer peas and cucumbers.|$|E
50|$|In certain {{circumstances}} this species may develop {{a tendency to}} gregariousness with formation of very numerous aggregates, potentially harmful to crops. It normally occurs in low densities in undisturbed sparse grassland but disappears when the land is cultivated. It occurs in high densities in uncultivated land that is invaded by Artemisia, and on overgrazed pastures with weeds and bare ground. Under these conditions it can become gregarious and form locust swarms. After {{the breakup of the}} USSR in 1991, much agricultural land was left uncultivated. This gave ideal conditions for the Italian locust to breed and build up in numbers, and Kazakhstan suffered a devastating <b>locust</b> <b>plague</b> between 1998 and 2001.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} test whether the intraspecies {{acoustic}} characters {{could be used to}} estimate the population density of a particular species, the calling samples of L. migratoria migratoria in three different density levels were recorded and analyzed, and then an automatic density classification and monitoring system was established based on the backpropagation (BP) neural network.

25|$|Crop {{loss from}} locusts was {{noted in the}} Bible and Qur'an; these insects have been {{documented}} as contributing to the severity {{of a number of}} Ethiopian famines.

In March–October 1915, a <b>plague</b> of <b>locusts</b> stripped Ottoman Palestine of almost all vegetation. The significant crop loss caused by swarming desert locusts exacerbates problems of food shortage, and is a threat to food security.|$|R
