5|$|Altar M this modest {{monument}} is {{the earliest}} known monument dedicated by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. The importance of this monument lies in its text, in which this preeminent king of Quiriguá claimed the title of k'uhul ajaw, holy <b>lord,</b> <b>and</b> began his bid for independence from Copán. This rhyolite sculpture was dedicated on 15September 734 and has {{the form of a}} monstrous head, possibly that of a crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} {{new rules}} {{to strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local <b>lord,</b> <b>and</b> offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the <b>lord,</b> <b>and</b> the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E
50|$|In April 2013 Gabaldon {{released}} an eBook collection called The Lord John Series featuring {{all three of}} her Lord John novels (<b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Private Matter, <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Brotherhood of the Blade and The Scottish Prisoner) {{as well as the}} initial three novellas collected as <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Hand of Devils (<b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Hellfire Club, <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Succubus <b>and</b> <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Haunted Soldier).

5|$|Antonio Ezequiel Cárdenas Guillén (5 March 1962 – 5 November 2010), {{commonly}} referred to by his alias Tony Tormenta ("Tony Storm"), was a Mexican suspected drug <b>lord</b> <b>and</b> co-leader of the Gulf Cartel, a drug trafficking organization based in Tamaulipas.

5|$|At {{the urging}} of Glover, <b>Lord</b> <b>and</b> Paice, who wanted him in the fold for the band's 25th anniversary tour, Gillan rejoined Deep Purple in 1992 to record the album The Battle Rages On. Gillan was unhappy with working on the album, as {{it had already been}} {{partially}} completed with Joe Lynn Turner, and he was only required to write replacement lyrics and vocal melodies, which, unsurprisingly, drew criticism from Blackmore.|$|E
5|$|Lady Charlotte Fermor {{was born}} on 14 February 1725, the second eldest {{daughter}} of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys.

50|$|The novella <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Haunted Soldier was {{published}} in the 2007 Delacorte Press collection <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Hand of Devils alongside previously-published novellas <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Hellfire Club (1998) <b>and</b> <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Succubus (2003). As Haunted Soldier is a direct follow-up to her novel <b>Lord</b> John <b>and</b> the Brotherhood of the Blade, Gabaldon pushed the publication of the Hand of Devils collection until after the novel's release.|$|R

5|$|The hero's {{story begins}} with a {{flashback}} dream {{of the death of}} his parents {{at the hands of the}} Dark Lord, the ruler of the nation of Granz. Upon waking, the hero, a gladiator-slave in Granz, attempts to escape before being confronted by the Dark <b>Lord</b> <b>and</b> thrown off of a bridge. After being fished out of a lake, the hero is advised to head to the city of Topple. The heroine's story also {{begins with a}} flashback dream of the Dark <b>Lord</b> <b>and</b> his assistant, Julius, killing her stepmother and destroying her village. Upon awaking, she is advised by the knight Bogard to head to Topple, while he journeys to the city of Wendell. The hero and heroine meet in Topple, and agree to journey together. They head toward Wendell, and along the way discover that women of the Mana tribe, which the heroine belongs to, are being kidnapped by vampires. The heroine is kidnapped, and is rescued by the hero and an unnamed man; they discover that the kidnappings are to keep the woman safe from the Dark <b>Lord</b> <b>and</b> Julius, who are killing them all in part because the tribe was unable to save the Dark Lord's mother from a terrible fate.|$|E

5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was protecting herself and her husband.

But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E

The settlement at Dunham Woodhouse (named after an outlying lodge on the estate) dates from the 15th century. During the medieval period, the primary source of employment was agriculture, mainly arable farming.|$|E
