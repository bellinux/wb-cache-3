40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} steps in biomedical longitudinal studies is choosing a good experimental design that can provide high accuracy in the analysis of results with a minimum sample size. Several methods for constructing efficient <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs</b> have been developed based on power analysis and the statistical model used for analyzing the final results. However, development of this technology is not available to practitioners through user-friendly software. In this paper we introduce LADES (<b>Longitudinal</b> Analysis and <b>Design</b> of Experiments Software) as an alternative and easy-to-use tool for conducting longitudinal analysis and constructing efficient <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs.</b> LADES incorporates methods for creating cost-efficient <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs,</b> unequal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs,</b> and simple <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs.</b> In addition, LADES includes different methods for analyzing longitudinal data such as linear mixed models, generalized estimating equations, among others. A study of European eels is reanalyzed in order to show LADES capabilities. Three treatments contained in three aquariums with five eels each were analyzed. Data were collected from 0 up to the 12 th week post treatment for all the eels (complete design). The response under evaluation is sperm volume. A linear mixed model was fitted to the results using LADES. The complete design had a power of 88. 7 % using 15 eels. With LADES we propose the use of an unequal design with only 14 eels and 89. 5 % efficiency. LADES was developed as a powerful and simple tool t...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare two {{research}} designs, namely the cross-sectional design and the longitudi-nal design, in the context of upper extremity performance and age-related changes. Upper extremity performance of 360 randomly recruited, healthy, community-dwelling elderly persons was evaluated with reliable and valid sensori-motor tests. Three years later, survivors (n = 264) were reevaluated with the same tests. In many tests, cross-sec-tional and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs</b> were comparable for estimating the changes in upper extremity performance with age. However, in some tests, the decline with age using a cross-sectional design was underestimated. The upper extremity performance decline observed with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>design</b> was larger than the decline predicted with the cross-sectional design. The withdrawal and survivor biases related to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>design</b> and the cohort bias associated with the cross-sectional design may, in part, explain these results. IN the study of age-related changes, two major researchdesigns may be used: the cross-sectional <b>design</b> and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>design.</b> Both designs have particular advan-tages and disadvantages. Even though the cross-sectional design is less expensive and frequently used in the devel-opment of normative data, this design may have an impor-tant limitation in the study of aging.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{choice among}} a longitudinal, mixed <b>longitudinal,</b> or {{cross-sectional}} <b>design</b> {{is often called}} for in educational and psychological research. The problem of choosing the most efficient design to estimate polynomial parameters for time-structured data is considered, and the comparison of the efficiencies shows that the assumed degree of the polynomial is crucial for {{the selection of the}} most efficient design. When the degree is much smaller than the number of time points and the correlations between adjacent time points are not too large, cross-sectional and mixed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs</b> are more efficient than a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>design.</b> Planners of experiments in education and psychology often face the prob-lem of choosing between a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>design</b> and a cross-sectional design.

40|$|Holdup in {{flighted}} rotary dryers can {{be classified}} according to its loading state as either over, under or at <b>design</b> <b>load.</b> The loading state influences the effectiveness of particle to gas heat and mass transfer {{as well as the}} residence time of solids through the dryer. As such, accurate estimation of the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> is critical to the analysis of performance and the optimal design of flighted rotary dryers. In this paper <b>design</b> <b>load</b> experiments carried out in a horizontal, pilot scale flighted rotary dryer at different experimental conditions are described. The <b>design</b> <b>load</b> experiments involved analysis of multiple photographs of the cross sectional area of the solids in {{the front end of the}} dryer, at increasing loading conditions. Subsequently, the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> was estimated using conventional criteria based on the saturation of material in the cascading or unloading flights. The study examined both free flowing and cohesive solids with cohesion being controlled through the addition of low volatility fluid to the solids (dynamic angle of repose ranged from 44. 7 ° to 62. 3 °). The effect of drum rotational speed was also examined (2. 5 rpm– 4. 5 rpm). In order to select an appropriate geometrically derived <b>design</b> <b>load</b> model, comparison with existing <b>design</b> <b>load</b> models from the literature was undertaken. The proportion of airborne to flight borne solids within the drum was characterised through a combination of photographic analysis coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. In particular, solid volume fractions of the airborne solids with solid flow rate ranging from 0. 703 kg/s to 0. 134 kg/s were characterised using a CFD technique based on the Eulerian–Eulerian approach. The suitability of using geometric models of flight unloading to predict <b>design</b> <b>loading</b> in flighted rotary dryers is discussed.

40|$|Mixed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs</b> are {{important}} study designs for {{many areas of}} medical research. Mixed longitudinal studies have several advantages over cross-sectional or pure longitudinal studies, including shorter study completion time and ability to separate time and age effects, thus are an attractive choice. Statistical methodology used in general longitudinal studies has been rapidly developing within the last few decades. Common approaches for statistical modeling in studies with mixed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs</b> have been the linear mixed-effects model incorporating an age or time effect. The general linear mixed-effects model is considered an appropriate choice to analyze repeated measurements data in longitudinal studies. However, common use of linear mixed-effects model on mixed longitudinal studies often incorporates age as the only random-effect but fails {{to take into consideration}} the cohort effect in conducting statistical inferences on age-related trajectories of outcome measurements. We believe special attention should be paid to cohort effects when analyzing data in mixed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs</b> with multiple overlapping cohorts. Thus, this has become an important statistical issue to address. ^ This research aims to address statistical issues related to mixed longitudinal studies. The proposed study examined the existing statistical analysis methods for the mixed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>designs</b> and developed an alternative analytic method to incorporate effects from multiple overlapping cohorts as well as from different aged subjects. The proposed study used simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed analytic method by comparing it with the commonly-used model. Finally, the study applied the proposed analytic method to the data collected by an existing study Project HeartBeat!, which had been evaluated using traditional analytic techniques. Project HeartBeat! is a longitudinal study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in childhood and adolescence using a mixed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>design.</b> The proposed model was used to evaluate four blood lipids adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and endocrine hormones. The result of this dissertation suggest the proposed analytic model could be a more flexible and reliable choice than the traditional model in terms of fitting data to provide more accurate estimates in mixed longitudinal studies. Conceptually, the proposed model described in this study has useful features, including consideration of effects from multiple overlapping cohorts, and is an attractive approach for analyzing data in mixed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>design</b> studies. ...|$|R

40|$|The common {{wisdom is}} to design {{cladding}} and components using {{a lower level}} wind load than the main structural frames, i. e. a shorter recurrence period wind load is used for cladding design than for frame design. This paper first discusses the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> levels for structural frames and for cladding and components. Next, the <b>design</b> wind <b>loads</b> of scaffolds for building construction, those of buildings in the construction stage, and those of so-called “temporary” structures such as site offices are discussed. In Japan, the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> for scaffolds is defined as 1 -year-recurrence wind load, because its average setting period at one construction site is around 6 months, but this paper clearly proves the inappropriateness of this <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> estimation concept. Then, it is shown {{that there is no}} relation between the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> level and its lifetime at an individual site. Finally, even for the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> for main structural frames, it is clearly demonstrated that the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> level {{may not be able to}} be determined based on the lifetime of an individual building. Therefore, although the LCC concept is applied in <b>design</b> <b>load</b> estimation, it is strongly recommended that the optimal <b>design</b> <b>load</b> level should be decided considering total LCC for the city or nation as a whole, and treat design as involving a group of buildings, rather than attempting to optimize the LCC of individual buildings.
