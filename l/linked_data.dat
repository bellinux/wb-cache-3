Such memory cards {{have to be}} original PlayStation (not PS2) memory cards with <b>Link</b> <b>Data</b> from the home version of DDR 5th Mix (the home version of 6thMix cannot create arcade-compatible <b>Link</b> <b>Data).</b> 5thMix can create two different kinds of arcade link data; the <b>Link</b> <b>Data</b> file for 6thMix is known as [...] "New Version" [...] <b>Link</b> <b>Data</b> and is forward-compatible with 7thMix arcade machines as well. <b>Link</b> <b>Data</b> serves two primary purposes: Score-saving and Internet Ranking. The user can save his or her scores from arcade performances, and whenever {{the game is played}} in the future, the arcade game will load the scores for each user and show them on the song-selection screen to show the player's best performances. These scores can also be viewed at home with 5thMix. 6thMix also provides Internet Ranking codes based on the user's performance in a given set of songs. As with all of Konami's Internet Ranking events, the website for the game would allow users to enter in a generated password which contains their initials and scores for that session, and the website would display the rankings for those who have submitted codes. <b>Link</b> <b>Data</b> saves these passwords so that they may be entered much more conveniently.|$|R

User data include user behavior, preferences, location, and mobility. Network data contain configurations, signal strength, traffic load, and interference information. Finally, <b>link</b> <b>data</b> cover physical channel information such as path loss, shadowing, and channel statistics.|$|R
