40|$|The {{so-called}} socialist regime {{collapsed in}} Hungary in May 1990 {{with the first}} free elections. The new government immediately started to reorganize the country 2 ̆ 7 s agriculture, but unfortunately on a mainly ideological basis. The agriculture of Hungary had been a successful branch of the national economy in the 19702 ̆ 7 s and 19802 ̆ 7 s, because its structure, including the co-operation of large farms and smallholders, was very effectively adapted to the technological conditions and market opportunities of the time. The measures introduced in the early nineties by the new government destroyed this structure. The arable land was split up and became the property of many owners, and this way a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> new farms of very small size emerged. International supermarket chains also appeared on the Hungarian market. They are a new factor of agri-business earlier unknown in Hungary, causing a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> and several problems. Hungarian agriculture still lacks a stable structure, i. e. the sizes and owners of farms keep changing, the applied farming technology is not adapted to the new situation, the products possible to grow in a profitable way are not clearly identified, though {{it would be necessary}} in order {{to solve the problem of}} high unemployment experienced in rural areas.

50|$|Karl Marx’s {{point of}} view that the idealistic hopes for {{religious}} tolerance will be disappointed in the field of politics, and soon the political expectations will disappear in a process of economical evolution and of secularization of their religious values, was finally confirmed by the failure of the 1848 revolution. Though the fact that revolutionary antisemitism was used frequently by left and right wing campaigners, for him it was more than just rhetoric. His own cynical and refusing attitude concerning religion was widespread among his contemporaries and it was related with the own biography and a personal experience full of disappointments and conflicts within the family. Equal participation in political decisions was not granted by a national law as they hoped, the participation was merely dependent on privileges which were defined by material values and these transformations cause a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> and the tendence to turn backwards. Even in France where the constitution granted the equal status as citizens since 100 years, the Dreyfus affair made evident that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> institutions of the French Republic like the military forces were already ruled by the circles of the ancien régime. So the major population was still excluded from participation and could not identify with the state and its authorities. Social movements and emigration to America or to Palestine were the response, often in a combination. The utopies of these movements were sometimes secular, sometimes religious, and they often had charismatic leaders.|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of the project was}} the question why people delay childbearing until later in life. Based on qualitative, problem-centred interviews with highly educated women in Vienna, this article investigates the effect <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> and uncertainties relating to this issue. The data were analysed with a combination of grounded theory and objective hermeneutic sequence analysis. The recent literature comprises works about the impact of uncertain economic conditions on fertility. To explain these issues, the New Home Economics approach has developed the idea of opportunity costs. The assessment of the present economic situation and future prospects produce insecurity and fears. The Second Demographic Transition assumes that 'individual autonomy' and 'female emancipation' are the main reasons for delaying family formation. Some theoretical considerations by Easterlin, and Ajzen's and Fishbein's theory of planned behaviour are useful for elucidating other parts of the results. The discussed theories are all relevant for explaining different dimensions <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> and worries concerning motherhood. Moreover, some findings showed a somewhat different situation to the one often discussed in the literature. Apparently economic uncertainty is not the only decisive factor in fertility decisions. Women have the feeling that they are expected to carefully reflect about the consequences of their behaviour, which produces <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> acting irresponsibly. Some women find it difficult to reconcile the conflicting roles of being a good mother and being a career woman. Others worry that they might not live up to expectations - be it their own or those of others. From the women's point of view, they will always lose out on something, no matter whether they decide for or against having a child. For highly educated women in Vienna, fertility is definitely an issue that involves a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> and uncertainties. " (author's abstract...|$|R

5000|$|After {{completing}} the album's first track, Swift deeply deliberated her personal {{definition of the}} word [...] "fearless".

[...] She then started contemplating the word to title the album, and to assure she was making the correct decision, applied to every song on the album. Finding a fearless element to the themes and messages behind the songs, Swift decided to title the album Fearless. On the liner notes, she further explained the album title, This album is called Fearless, and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, Fearless is not the absence <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> It's not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears, Fearless is having doubts. <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again... even though every time you've tried before, you've lost. It's Fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even though can't breathe without them. I think it's Fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's Fearless to stop believing them. It's Fearless to say [...] "you're NOT sorry". I think loving someone despite what people think is Fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is Fearless. Letting go is Fearless. Then, moving on and being alright... That's Fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily ever after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is Fearless.|$|R

While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless".

Gay {{men and lesbians}} are being prosecuted, stigmatized, discriminated and put down just because of their sexual orientation. Nowadays we hear many discussions about the modern family relationships and partnerships, among which same-sex partnerships and families are also included. Public discussions are mainly concentrated on the question whether or not homosexual couples can be fit parents. Although {{it seems that the}} Slovene society has accepted homosexuality and along with that homosexuals, certain fears about the ability of gay parents to raise children remain present in today's society. Numerous {{studies have shown that the}} children in such families do not have any psycho-social problems, or any problems concerning their sexual identity or sexual roles. Furthermore being raised in a homosexual family does not play any part in the children's sexual orientation. The parent's role in the education of the children is very important. Children look up to their parents, they follow them and that is why the parent's point of view and actions affect the youngsters. Beside their parents, the children are also affected by the general opinion of the society. And because of that gay men and lesbians have an even more important and difficult role, because they have to protect their children from the homophobic society. Since Kindergarten is the first institution a child comes into contact with outside the family, it represents a very important part of the educational system. Because it is influenced by both the society and parents, I decided to gather the opinions of kindergarten teachers and pre-school education students about same-sex parenting. The opinions I looked at are different. Most of the people I have asked think that they do not have any prejudice against homosexuals, but at the same time they do not support the idea of legalizing same-sex parenting in Slovenia and the right of these couples to adopt a child.
