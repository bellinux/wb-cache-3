40|$|International audienceA {{representative}} sample of <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> provided from French steel industry was treated by different physical separation techniques especially used in mineral processing. The results of characterisation study show that the <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> may contain up to 35 % of iron compounds. The X-ray diffraction reveals {{the presence of the}} following crystallized mineral phases: CaO, MgO, Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, MnO, and P 2 O 5. Larnite (Ca 2 SiO 4), di-calcium aluminoferrite (brownmillerite: Ca 2 Fe 2 - xAlxO 5 with x = 0. 6) and a solid solution (Fe, Mn, Mg) O structurally close to the wustite (FeO) and some residual lime (CaO). The results of grinding tests show that the manner of grinding is very important. Soft Grinding (SG) or sequential grinding is most suitable to reduce the particle size of <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> avoiding the overproduction of fine particles, which hinder the effectiveness of magnetic separation techniques. The combination of Low and High Intensity Magnetic Separation (LIMS and HIMS) of ground <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> at 63 mu m in wet process may recover ferromagnetic particles (iron oxides) at LIMS and paramagnetic particles at HIMS, while the non-magnetic fraction contains mostly calcium silicates. From this investigation, two flow-sheets of treatment of <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> are suggested to recover high grade iron material for recycling in metallurgical processes.

40|$|Abstract A {{procedure}} is defined for commercializing slags arising as by-products of steelmaking, {{and this is}} used to develop certain products. The outcome of the present work comprised three products or groups of products: 1) slag-based binding agents, 2) a road structure improved by means of stabilization with such binding agents, and 3) a procedure for designing stabilized structures. The commercialization procedure was drawn up by examining the technical properties of the initial materials, excluding environmental acceptability and the mechanisms of their chemical reactions. The research proceeded in stages, of which {{the first was a}} reconsideration of the results presented in the author's licentiate thesis concerning factors affecting the stabilization of road construction aggregates with blast-furnace slag-based binding agents and their significance. This was followed by a series of experiments designed to test the validity of these results. At the third stage the selection of slag-based binding agents was extended to include <b>LD</b> steel <b>slag</b> products, while the final stage consisted of the implementation of a set of test structures and associated preliminary experiments and monitoring measurements. The binding properties of three blast-furnace slag products and three <b>LD</b> steel <b>slag</b> products, used separately or in various combinations, were examined {{in the course of this}} work, taking cement as a reference material. Materials were then eliminated as the research proceeded, either on account of their poor binding properties or on economic grounds. The final construction experiments were performed with three combinations: cement-activated granulated blast-furnace <b>slag,</b> <b>LD</b> steel slag-activated granulated blast-furnace slag and a mixture of ground granulated blast-furnace slag and cement. The actual novel product among the slag-based binding agents to be introduced here is LD steel slag-activated granulated blast-furnace slag, which was found to be similar in its technical properties to cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag. Structural layers stabilized with these two binding agents showed very similar bearing capacities, although the former did not reach the same compression strengths at an age of 91 days. The reasons for these similarities lay in a larger amount of binding agent used when activated with <b>LD</b> steel <b>slag</b> and the greater thickness of the stabilized layer, factors which both tended to compensate for the poorer compression strength. The new information gained on the properties of cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag and the mixture of ground granulated blast-furnace slag and cement opens up fresh opportunities for selecting binding agents and designing road structures. Formulae were developed here for predicting the uniaxial compression strength at 91 days, used as a stabilization criterion, from the value for a sample taken at 28 days, a technique which will speed up the assessment of stabilization results, especially when using slowly reacting slag-based binding agents...|$|R

Much is known about the physicochemical characteristics of the slag and its relationship to the process efficiency; however few employ the microstructural aspect for such analysis. In this sense, the aim of this work was to analyze the slag microstructure formed at Usiminas converters and to understand important points relationed to dephosphorisation reaction, to act efficiently in the industrial process improvement. It was verified that dephosphorisation reaction does not occur in slag solid phases. According to this observation, the amount of fluxes added to the converter was reviewed, reaching a considerable reduction in the free CaO content of the slags.

The <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> was incorporated into the contaminated soil to consist four treatments: 0 % (T 1), 1 % (T 2), 2 % (T 3), and 4 % (T 4) per air-dried soil weight. A similar uncontaminated soil {{was used as}} a control (CTRL). After a one-month reaction period, potted soils (1 kg) were used for a 2 -week growth experiment with dwarf beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Soil pH increased with the incorporation rate of <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> from 5. 7 in the T 1 soil up to 7. 9 in the T 4 soil. Similarly the soil electrical conductivity (EC, in mS cm- 1) rose from 0. 15 (T 1 soil) up to 1. 17 (T 4 soil). Bean plants grown on the T 1 soil showed a high phytotoxicity. All incorporation rates of <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> increased the root and shoot dry weight yields compared to the untreated soil (T 1). The foliar Ca concentration of beans was enhanced for all LD slag-amended soils, while the foliar Mg, K, and P concentrations were not increased. Foliar Cu, Zn, and Cr concentrations of beans decreased with the <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> incorporation rate. The 2 % incorporation rate was sufficient to obtain the highest bean growth and foliar Ca concentration, to reduce foliar Cu concentration below its upper critical value, and to avoid an excessive soil EC and Zn deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Linz-Donawitz (<b>LD)</b> <b>slag</b> a major {{solid waste}} {{generated}} in huge quantities during steel making. It comes from slag formers such as burned lime/dolomite and from oxidizing of silica, iron etc. while refining the iron into steel in the LD furnace. Although {{a number of}} ways for its utilization have been suggested, its potential as a filler material in polymeric matrices has not yet been explored. The present work reports the possible use of this waste in glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites as a filler material. Hybrid composites consisting of bi-directional E-glass-fiber reinforced epoxy filled with different <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> content (0, 7. 5, 15, 22. 5 wt%) are prepared by simple hand lay-up technique. The composites are characterized in regard to their density, porosity, micro-hardness and strength properties. X-ray diffractography is carried out in order to ascertain the various phases present in LDS. This work shows that <b>LD</b> <b>slag,</b> in spite of being a waste, possesses fairly good filler characteristics as it modifies the strength properties and improves the composite micro-hardness of the polymeric resin...|$|E
40|$|Standard asphalt {{mixtures}} for road infrastructures consist of natural aggregate and bitumen. A number of research efforts have successfully investigated {{the possibility of}} replacing the conventional aggregate skeleton with industrial by-products such as slag originating from steel production process. However, little is known {{on the effect of}} steel slag on the mixtures performance properties such as resistance to low-temperature cracking and to permanent deformation, stiffness and fatigue. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation on the fundamental performance properties of different types of {{asphalt mixtures}} prepared with 100 % <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> aggregate and a conventional asphalt mixture containing natural Gabbro aggregate. Sophisticated testing methods were used to evaluate the key performance parameters for the set of asphalt mixtures investigated. In this study, low temperature cracking was addressed through thermal stress restrained specimen tests. Penetration tests and cyclic compression tests were used to evaluate the response of asphalt binder and asphalt mixture to permanent deformation due repeated loading, respectively. The cyclic indirect tensile test was selected for investigating both stiffness properties and fatigue resistance. For this purpose the complex stiffness modulus was measured to quantify material stiffness under different temperature and loading conditions providing information on the visco-elasto-plastic material behavior. Fatigue tests were used to determine the progressive and localized material damage caused by cyclic loading. The experimental results indicate that asphalt mixtures prepared with <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> are suitable for asphalt pavement construction and that in most cases they perform better than conventional asphalt mixtures prepared with Gabbro aggregate...|$|E

Neste trabalho, objetivou-se avaliar escórias siderúrgicas em diferentes frações granulométricas quanto à correção do pH e liberação de Ca, Mg e Si para o solo. O delineamento foi inteiramente casualizado com 4 repetições em esquema fatorial com 6 fontes (escória de alto-forno 1, escória de fosfato, escória de alto-forno 2, escória de aciaria de forno AOD, escória de aço inox e escória de forno LD) e 5 distribuições granulométricas (2 - 1, 41; 1, 41 - 0, 85; 0, 85 - 0, 50; 0, 50 - 0, 30 mm e The slags {{are used}} in the {{agriculture}} as soil acidity correctives in same rates of lime, but there are few studies about its reactivity in soils. The objective was to compare slag reactivity to soil acidity correction and calcium, magnesium, and silicon liberation. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with 4 repetitions in factorial with 6 sources (blast furnace slag 1, phosphate slag, blast furnace slag 2, AOD furnace steel slag, stainless steel <b>slag</b> and <b>LD</b> furnace steel <b>slag)</b> and 5 particle sizes (2 - 1. 41; 1. 41 - 0. 85; 0. 85 - 0. 50; 0. 50 - 0. 30 mm and < 0, 30 mm) and two additional treatments (control and CaCO 3). The CaCO 3 was used as a pattern for the determination of the reactivity index of each source. All treatments received 1500 mg kg- 1 of equivalent CaCO 3 and each rate of slags was calculated by its determined neutralization power. The pH-value increased with reduction of particle size in all slags. The phosphate slag showed best efficiency on the liberation of Ca + Mg compared to the calcium carbonate in the granulometrics inferior to 0. 5 mm. There was low efficiency in soil acidity correction and liberation of the Ca and Mg in soil to slag of blast furnace. It is necessary to use particles smaller than 0. 3 mm to improve silicon availability of phosphate slag and particles between 0. 85 and 1. 41 mm to stainless steel slag. The silicon availability of AOD furnace steel <b>slag</b> and <b>LD</b> furnace steel <b>slag</b> were not influenced by particle size...|$|R
30|$|Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable {{resource}} [1], and currently {{the majority of}} P added as fertiliser in agriculture {{is in the form}} of inorganic fertilisers. From a sustainability point of view, it is sensible to make better use of P resources that are discarded as waste from urban areas; hence, there is a need to improve the recycling of P from agricultural and urban wastes [2]. Recycled fertiliser products are by no means homogenous and the availability of P for plant uptake from recycled fertiliser products may vary considerably, depending on the feedstock of the fertiliser and the subsequent type of processing [3]. Sewage sludge as a fertiliser may contain a range of different P forms depending on the specific process used to recover P from the sewage water, but a precipitation reaction using Al, Fe, Mg or Ca to precipitate P is often employed [3]. Sewage sludge may contain different types of organic contaminants [4]. Although it is still used as a fertiliser in many countries across Europe [5], the use of sewage sludge has declined in a number of European countries, while sewage sludge application on agricultural land was banned in Switzerland in 2008 [6]. A common practice that eliminates the organic contaminants in sludge is to incinerate the sewage sludge, thus producing sewage sludge ash. However, the availability of P in sewage sludge ash is quite low, but is also observed to be variable depending on the type of treatment in the sewage treatment plant [7]. Techniques such as acid leaching and thermal treatment have been investigated for their potential to recover P from sewage sludge ash while separating it from the detrimental heavy metals with varying success [5, 7], but there is also a possibility of combining the upgrading of sewage sludge ash with the recycling of metallurgical slags. Slags from the metallurgical industry had been recycled as fertiliser in Germany in the form of Thomas phosphate for more than 100  years, but this is no longer produced [8]. BOF (basic oxygen furnace) or <b>LD</b> (Linz–Donawitz) <b>slag</b> from steel production may be used as a liming agent in agriculture [8]. It is also possible, however, to use sewage sludge ash as a means to enrich the hot liquid BOF slag with P, resulting in a fertiliser with a markedly higher P availability compared to the feedstock sewage sludge ash, due to a conversion of Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 (whitlockite) of low neutral ammonium citrate (nac) solubility into Ca-silico-phosphates with a higher nac solubility [9]. P contained in animal manures can be used more sustainably if it is up-concentrated, and thereby more easily transported from areas with a P surplus to areas where soils have a P deficit [3]. The majority of P (60 – 90  %) found in pig manure is inorganic [10] and only very little {{is in the form of}} phytate [11, 12]. Biomass ash (e.g. wood and straw ash) from bioenergy-plants could also potentially serve as a P fertiliser [13].|$|R
40|$|Although {{a variety}} of metal and ceramic powders are used as coating {{material}} and as reinforcing fillers in polymeric resins, the use of industrial wastes for this purpose has not been adequately explored. In view of this, the present investigation reports on the development and performance of new class es of plasma sprayed coatings and polymer composites using Linz-Donawitz slag (LDS) as the primary material. This LDS is a major solid waste generated in huge quantities during steel making and its chemical analysis suggests the presence of oxides of silicon, calcium and iron in it. The research reported in this thesis broadly consists of two parts: The first part has provided {{the description of the}} materials used, the experimental details and the methods adopted for analysis of experimental results. This part has also presented various physical and mechanical characteristics of the plasma sprayed LDS based coatings and LDS filled epoxy and polypropylene composites. An assessment of LDS as a potential coating material and a particulate filler in polymers has been made by evaluating the physical and mechanical properties of these coatings and composites under controlled laboratory conditions. Effects of premixing of Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 powders on the physical and mechanical properties of <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> coatings have also been reported. The second part of the thesis reports on the erosion wear characteristics of these coatings and composites. The wear response of LDS, ‘LDS + Al 2 O 3 ’ and ‘LDS + TiO 2 ’ coatings have been discussed separately. Comparisons between the erosion characteristics of <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> filled epoxy and polypropylene composites with and without glass fiber reinforcement have also been presented. Parametric analysis and wear response prediction has been made for all the coatings and composites under this study using statistical techniques namely Taguchi experimental design and artificial neural networks (ANN). Correlations have been developed to predict the wear rate for these coatings and composites under different test conditions. x This work suggests that LDS is eminently coatable and deposition of such coatings using plasma spraying route is possible. These coatings possess desirable characteristics such as good adhesion strength, hardness etc. This work further establishes that <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> can also be used as a functional filler in both thermoset and thermoplastic polymers. These <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> filled composites possess very low amount of porosity and improved micro-hardness. They also exhibit improved impact strength as compared to that of the neat polymers. The tensile and flexural strength of the composites are affected by the weight fraction of LDS in the composites. With improved hardness, these composites have the potential to be used in wear related applications. Erosion wear characteristics of LDS coatings and LDS filled polymer composites have been successfully analyzed using Taguchi technique. Significant factors affecting the erosion rate of these coatings and composites are identified through successful implementation of this technique. Two predictive models; one based on artificial neural networks (ANN) approach and the other on Taguchi approach are proposed in this work. It is demonstrated that these models well reflect the effects of various factors on the wear loss and their predictive results are consistent with the experimental observations. Neural computation is successfully applied in this investigation to predict and simulate the wear response of these coatings and composites under various test conditions within and beyond the experimental domain. The predicted and the experimental values of erosion wear rate exhibit good agreement and validate the remarkable capability of a well-trained neural network for these kinds of processes...|$|E

We hypothesized that, by restricting the leaching of metals of toxicological concern such as Cr and V, carbonation can suppress the toxicity of these materials. The cytotoxic activity (WST 1 assay) of slag dusts collected from a stainless and a Linz-Donawitz (LD) steel plant, before and after carbonation, was examined in J 774 macrophages. The release of Cr, V, Fe, Mn and Ni was measured after incubation in artificial lung fluids mimicking the extracellular and phagolysosomal milieu to which particles are confronted after inhalation. <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> had the higher Fe, Mn and V content, and was more cytotoxic than stainless steel slag. The cytotoxic activity of LD but not of stainless dusts was reduced after carbonation. The cytotoxic activity of the dusts toward J 774 macrophages necessitated a {{direct contact with the}} cells and was reduced in the presence of inhibitors of phagocytosis (cytochalasin D) or phagolysosome acidification (bafilomycin), pointing to a key role of metallic constituents released in phagolysosomes.

LDS is generated in great amounts from LD furnaces in steel plants worldwide during steel making. The slag particles of average size 100 μm are reinforced in PEEK resin to prepare particulate filled composites of three different compositions (0, 7. 5 and 15 wt% of LDS). Dry sliding wear trials are conducted following a well-planned experimental schedule based on design of experiments (DOE) using a standard pin-on-disc test set-up. Significant control factors predominantly influencing the wear rate are identified. Effect of LDS content on the wear rate of PEEK composites under different test conditions is studied. The results of the experiments are compared with that of results obtained from wear test of TiO 2 -PEEK composites under same experimental conditions. An Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach taking into account training and test procedure to predict the dependence of wear behavior on various control factors is implemented.

The slag contains 52. 8 and 2. 2 % (w/w) CaO and MgO, respectively. To {{determine the influence of}} <b>LD</b> <b>slag</b> on the chemical characteristics of three acid soils from Gilan, an incubation study was conducted. The soil samples were collected from 0 - 30 cm of rice and tobacco fields and a tea garden. Treatments were 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 % (w/w) of converter slag/kg soil. The slag was thoroughly mixed with 500 g soil in plastic pots. Soil moisture content was adjusted to near field capacity and changes in pH, EC and AB-DTPA-extractable Fe, Mn, Zn, P and K were determined at 1, 10, 30 and 60 days. Results showed that soil pH increased with increasing slag rates. Slag increased AB-DTPA-extractable P and Mn, the magnitude increase depend on the amount of slag applied. However, the effect of slag on AB-DTPA-extractable Fe depended on initial pH, initially decreasing at the pH range of 7. 4 - 8. 5 and then increasing at higher pH levels. Slag decreased AB-DTPA-extractable K especially in highly acid soil. In the present study, soil pH and AB-DTPA-extractable Fe decreased with time, though the effect of incubation time on pH was not significant. The effect of incubation time on AB-DTPA extractable Mn and P was different. Time effect on EC and AB-DTPA-extractable K was not significant. In general, soil chemical characteristics were more affected by slag rates than by incubation time. In conclusion, it seems that converter slag is a suitable amendment for acid soils. It is suggested that the effect of LD converter slag on plant growth and chemical characteristics of acid soils be studied under field conditions...|$|E
