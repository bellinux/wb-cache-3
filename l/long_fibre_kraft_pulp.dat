Tear strength of PGW furnishes was increased when either unrefined or refined sawdust pulp was added. Tear strength of TMP furnishes was not influenced when different sawdust <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> were added. Up to 30 % of unrefined sawdust <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> could be added and no significant negative effect was observed in TMP and PGW furnishes. On the other hand, when refined sawdust <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> was added into the mechanical pulp furnishes, a clear improvement in the tensile strength was observed. According to the economic calculation the production cost of bleached sawdust <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> is almost as low as the production cost of bleached mechanical pulp.

Handsheets were prepared that contained 25 % of the modified fibres. Changes in the modified samples were examined by measuring their mechanical and optical properties and comparing them to those made with unmodified fibres. The observed differences were explained {{and supported by}} structural analyses, by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It {{was found that the}} NaOH/H 2 O pretreatment led to a significant deterioration of optical and strength properties of the handsheets. These modifications affected both the inner part of the crystalline cellulose (change from cellulose I to cellulose II) and the morphology of the fibers. Conversely, these properties slightly improved after propargylation, due to the propargyl functional groups. For the NaCl/H 2 O system, a significant enhancement of the mechanical properties of the handsheets was noted, such as an increase of up to 108 % of the tear index. The propargylation further increased the tear index (by 157 %). These enhancements were not accompanied by significant changes at both the micrometric and nanometric scales, except for the increase of the crystallinity index after propargylatio...|$|R

Sampling sites covered 6 different forest areas within the estate. Prior land use (PLU) significantly affected wood stiffness, density and fibre length but not the <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping</b> traits. In contrast, differences were found between different forest areas for the <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping</b> traits plus <b>fibre</b> length but not for stiffness or density. Pasture sites produced larger trees with bigger branches and slightly lower stiffness and density and shorter fibres. Cleared sites were similar to pasture whilst the timber sites were distinctly different. Density of each log up the tree was lower on pasture sites. However, the correlation between the breast height outer-wood density and the whole tree average density was high and similar for all the 3 land uses.

40|$|<b>Kraft</b> <b>fibre,</b> <b>pulp,</b> and handsheet {{properties}} for 11 standard Pinus radiata D. Don wood samples {{were compared with}} four corresponding samples of the progeny of Clone 850 - 55 (C 55). The standard samples included 9 -, 12 -, 15 -, and 18 -year-old toplog and thinnings, and three slabwood samples. Two toplog and two slabwood C 55 wood samples {{were included in the}} comparison. It is generally accepted that the basic density of standard New Zealand P. radiata wood chips is strongly correlated with pulp coarseness and handsheet properties. For the C 55 -toplog pulps such relationships held for handsheet properties but not for pulp fibre coarseness. For the C 55 -slabwood pulps the converse occurred since standard slabwood and C 55 -slabwood pulp coarseness and handsheet properties were similar but chip basic densities were very different. C 55 <b>kraft</b> <b>fibres,</b> at a given pulp coarseness or fibre wall area, are proportionately large (broad) and thin walled compared with standard P. radiata <b>kraft</b> <b>fibres.</b> Thus, C 55 fibres can be expected to collapse and bond readily one to another and develop high sheet tensile strengths and densities with minimal refining. The handsheet properties obtained supported such interpretations for the C 55 -toplog pulps, but not necessarily for the coarse long-fibred C 55 -slabwood <b>pulps.</b> The <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> and <b>fibre</b> properties of the progeny of Clone 850 - 55 were so unusual that they evoke the question "Is this clone a genetic misfit?" Fibre cross-section dimensions correlated with pulp coarseness more strongly for dried and rewetted pulps than for undried (never dried) pulps. Fibre wall substance densities and porosities are apparently more variable in undried pulps than in dried and rewetted pulps...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns studies of <b>kraft</b> <b>fibre</b> surfaces in respect of chemical composition and effect on <b>pulp</b> bleachability. <b>Kraft</b> <b>fibre</b> surfaces were studied by mechanical peeling using a disintegrator operated at 20. 000 - 200. 000 revolutions and a pulp consistency of 3 % or 4. 5 %. Surfaces of unbleached <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> of different origin and kappa numbers exhibited a high lignin content compared to {{the bulk of the}} fibres. The lignin content of pulp fractions enriched in the ray cells was also higher than that of corresponding fibres. In unbleached pine <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> similar contents of xylan were found in the fibre surfaces and ray cells compared to the fibres, whereas these fractions exhibited a relatively high xylan content in birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> Results obtained for pine <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> indicated no extensive reprecipitation of xylan on the pine fibre surfaces during the pulping process. Metal ion enrichment was observed in both surface material and ray cells of unbleached <b>kraft</b> <b>fibres.</b> The distribution patterns of the metal ions, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ca and Mg were similar to those found in wood. Furthermore, the content of Mn and Ca correlated well with the content of lignin and carboxy groups in the different pulp fractions. In unbleached pine <b>kraft</b> <b>fibres,</b> xylanase acted relatively uniformly on all accessible surfaces, whereas the action of mannanase was more pronounced on the outermost fibre surface than in the inner fibre wall. In unbleached birch <b>kraft</b> <b>fibres,</b> attack on the fibre surface was more extensive compared to the inner parts of the fibres. The action of xylanase on pine and birch <b>kraft</b> <b>fibres</b> differed both in site and intensity, probably reflecting the different chemical composition of the two types of pulp fibres. Fibre surface material and ray cells of both pine and birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> affected the bleachability in an enzyme-aided bleaching with one stage of peroxide treatment. The effect of the enzymic treatment was enhanced when surface material and ray cells were removed prior to treatment and, following peroxide bleaching, a higher brightness level and lower kappa number were obtained compared to the reference pulp. However, removal of surface material and ray cells from a pulp manufactured according to an extended cooking procedure prior to bleaching in a TCF-sequence had no significant effect on the final brightness and kappa number. However, a higher viscosity and brightness stability, and a lower consumption of hydrogen peroxide, was recorded when surface material and ray cells were removed...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the behavior of lignin and carbohydrates in <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> during sulfuric acid bleaching.

Mean basic density of bulked chip samples ranged from 447 kg/m 3 for both ages of E. nitens to 576 kg/m 3 for 11 -year-old E. maidenii. Pulp yields for all wood types were similar, from 54. 5 to 55. 6 %. The <b>kraft</b> <b>fibres</b> of E. maidenii were somewhat longer, with higher wall area (coarseness) {{than those of}} E. globulus, which were in turn of higher coarseness than those^f E. nitens. Fibre collapse potential (as indicated by fibre width / thickness ratio) of both E. maidenii pulps and the E. globulus 11 -year-old material was much less than that for E. nitens. For these six wood origins, pulps of premium quality were obtained from E. globulus aged 11 and from E. maidenii aged 8 years. The pulp from 11 -year-old E. maidenii was too high in bulk, requiring excessive refining, and the pulps from E. nitens (aged 8 and 11 years) were deficient in bulk and unsuitable for many eucalypt market kraft end uses...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to {{study the effects of}} partial removal of wood hemicelluloses on the properties of <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> The work was conducted by extracting hemicelluloses (1) by a softwood chip pretreatment process prior to <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping,</b> (2) by alkaline extraction from bleached birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp,</b> and (3) by enzymatic treatment, xylanase treatment in particular, of bleached birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> The qualitative and quantitative changes in fibers and paper properties were evaluated. In addition, the applicability of the extraction concepts and hemicellulose-extracted birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> as a raw material in papermaking was evaluated in a pilot-scale papermaking environment. The results showed that each examined hemicellulose extraction method has its characteristic effects on fiber properties, seen as differences in both the physical and chemical nature of the fibers. A prehydrolysis process prior to the <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping</b> process offered reductions in cooking time, bleaching chemical consumption and produced fibers with low hemicellulose content that are more susceptible to mechanically induced damages and dislocations. Softwood chip pretreatment for hemicellulose recovery prior to cooking, whether acidic or alkaline, {{had an impact on the}} physical properties of the non-refined and refined pulp. In addition, all the pretreated pulps exhibited slower beating response than the unhydrolyzed reference pulp. Both alkaline extraction and enzymatic (xylanase) treatment of bleached birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> fibers indicated very selective hemicellulose removal, particularly xylan removal. Furthermore, these two hemicellulose-extracted birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> were utilized in a pilot-scale papermaking environment in order to evaluate the upscalability of the extraction concepts. Investigations made using pilot paper machine trials revealed that some amount of alkalineextracted birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp,</b> with a 24. 9 % reduction in the total amount of xylan, could be used in the papermaking stock as a mixture with non-extracted pulp when producing 75 g/m 2 paper. For xylanase-treated fibers there were no reductions in the mechanical properties of the 180 g/m 2 paper produced compared to paper made from the control pulp, although there was a 14. 2 % reduction in the total amount of xylan in the xylanase-treated pulp compared to the control birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> This work emphasized the importance of the hemicellulose extraction method in providing new solutions to create functional fibers and in providing a valuable hemicellulose co-product stream. The hemicellulose removal concept therefore plays an important role in the integrated forest biorefinery scenario, where the target is to the co-production of hemicellulose-extracted pulp and hemicellulose-based chemicals or fuels...|$|R

Sawdust kraft cooking equipped with an impregnation stage increases the cooking yield and decreases the lignin content of the produced pulp. Impregnation also increases viscosity of the pulp and decreases chlorine dioxide consumption in bleaching. In addition, impregnation increases certain pulp properties after refining. Hydrotropic extraction showed that more lignin can be extracted from hardwood than softwood. However, the particle size had a major influence on the lignin extraction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study on fibre cement composite board (CCB) reinforced by Kraft and Blast Furnace Slag Fibres (BFSF) powder. Three {{different types of}} BFSF were used with <b>Kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> extracted from waste cardboard. Three types of slag fibres including SLL (Slag <b>fibre,</b> <b>long</b> length), SLW (slag fibre, white colour) and SLY (slag fibre, yellow colour) {{in the range of}} 1 - 3 % were used in this research. This investigation provides an important insight into the study of the effect of blast furnace slag powder on the property of CCB reinforced by cellulose fibres; as no previous literatures has investigated the use of BFS fibres. The results show that SLL does not have enough consistency with <b>Kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>fibre</b> and degrades the flexural properties of cement board over time. The results of modulus of rupture (MOR) for 7 to 28 days dropped from 11 to 7. 5 MPa, respectively. On the other hand, SLW and SLY are much more compatible with hydrated cement products and <b>Kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>fibre</b> giving MOR values of up to 17. 5 MPa at 28 days...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years, growing {{concerns}} over the modification of fibers have led researchers to focus on enriching the carboxyl group content of fibers by chemical oxidation and topochemical grafting. The current series of experiments continues this line of research by investigating the carboxyl group content of fibers during <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping,</b> alkaline peroxide bleaching, and 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetrametyl- 1 -piperidinyloxy radical (TEMPO) -KBr-NaClO oxidation system. 	The first experiment characterizes changes in the carboxyl group content of fibers for two sets of kraft pulps: 1) conventional laboratory cooked loblolly pine <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps,</b> and 2) conventional pulping (CK) versus Lo-Solids pulping (LS) pulps. The results indicate that effective alkali (EA), temperature, and H-factor are the primary factors controlling fiber charge during <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping.</b> Another set of <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> distinguished by conventional pulping and Lo-Solids pulping were investigated {{to determine the effect}} of H-factor and pulping protocol on fiber charge. 	The second experiment examines the influence of alkaline peroxide treatment on elementally chlorine-free (ECF) bleached softwood <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> The effect of increased fiber charge on refining, cationic starch adsorption, and hornification was examined. 	The final experiment investigates the effect of TEMPO-mediated oxidation of an ECF bleached softwood <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> on carboxyl group content, carbonyl group contents, degree of polymerization, and water retention value of fibers. The results show that TEMPO-mediated oxidation is useful in enriching the carboxyl and carbonyl groups to fibers, as well as enhancing the property of water adsorption of fibers. These findings suggest that: (1) <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping</b> process can be modified to obtain the target carboxyl group content, (2) terminal peroxide bleaching provides higher fiber charge which can save energy and chemical charge of subsequent refining and wet-end processes, respectively, as well as reduce hornification during drying, (3) TEMPO-mediated oxidation of fibers is capable of improving the properties of fibers, including fiber charge and water adsorption, and enhancing final paper strength.
