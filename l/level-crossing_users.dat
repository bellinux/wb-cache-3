30|$|The most {{reliable}} solution {{to decrease the}} risk and accident rate at level crossings is to eliminate unsafe railroad crossings. This avoids any collisions between trains and road users. Unfortunately, this is impossible in most cases, due to location feasibility and cost that would be incurred. For instance, almost 10 million Euros per year are earmarked {{for the removal of}} the most dangerous level crossings in France. To overcome these limits, {{the development of a new}} obstacle-detection system is required. Any proposed system is not intended to replace the currently equipment installed on each level crossing. The purpose of such a system is to provide additional information to the human operator it can be considered as support system operations. This concerns the detection and localization of any kind of objects, such as pedestrians, people on two-wheeled vehicle, wheelchairs, and car drivers. Presently, sensors are evaluated relying on their false object-detection alert among other. This may increase the risk related to <b>level-crossing</b> <b>users.</b> It is important to be noted that risks associated with the use of technology systems are becoming increasingly important in our society. Risk involves notions of failure and consequences of failure. Therefore, it requires an assessment of dependability; this might be expressed, for example, as probability of failure upon demand, rate of occurrence of failures, probability of mission failure, and so on. Each level crossing is equipped with various sensors for timely detection of potentially hazardous situations. To be reliable, the related information must be shared and transmitted to the train dispatching center, stations, train drivers, and road users. Generally, most level crossings are fitted with standard equipments such as lights, automatic full or half barriers, and notices. This equipment warns and prevents all users of the level crossing if a train is approaching the dangerous area.|$|E
