The Salary Reform Act, passed in April 1920, greatly improved the pay of civil servants. In May 1920, the Reich office for Labour Allocation was set up as the first Reich-wide institution [...] "to allocate labor, administer unemployment insurance and generally manage labor concerns". The Reich Insurance Code of May 1920 provided war-wounded persons and dependent survivors with therapeutic treatment and social welfare which had the objective of reintegrating handicapped persons into working life. The Cripples' Welfare Act, passed that same month, made it a duty of the public welfare system to assist cripples {{under the age of}} 18 to obtain the capacity to earn an income. The Reich Homestead Act, passed in May 1920, sought to encourage homesteading as a means of helping economically vulnerable groups. The Reich Tenant Protection Order of 9 June 1920 sought to check evictions and [...] "an immoderate increase of rental rates", authorising the <b>Laender</b> to set up tenancy offices, made up of tenants and owners’ representatives, with a judge as chairman to settle disputes concerning rents. As noted by Frieda Wunderlich, they were entitled [...] "to supervise the fixing of rents for all farms". During Müller’s last year in office, a number of Orders were introduced that “confirmed and defined the protective measures taken in connection with the employment of women in certain work of a particularly dangerous or arduous nature,” which included work in glass-works, rolling mills, and iron foundries (through Orders of the 26th of March 1930).|$|E

We do not find indications for strategic behaviour due to external effects either. Nonetheless, if external effects are regarded as a problem concerning ?Stadtstaaten?, they should rather be internalised by horizontal negotiations than by other instruments such as vertical payments or mergers between <b>Laender.</b> Hence, mergers of <b>Laender</b> {{do not seem to be}} a necessary precondition for decentralisation, which in turn is advisable as our results show.

30|$|In 2009 Germany {{introduced}} a new fiscal rule in its Basic Law. It stipulates that the federal budget must be (structurally) close to balance from 2016 onwards and {{does not allow for}} (structural) budget deficits in the <b>Laender</b> (states’) budgets after 2019. While the already existing debt brakes at the <b>Laender</b> level have relatively wide loopholes, six states do not even seriously consider the introduction of new fiscal rules. In fact, only 9 of the 16 <b>Laender</b> as well as the federal level passed binding consolidation plans. Despite historically high revenues in 2011, most states ran deficits and increased public debt. In this paper, we analyze the German debt brakes at the federal and the <b>Laender</b> levels and assess the probability that the German jurisdictions manage to comply with the constitutional requirements of its debt brake.|$|E

First, the financial situation of the elderly has improved substantially over time. This is true especially for the New <b>Laender,</b> although elderly with residence in the Old <b>Laender</b> remain financially privileged. Within the same age cohort, we also find that non-retired, on average, are financially better-off compared to retired elderly.

40|$|EU {{enlargement}} offers significant {{welfare gains}} to {{old and new}} member states. However, these welfare gains do not come automatically but have to be earned by appropriate adjustments in domestic policies. This is particularly relevant for Germany's New <b>Laender,</b> which could benefit from the proximity to the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe but which also suffer particularly from inefficient institutions in Germany. Welfare gains will only be realised if wage adjustment is flexible. Instead, the German welfare system implicitly creates downward rigid wages. Without appropriate social policy reforms, the competitive pressure and the mobility of capital will destroy jobs in the New <b>Laender.</b> The paper shows the potential benefits and risks of economic integration in a simple partial equilibrium setting with flexible and rigid labour markets, respectively.

40|$|In {{spite of}} its long history, reform of {{financial}} equalization at local government level has not brought the necessary improvements in efficiency. Therefore, {{it is surprising that}} the criticized West German system was transferred almost unchanged to the East German <b>Laender</b> in the course of reunification. Obviously the politicians were in conflict between testing new promising alternatives and preserving the calculable institutional structure. Therefore, this paper compares the financial equalization law of two <b>Laender</b> (Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saxony) in order to research its suitability under different socio-economic conditions. In the analysis we can clearly show the impact of socio-economic characteristics on the carrying ability of institutions, so any transferability of local financial equalization systems has to be rejected.

Our prime contribution is an investigation into how political leaders' socioeconomic background influences public spending priorities. Applying sociological theory, we link preferences for the composition of public spending to social status. In contrast to approaches relying on political budget cycles or partisan theory, we find strong and theory-consistent evidence that prime ministers tend to favour fiscal policies supporting the social class in which they are socialised. Governments led by prime ministers from a poor socioeconomic background spend significantly more on social security, education, health, infrastructure, and public safety...|$|E

There are new ways to be found beyond the institutionalized way of procurement of the enhanced rights. The international partnership with the regions of the similar power and interests (e. g.

40|$|Driven by {{increasing}} environmental awareness {{as well as}} numerous environmental policy measures, the market for environmental goods has expanded {{over the last few}} years, bringing a growing number of jobs. A study of leading German economics research institutes shows that the employment effects of environmental protection have attained considerable dimensions, with nearly a million jobs in 1994 alone, with the service sector being the main beneficiary. And of particular importance: In terms of both population and economic performance, the new <b>Laender</b> are in a better position than the old <b>Laender</b> (the former FRG states) in respect of environmental jobs. In the new <b>Laender</b> important impulses towards creating and safeguarding jobs have emerged from environmental clean-up and development. The concern of this publication is not to promise a job-creation miracle by means of environmental protection alone. Nor is it a matter of legitimising environmental protection in terms of employment policy, for environmental protection does not require employment policy for legitimisation. Rather, the paper wants to provide up-to-date background information to point out the synergies between environmental and employment objectives. It also presents fields of activity which can be helpful to address both environmental and employment policy problems. I do hope that this study can provide some incentives for further action.

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} version. Please do not circle without authors ' consent. Abstract. Deploying {{data from the}} German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) this paper seeks to analyze the variability of individual earnings. Changes in inequality of yearly earnings can {{be the result of}} changes in the distribution of lifetime earnings (permanent changes) and the result changes in the stability of earnings (transitory changes). While a lot of research has been dedicated to prove that both components rose in the U. S. over the past several decades, little has been done for the German case. Permanent and transitory variances of male earnings over the period 1985 - 2004 are estimated to determine their importance in the German earnings dynamics. We find evidence that income volatility is substantial and increasing in Germany, particularly among younger cohorts and less qualified workers. Furthermore, trends in the New German <b>Laender</b> indicate a rise in structural inquality, approximating the earnings distribution of the Old German <b>Laender...</b>|$|E

It became clear that the experience gained and the approach chosen in these cases of remedial action were only generalisable or transferable to a limited degree. The analysis of the particular circumstances and of the feasibility of a remedial measure has proved itself as an essential precondition for the application of ecologically and economically appropriate procedures and techniques. This preliminary step to a sanitation measure, the remedial investigation, permits a flexible and dynamic approach to the optimal harmonisation of remedial action with the location-specific circumstances of a hazardous waste site.
