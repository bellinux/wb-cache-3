The leader of the army is the Fourth Trustee of the Will, Sir Thursday, a Denizen afflicted with the deadly sin of wrath. The army is currently involved in a campaign against the Piper, who is trying to claim the Fourth Key.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains {{that they could not}} stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{the house}} saw {{service as a}} {{depository}} for the evacuated Wallace Collection and a convalescent home. A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park {{was used for the}} inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers to pay the bills, albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition that he and his descendants could continue <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Earl {{also built}} the Grade II* listed Gardener's House {{at the back}} of the park, in a similar Palladian style. The head {{gardener}} of Althorp resided at the villa in the 18th century. Princess Diana had been intent on <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> following her separation from Prince Charles, but due to security concerns it was considered unfeasible. Of particular note is its Victorian three-quarter life-sized marble sculpture, The Shipwrecked Mariner, depicting a sailor reaching desperately from a raft. Charles Spencer has since moved it from the main portico of Gardener's House to the main house.|$|E
25|$|Clemens enjoyed <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> {{partly because}} he knew many {{different}} authors from his Hartford neighborhood, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe who lived next door and Isabella Beecher Hooker.

25|$|In his will, Martin divided his {{property}} among his two younger sons, David and Gottlieb. By the 1790s {{records show that}} Henry, the oldest son, was <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> while Gottlieb was living nearby in a newer house that still stands near the intersection of Willowbrook and Broadway. David had apparently left the area after conveying the land on which Gottlieb built his house to his brother.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a number}} of {{incidents}} related to fraternities and sororities on campus, in 2005, the university decided to purchase the Greek houses.

Students were forbidden from <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> (which is now school-owned housing) or participating in the fraternity's activities. Delta Kappa Epsilon no longer has affiliation with the school.|$|E
25|$|As a result, both Logans {{were able}} to {{continue}} <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> but would {{be treated as a}} single person in matters such as evictions and nominations. Late in the series a special eviction was held where one twin was evicted based on the votes of the other housemates, and the remaining twin allowed to continue in the House as a normal housemate. During this eviction process, David was evicted. However, because Greg was the last housemate to be evicted, both David and Greg shared the prize equally.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} yet who owned the house {{through the middle of}} the next century. But around 1810, it is believed, the {{original}} Federal style mantel on the main fireplace was replaced with the current one. The same 1882 history that assesses the house as being built around 1730 claims that the house had never passed out of the Martin family, although Edward Martin, the family member living in the area at that time, appeared to be <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> Gottlieb Martin had built rather than the older one, which was recorded as being the residence of E.L.

The child cannot be the age of sixteen or older, unless again it is custom or the usage is applicable to the involved parties. An adoption can only occur if there is not a child of the same sex of the adopted child still residing in the home. In particular, if a son were to be adopted then the adoptive father or mother must not have a legitimate or adopted son still <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

At 18 pages of stage directions, the script contained every joke in the episode, an exercise in planning atypical for Shearsmith and Pemberton. The story contains multiple [...] "reveals"; Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith [...] "hope there's an 'oh my God' moment. There is always a desire to wrong-foot the viewer. That's what you strive to do". Pemberton said that writing for a silent episode [...] "makes you inventive in a completely different way".|$|E
