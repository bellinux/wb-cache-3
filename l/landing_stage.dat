5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{opened in}} 1869 {{and served as}} an {{embarkation}} point for paddle steamer excursions for almost exactly 100 years. Two of the spans collapsed during stress testing in 1970 and demolition was proposed, but local fund raising and heritage grants allowed the pier to be dismantled for restoration and reassembled. It reopened in 1989, and ten years later was awarded the Pier of the Year from the National Piers Society, and a Civic Trust Award. The pier now, once again, offers a <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little of}} Bristol Castle remains above ground. The most {{tangible}} survival is a vaulted {{chamber of the}} King's Hall, formerly on Tower Street near the now-truncated Castle Street. Other than that, the excavated remains of the south wall can be seen near the <b>landing</b> <b>stage,</b> and near St Peter's Church the sally port and traces of the west wall are visible. The foundations of the keep are on show next to the public toilets on Newgate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is now}} {{possible}} to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site of the goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on {{a branch of the}} river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> or jetty on the river channel.|$|E
50|$|London {{passenger}} wherries {{evolved into}} the Thames skiff, a gentleman's rowing boat. Wherries were clinker-built with long overhanging bows so that patrons could step ashore dryshod before <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> were built along the river. It is the long angled bow that distinguishes the wherry and skiff from the gig and cutter which have steeper bows following {{the rise of the}} Royal Navy, and the building of <b>landing</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R

50|$|The stages also {{connected}} with public toilets {{that used to}} be in front of the cathedral. While now disused and closed to the public in 1967, Manchester Central Library maps demonstrate their proximity to the <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> on the river, and both stage and toilets are accessible from one another. Explorers have accessed the <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> and documented their current condition, including taking photographs. There was an underground entrance to the stages from the premises of Thomas Cook & Son, which stood on the corner of Victoria Bridge. Evidence of the building was reportedly found inside one of the stages in the form of fire-damaged timber purlins, albeit in very poor condition. It has been suggested that the <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> might be reopened to the public as a tourist attraction.|$|R
5|$|The {{layout of}} the Grand Palace {{followed}} that of the Royal Palace at Ayutthaya in location, organization, and in the divisions of separate courts, walls, gates and forts. Both palaces featured a proximity to the river. The location of a pavilion serving as a <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> for barge processions also corresponded {{with that of the}} old palace. To the north of the Grand Palace there is a large field, the Thung Phra Men (now called Sanam Luang), which is used as an open space for royal ceremonies and as a parade ground. There was also a similar field in Ayutthaya, which was used for the same purpose. The road running north leads to the Front Palace, the residence of the Second King of Siam.|$|E
5|$|There was a wharf on {{the river}} in 1874, served by a railway line, and sidings which were used to collect shingle. By 1909, the wharf had been {{replaced}} by a <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> slightly further downstream, which was also served by the railway. As it nears the sea, a Martello tower, built in 1806 to protect against French invasion, stands {{to the west of the}} channel. It is numbered 28, and was one of many such structures built at the time. Nearby is an Inshore Rescue station, run by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution The river then enters Rye Bay, part of the English Channel.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of Penarth beach and the need for better communications with Cardiff, in 1856 the Cardiff Steam and Navigation Company started a regular ferry service between Cardiff and Penarth. This continued until 1903. Boats were loaded and unloaded at Penarth using a <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> on wheels which was hauled up the beach.|$|E

50|$|There are <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> of {{the tourist}} lines Köln-Düsseldorfer, Bingen-Rüdesheimer Fahrgastschifffahrt and Rösslerlinie. A {{passenger}} ferry and a car ferry link Bingen with Rüdesheim.|$|R
50|$|The current {{ferry boat}} is {{constructed}} principally of wood, and {{was built in}} 1946. The hull is 10.7 m long and 5.1 m wide, with 4.95 m long landing ramps at each end. The engine house is cantilevered approximately 1.1 m out to the side. Because {{of the variation in}} the water level in Lake Hume, the ferry operates between floating <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> which are attached to each bank. The position of the <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> is adjusted by hand winch to suit the level of the water.|$|R
25|$|On 15 September 2008 Waverley was {{involved}} in minor damage to Worthing Pier. After she berthed and secured lines to pier bollards, part of the <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> was dislodged. The ship escaped damage and the only damage to the pier was that a length of timber was pulled out, {{but she had to}} leave without taking on passengers.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, {{he retired}} from school {{inspection}} and made another trip to America. Arnold died suddenly in 1888 of heart failure, when running to meet a tram that would have taken him to the Liverpool <b>Landing</b> <b>Stage</b> to see his daughter, who was visiting from the United States where she had moved after marrying an American. Mrs. Arnold died in June 1901.|$|E
25|$|The Marina opens into Nim Shue Wan, a bay to {{the south}} of DB. There is also a public <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> for cargo boats and privately {{operated}} kat-to ferries that link DB to nearby Peng Chau Island and the Trappist Haven Monastery pier about 2km {{to the south}}. Kai-tos replaced the high-speed ferry to Mui Wo (Silvermine Bay) operated by Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited (DBTPL).|$|E

25|$|The {{flotilla}} {{left their}} anchorage on 29 May, {{but were not}} able to work into a position to attack windward of the rock until 31 May. Lieutenant Maurice assessed the overwhelming strength of the French, and having decided that {{it would be impossible to}} hold the lower stages, spiked the guns covering the <b>landing</b> <b>stage,</b> scuttled the launch, and withdrew his forces to defend the upper levels. Four Spanish gunboats from the ships San Rafael, Argonauta, España and Firme participated in the attack, with a Spanish gunboat being the first to disembark troops on the rock under fire from the British positions. Cosmao began an intense bombardment while the infantry forced their way onto the <b>landing</b> <b>stage,</b> losing three gunboats and two rowing boats full of soldiers as they did so. The attacking force had however neglected to bring any scaling ladders, and could not assault the sheer rock sides. Instead they were forced to besiege the British forces in the upper levels. By 2 June, with his ammunition almost exhausted and water supplies running critically short, Maurice opened negotiations.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{significant}} bodies of water exist close to the village, including the Auchendores reservoir at Cloak (to {{the north of the}} village) and the Knapps Loch, part of the Duchal estate. The Knapps Loch and the area around it is used for recreational activities and events in the village. The Loch is itself artificial, having been created by a local angling club in the early 20th century. It is shallow, with a number of islands, and has a small boathouse and <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> at the shore.|$|E
25|$|The entire island, {{except the}} church {{and a few other}} {{buildings}} which are leased or managed by third parties, is owned by the National Trust. Most of the buildings are situated near the small <b>landing</b> <b>stage.</b> The northern portion of the island is a Nature Reserve managed by Dorset Wildlife Trust and an important habitat for birds; this part of the island has limited public access. A small portion to the southeast of the island, along with Brownsea Castle, is leased to the John Lewis Partnership for use as a holiday hotel for staff, and is not open to the public.|$|E
50|$|You can cruise on the Biggesee. From April {{to the end}} of October, {{two ships}} of the Personenschifffahrt Biggesee ply the lake. A round trip takes ca. 2 hours. There are five <b>landing</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
