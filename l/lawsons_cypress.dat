5000|$|North Coast Collection - {{features}} various broadleaf and evergreen {{plants of}} coastal Northern California, including California bay laurel, <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress,</b> bigleaf maple, dogwood, and Lindera (spice bush).|$|R
5000|$|It {{was first}} {{discovered}} (by Euro-Americans) near Port Orford in Oregon and introduced into cultivation in 1854, by collectors working for Charles Lawson FRSE of the Lawson & Son nursery in Edinburgh, Scotland, after {{whom it was}} named as <b>Lawson</b> <b>Cypress</b> by the describing botanist Andrew Murray. The USDA officially calls it by the name Port Orford cedar, as do most people in its native area, but some botanists prefer to use the name <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> (or in very rare instances Port Orford cypress) instead. The name [...] "Lawson's cypress" [...] is widely used in horticulture.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 {{there was}} an {{outbreak}} of the tree disease Phytophthora lateralis, affecting approximately 800 <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> trees over a two hector area. Felling of infected trees was carried out to prevent further spread.|$|R
50|$|San Lorenzo de El Escorial {{also has}} some {{allochthonous}} in its mountain areas, plant species as beech (American beech), cedars, larches, <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypresses</b> (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), and sycamores (Acer pseudoplatanus). Students of a forestry school planted these trees during the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} is over 250 years old, {{and contains}} remarkable specimens of Castanea sativa, the rare Fagus sylvatica 'Tortuosa', Ginkgo biloba, <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress,</b> and Sciadopitys verticillata, {{as well as}} American oak, cedar, Magnolia stellata, and Rhododendron ponticum. This site was also the location of Julie-Victoire Daubié's herbarium.|$|R
50|$|Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, {{known as}} Port Orford cedar or <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress,</b> is {{a species of}} conifer in the genus Chamaecyparis, family Cupressaceae. It is native to Oregon and northwestern California, and grows from sea level up to 1500 m in the valleys of the Klamath Mountains, often along streams.|$|R
50|$|At {{the centre}} of the village is Hatchet Green, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Conservation Area. It {{contains}} various tree species including oak, ash, birch, holly, <b>lawson</b> <b>cypress,</b> chestnut and hawthorn. It was taken over by the Parish Council in 1975 because no owner could be traced.|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{was first}} {{established in the}} 19th century as the Canal du Midi administration's experimental site for exotic trees. After forty years of neglect, restoration began in 1995. Older trees include araucarias, <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypresses,</b> sequoiadendrons, thujas, and Virginia tulip trees; these have been augmented with new plantings of cedar of Lebanon, Ginkgo biloba, liquidambar, Negundo maple, etc.|$|R
50|$|Royat is a {{spa town}} {{at the foot of}} the Parc des Volcans d'Auvergne and the Puy-de-Dôme, {{developed}} from 1850 onwards. The arboretum was established in 1931, and currently contains walking paths through over 40 types of trees, including conifers from North America and Europe such as Douglas fir, larch, and <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress.</b> It is managed by the Office National des Forêts.|$|R
25|$|The {{geological}} {{composition of}} the summit is predominantly quartzite. The high ground {{is a mixture of}} heathland and commercial forestry while the lower slopes are mainly farmland. The forest on the mountain is mixed woodland including Lodgepole pine, Noble fir, Japanese larch, <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress,</b> Scots pine, birch and beech trees and is a habitat for badgers, rabbits and a variety of birds. The area around the summit includes a number of sites of historical interest including the former lead works at Ballycorus and the ruined church and round tower at Rathmichael.|$|R
50|$|From Puck's Castle Lane, {{the trail}} enters Carrickgollogan Wood. These woods consist of 85 ha of mixed {{woodland}} including Lodgepole pine, Noble fir, Japanese larch, <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress,</b> Scots pine, birch and beech. The ruin of the flue chimney {{of the former}} Ballycorus Leadmines, with its distinctive external spiral staircase becomes visible as the trail climbs the hillside. The route passes close to but does not ascend the summit of Carrickgollogan Hill (276 m), which {{can be reached by}} a short detour along the waymarked Lead Mines Way. The trail emerges from Carrickgollogan onto Murphy's Lane and thence to Barnaslingan Lane where it enters Barnaslingan Wood.|$|R
50|$|With {{regard to}} vegetation, the area holds {{important}} deciduous forests, {{especially in the}} aspect of Alava (Altube area). The tree that occupies the largest area with about 6,000 have been, but we also found robledades sessile oak and pedunculate oak, and sketches of Cantabrian holm oak and strawberry trees reveal that centuries ago the climate was much warmer. Alders, willows, ash, and poplars are increasingly rare riparian forests found to shelter species of great interest. The conifers, mostly exotic species planted for forestry, occupy much of the Park's area, among the most representative of these plantations are insignis and radiata pine (Pinus radiata), <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> and the black pine (Pinus nigra).|$|R
5000|$|Phytophthora lateralis (Tucker & Milbrath) is a soil-borne plant {{pathogen}} that causes cedar root disease in <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypresses,</b> called Port Orford cedar trees (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana Murray) in Northern USA. This pathogen was first noted to cause disease in around 1920 on nursery stock near Seattle WA. Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia Nutt.) is also vulnerable to P. lateralis [...] but less susceptible than Port Orford cedar trees, and tree mortality {{has only been}} observed in areas where C. lawsoniana trees were also infected. Asiatic species of Chamaecyparis are generally described as resistant to P. lateralis, although this pathogen is occasionally isolated from Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold & Zucc.) Endl. (Hinoki cypress) in nurseries.|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora lateralis is a fungus-like (oomycete) {{pathogen}} {{of trees}} in the family Cupressaceae, including Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (<b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> or Port Orford cedar). Known in North America since the 1920 s, presumably having been accidentally introduced from its assumed East Asian centre of origin, until recently, this pathogen has not been identified causing disease in Europe {{except for a few}} isolated outbreaks. However, since 2010, there have been several reports of infection of C. lawsoniana by P. lateralis in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland. We sequenced the genomes of four isolates of P. lateralis from two sites in Northern Ireland in 2011. Comparison with the closely related tree and shrub pathogen P. ramorum (cause of ramorum disease of larch and other species in the UK) shows that P. lateralis shares 91. 47...|$|R
40|$|Isolates of Armillaria mellea and A. gallica that {{differed}} in virulence to healthy blackcurrant, strawberry, <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> and privet {{were used to}} inoculate plants exposed to different watering regimes. Host plants from which water had either been withheld or their roots kept constantly flooded with water, both showed increased susceptibility compared to those plants, which had been watered regularly.

40|$|Abstract [...] Strength {{of double}} lap joints of wood (<b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress)</b> {{including}} a glued end butt joint at center was analyzed by applying Fracture Mechanics. Approximate stress {{analysis was conducted}} in accordance with Volkersen type theory. Apparent strain energy release rate G * of the joints was derived from applying the J-integral to the stress components. I t was assumed that the apparent strain energy release rate G * of the joints was propotional to the strain energy release rate G of cracked adhesive joint specimen subjecting to shear force and expressed as G*=NG. Fracture criterion was assumed that when G * reached its critical value G*c (=NGc), fracture occured at the right-angled corner of the joints. Experimental results showed good applicability of derived equation on predicting strength of the joints when N was 0. 5 and Gc was 0. 25 kg. cm/cm 2 • A simple but conservative design equation between strength and the half lap length of the joints based on the experimental results and derived equation was proposed...|$|R
40|$|A short paper noting on the {{uncertainty}} of the relationship between taxonomic position and the form of mycorrhiza and recording a recent case of double infection in <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> (Cbamaecyparis lawsoniana PaiL) in the south of England. FRANK'S (i) classification of mycorrhizas into ectotrophic and endotrophicforms is still accepted in botanical textbooks, and although the separation of these two types may sometimes appear rigid and inadequate (Rayner, 2; Harley 3), it is nevertheless generally convenient and informative. There are a number of lists available supplying the names of plants regularly affected by one or other of these two forms of mycorrhizal infection, but this classification into ectotrophic and endotrophic plants is useful only so long as comparison is made with typical examples of these types. It has long been recognized (1) that while the endotrophic form is widely distri-buted among numerous plant species, the ectotrophic form seems to be re-stricted to certain forest trees and shrubs: the Pinaceae, Fagus, Betula, Corylus, Quercus, and many other members of the Fagales [presence of ectotrophic mycorrhizas in wild fruit-trees has been reported by Stahl (4) and described b...|$|R
5000|$|Only one {{existing}} {{cemetery in}} the vicinity, Fraser Cemetery in New Westminster (established in 1870), {{is older than}} Mountain View. When Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1886, it supplanted burial grounds in what was designated Stanley Park that same year as the city’s cemetery. The original parcel of land {{now known as the}} [...] "Old Section" [...] is bounded by Fraser Street on the east, 37th Avenue on the south, 33rd on the north, and three remaining trees from what was once a row of tall <b>Lawson</b> <b>Cypress</b> trees on the west. Land on the north of this was purchased in 1901 for an expansion and became the [...] "Horne I Addition" [...] - named after the developer who sold the land. The Jones farm between 37th and 41st Avenues was added in 1910 as the Jones I and Jones II Additions, and in 1922, an additional piece was acquired west of the Horne I Addition. The [...] "1919 Addition" [...] is a tract bounded by 41st and 43rd Avenues, and contains many victims of the Spanish flu pandemic that took many hundreds of lives of local residents. The final addition is the Abray Park Addition on the western side, acquired in 1941 through a land swap with the Vancouver Park Board and was named after a squatter, Nonus Abray, who previously lived on the land and tended an orchard and grazed cattle there. Burial sites historically were often grouped together along the lines of religion (e.g., Jewish), nationality (e.g., Chinese and Japanese), or organizational affiliation (e.g., Freemasons and Oddfellows). Other groupings are pauper grave sites and war veterans.|$|R
40|$|Our {{investigation}} comprised {{a plot of}} 0. 58 ha in a stand {{established by}} afforestation of farmland during spring 2007. The stand includes 16 different tree species (listed below), ten of which were planted at establishment, while the remaining six species were introduced as replacement planting or invaded spontaneously. Based on their frequency in this stand and their potential economic importance, we consider sycamore, cherry, walnut and Sorbus torminalis as the main species. The plot included a total of 116 Sorbus torminalis trees. The soil developed on sandy glacial till (type luvisol, or similar) with a fragipan {{at a depth of}} 40 cm (Figure 1). During the first five years after planting the height growth of Sorbus torminalis was almost the same as for ash and Norway spruce (Figure 3). Sycamore and cherry grew faster and ranged at the same level as Sitka spruce. For walnut the variation in height growth was substantial, but the best walnut trees grew almost as fast as ash. In 2010 and 2011 the average annual height growth of the 50 tallest trees ranged at 111 - 156 cm for sycamore, 90 - 126 cm for cherry, 71 - 113 cm for wild service tree, 87 - 96 cm for ash, 86 cm for walnut and 48 - 89 cm for Port Orford cedar / <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> (Table 2). So far, we have been unable to detect any statistically significant influence of topography or depth to the fragipan on height growth. The mortality of Sorbus torminalis was low (9 percent). The most significant problem for Sorbus torminalis was browsing by hare during a period of high snow cover in the winter of 2010 (Table 1 and Figure 2). This effectively reduced the height of the affected trees to 35 - 40 cm (Figure 3). No other tree species were browsed (the area was fenced). In 2012 we pre-selected 100 evenly distributed potential future crop trees per ha and 100 reserve trees. Out of these, only 9 trees were Sorbus torminalis, 23 were walnut, 31 were sycamore and 53 were cherry. During the selection, sycamore and cherry were avoided in favour of Sorbus torminalis and walnut. In the discussion we emphasize the challenge of managing a mixture of 16 different tree species. We point out the urgent need for timely regulation of the light conditions to favour Sorbus torminalis as well as walnut (Figure 4) and the need for early formative pruning as well as subsequent, regular high pruning to avoid inferior timber quality for the main species (Figure 5). We also point out that many of the 'additional' species should be regarded only as serving {{for the benefit of the}} hardwood timber species (sycamore, cherry, walnut, Sorbus torminalis). Finally, we conclude that the stand includes a suitable share of high-quality stems of sycamore and cherry, if Sorbus torminalis or walnut should fail completely...|$|R
40|$|Human-wildlife {{conflict}} is common wherever humans and wildlife coexist {{and is a}} growing problem in urban landscapes. Successfully mitigating conflict with wildlife requires {{an understanding of the}} ecological and social dimensions of the problem. In Wellington City, New Zealand, a human-wildlife {{conflict is}} beginning to emerge with North Island kākā (Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis: Nestoridae), a threatened endemic parrot that was reintroduced to the city in 2002. Kākā damage property but especially damage tree bark while foraging for sap. In this thesis, I investigate the conflict with kākā using ecological, behavioural and social science approaches to understand the problem and recommend ways to mitigate the growing conflict with kākā. To investigate tree selection for sap foraging by kākā, I sampled the characteristics, microhabitat and distribution (independent variables) of 282 trees at 15 sites across public greenspaces in Wellington City, and used model averaging to determine the relative influence of independent variables on the binary dependant variable – presence/absence of bark damage. Tree size (Σωᵢ [Akaike weight] = 0. 859) and site exposure (Σωᵢ = 0. 739) had the greatest influence on tree selection for sap feeding. Kākā were found to prefer larger trees (x ± SE, DBH: x damaged = 64. 8 ± 5. 2 cm, x undamaged = 32. 9 ± 4. 5 cm) at more exposed sites. Exotic species {{were significantly more likely to}} have been damaged than native species (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0. 001). Seven of 10 tree species damaged were exotic, and exotic conifers, such as macrocarpa (Cupressus macrocarpa) and <b>Lawson</b> <b>cypress</b> (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) were the most commonly damaged species. I used instantaneous scan sampling to record kākā behaviour during 25 60 - 100 minute observation periods at Anderson Park, Wellington Botanic Garden, and during 12 opportunistic observations of sap feeding kākā in Wellington City during other research activities. Forty observations of sap feeding were made and 20 sap feeding kākā identified. Based on estimated sex, females were no more likely to sap feed than males (exact binomial test p = 0. 916) and both adults and juveniles were observed sap feeding. Kākā were observed displacing sap-feeding conspecifics and defending sap feeding sites from tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae). This indicates that sap is an important resource across sexes and life stages of kākā and is not just a supplementary food for females before breeding as previously hypothesised. Since supplementary food is provided by Karori Wildlife Sanctuary and utilised by the identified kākā, and 34 % of Wellington residents provide food and water for birds, it is unlikely that further provision of supplementary food will reduce sap feeding. To investigate residents’ attitudes and problems with birds, I hand-delivered 1030 questionnaires to households in 10 Wellington City suburbs. I then assessed the relationship between a person’s attitude and their biodiversity knowledge, engagement with birds and greenspaces and experience of bird problems. An extraordinary survey return rate of 61. 8 % (n = 635) revealed that residents had overwhelmingly positive attitudes towards native birds, despite 25 % experiencing a bird problem. Planting trees to attract birds was the only predictor to provide substantial inference for attitude (ωi = 0. 873). Experiencing a problem with birds was not an influential predictor of attitude when modelled alone (ΔAIC = 17. 50, ωi = 0. 000), but when combined additively (ωi = 0. 568) and interactively (ωi = 0. 400) with planting to attract birds these models comprised the confidence set. Respondents who had planted to attract birds were more likely to have more positive attitudes than the rest of the population even when they reported a bird problem. Hence, attitude to birds and tolerance of problems they cause was most closely associated with a person’s positive engagement with birds rather than their negative experiences...|$|R
