30|$|Venoarterial extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (VA-ECMO) {{is increasingly}} {{being used as}} a support system for patients with cardiogenic shock refractory to conventional medical therapies [1]. <b>Levosimendan</b> is a calcium-sensitizing inotropic agent that improves myocardial function in patients with cardiogenic shock [2]. Unlike other inotropes like dobutamine, <b>levosimendan</b> has anti-inflammatory properties and does not increase myocardial oxygen consumption [3]. Nevertheless, debates continue in clinical practice regarding the beneficial effects of <b>levosimendan</b> in patients with cardiogenic shock or low cardiac output syndrome who are not treated with VA-ECMO [4 – 7]. While <b>levosimendan</b> has been shown to improve endothelial function and to increase cardiac index in cardiogenic shock patients undergoing VA-ECMO [8], few data are available on the impact of <b>levosimendan</b> in refractory cardiogenic shock patients undergoing VA-ECMO [9 – 11].

Following a 24 -h infusion of <b>levosimendan,</b> {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} was re-attempted. <b>Levosimendan</b> significantly improved LV ejection fraction and oxygenation variables and contributed to successful weaning in 7 out of 12 patients [17]. Also, the short-term hemodynamic effects of <b>levosimendan,</b> compared to dobutamine, were studied in 10 COPD patients experiencing weaning difficulties related to increased PAOP [83]. <b>Levosimendan</b> resulted in significantly greater inhibition of SBT-induced increase in PAOP and mean pulmonary artery pressure than dobutamine. Moreover, on mechanical ventilation, the rate-pressure product remained constant with <b>levosimendan</b> infusion, whereas it was significantly increased with dobutamine infusion. All included patients were ultimately extubated without the adjunct of any other cardiovascular drug. Lastly, use of <b>levosimendan</b> effectively contributed to successful weaning in difficult-to-wean patients with impaired LV function in a study available only in an abstract form [87] as well as in single patients with LV dysfunction of various etiologies [88, 89].|$|E
40|$|<b>Levosimendan</b> {{is a new}} {{agent for}} the {{treatment}} of acute heart failure. <b>Levosimendan</b> acts via complementary mechanisms; it enhances contractility by sensitising cardiac myofilaments to calcium and dilates blood vessels by opening ATP-dependent potassium channels. In contrast to traditional inotropes (beta-agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors), <b>levosimendan</b> does not raise myocyte calcium levels and is therefore less likely to elicit arrhythmias or to impair diastolic relaxation. The clinical efficacy of <b>levosimendan</b> is supported by four key clinical studies, including more than 900 patients hospitalised for cardiac decompensation due to acutely worsened chronic heart failure or to heart failure following myocardial infarction. When given as short-term therapy, <b>levosimendan</b> enhances cardiac output, reduces systemic vascular resistance and lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 31 days post-treatment, mortality rates were halved in decompensated chronic heart failure patients who received <b>levosimendan,</b> compared with those on dobutamine - an advantage sustained at 180 days. Similar survival gains were observed among acute failure patients treated with <b>levosimendan</b> following myocardial infarction.

Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the role of <b>levosimendan</b> as a modulator of the apoptosis/autophagy interplay in liver cells subjected to peroxidation and the related involvement of NO and mitoKATP. In primary rat hepatocytes that have been subjected to oxidative stress, Western blot was performed to examine endothelial and inducible NO synthase isoforms (eNOS, iNOS) activation, apoptosis/autophagy and survival signalling detection in response to <b>levosimendan.</b> In addition, NO release, cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were examined through specific dyes. Some of those evaluations were also performed in human hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Pre-treatment of hepatocytes with <b>levosimendan</b> dose-dependently counteracted the injuries caused by oxidative stress and reduced NO release by modulating eNOS/iNOS activation. In hepatocytes, while the autophagic inhibition reduced the effects of <b>levosimendan,</b> after the pan-caspases inhibition, cell survival and autophagy in response to <b>levosimendan</b> were increased. Finally, all protective effects were prevented by both mitoKATP channels inhibition and NOS blocking. In HSC, <b>levosimendan</b> was able to modulate the oxidative balance and inhibit autophagy without improving cell viability and apoptosis. <b>Levosimendan</b> protects hepatocytes against oxidative injuries by autophagic-dependent inhibition of apoptosis and the activation of survival signalling.

A majority of <b>levosimendan</b> infusions were administered to children who were undergoing cardiac surgery (72 %), 14 % to children with cardiomyopathy and 14 % to children with cardiac failure. Eighty-nine out of the 293 patients (30. 4 %) received repeated doses of <b>levosimendan</b> (up to 11 infusions). The most common indication for the use of <b>levosimendan</b> (94 %) was when the other inotropic agents were insufficient to maintain stable hemodynamics. <b>Levosimendan</b> was especially used in children with cardiomyopathy (100 %) or with low cardiac output syndrome (94 %).

When BP dropped to 50 % of baseline rats received 1 of 7 treatments: (1) 0. 9 % saline (control), (2) <b>levosimendan</b> 36 mg/kg loading dose then 0. 6 mg/kg per min, (3) <b>levosimendan</b> 0. 6 mg/kg per min, (4) epinephrine 0. 5 mg/kg per min, (5) <b>levosimendan</b> 70 mg/kg loading dose then 1. 2 mg/kg per min, (6) <b>levosimendan</b> 1. 2 mg/kg per min, and (7) <b>levosimendan</b> 70 mg/kg loading dose alone.

30|$|CS {{refractory}} to catecholamines can {{be treated}} by perfusion of phosphodiesterase inhibitors [16] or <b>levosimendan</b> [17]. While these two drug classes improve macrocirculatory hemodynamics, only <b>levosimendan</b> appears to improve prognosis [17]. <b>Levosimendan</b> improves myocardial performance by increasing myofilament calcium sensitivity, without raising intracellular calcium and AMP concentrations. It therefore does not increase or has very little myocardial oxygen consumption. There is a pharmacodynamic rationale {{for the use of}} <b>levosimendan</b> in patients on chronic beta-blocker treatment. In CS refractory to catecholamines, it seems logical to consider the use of circulatory support rather than increased pharmacological support.|$|E

Fourteen male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into two groups of seven animals each. Group 1 was not exposed to <b>levosimendan</b> and served as a control. <b>Levosimendan</b> (12 lg/kg) diluted in 10 ml 0. 9...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{present the}} case of a patient with dilatative {{cardiomyopathy}} waiting for heart transplantation with pleural effusion to be subjected to pleural biopsy, treated with preoperative infusion of <b>levosimendan</b> to improve heart performances. Presentation of case: A 56 -year-old man (BMI 22, 49) with dilatative cardiomyopathy (EF 18 %) presented right pleural effusion. The <b>levosimendan</b> treatment protocol consisted of 24  h continuous infusion (0, 1  ug/kg/min), without bolus. The patient was under continuous hemodynamic monitoring prior, during and after <b>levosimendan</b> administration. The surgery for pleural biopsy was performed with uniportal Video Assisted Thoracoscopic approach (VATS). Discussion: A significant increase of Cardiac Index (CI) and Stroke Volume Index (SVI) were observed at 4  h after infusion initiation and was sustained during the next 24  h after the end of infusion. <b>Levosimendan</b> administration was safe. Conclusion: In this case the prophylactic preoperative <b>levosimendan</b> administration is safe and effective in cardiac failure patient undergoing thoracic surgery, but prophylactic preoperative <b>levosimendan</b> treatment in these patients merits further study...|$|E
