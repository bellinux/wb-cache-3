The main function of the ALAX is to provide an interface between legacy LAN and ATM world giving network managers the option of gradually integrating ATM technology into their existing networks.

The most important design characteristics of the ALAX is the adoption of the IEEE P 1355 Standard for Heterogeneous Inter Connect (HIC) [1] as the data communication paths within the ALAX switching system.

This paper presents Quality of Service analyses in wired and wireless IP networks based on the three popular techniques – RSVP, IntServ, and DiffServ. The analyses are based on a quick approximation schema of the traffic system with static and dynamic changes of the system bounds. We offer a simulation approach where a typical leaky bucket model is ap- proximated with a G/D/ 1 /k traffic system with flexible bounds in waiting time, loss and priority. The approach is applied for two cascaded leaky buckets. The derived traffic system is programmed in C++. The simula- tion model is flexible to the dynamic traffic changes and priorities. Student criterion is applied in the simulation program to prove results.
