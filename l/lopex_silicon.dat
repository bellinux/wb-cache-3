40|$|Lithium {{doped silicon}} solar cells having {{dimensions}} {{as large as}} 12 sq cm are now possible, due to significantly improved boron-diffusion techniques. A large increase was observed in the short circuit current measured in tungsten light for cells that were fabricated using the improved diffusion techniques as compared with previous cells, indicating a preservation of minority carrier diffusion length in the base region of the former cells. Sintering of the contacts of lithium doped cells fabricated from <b>Lopex</b> <b>silicon</b> resulted in large increases in maximum power, mostly due to an open circuit voltage improvement, over non-sintered cells. Efficiencies as high as 12. 8 % were observed, with the average efficiency being about 11. 9 %...|$|E
40|$|The work {{performed}} {{to investigate the}} effect of various process parameters {{on the performance of}} lithium doped P/N solar cells is described. Effort was concentrated in four main areas: (1) the starting material, (2) the boron diffusion, (3) the lithium diffusion, and (4) the contact system. Investigation of starting material primarily involved comparison of crucible grown silicon (high oxygen content) and <b>Lopex</b> <b>silicon</b> (low oxygen content). In addition, the effect of varying growing parameters of crucible grown silicon on lithium cell output was also examined. The objective of the boron diffusion studies was to obtain a diffusion process which produced high efficiency cells with minimal silicon stressing and could be scaled up to process 100 or more cells per diffusion. Contact studies included investigating sintering of the TiAg contacts and evaluation of the contact integrity...|$|E
