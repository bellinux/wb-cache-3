5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At the end of {{the last}} Ice Age, the glaciers left behind a uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> fertile terrain.|$|E

5|$|A {{nobelium}} atom has 102 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f147s2 (ground state term symbol 1S0), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, all the three valence electrons may be lost, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> a 5f13 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. Nevertheless, {{it is more likely that}} only two valence electrons may be lost, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> a stable 5f14 core with a filled 5f14 shell. The first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most (6.65±0.07)eV in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to nobelium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate and octacoordinate No3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 90 and 102pm respectively; the ionic radius of No2+ has been experimentally found to be 100pm to two significant figures. The enthalpy of hydration of No2+ has been calculated as 1486kJ·mol−1.|$|E
5|$|As {{the more}} massive stars appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> {{one or more}} young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join {{the population of the}} Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E

Kertész was among numerous Hungarian artists who emigrated during these decades, including François Kollar, Robert Capa, Emeric Fehér, Brassaï, and Julia Bathory. Man Ray, Germaine Krull and Lucien Aigner also emigrated to Paris during this period.|$|E

5|$|After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is {{restored}} to freedom {{and returned to}} his family, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> the other slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Solomon never met again.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions.

Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be <b>leaving</b> <b>behind,</b> as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside.

In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Shengzong died in 1031, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> {{instructions}} that named his son Yelü Zongzhen as heir. Yelü Zongzhen, known historically {{by the name}} Emperor Xingzong of Liao, became the Emperor of the Liao dynasty {{at the age of}} fifteen, and his reign immediately became plagued with courtly infighting. Emperor Xingzong's mother was a low-ranking consort, Nuou Jin, but he was raised by Emperor Shengzong's wife, Empress Ji Dian. Nuou Jin quickly moved to marginalize Ji Dian and her supporters, fabricating a coup and using it to justify exiling Ji Dian and executing most of her supporters in several months of purges. Nuou Jin eventually sent assassins to kill Ji Dian; however, Ji Dian instead committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union {{splintered}} {{into several}} different factions.

Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, <b>leaving</b> <b>behind</b> an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E
