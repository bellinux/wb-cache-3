40|$|Communication is {{increasingly}} present for managing and controlling critical infrastructures strengthening their cyber interdependencies. In electric power systems, grid splitting is a topical communication-critical application. It amounts to separating a power system into islands {{in response to}} an impending instability, e. g., <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> generator <b>synchronism</b> due to a component fault, by appropriately disconnecting transmission lines and grouping synchronous generators. The successful application of grid splitting depends on the communication infrastructure to collect system-wide synchronized measurements and to relay the command to open line switches. Grid splitting may be ineffective if communication is degraded and its outcome may also depend on the system loading conditions. This paper investigates the effects of degraded communication and load variability on grid splitting. To this aim, a communication delay model is coupled with a transient electrical model and applied to the IEEE 39 -Bus and the IEEE 118 -Bus Test System. Case studies show that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> generator <b>synchronism</b> following a fault is mitigated by timely splitting the network into islands. On the other hand, the results show that communication delays and increased network flows can degrade the performance of grid splitting. The developed framework enables the identification of the requirements of the dedicated communication infrastructure for a successful grid-splitting procedure...|$|R

However, bit errors {{can cause a}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> decoder <b>synchronism</b> that often leads to error propagation.

However, it is still important to model the performance of various VLC code sets so that comparisons can be made between different coding schemes and for different applications. Communicating sequential processes (CSP) is a well-established formal description technique that allows one to analyse the behaviour of concurrently evolving processes. It has been successfully applied to industrial-scale problems. The paper describes how CSP {{can be applied to the}} modelling of the resync process of VLC. This approach offers three main advantages. First, a complete model comprises processes and events as basic building blocks, making this approach highly scalable. Second, different semantic models provide different level of abstraction. Third, tools are available for automatic generation of sync sequences, which also provide a measure of sync performance. This facilitates comparisons of different VLC schemes in addition to code sets obtained using a given coding scheme...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} an {{open loop}} stepping electric drive (SEP) with electric crushing of a step and motor fed from the controlled current invertor which should {{meet the requirement}} that is to trial a free-form guided trajectory with a split-hair accuracy. It is shown that with traditional programmed control, when the SEP forms motor phase currents of identical amplitude and variable frequency proportional to the set speed of movement, there may be considerable errors reducing a trial accuracy of the set movement trajectory, dynamic indicators provoking oscillatory processes, and even <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> motor <b>synchronism</b> because influence on a dynamic moment of the motor is impossible. The paper offers and proves {{a new way to}} define a control algorithm adequate to drive parameters and programmed trajectory of movement, providing error minimization and thereby increasing trial accuracy of set parameters of movement and expanding dynamic capabilities of a drive. The essence of the offered way is to use a modified mathematical model of a drive in d,q coordinates with a motor fed by the current source. In this model a programmed trajectory of movement is chosen as an input action while solving the appropriate equations defines the necessary law of control. The paper describes a developed simulation model of the stepping electric drive in the environment of MATLAB – SIMULINK, which has been used to verify and prove an efficiency of the offered method to define a control law via typical examples. It is established that no error trial of set movement trajectory in case it has breaks (jogs) is technically unfeasible, as it demands an infinitely high forcing voltage of the power supply to maintain the instant positive or negative phase shifts of currents formed in the motor windings. The obtained results can be used in designing programmable precision SEPs in robots, numerically controlled machine tools, and assembly equipment. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} era, the power system {{has become a}} vital part to provide {{stability}} enhancement. The stability of a power system depends on how low frequency disturbances which are typically in the frequency range of 0. 2 to 3. 0 Hz, accurately find out and cleared so that quick restoration and maintains a stability enhancement of power is accomplished. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> and stability enhancement are needs to be performed using ANFIS controlled based excitation of power system [3]. The significant factors which affect the operation of power system during the occurrence of low frequency disturbances are mainly; <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> which might be excited by the disturbances in the system or, in some cases, might even build up spontaneously. These factors can be analyzed {{to find out the}} occurrence of the low frequency disturbance in the power line operation. Various techniques like Power System Stabilizer with algorithm based or logic controlled based, UPFC has been used in past to find out and cleared the different low frequency disturbances occurred in the transmission line.

To avoid the drawbacks of conventional power system stabilizer with algorithm or logic controller based techniques, this dissertation proposed, an efficient and robust technique of stability enhancement using ANFIS based power system excitation.

40|$|Abstract — Power {{systems are}} subject {{to a wide range}} of small or large {{disturbances}} during operating conditions. Small changes in loading conditions occur continually. The power system must adjust to these changing conditions and continue to operate satisfactorily and within the desired limits of voltage and frequency. The power system should be designed to survive larger types of disturbances, such as faults, loss of a large generator, or line switching. Certain system disturbances may cause <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> between a generator and rest of the utility system, or between interconnected power systems of neighboring utilities. If such a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>synchronism</b> occurs, it is imperative that the generator or system areas operating asynchronously are separated immediately to avoid widespread outages and equipment damage. Here it is described to distinguish between power swing and real fault. It is also discussed recent enhancements in the design of out of step tripping and blocking protection functions that improve the security and reliability of the power system. In addition to that the behavior of distance relay element during power swing and during fault is simulated using MATLAB and SIMULINK simulations...|$|E

However, a question still exists: how to avoid the wake field deterioration and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the phase <b>synchronism</b> between the plasma wave and the electrons that prevent them from being accelerated up to the theoretical limit. In order to obtain the highest possible values of the wake electric field one must use as intense laser pulses as possible i. e., pulses with dimensionless amplitudes a {much_gt} 1. Pulses that have a dimensionless amplitude larger than one tend to be subject to a host of instabilities, such as relativistic self-focusing, self modulation and stimulated Raman scattering, that affect their propagation in the plasma. Such processes could be beneficial, in so far as they increase the pulse energy density, enhance the wake field generation, and provide the mechanism for transporting the laser radiation over several Rayleigh lengths without diffraction spreading. However, it is still far from certain that these processes can be exploited in a controlled form and can lead to regular, stationary wake fields. It is known that, in order to create good quality wake fields, it would be preferable to use laser pulses with steep fronts of order {lambda}{sub p}.
