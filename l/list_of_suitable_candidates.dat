This commission {{was made up of}} the kaza müdürü, the kadi, the mufti, the imam, kaza scribes, and religious leaders of non-Muslim residents. The commission was charged with compiling a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>candidates,</b> 30 years of age or older who paid a sum of 150 piastres in direct yearly taxes and who were preferably literate. This list was then submitted to the “Council of Elders,” where about one-third of the candidates would be voted out. The list then passed for review to the kaymakam of the sanjak, where another third of the candidates would be eliminated. The remaining one-third of candidates made up the list of possible members.|$|E

We used the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to observe the 1665, 1667, 1612 and 1720 MHz OH maser transitions within 41 regions. These are the first high resolution observations {{for most of the}} sources. For all the transitions 30 sites of maser emission were detected, 4 of the sources have new detections, and approximately 40 % of the sources in the sample exhibit highly compact structure. Finally we consider that the spectrum observed in W 75 N shows the early stage of a long period OH maser flare in the 1665 MHz line, the first of its kind.

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{bottlenecks}} of fast development in the modern electronics industry is heat. Managing the high heat flux generated by billions of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) is the main challenge. A scalable, built-in, and agile temperature sensor which can provide real-time thermal history of an IC chip is essential to thermal failure analysis [1]. However, thermal measurement at microscale and nanoscale is a technical challenge. When both high spatial resolution and high temperature sensitivity are required, only a few approaches, such as scanning thermal microscopy [2], luminescent nanoparticles, and infrared thermography [3 – 5], remain in the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>candidates.</b> If built-in thermal sensors are required for time-resolvable solutions in a solid device, such as in IC chips, micro-electro-mechanical system, a lab-on-a-chip, or a flexible printed circuits, then it seems that only stripe-shaped resistive sensor [6] and thin-film thermocouple (TFTC) are left in the candidate list. The passive nature of a thermocouple makes it superior to a resistive thermal sensor (usually made of metal or semiconductors) because a thermocouple provides a far more rapid response, does not require external excitation voltage or current, and generates no additional heat which may cause unexpected electrical noise and error in temperature measurement.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} being {{designated}} {{as a member of}} the Protestant clergy, as well as that of being assigned to a particular office, varies with the denomination or faith group. Some Protestant denominations, such as Methodism, Presbyterianism, and Lutheranism, are hierarchical in nature; and ordination and assignment to individual pastorates or other ministries are made by the parent denominations. In other traditions, such as the Baptist and other Congregational groups, local churches are free to hire (and often ordain) their own clergy, although the parent denominations typically maintain <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>candidates</b> seeking appointment to local church ministries and encourage local churches to consider these individuals when filling available positions.|$|R

40|$|In late 2013 the European Commission {{issued a}} call for {{proposals}} addressing “access technologies and characterisation for Near Earth Objects (NEOs) ”, to succeed the activities started by the NEOShield project in 2012. This new call for proposals, {{in the framework of}} the Horizon 2020 program, resulted in the granting of funding for the 11 -partner NEOShield- 2 project for 2. 5 years from March 2015 in order to address "Science and Technology for Near-Earth Object Impact Prevention". The project work packages are integrated into a coherent programme of research and technology development. Building on NEOShield experience, the project is investigating in more detail key technologies crucial to space missions to deflect NEOs and for reconnaissance purposes. NEOShield- 2 technical activities include the development of autonomous guidance, navigation, and control systems to allow increased targeting accuracy and relative velocity of a kinetic impactor spacecraft into a small (e. g. 100 - 300 m diameter) asteroid, systems and procedures to facilitate navigation close to a low-gravity, irregularly shaped asteroid and demonstrate techniques for precise and rapid NEO orbit determination, and the development of mechanisms for the collection of material samples. On the scientific front, astronomical observations of selected NEOs are being carried out for the purposes of broadening our knowledge of their mitigation-relevant physical properties, concentrating on the smaller sizes of most concern for mitigation purposes, and increasing the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>candidate</b> targets for deflection test missions. Statistical analyses of recently published NEO survey data, which have already produced very useful results in the course of NEOShield, are being further explored in NEOShield 2. Furthermore, modelling work and computer simulations are being enhanced to model the fate of ejecta produced by a kinetic impactor and to identify possible safe locations for a reconnaissance spacecraft observing the impact {{in the vicinity of the}} targeted asteroid. We will present an overview of the objectives and status of the NEOShield 2 project, including important results achieved to date in the individual work packages. Some work items and results will be reported on in more detail in separate presentations by NEOShield 2 Consortium members.

Each fault tolerant scheme will have several candidates depending on the characteristics and constraints to be satisfied.

For the set of constraints of a critical configuration given as input to the algorithm, it generates a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> fault tolerant <b>candidates</b> whose failure probability {{is less than the}} configuration interaction value.

40|$|One key {{challenge}} in talent search {{is how to}} translate complex criteria of a hiring position into a search query. This typically requires deep knowledge on which skills are typically needed for the position, what are their alternatives, which companies {{are likely to have}} such candidates, etc. However, <b>listing</b> examples <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>candidates</b> for a given position is a relatively easy job. Therefore, in order to help searchers overcome this challenge, we design a next generation of talent search paradigm at LinkedIn: Search by Ideal Candidates. This new system only needs the searcher to input one or several examples <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>candidates</b> for the position. The system will generate a query based on the input candidates and then retrieve and rank results based on the query as well as the input candidates. The query is also shown to the searcher to make the system transparent and to allow the searcher to interact with it. As the searcher modifies the initial query and makes it deviate from the ideal candidates, the search ranking function dynamically adjusts an refreshes the ranking results balancing between the roles of query and ideal candidates. As of writing this paper, the new system is being launched to our customers. Comment: Demonstrated at WWW 2015, The 25 th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2015...|$|R
40|$|One key {{challenge}} in talent search is to translate complex criteria of a hiring position into a search query, {{while it is}} relatively easy for a searcher to <b>list</b> examples <b>of</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>candidates</b> for a given position. To improve search efficiency, we propose {{the next generation of}} talent search at LinkedIn, also referred to as Search By Ideal Candidates. In this system, a searcher provides one or several ideal candidates as the input to hire for a given position. The system then generates a query based on the ideal candidates and uses it to retrieve and rank results. Shifting from the traditional Query-By-Keyword to this new Query-By-Example system poses a number of challenges: How to generate a query that best describes the candidates? When moving to a completely different paradigm, how does one leverage previous product logs to learn ranking models and/or evaluate the new system with no existing usage logs? Finally, given the different nature between the two search paradigms, the ranking features typically used for Query-By-Keyword systems might not be optimal for Query-By-Example. This paper describes our approach to solving these challenges. We present experimental results confirming the effectiveness of the proposed solution, particularly on query building and search ranking tasks.
