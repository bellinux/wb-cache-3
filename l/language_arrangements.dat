5000|$|Legislation and {{documents}} of major public importance or interest are produced in all official languages, but {{that accounts for}} {{a minority of the}} institutions′ work. Other documents—e.g., communications with the national authorities, decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities and correspondence—are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions are allowed by law to choose their own <b>language</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in three languages, English, French, and German (sometimes called [...] "procedural languages"), and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset. Non-institutional EU bodies are not legally obliged to make language arrangement for all the 24 languages (Kik v. Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market, Case C-361/01, 2003 ECJ I-8283).|$|E

In a broader sense, political language refers to language policy or political linguistics—that is, {{the ways in which}} governments attempt to shape the linguistic structure of the society or the claims issued by linguistic groups to change existing <b>language</b> <b>arrangements</b> or legislations. Neither of these working definitions fully captures the relevance of language issues to politics and political science. This entry therefore reviews three types of related but not overlapping issues: (1) the way social sciences address the relationship between language and politics, (2) classical language policies and legislation, and (3) the “normative turn. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} based on the concept of {{interaction}} as a procedure for seizing and building sense. As these concepts are intertwined and interdependent, we approach interaction types that produce different types of sense construction in a corpus made of life praxis in São Paulo. City and inhabitants are the interactive subjects analyzed in the narratives of the living experiences, which are different from the ones conveyed by media. The French Semiotics is both theoretical fundament and method for the analysis of the praxis’ enunciates, syncretic <b>language</b> <b>arrangements</b> that materialize the content, orchestrated by the enunciation mechanisms from which the discursive interaction is the sense’s and social value’s circulation emerging force. These are not reflections, but the sense’s own presence...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to identify the key aspects of Quality Assurance (QA) affecting the quality of translations at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The chapter starts with a brief clarification of the terms connected with QA, which are quite often used interchangeably and imprecisely. The next two sections set the background for the analysis by exploring the current <b>language</b> <b>arrangements</b> at the CJEU and associated challenges and by discussing two standards {{that are relevant to}} the field of legal translation, namely EN- 15038 : 2006 and ISO 17100. The main part of the chapter proposes a two-tiered approach to translation quality at the CJEU. It is argued that it can be conceptualized at two interrelated levels, namely the human resources level and workflow level. While the human resources level comprises, inter alia, in-house lawyer-linguists, external contractors, revisers, auxiliary staff and project managers, the workflow level consists of measures aimed at achieving proper structurization of the translation process as well as intra- and interinstitutional co-operation...|$|E
40|$|The postmodern and {{critical}} movements in language policy, with their redefinition of governmentality {{and attention to}} power structures, call for localised perspectives on <b>language</b> <b>arrangements.</b> In this way, a polity, in its social and cultural context, {{can be understood as}} much as the policies it operates. In the case of Indigenous languages undergoing revitalisation, this allows us to define language revitalisation, and the vitality it should deliver, not through western scholarship but for local purposes with local ideas by examining local knowledge and preferences. To do this, a folk linguistic approach was applied to language policy research. A quantitative and qualitative survey investigated how around 1, 300 Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth in New Zealand define Māori language revitalisation from their own perspective and how they perceive the revitalisation processes and outcomes proposed in scholarship and local discourses. The paper shows that claimed linguistic knowledge not only exists parallel to language attitudes, but informs local policy ideas. The findings indicate that these youth define language revitalisation and vitality in terms contextualised by local ontology, knowledge, ideologies and values, therefore challenging the local applicability of universal theories.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the main}} cause of death among {{men and women in the}} United States. Therefore, the American Heart Association {{recommends}} an increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (5 or more servings per day). Many studies have shown an inverse relationship between the consumption of fruits and vegetables and the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, certain populations are unaware of the benefits that fruits and vegetables provide. Culturally Deaf adults who use American Sign Language (ASL) often have limited English literacy (Gallaudet Research Institute, 1996; Holt, Traxler, & Allen, 1997) and have difficulty communicating with hearing health providers (Barnett, 2002). Consequently, Deaf adults miss a great deal of significant health information, leading to greater risk for CVD disease and other chronic diseases. The research question for this study was “What is the average intake of fruits and vegetables among Deaf adults? ” Three-day food diaries were collected from 57 Deaf adults. The mean number of servings for fruit, vegetables and combined fruit plus vegetables fell below recommended number of servings for optimal health. Results support nutrition education for Deaf adults to minimize their risk for heart disease and other chronic diseases. Classes must be specifically tailored for Deaf adults because they often have lower educational levels than the general public and their preferred communication mode is sign language. Unless the nurse is fluent in sign <b>language,</b> <b>arrangements</b> should be made for a professional sign language interpreter to assist during health teaching...|$|E

40|$|Organizational {{capital is}} a {{specific}} form of capital that firms accumulate.

The distinctive feature of this form of capital {{is the fact that it}} does not contribute directly to an output result. Instead, it can be thought as creating the correct environment for the human factor to maximize its capability of generating value, that is, organizational capital works as an external effect on the accumulation of the human capital input. Nevertheless, organizational capital is a form of capital and therefore it has an investment process associated with it. The paper considers the process of investment in this form of capital and recognizes that it introduces important changes over the firm's profit maximization problem. The problem gains new features relating to its dynamic nature and a condition that guarantees saddle-path stability can be derived. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
