40|$|Abstract — Although {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} on cooperative diversity, the current literature is mainly limited to the results obtained for Rayleigh, Rician, or Nakagami fading channels. In this paper, we investigate the performance of cooperative diversity schemes over <b>log-normal</b> <b>fading</b> channels which provide an accurate channel model for indoor wireless environments. We focus on single-relay cooperative networks with amplify-and-forward relaying and consider three TDMA-based cooperation protocols which correspond to distributed implementations of MIMO (multi-input multi-output), SIMO (single-input multi-output), and MISO (multi-input single-output) schemes. For each protocol under consideration, we derive upper bounds on pairwise error probability over log-normal channels and quantify the diversity advantages. Based on the minimization of a union bound on the bit error rate performance, we further formulate optimal power allocation schemes which demonstrate significant performance gains over their counterparts with equal power allocation.

The channel under weak atmospheric turbulence is modeled as a <b>log-normal</b> intensity <b>fading</b> channel where on-off keying {{makes it look}} asymmetric. While no effort is made to spectrally match the code to the asymmetry of the channel, the decoding strategy is optimally adjusted to match to the channel response. In addition to fixed rate turbo coding, a family of variable rate turbo codes are constructed and discussed. Shannon capacity is also briefly visited to denote the theoretic limit. It is shown that under low turbulence a single long turbo code is sufficient to get within 1 dB from the capacity, but when the turbulence gets strong, adaptive coding is necessary to close the gap.
