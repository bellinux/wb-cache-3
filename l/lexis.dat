5|$|Heliade Rădulescu is {{considered}} one of the foremost champions of Romanian culture from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with Gheorghe Lazăr and his support of Lazăr's drive for discontinuing education in Greek. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of Italian neologisms into the Romanian <b>lexis.</b> A Romantic nationalist landowner siding with moderate liberals, Heliade was among the leaders of the 1848 Wallachian revolution, after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form of conservatism, which emphasized the role of the aristocratic boyars in Romanian history, he was rewarded for supporting the Ottoman Empire and clashed with the radical wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.|$|E

When Billy's great-granddaughter, <b>Lexi</b> Pearce, is taken into care, <b>Lexi's</b> mother Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) tells Phil that Ben is <b>Lexi's</b> father and Phil is her grandfather. Lola agrees for Phil to have [...] {{residence}} of <b>Lexi</b> and he suggests to Sharon that they {{pretend to be}} in a relationship to increase the chances of success, even though she is in a relationship with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). They tell social workers that they are engaged but Shirley threatens to tell the truth, so Phil tells them the engagement is over. Phil is appointed <b>Lexi's</b> foster carer and ordered to arrange for Lola to visit <b>Lexi</b> three times a week but he immediately takes over, angering Lola by calling <b>Lexi</b> his baby, refusing to take presents that Lola buys for her and having her christened with the name Mitchell instead of Pearce. Phil and Jack become rivals when Phil tells Jack that he will be with Sharon {{by the end of the}} year, and Phil even proposes to Sharon, though she accepts Jack's proposal of marriage instead. When Phil offers Sharon an increase of her salary, and a 19% stake in club, Jack is not pleased and punches Phil, who falls into the vehicle pit in the garage. Jack thinks he has killed Phil, but Phil later arrives at the pub and announces Jack's guilt. Jack is arrested but Phil does not press charges after Sharon convinces him for her and <b>Lexi's</b> sake.

25|$|Caragiale's tale {{has been}} the target of {{critical}} interest since its publication, being discussed for its relation to Machiavelli's original story, its particular Neoromantic aesthetics and picturesque elements, its ambivalent take on feminism, as well as the various allusions to concrete social realities. Among the latter are its original insight into the urban culture of Romania in the pre-Westernization period, the recovery of Greek or Turkish influences on the Romanian <b>lexis,</b> and the possible intention on Caragiale's part to depict Ianulea as his alter ego. The story has had its own sizable impact on local literature and the culture of Romania, notably serving to inspire writers such as Radu Cosașu and Radu Macrinici, and being turned into a 1939 operetta by composer Sabin Drăgoi.|$|E
25|$|Meaning and truth. The most {{important}} and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern propositional logic. The Stoics distinguished between utterance (phone), which may be noise, speech (<b>lexis),</b> which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (logos), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory {{is the idea that}} what is expressed by a sentence, called a lekton, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a proposition. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word Dion, and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.|$|E
25|$|The book {{offers an}} {{in-depth}} account of Ion Creangă's early life {{in what was}} then the state of Moldavia, with much insight into the social landscape of his childhood universe, describing relationships between its hero, mainly referred to with his hypocorism and patronymic Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei or Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru"), and the various people in his life. It traces Nică's coming of age passage, from an idyllic age spent the remote village of Humulești (now part of Târgu Neamț town) to rebellious adolescence and training for a Romanian Orthodox priesthood in the urban centers of Fălticeni and Iași. The narrative flow is often interrupted by lengthy and characteristic soliloquies, imparting Creangă's worldview and regrets.

Alexa drops the assault charge but Lola is devastated to learn that she will not get <b>Lexi</b> back. Lola worries that Phil's plan will fail after he tells Social Services that he and Sharon are no longer engaged, but Phil does become <b>Lexi's</b> kinship foster carer.

500|$|Grigore Nandris {{writes that}} the Romanian {{vocabulary}} suggests that the Romanians' ancestors were [...] "reduced to a pastoral life {{in the mountains and}} to agricultural pursuits in the foothills of their pasture lands" [...] following the collapse of the Roman rule.

Many words related to a more settled form of animal husbandry were borrowed from Slavic, including coteţ ("poultry house"), grajd ("stable"), and stână ("fenced pasture"). Romanian has preserved Latin terms for agriculture and the Latin names of certain crops, but a significant part of its agricultural <b>lexis</b> originates from a Slavic-speaking population. The first group includes a ara ("to plough"), a semăna ("to sow"), a culege ("to harvest"), a secera ("to reap"), grâu ("wheat"), in ("flax"), and furcă ("pitchfork"), while a croi ("to cut out"), a plivi ("to weed"), brazdă ("furrow"), cobilă ("plow line"), coasă ("scythe"), lopată ("shovel") and many others are Slavic loanwords.|$|E
