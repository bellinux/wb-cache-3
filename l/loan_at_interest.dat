These days, even {{countries}} {{sometimes have}} difficulties repaying just the interests {{generated by the}} debt. But, strangely, the medieval doctrine banned the charging of a profit on the lending of money. This theory advocated only the benefit generated from the capital invested should be shared between the lender and the borrower ex post according to an agreement drawn up ex ante. This article analyses the contribution of this theory and its underlying concepts. Part I presents the theories of rate regulation in the Ancient world. Part II analyses their developments in the Middle Ages {{under the influence of}} the canonists until the end of prohibition of usury in the 18 th century. The medieval approach is making a come back in France under a new form: the Islamic finance which outlaws interest and advocates the sharing of benefits.

No one in the whole kingdom was allowed to detain a Jew belonging to another, and each lord might recover a Jew who belonged to him, just as he might his own serf (tanquam proprium servum), wherever he might find him and however long a period had elapsed since the Jew had settled elsewhere.
