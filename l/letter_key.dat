50|$|The {{keyboard}} {{itself was}} a large sliding switch, also called permutor board. A signal, coming from a <b>letter</b> <b>key,</b> went through the rotors, back to the permutor board to continue to the printer. The KL-7 was non-reciprocal. Therefore, depending on the Encipher or Decipher position of the permutor board, {{the direction of the}} signal through the rotors was changed.|$|E
5000|$|Consider {{an attack}} on the {{ciphertext}} string [...] "WNAIW" [...] encrypted using a Vigenère cipher with a five <b>letter</b> <b>key.</b> Conceivably, this string could be deciphered into any other string [...] - [...] RIVER and WATER are both possibilities for certain keys. This is a general rule of cryptanalysis: with no additional information it is impossible to decode this message.|$|E

40|$|A new one-key {{text entry}} method is presented. SAK, for "scanning {{ambiguous}} keyboard", combines one-key physical input (including error correction) with three virtual <b>letter</b> <b>keys</b> and a SPACE <b>key.</b> The virtual <b>letter</b> <b>keys</b> are highlighted in sequence ("scanned") and selected when the key bearing the desired letter receives focus. There is only one selection per letter. Selecting SPACE transfers scanning to a word-selection region, which presents a list of candidate words. A novel feature of SAK is multiple-letter-selection in a single scanning interval. In an evaluation with 12 participants, average entry speeds reached 5. 11 wpm (all trials, 99 % accuracy) or 7. 03 wpm (errorfree trials). A modification using "timer restart on selection" allowed for more time and more selections per scanning interval. One participant performed extended trials (5 blocks x 5 phrases/block) with the modification and reached an average entry speed of 9. 28 wpm...|$|R
5000|$|In Japanese, {{the more}} formal name is 3=rōmaji kana henkan (2=ローマ字仮名変換), {{literally}} [...] "Roman character kana conversion". One conversion method has been standardized as JIS X 4063:2000 (Keystroke to KANA Transfer Method Using Latin <b>Letter</b> <b>Key</b> for Japanese Input Method); however, the standard explicitly {{states that it}} is intended {{as a means of}} input, not as a method of romanization.|$|E
50|$|Unicode encoded {{over one}} hundred precomposed {{characters}} with two diacritics, for use in Latin script for Vietnamese {{and a number of}} other languages. For convenience, they are generated on most keyboards supporting them, by pressing the two corresponding deadkeys in any order, followed by the <b>letter</b> <b>key.</b> Therefore, these dead keys are chained, which means that the second keystroke does not trigger any insertion, the system being still awaiting another key press.|$|E
50|$|Special power-ups can be {{accessed}} by pressing the tab key to toggle between the different icons at the bottom left of the screen and then pushing enter, or simply by pushing the <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> corresponding to the desired icon. The icon for the chosen item will turn purple while activated. Each power-up is represented by a certain symbol {{and can be used}} up to three times throughout the game, depending on the difficulty setting.|$|E
50|$|A {{dead key}} {{is a special}} kind of a {{modifier}} key on a mechanical typewriter, or computer keyboard, that is typically used to attach a specific diacritic to a base <b>letter.</b> The dead <b>key</b> does not generate a (complete) character by itself, but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after. Thus, a dedicated key is not needed for each possible combination of a diacritic and a letter, but rather only one dead key for each diacritic is needed, in addition to the normal base <b>letter</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|Control {{characters}} are often rendered into a printable form known as caret notation by printing a caret (^) {{and then the}} ASCII character that has a value of the control character plus 64. Control characters generated using <b>letter</b> <b>keys</b> are thus displayed with the upper-case form of the letter. For example, ^G represents code 7, which is generated by pressing the G key when the control key is held down.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1964, Mad was tricked into {{purchasing}} the [...] "rights" [...] to an optical illusion {{already in the}} public domain, featuring a sort of three-pronged tuning fork whose appearance defies physical possibility. The magazine dubbed it the [...] "Mad poiuyt" [...] after the six rightmost <b>letter</b> <b>keys</b> on a QWERTY keyboard in reverse order, not realizing that the existing image was already known to engineers and usually called a blivet.|$|R
50|$|ISO/IEC 9995-3:2010 {{defines a}} common {{secondary}} layout (“common secondary group”) for the alphanumeric keyboard. These are engraved {{on the right}} part of the keytops; the standard defines their position independent of the characters of the primary layout. Thus, e. g. the Yen symbol “¥” occupies the shifted position on the 6th <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> of the second row, whether this is the Y key on a QWERTY keyboard (like the US layout) or the Z key on a QWERTZ keyboard (like the German layout).|$|E
5000|$|The {{serial number}} on a Kodak {{manufactured}} lens is always {{preceded by a}} code consisting of two capital letters that indicates {{the year of manufacture}} using a 10 <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> word, CAMEROSITY, in which each letter in the word represents a corresponding numeral in the sequence 1234567890. Of these, the C is substituted by 1, the A by 2 etc. through to the Y by 0. [...] "ET" [...] thus gives the number 49 for the year 1949. The Kodak 35 serial number is engraved on the front ring on the lens.|$|E
5000|$|To {{achieve these}} steps, the team {{employed}} a principle {{similar to the}} [...] "pictophonetic compounds" [...] principle of Chinese. In 1977 the team released {{the first generation of}} the method that would later be named [...] "Canjie". The team selected a set of less than 2,000 components to compose about 12,000 common characters. Each component is represented by a permutation of 1 to 3 of 26 [...] "Chinese alphabets" [...] (also called [...] "radicals"). Each [...] "alphabet" [...] maps to a particular <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> on a standard QWERTY keyboard.|$|E

5000|$|Of course, {{even in this}} case, only {{a certain}} number of five <b>letter</b> <b>keys</b> will result in English words. Trying all {{possible}} keys we will not only get RIVER and WATER, but SXOOS and KHDOP as well. The number of [...] "working" [...] keys will likely be very much smaller than the set of all possible keys. The problem is knowing which of these [...] "working" [...] keys is the right one; the rest are spurious.|$|R
2500|$|Each row {{starts with}} a <b>key</b> <b>letter.</b> [...] The {{remainder}} of the row holds the letters A to Z (in shifted order). [...] Although there are 26 key rows shown, you will only use as many keys (different alphabets) as there are unique <b>letters</b> in the <b>key</b> string, here just 5 keys, {L, E, M, O, N}. [...] For successive letters of the message, {{we are going to}} take successive <b>letters</b> of the <b>key</b> string, and encipher each message letter using its corresponding key row. [...] Choose the next <b>letter</b> of the <b>key,</b> go along that row to find the column heading that matches the message character; the letter at the intersection of [...] is the enciphered letter.|$|R
5000|$|The accent keys , , [...] {{are dead}} keys: {{press and release}} an accent key, then press a <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> to produce accented {{characters}} (ô, á, ù, etc.; the current DIN 2137-1:2012-06 extends this for e.g. ń, ś etc.). If the entered combination is not encoded in Unicode by a single code point (precomposed character), most current implementations cause the display of a free-standing (spacing) version of the accent followed by the unaccented base letter. This behavior (which is explicitly not compliant with the current DIN 2137-1:2012-06) leads some users suffering from insufficient typing skills to mistype a spacing accent instead of an apostrophe (e.g., it's or it's instead of correctly it's).|$|E
50|$|Some non-English {{language}} keyboards {{have special}} keys to produce accented modifications {{of the standard}} Latin-letter keys. In fact, the standard British keyboard layout includes an accent key on the top-left corner to produce àèìòù, although this is a two step procedure, press the accent key and release, then the <b>letter</b> <b>key.</b> These kinds of keys are called dead keys. The AltGr modifier produces the áéíóú sequence, or {{in conjunction with the}} Shift key, ÁÉÍÓÚ. Keyboards of some languages simply include the accented characters on their own keys. Some keyboards also have a Compose key for typing accented and other special characters. By pressing , and then two other keys, something similar to a combination of the glyphs of the two previous keys will appear on the screen.|$|E
5000|$|... Prime Minister John Key congratulated Modi by <b>letter.</b> <b>Key</b> {{expressed}} {{hope that}} the two countries {{would be able to}} negotiate a free trade agreement, which they began discussing in 2010. However, talks later stalled and the last round of discussions was held in July 2013. The Prime Minister stated, [...] "We are sort of hopeful we can reignite the free trade agreement with Modi as the new Prime Minister. He has obviously been very pro-business and he has had an overwhelming mandate delivered to him so you can see the Indian people want and expect to see high levels of economic growth. One of those things is trade, so we are certainly going to be taking it up with the new Indian Government at the appropriate time." ...|$|E
50|$|Typically, in {{a compact}} layout the main {{area of the}} {{keyboard}} (containing the <b>letter</b> <b>keys)</b> is kept {{in much the same}} layout as with a full-sized keyboard, and the numeric keypad is moved to share a group of central keys. This allows typists to enter text without having to learn a new layout. The symbol that is accessed through pressing Fn is often printed on the key in a smaller font, a box, or different color (usually blue but sometimes orange).|$|R
2500|$|The 1874 Sholes & Glidden {{typewriters}} {{established the}} [...] "QWERTY" [...] layout for the <b>letter</b> <b>keys.</b> During {{the period in}} which Sholes and his colleagues were experimenting with this invention, other keyboard arrangements were apparently tried, but these are poorly documented. The QWERTY layout of keys has become the de facto standard for English-language typewriter and computer keyboards. Other languages written in the Latin alphabet sometimes use variants of the QWERTY layouts, such as the French AZERTY, the Italian QZERTY and the German QWERTZ layouts.|$|R
25|$|The {{linotype}} keyboard has {{the same}} alphabet arrangement given twice, once for lower-case <b>letters,</b> the <b>keys</b> in black, {{on the left side}} of the keyboard, and once for upper-case <b>letters,</b> the <b>keys</b> in white, located on the right side of the keyboard. The blue keys in the middle are punctuation, digits, small capital letters and fixed-width spaces. In proper keyboard operation, an experienced operator's left hand operates only the spaceband key and the left column of keys. The operator's right hand strokes the remaining keys on the entire keyboard.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Spain briefly {{introduced}} an import tax on computers without ñ <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> and containing 64KB {{or less of}} RAM. To circumvent this, Amstrad's Spanish distributor Indescomp (later to become Amstrad Spain) created and distributed the CPC472, {{a modified version of}} the CPC464. Its main difference is a small additional daughter board containing a CPC664 ROM chip, and an 8 KB memory chip which is not electrically connected to the machine, and consequently rendered unusable. Its sole purpose was supposedly to increase the machine's total memory specs to 72 KB in order to circumvent the import tax. Only a month after the CPC472 had been released, Amstrad added the ñ key for the 464 so this tariff was not applied to 64k computers anymore and production of the CPC472 was discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike pinyin, Cangjie {{is based}} on the graphological aspect of the characters: each basic, {{graphical}} unit is represented by a basic character component, 24 in all, each mapped to a particular <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> on a standard QWERTY keyboard. An additional, [...] "difficult character" [...] function is mapped to the X key. Within the keystroke-to-character representations, there are four subsections of characters: the Philosophical Set (corresponding to the letters 'A' to 'G' and representing the sun, the moon and the five elements), the Strokes Set (corresponding to the letters 'H' to 'N' and representing the brief and subtle strokes), the Body-Related Set (corresponding to the letters 'O' to 'R' and representing various parts of human anatomy), and the Shapes Set (corresponding to the letters 'S' to 'Y' and representing complex and encompassing character forms).|$|E
5000|$|Emacs - has {{the concept}} of [...] "prefix keys", which trigger a modal state by {{pressing}} the control key plus a <b>letter</b> <b>key.</b> Emacs then waits for additional keypresses that complete a keybinding. This differs from vi in that the mode always ends {{as soon as the}} command is called (when the sequence of key presses that activates it is completed). Emacs also has many [...] "major and minor" [...] modes that change the available commands, and may be automatically invoked based on file type to more easily edit files of that type. Emacs modes are not restricted to editing text files; modes exist for file browsing, web browsing, IRC and email and their interaction patterns are equivalent to application software within the Emacs environment. Modes are written in Emacs Lisp, and all modes may not be included with all versions.|$|E

Secondly, travel down column P to the corresponding <b>key</b> <b>Letter</b> K. Finally, move directly left from the <b>Key</b> <b>letter</b> to the left edge of the tableau, the CipherText encryption of Plaintext P with Key K will be there.|$|R
50|$|When {{the control}} key is held down, <b>letter</b> <b>keys</b> {{produce the same}} control {{characters}} regardless {{of the state of}} the shift or caps lock keys. In other words, it does not matter whether the key would have produced an upper-case or a lower-case letter. The interpretation of the control key with the space, graphics character, and digit keys (ASCII codes 32 to 63) vary between systems. Some will produce the same character code as if the control key were not held down. Other systems translate these keys into control characters when the control key is held down. The interpretation of the control key with non-ASCII ("foreign") keys also varies between systems.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, {{the game}} was decided by a [...] "Super Round," [...] a race that {{encompassed}} all abilities from the previous rounds. At {{the start of the}} round, players were shown five coloured circles, each with a letter or number, and the players had to memorize the sequence before making a parachute jump down 50 feet to the floor. They then entered the Kryptic Rings, a three-dimensional maze of interlocking rings with numbered and lettered junctions where following and correctly interpreting the sequence (by following the circles clockwise, starting with the circle of their colour) would lead each player to their correct exit. Each exit was marked with a letter, which they would memorize {{on their way to the}} next part of the race, the Laser Matrix, preceded by a computer where each player had to log in by hitting the <b>letter</b> <b>key</b> matching their exit. Each player then had to type in four words with a common thread, however each key corresponded to a different letter according to a code (such as each key giving the preceding letter). After cracking the code and typing in the four words, each player had to cross a corridor of shifting laser beams, where breaking each beam resulted in a seven-second penalty. Once out, the players entered the Response Revolve, a rotating cylinder where each player had to collect six batons of their colour from their holds, however, each baton could only be removed when a light by the baton flashed, and all lights flashed according to a sequence. Once all six batons were out and placed in the player's pedestal, each player had to run to the Krypton Mountain, where they first had to build a four-piece ladder, which they ascended before making a vertical climb up the Krypton Mountain, completing the race by grabbing a letter K of their colour at the top of the Krypton Mountain.|$|E
