25|$|There {{have also}} been some {{concerns}} over possible problems related to hydrogen gas leakage. Molecular hydrogen leaks slowly from most containment vessels. It has been hypothesized that if significant amounts of hydrogen gas (H2) escape, hydrogen gas may, because of ultraviolet radiation, form free radicals (H) in the stratosphere. These free radicals would {{then be able to}} act as catalysts for ozone depletion. A large enough increase in stratospheric hydrogen from leaked H2 could exacerbate the depletion process. However, the effect of these leakage problems may not be significant. The amount of hydrogen that leaks today is much lower (by a factor of 10–100) than the estimated 10–20% figure conjectured by some researchers; for example, in Germany, the leakage rate is only 0.1% (less than the natural gas <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> of 0.7%). At most, such leakage would likely be no more than 1–2% even with widespread hydrogen use, using present technology.|$|E

The <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of the silicone elastomer S 0383 - 70 O-ring test articles were used to quantify the degradation of the seals after exposure to vacuum-ultraviolet and/or middle-to-near-ultraviolet wavelength radiation. Three groups of seals were exposed in terrestrial facilities to 115 - 165 nm wavelength radiation, 230 - 500 nm wavelength radiation, or both spectrums, for an orbital spaceflight equivalent of 125 hours. The <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of the silicone elastomer S 0383 - 70 seals were quantified and compared to samples that received no radiation. Each lot contained six samples and statistical t-tests were used to determine the separate and combined influences of exposure to the two wavelength ranges. A comparison of the mean <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of samples exposed to 115 - 165 nm wavelength radiation to the control specimens showed no difference, suggesting that spectrum was not damaging. The 230 - 500 nm wavelength appeared to be damaging, as the mean <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of the specimens exposed to that range of wavelengths, and those exposed to the combined 115 - 165 nm and 230 - 500 nm spectrums, were significantly different from the <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of the control specimens.

Collins performed her first deep dive on 19 January 1996 without any problems. However, during a later deep dive trial, the propeller shaft seal began to leak excessively. Although designed to leak at [...] an hour, the seal had previously shown itself to be faulty, with an hourly <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> {{in the hundreds of}} litres. On this occasion, the water pressure meant the flow rate was significantly greater, {{to the point where the}} aft bilge pump was barely keeping up. When the senior engineer entered the compartment, he found personnel trying to stem the flow, including one sailor who was underneath the shaft, attempting to tighten the seal manually. The engineer instructed the commander to take the submarine to the surface as quickly as possible, but keep the boat level—had the engineer instead informed the commander that the submarine was flooding, Collins would have blown all ballast and driven for the surface at a steep angle, likely drowning the sailor under the shaft. Collins reached the surface without further incident. Modified seals were fitted to all submarines to bring the leak back to the accepted rate. It was later calculated that the submarine was taking on water at over [...] a minute.|$|E
