The only secondary guns installed were the 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940, and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83. The vessel's design {{provided the basis for}} a planned heavy cruiser, designated Projekt 82, although this ship was canceled before work began. Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany, while the Germans preferred sending instructors to the Soviet Union. <b>Language</b> <b>barriers</b> and inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort.|$|E

The theoretical part describes the fundamental importance of the host language as a means of communication in the context of immigrant integration to the new society, outlines the specifics of the intercultural communication between people of different nationalities, summarizes the factors which influence the acquisition of the host language, and acquaint with the situation in Czech schools in conjunction with the <b>language</b> <b>barrier.</b> The empirical part is based on semi-structured interviews with immigrant students of three different nationalities (Ukrainian, Vietnamese and Romanian).

Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to {{disperse}} his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.|$|E

In Indonesia, there are many kinds of scholarship program in secondary and higher education. One of them is Erasmus Mundus scholarship. Erasmus Mundus is a kind of scholarship program which aims to enchance quality in higher education through scholarship and academic cooperation between Europe. It offers several programs such as Joint Programmes, Partnership, and Promotion of European higher education. University of Muhammadiyah Malang is one of the universities in Indonesia which held Erasmus Mundus. Through Erasmus Mundus scholarship program, UMM students could improve the quality of their education.

This research focuses on UMM students <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> problems in joiningErasmus Mundus and the ways to solve their problems. There are two statements of problems in this research. Those are; (1) what are the problems on <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> faced by UMM students in joining Erasmus Mundus?, (2) how the ways to solve the <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> faced by the UMM students in joining Erasmus Mundus?. This research implemented qualitative as the research to find out the concering experiences of UMM students who faced <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> in joining Erasmus Mundus in form of the words rather than numbers. The subjects were four students who once joined Erasmus Mundus in Portugal, Italy, Polandia, and Latvia. Furthermore, this research were used documents and interview.

40|$|Abstract: Background: The <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> is a {{significant}} obstacle for nurses who are not native English speakers to obtain information from international journals. Freely accessible online machine translation (MT) offers a possible solution to this problem. Aim: To explore how Japanese nursing professionals use online MT and perceive its usability in reading English articles and to discuss what should be considered for better utilisation of online MT lessening the <b>language</b> <b>barrier.</b> Method: In total, 250 randomly selected assistants and research associates at nursing colleges across Japan answered a questionnaire examining the current use of online MT and perceived usability among Japanese nurses, along {{with the number of}} articles read in English and the perceived <b>language</b> <b>barrier.</b> The items were rated on Likert scales, and t-test, ANOVA, chi-square test, and Spearman’s correlation were used for analyses. Results: Of the participants, 73. 8 % had used online MT. More than half of them felt it was usable. The <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> was strongly felt, and academic degrees and English proficiency level were associated factors. The perceived <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> was related to the frequency of online MT use. No associated factor was found for the perceived usability of online MT. Conclusion: Language proficiency is an important factor for optimum utilisation of MT. A need for education in the English language, reading scientific papers, and online MT training was indicated. Cooperation with developers and providers of MT for the improvement of their systems is required...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the paper is to analyze {{the impact of the}} <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> faced by Hungarian {{minority}} female professors and students in the higher education sys­tem of Serbia. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose measures which might allow Hungarian minority students to overcome the <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> more easily and to raise awareness for the need of more Hungarian women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The analysis is based on twenty four semi-structured interviews conducted with minority Hungarian female professors and students, who are working or studying at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia. Interviews were conducted with a pre-composed questionnaire between the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015. Interviewees were chosen with a snowball sampling method. Results of analysis show that the majority of Hungarian women face a <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> at the start of their studies, mostly because of their limited knowledge of the majority’s <b>language.</b> These <b>barriers</b> were more pronounced in Hungarian female students than with professor. This phenomenon can be attributed to the time in which they grew up, or to a different social environment of the twentieth century, when bilingualism was completely natural, from which, less segregation of the nations resulted and a better knowledge of the Serbian language. The professors particularly point out that being bilingual is a great advantage and that their knowledge of several languages was a key advantage in their academic careers. With the analysis of the interviews it was determined that the <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> was mostly pronounced for students of social sciences and humanities (SSH), where language is the primary tool of communication. The <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> was less important for the students studying in STEM sciences, where students and professors interact through formulas and written exams...|$|R

25|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} {{industry}} in the United States, with California accounting for over 12% of the U.S. agriculture cash receipts. Over half of agricultural workers in California, contributing to the state's agriculture economy and providing the nation with over half of all fruits and vegetables, are undocumented. Despite undocumented laborers contributing to the agriculture industry, farm work and labor is among {{one of the lowest}} paid occupations in the U.S. Many undocumented communities suffer from food insecurity due to low wages, forcing families to purchase economically viable unhealthy food. Though existing food pantry and food stamp programs aid in reducing the amount of food insecure individuals, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for social service programs and studies have found that limited English acts as a barrier to food stamp program participation. Due to a lack of education, encounters with government agents, <b>language</b> <b>barriers,</b> undocumented individuals pose higher rates of food insecurity and hunger when compared to legal citizens. The Trump administration is attempting to draft new stricter immigration policies; undocumented individuals who fear being deported under the new policies, limit their interactions with government agencies, social service programs (e.g., food stamps), increasing their susceptibility to food insecurity.|$|E
