It has facilities for LNG receipt, storage, and re-gasification. Other industrial companies include PPG Industries, Phillips 66, Sasol, and W. R. Grace. Local industry also includes a number of manufacturing companies. Chennault International Airport hosts AAR Corp, which services airplanes, and a Northrop Grumman facility. The Shaw Group has a manufacturing facility which manufactures and exports parts for nuclear power plants.|$|E
25|$|Saint John is a {{historic}} city and popular port of call. The Port City is the oldest {{in the country and}} until recently was the largest in the province. The city is one of the busiest shipping ports in Canada in terms of gross tonnage. Saint John has become a major energy hub for the East Coast. It is the home of Canada's biggest oil refinery and an <b>LNG</b> <b>terminal</b> has also been constructed in the city. In addition, the public owns large oil-fired and nuclear power plants, which are located in or near the city. Due to recent prosperity, the retail, commercial, and residential sectors are currently experiencing a resurgence. The Moosehead Brewery is located in {{the west side of the}} city. Saint John is a maritime city both in terms of its culture and traditional industries like fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John is a city of predominantly Celtic heritage making its cultural experience akin to cities in Nova Scotia. Saint John has a growing tech sector surrounding the downtown (locally called uptown) and University of New Brunswick.|$|E

500|$|Milford Haven has {{experienced}} a history of boom and slump in shipbuilding, fishing, as a railhead and an ocean terminal. At {{the height of the}} fishing boom, it was said that [...] "every day was a pay day". [...] In 1921, 674 people were identified as working in the fishing industry, the leading occupation in the town, followed by transport and communication [...] with [...] 600 employees. The development of the oil industry also helped to boost the town's fortunes. [...] However, the slumps have been just as severe, the area being scheduled as 'distressed' in the inter-war period. During the 1980s and 1990s, the unemployment rate at times topped 30%, and the major industry of oil refining created no more than 2,000 direct or indirect jobs. Into the new millennium, its fortunes have risen, as can be witnessed in the activity surrounding the <b>LNG</b> <b>terminal,</b> and the new building works which accompanied it and its connection to the controversial South Wales Gas Pipeline. In February 2003, Pembrokeshire Council granted outline planning permission to Petroplus for an LNG storage depot at Waterston, and in March 2004, an additional site was approved at South Hook for ExxonMobil.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of a five-year PPP government, an election was scheduled for 11 May 2013. Abbasi ran for a seat in the National Assembly as a candidate of the PML (N) and successfully retained his seat from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi) for the sixth time with 134,439 votes. Upon the victory of PML (N) in the 2013 national election, he was inducted into the federal cabinet and was appointed as the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources. During his tenure as Minister for Petroleum, he introduced a liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>terminal</b> and the importation of gas in Pakistan to control the shortage of gas in the country. He was credited for taking measures which helped Pakistan overcome gas shortage issues. In 2015, he was accused of issuing illegal contracts worth [...] for the import and distribution of LNG without a proper bidding process, after which the National Accountability Bureau registered a case and began an investigation. However, the case was closed in 2016 after it was found that all rules were followed during procurement and the bidding process to award the contract was transparent. The Express Tribune described the LNG project as successful and one of the cheapest regasifications in the world. He also denied the corruption allegations. Abbasi ceased to hold the ministerial office of Petroleum and Natural Resources on 28 July 2017 when the Sharif cabinet was disbanded following his resignation after the Panama Papers case decision.|$|E
2500|$|Logan Township was the {{proposed}} {{location for the}} Crown Landing <b>LNG</b> <b>Terminal,</b> a liquefied natural gas (LNG) off-loading and processing facility to be sited along the Delaware River. The facility would have included an off-loading pier that would technically enter {{the waters of the}} state of Delaware. Delaware opposed the project and filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the project from going forward on the basis that they control the waters in which part of the pier would be situated; a lawsuit the State of Delaware lost. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the Crown Landing <b>LNG</b> <b>Terminal</b> on June 15, 2006. In 2009, long after the project should have been completed, Hess Energy acquired the project after BP failed to get plans approved and construction started. On January 6, 2012, Hess Energy surrendered its authorization to construct and operate the terminal. In a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Hess said it determined that the terminal would not be profitable, saying that [...] "significant increases in natural gas production from North American shale resources" [...] would affect prices and demand for natural gas.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, there have been {{concerns}} about the security of LNG shipments within Boston Harbor, and increased fear of terrorism. Because of the location of the <b>LNG</b> <b>terminal</b> in the Mystic River, tankers traveling to and from the facility are forced to pass directly offshore of downtown Boston. During their voyage through the harbor, they are protected by a security zone that extends [...] in front of the vessel, [...] behind it, and more than half a mile on either side. This zone is enforced by escort vessels provided by the Coast Guard and State Police. The Tobin Bridge is closed as the escort passes under it, and boating is forbidden within the security zone. , there have been proposals to construct an offshore LNG facility on either Outer Brewster Island in the Harbor, or further a field in the wider Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to natural}} gas {{shortage}} {{concerns in the}} northeastern U.S. and surplus nature gas {{in the rest of}} the country, many new LNG import and export terminals are being contemplated in the United States. Concerns about the safety of such facilities create controversy in some regions where they are proposed. One such location is in the Long Island Sound between Connecticut and Long Island. Broadwater Energy, an effort of TransCanada Corp. and Shell, wishes to build an LNG import terminal in the sound on the New York side. Local politicians including the Suffolk County Executive raised questions about the terminal. In 2005, New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton also announced their opposition to the project. [...] Several import terminal proposals along the coast of Maine were also met with high levels of resistance and questions. On Sep. 13, 2013 the U.S. Department of Energy approved Dominion Cove Point's application to export up to 770 million cubic feet per day of LNG to countries that do not have a free trade agreement with the U.S. In May 2014, the FERC concluded its environmental assessment of the Cove Point LNG project, which found that the proposed natural gas export project could be built and operated safely. Another <b>LNG</b> <b>terminal</b> is currently proposed for Elba Island, Ga. Plans for three LNG export terminals in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have also received conditional Federal approval. In Canada, an LNG export terminal is under construction near Guysborough, Nova Scotia.|$|E
