5|$|The <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> of {{the passage}} is similar to one from the Republican era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. But instead of {{teaching}} them his own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle.|$|E
5|$|Once Romania {{recovered}} possession {{over its}} southern areas, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was reportedly prosecuted for treason and was again sent to Văcărești. Others however {{note that this}} <b>last</b> <b>sentence,</b> passed in 1919, was not in fact related to his wartime dealings, but merely to his fraudulent activities, and that only by coincidence did Bogdan-Pitești share a prison with the convicted collaborationist journalists (Arghezi, Karnabatt, Ioan Slavici).|$|E

25|$|The <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> {{makes clear}} what the title suggests—that the institutionalization of {{education}} tends towards the institutionalization of society and that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be {{a starting point for}} a de-institutionalized society.|$|E
25|$|The Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. adopted more {{sweeping}} {{revisions of}} its Confession in 1903. Chapter 16.7, on {{the works of}} unregenerate men, was rewritten. The <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> of chapter 22.3, which forbade the refusing of a proper oath when imposed by lawful authority, was removed. Chapter 25.6, {{on the head of}} the church, was rewritten, and the identification of the Roman Catholic pope as the Antichrist was removed.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>last</b> <b>sentence,</b> the {{independent}} form of a̰kpuː- ‘crown’ is formed by combining this prefix with a base -n which is sometimes (as here) analyzed as a nominalizing suffix. Because words for body parts are inflected for possession, a̰kpuːn ‘crown’ has a third-person singular possessive prefix, linking it to mesa ‘table’, the object on whose crown {{the book is}} located (see the section below on Possessive constructions).|$|E

25|$|The Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864–66 {{concluded}} (with dissenting Commissioners) {{that there}} was not a case for abolition but recommended an end to public executions. This proposal was included in the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868. From that date executions in Great Britain were carried out only in prisons. The punishment of beheading and quartering those executed for treason was abolished in 1870. The last application of that punishment had been in 1820 and the <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> to the punishment had been in 1839.|$|E
25|$|The <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> of {{the passage}} is of great {{interest}} for navigation at sea, since the magnetic compass used for seafaring navigation was not used until the time of Shen Kuo (10311095). Although the Song Shu text describes earlier precedents of the south-pointing chariot before the time of Ma Jun, this is not entirely credible, as there are no pre-Han or Han Dynasty era texts that describe the device. In fact, the first known source to describe stories of its legendary use during the Zhou period was the Gu Jin Zhu book of Cui Bao (c. 300 CE), written soon after the Three Kingdoms era. Cui Bao also wrote that the intricate details of construction for the device were once written in the Shang Fang Gu Shi (Traditions of the Imperial Workshops), but the book was lost by his time.|$|E

500|$|Although {{this was}} his 12th {{published}} novel, Irving said that Last Night in Twisted River was [...] "20 years in the making". The idea for a novel about a cook and his son on the run {{had been in the}} back of his mind for as long ago as 1986. Irving, who likes to start his novels with the <b>last</b> <b>sentence,</b> said in an interview with The Independent in October 2009: [...] "For the longest time the <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> eluded me, but 20 years ago I imagined a novel about a cook and his young son who become fugitives; who have to run from some violent act that will follow them. And it was always in a kind of frontier town — a place where there was one law, and it was one man, who was single-minded and bad." [...] Irving did not start writing the novel until 2005. Speaking to the BBC World Service in October 2009, Irving explained that he found that <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> on his way to a doctor's appointment. He said an old Bob Dylan CD was playing [...] "Tangled Up in Blue" [...] in his car, and when he heard the lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{quotes from}} the <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> of Charles Darwin's 1859 The Origin of Species, in which he {{described}} the evolution of all living organisms from a common ancestor: [...] "endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved." [...] Darwin, however, was unable to explain how those body forms actually came into being. The early 20th century modern synthesis of evolution and genetics, too, largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics {{appeared to be an}} adequate explanation of how forms evolved. That task was finally undertaken {{at the end of the}} 20th century with the arrival of recombinant DNA technology, when biologists were able to start to explore how development was actually controlled.|$|E
500|$|Catching Fire {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "If this second installment spends {{too much time}} recapping events from book one, it doesn't disappoint when it segues into the pulse-pounding action readers have come to expect." [...] Booklist commented on how the [...] "unadorned prose provides an open window to perfect pacing and electrifying world building". The New York Times also gave a positive review, writing, [...] "Collins has done that rare thing. She has written a sequel that improves upon the first book. As a reader, I felt excited and even hopeful: {{could it be that}} this series and its characters were actually going somewhere?" [...] The review also praised Collins' development of the character of Katniss. The Plain Dealer wrote, [...] "The very <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> of Catching Fire will leave readers gasping.

5000|$|The 1940 Constitution of Cuba banned capital {{punishment}} for peacetime offenses, but the penalty was officially reinstated by law {{as well as}} in practice following the Cuban Revolution, in 1959.

500|$|While {{riding a}} tour bus in Germany, Brian {{looks at a}} history book that has no {{information}} regarding German history from1939 – 1945; the years on which World War II started and ended. Brian questions the tour guide about the dates when Germany invaded Poland, but the guide denies that it happened. Brian keeps insisting until the guide yells [...] "Sie werden sich hinsetzen! Sie werden ruhig sein! Sie werden nicht beleidigen Deutschland!", literally meaning [...] "You will sit down! You will be quiet! You will not insult Germany!" [...] while making the Nazi salute with his left hand. The <b>last</b> <b>sentence</b> is grammatically incorrect, as the proper German statement would be, [...] "Sie werden Deutschland nicht beleidigen!" [...] At {{the beginning of the}} episode, the credits are presented with title cards containing images of Brian and Stewie passing by various iconic places in Europe. These include France's Eiffel Tower, Italy's Leaning Tower of Pisa and a venetian gondola, the United Kingdom's Stonehenge and Greece's Parthenon.
