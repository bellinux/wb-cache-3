5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

25|$|OSU ROTC's {{shoulder}} insignia {{was a red}} {{and gray}} circle. This was worn on the right shoulder. On the right sleeve, a five pointed star signifying OSU was {{the recipient of the}} ROTC Honor School award was worn. Near the cuff of the left sleeve, a shield patch with U.S. R.O.T.C embroidered on it was worn. If the cadet had attained a rank in ROTC, they wore their rank insignia on each sleeve. The color of rank chevrons and the ROTC shield patch were determined by the military division in which the cadet was looking to commission. For example, an Artillery cadet would wear a black shield with scarlet lettering and black chevrons on a scarlet background, while an Infantry cadet would wear a black shield with teal lettering and black chevrons on a teal background. The hat took on a more modern look as well, <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the modern military style visor hat. ROTC chin straps and uniform buttons were gold colored. The peace eagle remained, but an addition was made to the eagles, an extra banner that arced above the E. Pluribus Unum banner from the eagle’s beak. This banner simply read “OHIO,” earning the OSUMB’s peace eagles the nickname “Eagle Ohio.” These early Eagle Ohios were made in gold colored metal to match the buttons and chin strap of the uniform jacket and hat. The regular uniform of an OSU ROTC cadet included a navy blue service coat, a light blue dress shirt, black tie, navy blue pants, white cotton spats, black dress shoes, and a white canvas belt with a gold buckle.|$|E
500|$|... "Ricardio the Heart Guy" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez, from {{a story by}} Merriwether Williams, Tim McKeon, and Adam Muto. Directed by Larry Leichliter, the episode {{introduces}} the recurring villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny later called [...] "the valentine from Hell". Takei later reprised the role in the season four episode [...] "Lady and Peebles". Initial drafts of the character featured him <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an anthropomorphic heart, complete with arteries and ventricles. Ricardio {{is one of the}} few individuals in the Adventure Time universe to have a highly detailed face; during the commentary for the episode, his design was compared to that of the face on the moon in the 1902 French silent film Le Voyage dans la Lune, based on H.G. Wells's 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{situated}} at 3145 Las Vegas Boulevard South, between Desert Inn Road and Sands Avenue. The original name {{for many years}} was Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn. Wilbur Clark, described by Frank Sinatra biographer James Kaplan as a [...] "onetime San Diego bellhop and Reno craps dealer", originally began building the resort with his brother in 1947 with $250,000, but ran out of money. Author Hal Rothman notes that [...] "for nearly two years the framed structure sat in the hot desert sun, <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an ancient relic than a nascent casino". Clark approached the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for investment, but it was struggling financially. In 1949, he met with Moe Dalitz, {{the head of the}} notorious Cleveland gang, the Mayfield Road Mob, and Dalitz agreed to fund 75% of the project with $1.3 million, and construction resumed. Much of the financing came from the American National Insurance Company (ANICO), though Clark became the public frontman of the resort while Dalitz remained quietly in the background as the principal owner. The resort would eventually be renamed Desert Inn and was called the [...] "D.I." [...] by Las Vegas locals and regular guests.|$|E

500|$|Mount Ślęża {{formation}} is believed {{by many to}} have been a place of exceptional cult significance, over many centuries, possibly going back {{all the way to the}} Lusatian times, but especially for the Celts. Chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg mentions in the early 11th century the mountain as a place surrounded by adoration because of its size and the [...] "cursed" [...] pagan ceremonies carried out there. The summits of this and of the neighboring mountains are circled by stone rings and monumental sculptures. Diagonalized cross signs found on many of the stone objects may have had their origin in the Hallstatt - Lusatian solar cult. Such signs can also be seen on the massive [...] "monk" [...] stone sculpture (actually <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a simple chess figure or a skittles pin) that was located inside the largest stone ring on Mount Ślęża itself and is therefore believed to originate from the Hallstatt cultural circles. The stone rings also contain fragments of Lusatian ceramics. The younger sculptures ("Maiden with a fish", [...] "Mushroom" [...] and the bear figures) have their distant counterparts in the Iberian Peninsula Celtic art and are thought to be the work of the Celtic people, who developed the Ślęża cult center further. After that the Mount Ślęża area cult was probably revived by the Slavs, who arrived here in early Middle Ages.|$|E

Stan is dressed as Raggedy Andy (since Wendy would be going as Raggedy Ann, thus making a pair), Kyle wears a Chewbacca mask, and Cartman is dressed as Adolf Hitler, much to the fury of Kyle, who is Jewish. A zombified Kenny joins the boys, but they fail to notice {{that he is a}} zombie. At school, Kyle gets more annoyed after {{discovering}} that the other students (as well as Mr. Hat) are also dressed as Chewbacca, while Mr. Garrison is dressed as Marilyn Monroe. Worst of all, Wendy is dressed as Chewbacca; she explains that she changed costumes because they would have looked stupid as the Raggedy couple and she figured Stan would realize it too. A stubborn Kyle decides to make a new costume so he can win the prize, two tons of candy. Both Chef (dressed as Evel Knievel) and Principal Victoria are annoyed to see Cartman dressed as Hitler. Victoria makes him a [...] "ghost" [...] costume but he ends up <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a Ku Klux Klan member, which annoys Chef even more. At the contest, which is judged by Tina Yothers, Wendy (despite wearing the same costume as the other students) wins the candy, much to the fury of Kyle, who is now dressed as the Solar System. Stan wins the worst costume and everyone laughs at him, leaving him humiliated.|$|E
500|$|Robinett first {{identified}} ways {{to translate}} the elements of Colossal Cave Adventure into simple, easy-to-recognize graphics that the player could interact with directly, replacing text-based commands with joystick controls. Due to {{the limitations of the}} system's graphical hardware, Robinett noted the dragons ended up <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> ducks. Robinett developed workarounds for various technical limitations of the Atari 2600. The system has only one playfield and five memory-mapped registers available to represent moving objects. [...] Only two of these registers are capable of representing more complex sprites. [...] Robinett used those for objects and creatures within the game. He used the register originally designated for the ball in games such as Pong to represent the player's avatar. [...] Finally, he used the registers assigned for missiles, such as the bullets in Combat, for additional walls in the playing field to be able to represent different rooms within the game with the same playfield. Another hardware limitation forces the left and right sides of nearly every screen to be mirror images of each other; this fostered the creation of the game's confusing mazes. The notable exceptions are two screens in the black castle catacombs and two in the main hallway beneath the Yellow Castle. These two hallway screens are mirrored, but contain a vertical [...] "wall" [...] object in the room in order to achieve a non-symmetrical shape, as well as act as a secret door for an Easter egg.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated [...] "Director Peter Jackson, at {{home with}} all kinds of excess in New Zealand, keeps {{everything}} spinning nicely, not even losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times enjoyed The Frighteners, but [...] "walked out the theater with mixed emotions," [...] she commented that [...] "Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert, imaginative effects than for his live actors anyhow. These lively touches would leave The Frighteners <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a more frantic Beetlejuice if Jackson's film weren't so wearyingly overcrowded. The Frighteners is not immune to overkill, even though most of its characters are already dead." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News praised the acting in the film, with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular, but said that there were also [...] "bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things to a screeching halt", and that if [...] "Jackson had used the restraint he showed in Heavenly Creatures, the movie could have [...] "been the best of its kind". Critic Christopher Null praised the film, as he described it as a mixture between Ghostbusters and Twin Peaks. Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film wouldn't make Jackson's top five of movies, it [...] "is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you'll enjoy casually watching from time to time". The Frighteners received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson's native country, New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Episode one: Ellie and Lester - Ellie and Lester {{appeared}} as a challenging couple for [...] Woodall and Constantine to transform and help in their first episode. The couple have an age gap of nineteen years and Lester, who is seven inches shorter than Ellie, is struggling to keep their marriage together. Whilst Ellie, thirty-four, goes out to work every day, fifty-three-year-old Lester stays at home to look after their two autistic sons. While Ellie has been dressing in inexpensive, baggy suits, Lester appears to pride himself in a dated collection of casual trousers. It soon becomes apparent that Ellie and Lester's relationship is in a big crisis when Ellie confesses to previously having an affair. Following Ellie's revelation, the couple is taken out shopping to find some fashionable attire to suit their lifestyle. Woodall dresses Ellie in a [...] black dress; meanwhile, Constantine finds some suitable clothes for Lester.

2500|$|Fraser-Simson is {{also known}} for his many {{settings}} of children's verse by A. A.

[...] His settings of Milne's verse include a children's song cycle The Hums of Pooh, based on verses from Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner. This was included in Julian Slade's 1970 adaptation of Winnie-the-Pooh. He published six volumes of songs setting verses from Milne's When We Were Very Young. They were first recorded for the gramophone by George Baker accompanied by Gerald Moore in 1930. His other songs included the collection Teddy Bear and Other Songs and songs from Alice in Wonderland which were published in 1932 and recorded by Baker and Moore the same year.
