Determining {{the design of the}} <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> is critical to effective operations of such carriers. This dissertation makes contributions in modeling and algorithm design for three problems in LTL <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design: (1) Refined execution cost estimation. Existing <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design models use approximations that ignore important facts such as the nonlinearity of transportation costs with respect to the number of trailers, and empty travel beyond what is required for trailer balance that results from driver rules. We develop models that more accurately capture key operations of LTL carriers and produce accurate operational execution costs estimates; (2) Dynamic <b>load</b> <b>planning.</b> <b>Load</b> <b>plans</b> are traditionally revised infrequently by LTL carriers due to the difficulty of solving the associated optimization problem. Technological advances have now enabled carriers to consider daily <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> updates. We develop technologies that efficiently and effectively adjust a nominal <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> for a given day based on the actual freight to be served by the carrier. We present an integer programming based local search procedure, and a greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic; and (3) Stochastic <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design. <b>Load</b> <b>plan</b> design models commonly represent origin-destination freight volumes using average demands, which do not describe freight volume fluctuations. We investigate <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design models that explicitly utilize information on freight volume uncertainty and design <b>load</b> <b>plans</b> that most cost-effectively deal with varying freight volumes and lead to the lowest expected cost. We present a Sample Average Approximation approach and a variant of the method for solving the stochastic integer programming formulations. Ph. D.

Mission change orders finally {{got down to}} company commanders, on the 24th, just 15 minutes before their units, not yet provisioned with spades, anti-tank mines, or ponchos for the autumn night frosts, assembled on airfields. Owing to the weather, not all assigned aircraft had arrived at airfields on time (if at all). Further, most flight safety officers disallowed maximum loading of their aircraft. Given fewer aircraft (and lower than expected capacities), the master <b>loading</b> <b>plan,</b> ruined, was abandoned. Many radios and supplies got left behind. In the best case, it would take three lifts to deliver the two brigades. Units (still arriving by the over-taxed rail system), were loaded piecemeal onto returned aircraft, which were slow to refuel owing to the less-than-expected capacities of fuel trucks. Meanwhile, already-arrived troops changed planes, seeking earlier flights. Urgency and the fuel shortage prevented aerial assembly aloft. Most aircraft, {{as soon as they}} were loaded and fueled, flew in single file, instead of line abreast, to the dropping points. Assault waves became as intermingled as the units they carried.|$|E

The goal of <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> is to choose wagon settings and assign load units to wagons of a train such that the utilization of the train is maximized, and setup and transportation costs in the terminal are minimized. However, in real-world applications, many of the parameters needed for the model are not known exactly. Since feasibility of the resulting load distribution has always to be guaranteed, we decided to use a robust approach. In particular, we apply the concepts of strict and adjustable robustness to enhance the <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> problem.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Ship {{turnaround}} {{time at a}} marine containerport is an important measure of the port's efficiency and attractiveness. Both the speed and quality of <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> affect the length of {{turnaround time}} considerably. Past attempts at computerizing the <b>load</b> <b>planning</b> function have been unsatisfactory and have not reflected the port's objective of optimally utilizing its facilities and equipment. The computerized model developed through this study generates optimum feasible <b>load</b> <b>plans</b> that minimize yard material handling of containers while meeting all ship stability and loading restrictions. The model is particularly addressed to containerports with transtainers as prime yard movers. Minimization of yard handling is accomplished through formulation of the transtainer routing problem as a dynamic programming problem. The set of shipboard container-cell assignments is then checked against the constraints. Pairwise exchanges of assignments are made to meet any violated constraint so that the yard handling increase is minimized. The model has been tested using data for five actual ship loadings at Port of Portland. It yielded feasible <b>load</b> <b>plans</b> that were better than those manually generated showing an average 3. 2 percent less material handling requirements.
