40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel fuzzy based approach {{to determine the}} complexity of an image which is independent of a human perception criterion. The proposed method determines the complexity of an image based on the analysis of its edge level percentages.

The method is very robust and consistent since it does not incorporate any a priori human evaluation of complexity. Results of the method show a correlation with human complexity values obtained in an independent evaluation test; however, the values obtained with our method are consistent and not subject to the viewer’s subjectivity. The paper also shows promising results in applying the method to an application of determining the edges of images when compared with a crisp image complexity method...|$|R

40|$|Leukopenia is {{a severe}} {{condition}} resulting from both pathological processes and some treatments, like chemotherapy in cancer patients. However, the {{activation of the}} patient immune system {{is required for the}} success of immunotherapeutic strategies, as cancer vaccines. In this regard, leukopenia constitutes a major hurdle to overcome, mainly due to the impairment of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Adjuvants are basic components of vaccine formulations, which might be useful to stimulate immunity under this immunosuppressed condition. To this aim, we tested the capacity of a novel nanoparticulated <b>complex,</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> size proteoliposomes (VSSP), to promote CTL even in a leukopenic scenario. Noteworthy, we observed that a VSSP-based OVA vaccine induced a normal antigen-specific CTL response in mice rendered leukopenia by the administration of high doses of the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (CY), while under the same conditions the OVA antigen formulated in the TLR- 3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (P(I:C)) was ineffective. Moreover, an appropriate combination of VSSP with the P(I:C) vaccine was able to restore the CD 8 (+) T cell effector function in leukopenic mice. VSSP induced not only a faster repopulation of immune cells in CY-receiving animals, but also enhanced the recovery of memory T lymphocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) while simultaneously abrogated the immunosuppressive capacity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Our results suggest that VSSP could be a particularly suitable immunomodulator to be used in CTL-promoting active immunotherapy strategies operating in severe immune compromised scenarios. status: publishe...|$|R

We applied NMR relaxation dispersion to investigate the role of bound ligands in modulating the dynamics and energy landscape of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase to obtain insights into the mechanism by which the enzyme efficiently samples functional conformations as it traverses its reaction pathway. Although the structural differences between the occluded substrate binary complexes and product ternary <b>complexes</b> are <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> there are substantial differences in protein dynamics. Backbone fluctuations on the μs-ms timescale in the cofactor binding cleft are similar for the substrate and product binary complexes, but fluctuations on this timescale in the active site loops are observed only for complexes with substrate or substrate analog and are not observed for the binary product complex. The dynamics in the substrate and product binary complexes are governed by quite different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. Analogous dynamic differences in the E:THF:NADPH and E:THF:NADP+ product ternary complexes are difficult to rationalize from ground-state structures. For both of these complexes, the nicotinamide ring resides outside the active site pocket in the ground state. However, they differ in the structure, energetics, and dynamics of accessible higher energy substates where the nicotinamide ring transiently occupies the active site. Overall, our results suggest that dynamics in dihydrofolate reductase are exquisitely “tuned” for every intermediate in the catalytic cycle; structural fluctuations efficiently channel the enzyme through functionally relevant conformational space...|$|R

If large grains grow by agglomeration of submicron grains of all dust types, the amorphous silicate components of these aggregates must typically be more abundant than the crystalline silicate components. Crystalline silicate abundances correlate positively with other such abundances, suggesting that crystalline silicates are processed directly from amorphous silicates and that neither forsterite, enstatite, nor silica are intermediate steps when producing either of the other two. Disks with more dust settling typically have greater crystalline abundances. Large-grain abundance is somewhat correlated with greater settling of disks. The lack of strong correlation is interpreted to mean that settling of large grains is sensitive to individual disk properties. Lower-mass stars have higher abundances of large grains in their inner regions. Comment: 84 pages, 27 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal on 7 November, 200...|$|R

The analysis focuses on the Input-Queue Cell-Switch architecture, {{which is the most}} promising in terms of scalability for speed and number of router ports. After describing the main problems in the design of such devices and the critical role that the scheduling algorithm plays, it is proven that the scheduling problem is a problem of ?nding a matching in a bipartite graph. Also, the main tools of the analysis, simulations and stochastic modelling, are presented. So far, the algorithms in the area were either simple in their implementation, but with poor results, or too complex with better performance. The dissertation presents a series of new algorithms based on the study scheme that, while being <b>less</b> <b>complex,</b> they maintain <b>very</b> high performance levels.

Surface conductance of TiO 2 nanoparticles immersed in a NaCl solution is estimated using a surface complexation model, and this parameter and particle size are incorporated into Henry's model in order to determine a constrained value of the zeta potential from electrophoresis.
