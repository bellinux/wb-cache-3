50|$|The tool is a self-report {{comprising}} 28-items {{answered on}} a 5-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> “Does not describe me well” to“Describes me very well”.|$|E
50|$|The dimensions, Group Membership Evaluation, Pacific Connectedness and Belonging, and Religious Centrality and Embeddness all {{relate to}} identity. Answers to {{questions}} relating to identity are {{rated on a}} <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 to 7 (1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree). The dimensions, Perceived Familial Wellbeing and Perceived Societal Wellbeing both relate to wellbeing. Answers to questions relating to wellbeing are rated on a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 to 7 (1 = completely dissatisfied and 7 = completely satisfied).|$|E
50|$|Presented on a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale,</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always), those {{completing}} the SCS {{are able to}} gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time.|$|E
30|$|It was {{measured}} with the Satisfaction with Life (SWL) Scale developed by Diener et al. 1985 (translation by Moyano Díaz and Ramos Alvarado, 2007). The scale has five items that are answered on a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 1 (totally disagree) to 7 points (totally agree). In the present study, the scale accounted for high internal consistency (α[*]=[*] 0.85).|$|R
30|$|Perceptions of {{the present}} and future {{economic}} and political conditions of the home country was measured by 4 items (e.g., “I think the economic conditions of my country now for starting a new business …”, “I think the political conditions of my country in the coming 5 to 10  years will be …”). The 6 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 1 [*]=[*]Definitely worse to 6 [*]=[*]Definitely better.|$|R
30|$|The Brief-COPE (Carver, 1997) in a {{translation}} for Spanish population by Moran et al. (2010) was used. The instrument consists of 28 items that measure 14 factors of 2 items each, which correspond to a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 0 = I {{have not been}} doing this at all to 3 = I {{have been doing this}} a lot. The psychometric properties of the scale are presented in the “Results” section.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{scale to}} measure the effects of various substitutes was developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978). They assessed leadership substitutes via a questionnaire that contained thirteen subscales {{with a total of}} 55 items. The items were on a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 (almost always untrue or completely untrue), to 5 (almost always true or almost completely true).|$|E
5000|$|Us.E. 2.0 allows fast {{assessment}} of web site usability identifying critical issues {{that could be}} eventually addressed by re-design. Users are required to answer to all items along a 5-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> (<b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> [...] "strongly agree" [...] to [...] "strongly disagree"). In order to obtain stable usability estimates a minimum of 30 respondents are required.|$|E
5000|$|The authors drew {{inspiration}} for the scale's content {{from the work of}} previous researchers of hardiness, most notably S.C. Kobasa [...] and M. Rutter. The CD-RISC consists of 25 items, which are evaluated on a five point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 0-4: not true at all (0), rarely true (1), sometimes true (2), often true (3), and true nearly all of the time (4) - these ratings result in a number between 0-100, and higher scores indicate higher resilience.|$|E
30|$|CSE was {{measured}} with the 12 -item scale developed by Judge et al. (2003). The scale has been validated in China (Rode et al. 2012; Sun and Yang 2013). Sample items are “I am confident that I get the success I deserve in life” and “Sometimes when I fail I feel worthless”. The five-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>from</b> 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s alpha) of this scale is 0.71.|$|R
30|$|The {{reporting}} {{quality and}} the quality of the used methods were assessed in order to be able to judge the reproducibility of the included studies. During the analysis, two experts (RM and MDZ) rated each publication’s reporting and methods on two 5 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 (poor reporting/methods) to 5 (very good reporting/methods). The publication was excluded if either of the two scores was equal to or lower than three.|$|R
30|$|All scales {{consisted}} of statements {{that had to}} be rated using seven point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 [*]=[*]very strong disagreement to 7 [*]=[*]very strong agreement. In both studies, the participants were addressed in each examined community through the built-in communication tools and invited to answer the questionnaires online. Study 1 was conducted in June 2014, Study 2 in March 2015. In each 1, 2  weeks after inviting the participants to the survey, a reminder was sent, and after the 3 rd week the questionnaires were set offline. Subsequently, the survey data was downloaded and statistically processed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.|$|R
50|$|The FACT-G Version 4 has 27 questions, each {{of which}} is {{answered}} using a 5-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state, leading to some items being reverse-scored. Questions measure the respondents' health state over the last 7 days in four subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 questions), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 questions), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 questions), and Functional Well-being (FWB, 7 questions). Disease-specific versions of the FACT-G contain these four core subscales, with additional questions appended to address disease-specific factors.|$|E
50|$|The {{second part}} asks the {{respondent}} {{to explain the}} incident from section one and to answer a set of questions about his/her reactions and emotions during and immediately following the event. The third part asks the respondent how frequently they experienced common responses that align with the traumatic event on a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 0 (None) to 4 (Most). Two additional symptom questions were added to part 2 of the adolescent version because authors of the index found through their research that guilt and recurrence of the trauma are salient components to PTSD in adolescents, affecting the child’s view of the trauma {{and the degree to}} which the experience traumatized the child.|$|E
50|$|Consideration {{of future}} {{consequences}} {{is measured by}} the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale developed by Strathman and colleagues, and consists of 12 items. Respondents are asked to indicate to what extent each item characterizes them on a 5-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 (extremely uncharacteristic) to 5 (extremely characteristic). Example items are as follows: “I often consider how things might be in the future and try to influence those things with my day to day behaviour,” “I only act to satisfy immediate concerns, figuring the future will take care of itself,” and “I think that sacrificing now is usually unnecessary since future outcomes can be dealt with at a later time.” The scale has been translated into ten different languages: Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, and Turkish.|$|E
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{used in this}} study consisted of 16 items adapted from previous studies. Adapting questionnaire from previous studies was to ensure its validity and reliability. In measuring IEO, this paper considered it as a three-dimension construct which consisted of innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking. A total of ten items were adapted from Bolton and Lane (2012) to measure IEO. Meanwhile, six items adapted from Liñán and Chen (2009) were employed to measure entrepreneurial intention. All items were gauged on five-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 1 [*]=[*]“strongly disagree” to 5 [*]=[*]“strongly agree”. The questionnaire was pilot tested prior to the mass distribution. Consequently, feedbacks from respondents were collected and amendments were made to improve the questionnaire.|$|R

The aim of this study was “to determine the degree of satisfaction of parents of infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) ”. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, parents of 300 infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit participated with cluster sampling of twelve elected government hospital in Tehran in 2012. Demographic data and data on parental satisfaction using valid and reliable researcher made questionnaire in three domains of welfare, medical and nursing services was measured with a <b>likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 0 - 100.

5000|$|The British Values Survey {{measures}} over 100 psychological {{attributes of}} individuals, and includes Shalom Schwartz's Values scales model, which identifies ten core human values. Questions {{are based on}} a simple <b>Likert</b> <b>scale.</b> They <b>range</b> <b>from</b> everyday concerns (i.e. [...] "How much do you agree that products don't last as long as they used to?") to questions on social issues like the sentencing of criminals.|$|R
5000|$|One {{frequently}} used measure for general affective {{states is the}} Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Participants completing the PANAS are {{asked to rate the}} extent to which they experienced each out of 20 emotions on a 5-point <b>Likert</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> [...] "very slightly" [...] to [...] "very much". The exact instructions may vary according to the purpose of the study: Participants may be asked how they feel right now or during longer periods of time (e.g. during the past year). Half of the presented emotion words concern negative affect (distressed, upset, guilty, ashamed, hostile, irritable, nervous, jittery, scared, afraid), the other half positive affect (interested, alert, attentive, excited, enthusiastic, inspired, proud, determined, strong, active). The PANAS has been regarded as a highly reliable measure for non-clinical populations. Independent validation studies indicate that the measure demonstrates excellent construct validity.|$|E
5000|$|The VIA-IS is {{composed}} of a 240 item measure of 24 character strengths (10 items per strength). On average, an individual will complete the VIA-IS in 30 to 40 minutes. [...] Since 2001, the survey is available online for free at www.viacharacter.org and over 400,000 people have participated so far. [...] Participants are instructed to answer each item on the VIA-IS in terms of “whether the statement describes what you are like”. [...] Participants respond according to a 5-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> (1= very much unlike me, 5= very much like me). [...] Sample items include “I find the world a very interesting place”, which gauges curiosity, and “I always let bygone be bygones”, which gauges forgiveness. [...] People can score anywhere from 10 to 50 points {{for each of the}} 24 strengths. Moreover, a higher score on a scale indicates that the participant more strongly identifies with that scale's associated strength. Score reports are delivered to each participant at the completion of the survey. Feedback is provided for the signature strengths, but not for the lesser strengths. The results rank order the participant’s strengths from 1-24, with the top 4-7 strengths considered “signature strengths”.|$|E
5000|$|Currin et al. (2015) {{carried out}} a study {{investigating}} {{the existence of the}} fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a [...] "heterosexual group" [...] and a [...] "non-heterosexual" [...] group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, [...] "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" [...] and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected [...] "heterosexual" [...] were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting [...] "gay/lesbian" [...] were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, [...] "How sexually attracted are you to men?" [...] and selected from a 7 point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked [...] "How sexually attracted are you to women?" [...] and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, [...] "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" [...] and [...] "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" [...] Sexual partner was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile-vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group.|$|E
30|$|Personality traits were {{assessed}} through the short {{version of the}} NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), which is called the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). This 60 -item, multiple-choice questionnaire evaluates five main dimensions of personality: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism in a five-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> that <b>ranges</b> <b>from</b> 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Additionally, the NEO-FFI had already been validated for the Portuguese population (Magalhães et al. 2014).|$|R

Arthritis Educational Needs Assessment Tool (ENAT) was designed to identify individual educational needs of patients with arthritis [2]. Aim The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the educational needs of people with osteoarthritis by use of the ENAT. Methods ENAT is a self-completed questionnaire comprising of 39 items grouped into 7 domains (managing pain, movement, feelings, arthritis process, treatments, self-help measures and support systems). Patients score the items by ticking 5 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> “not at all important ” = 1 to “extremely important ” = 5.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the issue of audit reporting and going concern {{in the face of}} corporate scandals in Nigeria. We adopted the survey research design. An instrument containing 20 items was designed using the 5 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> strongly agree (5) to strongly disagree (1). A total of 60 samples were drawn from the target population using the simple random sampling technique. Out of the 60 questionnaires administered, 44 were returned upon which the analysis was based. Data analysis was carried out with the aid of SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). The Chi-square statistical technique was used to test the hypotheses at 5 % alpha level. It was found that there are differences in going concern reporting among independent auditors. We also found out using the data analyzed that there is a significant relationship between going concern reporting and corporate failures. The study recommended based on these findings, that all involved in the preparation and audit of financial statement must pay careful attention to going concern assumptions...|$|R

All District of Columbia public school nurses were asked to anonymously complete a food allergy knowledge and attitude questionnaire. Knowledge scores were calculated as percentage of correct responses. Attitude responses were tabulated across five-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales,</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> strongly disagree to strongly agree. The knowledge questionnaire was completed by 87 % of eligible nurses and the attitude questionnaire by  83 %. The mean total knowledge score was 76 ± 13 with domain score highest for symptom recognition and lowest for treatment. Regarding attitudes, most (94 %) felt food allergy is a serious health problem, for which schools should have guidelines (94 %). Fewer believed that nut-free schools (82 %) and allergen-free tables (44 %) should be implemented. Negative perceptions of parents were identified as: parents of food-allergic children are overprotective (55 %) and make unreasonable requests of schools (15 %).
