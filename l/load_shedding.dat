5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, <b>load</b> <b>shedding,</b> storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables.

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day.

40|$|Abstract—Smart grid {{support for}} demand {{response}} provides strategies for an electricity service provider to <b>shed</b> <b>loads</b> during peak usage periods with minimal consumer inconvenience. Direct load {{control is a}} strategy for doing this in which consumers enroll appliances such as electric water heaters, air conditioners, and battery vehicles in a program to respond to <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> instructions {{in exchange for a}} discount on electricity prices or other incentive. The effectiveness of direct control depends on the ability of the provider to verify that appliances respond to <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> instructions. A technique called non-intrusive load monitoring, in which electric power meter readings are used to identify loads generated by specific appliances, provides a practical strategy for <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> verification in residences. Non-intrusive <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> verification promises to greatly simplify trust assumptions required for the deployment of direct control. F D EMAND response is a corner stone ofsmart grid technology in which con-sumers are able to participate directly in en-ergy markets by limiting their usage during periods of emergency or peak demand. Direct control is an approach to demand response wherein an Electricity Service Provider (ESP) offers consumers discounts or other incentives if they agree to allow the ESP to send Load Shed Instructions (LSIs) to specified appliances. For instance, some ESPs offer such a program for adjusting set points on thermostats that control air conditioners. Other types of appli-ances have been involved in such programs, and even more are being considered as part of the smart grid. Direct control can save money for consumers and provide ESPs with valuable tools for controlling energy generation costs and grid stability. However, these benefits de-pend on knowing that LSIs will result in the ex-pected response by appliances. It is important that an appliance in such a program allow Load Shed Verification (LSV) to improve reliability and eliminate “free loaders ” who accept in-centives without implementing direct controls. This generates many challenges with trust since the appliance is owned and operated by the consumer while the integrity of its respons...|$|R

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of a 100 MW solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine (SOFC-GT) hybrid system has been {{developed}} and subjected to perturbations in diurnal ambient temperature and pressure as well as <b>load</b> <b>sheds.</b> The dynamic system responses monitored were the fuel cell electrolyte temperature, gas turbine shaft speed, turbine inlet temperature and compressor surge. Using a control strategy that primarily focuses on holding fuel cell electrolyte temperature constant and secondarily on maintaining gas turbine shaft speed, safe operation was found to occur for expected ambient pressure variation ranges and for ambient temperature variations up to 28 K, when tested non-simultaneously. When ambient temperature and pressure were varied simultaneously, stable operation was found to occur when the two are in phase but not when the two are out of phase. The latter case leads to shaft over-speed. Compressor surge {{was found to be}} more likely when the system is subjected to a <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> initiated at minimum ambient temperature rather than at maximum ambient temperature.

40|$|In this paper, the multi-type {{branching}} process {{is applied to}} describe the statistics and interdependencies of line outages, the <b>load</b> <b>shed,</b> and isolated buses. The offspring mean matrix of the multi-type {{branching process}} is estimated by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and can quantify the extent of outage propagation. The joint distribution of two types of outages is estimated by the multi-type branching process via the Lagrange-Good inversion. The proposed model is tested with data generated by the AC OPA cascading simulations on the IEEE 118 -bus system. The largest eigenvalues of the offspring mean matrix indicate {{that the system is}} closer to criticality when considering the interdependence of different types of outages. Compared with empirically estimating the joint distribution of the total outages, good estimate is obtained by using the multitype branching process with a much smaller number of cascades, thus greatly improving the efficiency. It is shown that the multitype branching process can effectively predict the distribution of the <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> and isolated buses and their conditional largest possible total outages even when there are no data of them.

Methodology/Principal Findings Our study, conducted in Salvador, Brazil, established the average load of leptospires in positive kidneys to be 5. 9 x 106 per mL (range 3. 1 - 8. 2 x 106) genome equivalents (GEq), similar to the 6. 1 x 106 per ml (range 2. 2 - 9. 4 x 106) average obtained from paired urines, with a significant positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 78) between the two. Based on bivariate and multivariate modeling, we found with both kidney and urine samples that leptospiral loads increased with the age of rats (based on the index of body length to mass), MAT titer {{and the presence of}} wounding/scars, and varied with site of capture. Some associations were modified by sex but trends were apparent. Combining with data on the demographic properties and prevalence of leptospiral carriage in rat populations in Salvador, we estimated that daily leptospiral <b>loads</b> <b>shed</b> in the urine of a population of 82 individuals exceeded 9. 1 x 1010 leptospires.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a stochastic model {{that describes the}} quasi-static dynamics of an electric transmission network under perturbations introduced by random load fluctuations, random removing of system components from service, random repair times for the failed components, and random response times to implement optimal system corrections for removing line overloads in a damaged or stressed transmission network. We use a linear approximation to the network flow equations and apply linear programming techniques that optimize the dispatching of generators and loads in order to eliminate the network overloads associated with a damaged system. We also provide a simple model for the operator's response to various contingency events that is not always optimal due to either failure of the state estimation system or due to the incorrect subjective assessment of the severity associated with these events. This further allows us to use a game theoretic framework for casting the optimization of the operator's response into {{the choice of the}} optimal strategy which minimizes the operating cost. We use a simple strategy space which is the degree of tolerance to line overloads and which is an automatic control (optimization) parameter that can be adjusted to trade off automatic <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> without propagating cascades versus reduced <b>load</b> <b>shed</b> and an increased risk of propagating cascades.
