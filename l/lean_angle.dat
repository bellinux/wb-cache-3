5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> of the rear frame from the ideal <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> {{described}} above. The actual <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E

5000|$|The ballbots (CMU Ballbot, BallIP, NXT Ballbot, Adelaide Ballbot, Rezero) use linear {{feedback}} control approaches to maintain balance and achieve motion. The CMU Ballbot uses an inner balancing control loop that maintains the body at desired body angles and an outer loop controller that achieves desired ball motions by commanding body angles to the balancing controller. The CMU Ballbot plans motions {{in the space}} of body <b>lean</b> <b>angles</b> in order to achieve fast, dynamic and graceful ball motions. With the introduction of arms, CMU Ballbot uses its planning procedure to plan {{in the space of}} both body <b>lean</b> <b>angles</b> and arm angles to achieve desired ball motions. [...] Moreover, it can also account for cases where the arms are constrained to certain specific motions and only body angles have to be used to achieve desired ball motions. The CMU Ballbot uses an integrated planning and control framework to autonomously navigate human environments. Its motion planner plans in the space of controllers to produce graceful navigation, and achieves point-point and surveillance tasks. It uses the laser range finder to actively detect and avoid both static and dynamic obstacles in its environment.|$|R
25|$|Much {{of the art}} of {{motorcycle}} cornering {{is learning}} how to effectively push the grips into corners and how to maintain proper <b>lean</b> <b>angles</b> through the turn. When the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an emergency, it is essential to know, through prior practice, that countersteering is {{the most efficient way to}} change the motorcycle's course. Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.|$|R
5|$|In this {{idealized}} and linearized model, {{there are}} many geometric parameters (wheelbase, head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: <b>lean</b> <b>angle,</b> lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate. These equations have been verified by comparison with multiple numeric models derived completely independently.|$|E
5|$|The term rear wobble {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mode of oscillation in which <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with steer angle. The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5Hz. Rear wobble is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium <b>lean</b> <b>angle,</b> the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
40|$|A computer-implemented {{model of}} fan {{section of a}} gas turbine engine {{accounts}} for the turbulence in the gas flow emanating from the rotor assembly and impinging upon an inlet to the stator vane cascade. The model allows for user-input variations in the sweep and/or <b>lean</b> <b>angles</b> for the stator vanes. The model determines the resulting acoustic response of the fan section {{as a function of}} the turbulence and the <b>lean</b> and/or sweep <b>angles</b> of the vanes. The model may be embodied in software that is rapidly executed in a computer. This way, an optimum arrangement in terms of fan noise reduction is quickly determined for the stator vane lean and sweep physical positioning in the fan section of a gas turbine engine...|$|R
50|$|Braking systems combine higher {{performance}} {{brake pads}} and disc brakes with multi-piston calipers that clamp onto oversized vented rotors. Suspension systems are advanced {{in terms of}} adjustments and materials for increased stability and durability. Front and rear tires are larger and wider than tires found on other types of motorcycles to allow higher cornering speeds and greater <b>lean</b> <b>angles.</b> Fairings {{may or may not}} be used on a sport bike; when used, fairings are shaped to reduce aerodynamic drag as much as possible and provide wind protection for the rider.|$|R
25|$|Higher {{speeds and}} tighter turns require greater <b>lean</b> <b>angles.</b> If the mass is not first {{leaned into the}} turn, the inertia of the rider and bike will cause them to {{continue}} {{in a straight line}} as the tires track out from under them along the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical way to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is to move the support points in the opposite direction first.|$|R
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any <b>lean</b> <b>angle</b> when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The ballbot {{with arms}} is an {{underactuated}} balancing mobile robot that moves {{on a single}} ball. Achieving desired motions in position space is a challenging task for such systems due to their unstable zero dynamics. This paper presents a novel approach that uses the dynamic constraint equations to plan shape trajectories, which when tracked will result in optimal tracking of desired position trajectories. The ballbot with arms has shape space of higher dimension than its position space and therefore, the procedure uses a user-defined weight matrix {{to choose between the}} infinite number of possible combinations of shape trajectories to achieve a particular desired trajectory in position space. Experimental results are shown on the real robot where different motions in position space are achieved by tracking motions of either the body <b>lean</b> <b>angles,</b> or the arm angles or combinations of both.

5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with <b>lean</b> <b>angle,</b> and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (<b>lean</b> <b>angle,</b> lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in <b>lean</b> <b>angle,</b> and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} shape-accelerated balancing {{systems as}} a special class of underactuated systems wherein their shape configurations can be mapped to the accelerations in the position space. These systems are destabilizedbygravitationalforcesandhavenon-integrable constraints on their dynamics. Balancing mobile robots, like the ballbot, are examples of such systems. The ballbot is a human-sized dynamically stable mobile robot that balances on a single ball. This paper presents a shape trajectory planner that uses dynamic constraint equations to plan trajectories in the shape space, which when tracked will result in approximate tracking of desired position trajectories.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{the idea of}} using a me-chanical steering compensator to influence the dynamic be-haviour of a high-performance motorcycle. The compensator is seen as a possible replacement for a conventional steering damper, and comprises a network of a spring, a damper and a less familiar component called the inerter. The inerter was recently introduced to allow the synthesis of arbitrary passive mechanical impedances, and finds a new potential application in the present work. The approach taken here to design the compensator is based on classical Bode-Nyquist frequency response ideas. The vehicle study involves computer simulations, which make use of a state-of-the-art motorcycle model whose parameter set is based on a Suzuki GSX-R 1000 sports machine. The study shows {{that it is possible to}} obtain significant improvements in the dynamic properties of the primary oscillatory modes, known as “wobble ” and “weave”, over a full range of <b>lean</b> <b>angles,</b> as compared with the standard machine fitted with a conventional steering damper.
