Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education. The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; Gaffa and the KaosPilot school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV2, Gnags, Thomas Helmig, Bamses Venner, Anne Dorte Michelsen, Mek Pek and Shit & Chanel.|$|E

25|$|The overall {{internal}} {{situation of}} Bulgaria following the two Balkan Wars remained greatly strained. The acquisition of around 18,000km2 of new land with its over 400,000 inhabitants failed {{to compensate for}} the loss of Southern Dobrudja, one of the country's most fertile regions; the approximately 176,000 casualties; and enormous financial costs. Agriculture, which was the <b>leading</b> <b>sector</b> of the economy, was badly affected and could no longer rely on Southern Dobrudja's annual grain harvest of up to 150,000 tonnes. The number of available horses, sheep and cattle was also lower when compared with 1912. Annual meat production was about 105,629 tonnes when the amount needed to sustain an army of 600,000 for a year was estimated at 87,600 tonnes. External trade and the public finances in this period were also characterized by a widening negative imbalance. It was reckoned that in case of war the country could not afford to feed, clothe and replace the manpower losses of an army greater than half a million men without severely undermining the economy.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} interplay between basic and applied {{research}} intensities in a simple model of creative destruction with research complementarities. Basic research intensity is chosen {{by the government and}} applied research intensity by the private sector. We find that the closer the country is to the world’s technological frontier the more the government should invest in basic research and the more the private sector will react with higher R&D expenditures. If innovation steps are small, a higher degree of openness triggers higher basic research and higher applied research investments in <b>leading</b> <b>sectors.</b> If innovation steps are larger, the government invests less in basic research, while firms in <b>leading</b> <b>sectors</b> tend to increase R&D investments, and those in lagging sectors reduce them.
