25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back feels as if it is moving both up and down as well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the hind legs engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as its hind leg steps under. As the legs push off the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the <b>leading</b> <b>leg</b> (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they will be for the stride, and then they begin to come back up as the horse places its weight on its <b>leading</b> <b>leg.</b> During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the hind legs come back under the body.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{occurrences of}} {{stabilizing}} and destabilizing external moments of force on a prosthetic knee during stance, {{in the first}} steps after gait initiation, in inexperienced users were investigated. Primary aim was to identify {{the differences in the}} external moments during gait initiation with the sound <b>leg</b> <b>leading</b> and the prosthetic <b>leg</b> <b>leading.</b> A prosthetic <b>leg</b> simulator device, with a flexible knee, was used to test able-bodied subject, with no walking aid experience. Inverse dynamics calculations were preformed to calculate the external moments. The subjects learned to control the prosthetic leg within 100 steps, without walking aids, evoking similar patterns of external moments of force during the steps after the gait initiation, either with their sound leg loading or prosthetic <b>leg</b> <b>leading.</b> Critical phases in which a sudden flexion of the knee can occur were found just after heelstrike and just before toe off, in which the external moment of force was close to the internal moment produced by a knee extension aiding spring in the opposite direction.

25|$|Like a canter, {{the horse}} will strike off with its non-leading hind foot; {{but the second}} stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with the {{striking}} off of the <b>leading</b> <b>leg,</b> followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Test at Cape Town, Benaud took 4/95 {{and then}} 5/49 {{in the second}} innings to secure an innings victory after the home team were forced to follow on. He {{followed}} this with 5/114 in a drawn Third Test, before a match-winning all round performance in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg. Benaud struck exactly 100 in the first innings, before taking 4/70 in South Africa's reply. When South Africa followed on, Benaud took 5/84, which left Australia needing only one run to win. He took 5/82 in the second innings of the Fifth Test, the fourth consecutive match {{in which he had}} taken five wickets in an innings, as Australia took a 3–0 series win. He had been a major contributor to the series win, scoring 329 runs at 54.83 and taking 30 wickets at 21.93, establishing himself as one of the <b>leading</b> <b>leg</b> spinners of the modern era.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{had another}} {{difficult}} time against New South Wales, {{as the state}} side made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless. When the servicemen batted, they faced an attack featuring <b>leading</b> <b>leg</b> spinner Bill O'Reilly and paceman Ray Lindwall, the fastest in Australia. Miller was on 74 as Services limped to 9/171. With only one partner left, Miller attacked, scoring 31 of the last 33 runs to end unbeaten on 105, and earning plaudits among cricket pundits on Australian soil. Former leading Test batsman Alan Kippax opined that [...] "Australia has unearthed a new champion", while O'Reilly said that Miller's century was [...] "one of the best hundreds ever got against me". Miller compiled 46 in the second innings as the Servicemen fell to another innings defeat. Miller finished the season with 4/49 against Queensland {{and a pair of}} fifties against Tasmania.|$|E

2500|$|In dynamic walking, {{the human}} body can be modeled {{as the center of}} mass (COM) {{supported}} by a massless rigid leg in single support and two massless legs during double-support, which is consistent with passive dynamics of the inverted pendulum, otherwise known as the inverted pendulum theory of gait. [...] In single support, no work is done since the ground reaction force is perpendicular to the COM motion. [...] In double support, the trailing leg works in conjunction with the <b>leading</b> <b>leg</b> to redirect the COM motion upward. [...] During this step-to-step transition period, the trailing leg exerts positive mechanical work on the COM while the <b>leading</b> <b>leg</b> exerts negative mechanical work on the COM. [...] To maintain steady walking gait requires the sum of these work terms, or the net work, to be equal to zero since any changes in system energy would impart different COM velocities between the start and end of transition. [...] While the ideal net mechanical work of this system is zero, muscle contractions are necessary to generate the ground reaction forces, implying that the metabolic energy expended is nonzero.|$|E

40|$|Here we {{show that}} novel, energy-recycling stairs {{reduce the amount of}} work {{required}} for humans to both ascend and descend stairs. Our low-power, interactive, and modular steps can be placed on existing staircases, storing energy during stair descent and returning that energy to the user during stair ascent. Energy is recycled through event-triggered latching and unlatching of passive springs without the use of powered actuators. When ascending the energy-recycling stairs, naive users generated 17. 4 ± 6. 9 % less positive work with their <b>leading</b> <b>legs</b> compared to conventional stairs, with the knee joint positive work reduced by 37. 7 ± 10. 5 %. Users also generated 21. 9 ± 17. 8 % less negative work with their trailing legs during stair descent, with ankle joint negative work reduced by 26. 0 ± 15. 9 %. Our low-power energy-recycling stairs have the potential to assist people with mobility impairments during stair negotiation on existing staircases...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{authorities}} {{define the}} <b>leading</b> <b>leg</b> in the singular form {{as the last}} to leave the ground before {{the one or two}} periods of suspension within each stride.

Because in some animals the gallop has two moments of suspension, some authorities recognize a lead in each pair of legs, fore and hind.

40|$|Introduction:Gait {{initiation}} {{requires the}} generation of propulsive ankle forces. These are produced by decoupling the centre of mass (CoM) and centre of pressure (CoP). The way able-bodied and transfemoral amputees use this decoupling during gait initiation has not been quantified yet. This pilot study aims to assess the usefulness of a new variable to quantify this decoupling, and to explore possible attributive mechanisms. Methods:Seven able-bodied and one transfemoral amputee were included. Gait initiation at both self selected walking speed and maximum walking speed were studied. Measurements were done using a six infrared Vicon camera system and two forceplates. Results:During the trials at higher walking speed, able-bodied achieved significantly larger decoupling {{when compared to the}} self-selected walking speed. In addition an increase in the posterior shift of the CoP, push-off power and step length were seen. The transfemoral amputee subject also showed a larger decoupling at the maximal walking speed. In the <b>leading</b> prosthetic <b>leg</b> condition the other variables showed similar results when compared with able-bodied. In the <b>leading</b> intact <b>leg,</b> an increase in step length was observed. Discussion:The introduced variable seems useful in describing the decoupling of the CoM and CoP during the gait initiation process. An exploratory analysis identified possible attributive mechanisms for increasing the decoupling. Future research should include a higher number of participants to investigate the relationship between the described mechanisms and the decoupling...|$|R

40|$|The torque {{generated}} by a rotating joint comprises the useful force exerted by the joint on the external environment, and both the magnitude and distribution of torque through the step cycle during walking are important variables in understanding the mechanics of walking. The mechanics of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) and snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) during walking were modelled to examine the relative roles of flexor versus extensor apodeme–muscle complexes, investigate which legs of these decapods likely contribute the greatest to locomotion, determine scaling effects of torque generation, and assess the relative roles of various model variables on torque production. Force generated {{along the length of}} the apodeme by the muscle was modelled based on apodeme surface area, muscle stress, and muscle fibre pinnation angle. Torque was then calculated from this estimated force and the corresponding moment arm. The flexor apodeme–muscle complex is calculated to generate consistently greater forces than the extensor, and generally this results in flexor torque being larger than extensor, though the snow crab does illustrate the opposite in two of its legs. This greater torque generation in flexion suggests that, in addition to the pushing of the trailing legs, the pulling action of the <b>leading</b> <b>legs</b> may play a significant role, at least during lateral walking. Leg 4 of both species appears to generate greater torques and thus provide the greatest forces for locomotion. Torque generation as a function of body size show...|$|R
