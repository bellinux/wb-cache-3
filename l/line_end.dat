5|$|The ARS had the Blue <b>Line</b> <b>end</b> at Addison Road. However, {{sports fans}} {{continually}} {{argued for a}} three-mile (5km) extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland. On February 27, 1997, the WMATA board approved construction of the extension. By the time the extension opened in 2004, professional basketball and hockey had relocated to a new arena atop the Gallery Place Station and the Capital Centre was replaced with a shopping mall. However, the extension still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is {{within walking distance of}} the FedExField football stadium. The extension cost $456 million.|$|E

2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the <b>line</b> <b>end</b> leads to <b>line</b> <b>end</b> shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip printability are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of opposite polarity. In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E
2500|$|A candlepin bowling lane, almost {{identical}} to a tenpin bowling lane, has an approach area of [...] for the player to bowl from, and then the lane proper, a maple surface approximately [...] wide, bounded on either side by a gutter (or [...] "channel", or trough.) The lane is separated from the approach by a [...] "foul line" [...] common to almost all bowling sports, which must not be crossed by players. At {{the far end of}} the lane are the pins, [...] from the foul line to the center of the headpin (or pin #1), placed by a machine called a pinsetter which occupies space both above and behind the pins. Unlike a tenpin lane, which has a level surface all the way from the foul <b>line</b> <b>end</b> of the lane's approach to the back end of the lanebed's [...] "pin deck", a candlepin lane has a hard-surfaced [...] "pin plate" [...] where the pins are set up, with the pin plate depressed [...] below the lanebed forward of it. The pin plate can be made from hard-surfaced metal, [...] "phenolic", [...] "high density plastic", or a [...] "synthetic" [...] material. Behind the pin plate area of a candlepin lane is a well-depressed [...] "pit" [...] area for the felled pins and balls to fall into. A heavy rubber backstop, faced with a black curtain, catches the flying pins and balls so they may drop into the pit. Generally there is seating behind the approach area for teammates, spectators, and score keeping.|$|E

5000|$|A {{very curious}} and {{interesting}} peculiarity {{of a certain}} sort of Irish verse is a desire to end a second line with a word with a syllable more than that which ends the first, {{the stress of the}} voice being thrown back a syllable in the last word of the second line. Thus, if the first <b>line</b> <b>end</b> with an accented monosyllable, the second line will end with a dissyllabic word accented on its first syllable, or if the first <b>line</b> <b>end</b> with a dissyllable accented on its penultimate the second line will end with a trisyllable accented on its ante-penultimate.

5000|$|The {{two most}} visible {{benefits}} of OPC are correcting linewidth differences seen between features in regions of different density (e.g., center vs. {{edge of an}} array, or nested vs. isolated lines), and <b>line</b> <b>end</b> shortening (e.g., gate overlap on field oxide).
