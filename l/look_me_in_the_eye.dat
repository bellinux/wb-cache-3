500|$|In April 2002, Hewson {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of an effort which {{delivered}} over a million postcards demanding that the facility be shut down; recipients included British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, and Norman Askew, head of British Nuclear Fuels Limited. (The message to the first said, [...] "Tony, <b>look</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and tell me I'm safe.") She personally delivered a giant postcard to Blair at 10Downing Street. The Shut Sellafield Campaign had its postcards stocked in Superquinn and Dunnes Stores supermarkets, and Hewson publicly engaged Tesco when they refused to do the same. The campaign was backed by celebrities, including Ronan Keating and Samantha Mumba, and Hewson made many newspaper and radio appearances on its behalf. It was the first prolonged exposure Hewson had to the public eye, after two decades of mostly being focused upon maintaining her privacy. Her continued activism also meant that she too would not always be around for the couple's children.|$|E

Parsons, who plays Sheldon, has read John Elder Robison's memoir <b>Look</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> {{about his life}} with Asperger syndrome, and said that: [...] "A {{majority}} of what I read in that book touched on aspects of Sheldon". He also stated that [...] "the way [...] brain works, it's so focused on the intellectual topics at hand that thinking he's autistic is an easy leap for people watching the show to make".|$|E

[...] Groove Armada headlined Uber Cool festival at Jersey Live on 3 September. The duo embarked on a series of secretive [...] "living room" [...] sets, performing intimately across the country for audiences of close friends. Little information was given about these private performances, but the tour kicked off in Brighton in late January, 2011.|$|E

At the moment Sheriff Smutzer confronted him, and, before a word was uttered by the lawman, Lamphere exclaimed, [...] "Did Widow Gunness and the kids get out all right?" [...] He was then told about the fire, but he denied having {{anything}} to do with it, claiming that he was not near the farm when the blaze occurred. A youth, John Solyem, was brought forward. He said that he had been watching the Gunness place and that he saw Lamphere running down the road from the Gunness house just before the structure erupted in flames. Lamphere snorted to the boy: [...] "You wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and say that!" ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{where your}} {{behavior}} was remarkable, where the affair begins to touch my imagination, {{was that you}} yourself presently put the whole business before me. Alone in the schoolroom, {{you seem to have}} come to some realization of the extraordinary dreadfulness of your behavior. Such moments happen in the lives of all small boys; they happened to me times enough, to my dead father, to that grandfather of the portrait which is now in my study, to his father and his, and so on through long series of Strattons, back to inarticulate, shock-haired little sinners slinking fearfully away from the awful wrath, the bellowings and limitless violence of the hairy Old Man of the herd. The bottom goes out of your heart then, you are full of a conviction of sin. So far you did but carry on the experience of the race. But to ask audience of me, to come and <b>look</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> to say you wanted my advice on a pressing matter, that I think marks almost a new phase in the long developing history of father and son.

I had met Edi--Miss Calder that is--before I came that morning, and there were things which made me look upon her as free; and, thinking that, I let my mind dwell on her. Then you said she wasn't free, but was promised to you, and that was the worst knock I've had for a time. It clean put me off, and I made a fool of myself for some days, and it's a mercy I'm not in Berwick gaol. Then by chance I met her again--on my soul, Jock, it was chance for me--and when I spoke of you she laughed at the thought. It was cousin and cousin, she said; but as for her not being free, or you being more to her than a friend, it was fool's talk. So you see, Jock, I was not so much to blame, after all: the more so as she promised that she would let you see by her conduct that you were mistaken in thinking that you had any claim upon her. You must have noticed that she has hardly had a word for you for these last two weeks." ...|$|E
