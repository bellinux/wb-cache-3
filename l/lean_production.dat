Attenborough's fist major credited role was provided in Brian Desmond Hurst's The Hundred Pound Window (1944) playing Tommy Draper who helps rescue his accountant father who has taken a wrong turn in life. Attenborough's film career had, however, began in 1942 in an uncredited role as a sailor deserting his post under fire in the Noël Coward/David <b>Lean</b> <b>production</b> In Which We Serve (his name and character were accidentally omitted from the original release-print credits), a role which would help to type-cast him for many years as a spiv or coward in films like London Belongs to Me (1948), Morning Departure (1950) and his breakthrough role as Pinkie Brown in John Boulting's film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel Brighton Rock (1947), a part that he had previously played to great acclaim at the Garrick Theatre in 1942.|$|E

In this project, guidelines for the implementation of {{lean manufacturing}} were developed using data collected from multiple sources. One of these sources were company visitations conducted at Desta Power Matla (DPM) in Johannesburg and Bosch SA in Brits. In addition, interviews were conducted with an expert in the field of lean manufacturing, ECSA-accredited professionals in the field, academics in industrial engineering and workers who use lean manufacturing. The significance of this study lies in assisting employees in understanding <b>lean</b> manufacturing <b>production</b> and then developing and implementing guidelines for its implementation. The study also brings to the fore the role of the individual worker in acquiring knowledge about and an understanding of lean manufacturing guidelines.

It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing [...] "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that [...] "the wife-killing jokes of [...] "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record."

Hoogendoorn and Van Praag (2012) use a randomised control trial on Dutch students {{to show a}} positive effect of migrant diversity on team performance (when over 50 % of the team are foreign-born). Parrotta et al. (2014 a) and Trax et al. (2012) both identify causal effects for firm level data, using instruments and GMM estimation respectively. The former find that ethnic diversity helps raise TFP in Danish firms operating in trade-intensive sectors, suggesting that diaspora externalities may explain the link. The latter find strong spillover effects from workforce diversity (measured by nationality) to German firm-level productivity. They also find spillovers from diverse firms to other firms in the area, raising area-level productivity. Brunow and Blien (2011), also working with German data, find negative links from skilled migrants to firms’ employment; they interpret this as evidence of productivity gains (<b>leaner</b> <b>production</b> functions).|$|R

40|$|The {{date of receipt}} and {{acceptance}} will be inserted by the editor Abstract Lean Manufacturing often simply referred to as Lean is a process management philosophy that aims to improve {{the way in which}} products are manufactured. It does this through identifying and removing waste and creating a smooth transition between stages in the production process. To a large extent, it relies on visual and simple mechanical aids to assist in improving manufacturing e ectiveness. However, when it comes to combining several aspects of Lean or when dealing with complex environments, quantitative modelling becomes essential to achieve the full bene ts of Lean. In this paper, we show through two detailed case studies how various aspects of Lean can be supported using (constraint-based) scheduling tools. One study concerns a planning support tool to evaluate di erent Lean initiatives; the other supports the day-to-day scheduling of a complex, <b>Leaned</b> <b>production</b> process Key word...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} in modular {{automation}} systems and their virtual engineering is presented. The new approach is aimed {{to provide support}} for the reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) approach to automation. Manufacturing industries are moving {{to the concept of}} RMS to fulfill the great demand to deliver greater levels of product customisation at a higher quality and at reduced cost. RMS allows the manufacturing companies to quickly implement innovative design changes in their products and produce a greater number of product variants on <b>leaner</b> <b>production</b> lines with shorter times to market. The aim of this research is to enable production machines to be more easily and cost effectively built and subsequently reconfigurable through the adoption of a component-based approach to their implementation utilising virtual manufacturing tools. It is proposed that through the decomposition of manufacturing machines into standardized mechanisms and their associated data structures, a RMS can be designed and implemented. Research conducted at Loughborough University into the development of concepts and tools to support the global engineering of component-based reconfigurable manufacturing automation systems in the automotive production domain is described in this paper. A collaborative framework to integrate and coordinate the various engineering activities of globally distributed engineering teams involved in the design, implementation, operation and diagnosis of production machinery is also described...|$|R
50|$|The {{theory of}} the Information Age is deeply rooted in {{organization}} theory. This {{may come as a}} surprise since Manuel Castells is perhaps more readily associated with either the study of the Internet, cities and regions, or social movements. There are two points to be made about the parallels with organization theory. First, Castells sees himself as picking up Max Weber's mantle in both his use of historical sociology and in his style of theory. Second, the informational economy is not the direct result of the rise of new ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies). Rather, it is the convergence of those technologies with an older and autonomous process of network forms of organizing with their focus on flexibility and adaptability as key modes of organizing. This is a shift that organization theorists have been discussing and documenting since the appearance of open systems perspectives in the 1960s. Castells documents how the 1970s marked a shift towards new organizational forms; these changes were parallel to the rise of new information technologies, but not dependent on them because the changes emerged to deal with economic uncertainties rooted in the increasing globalization of trade and the structural crises of capitalism in the 1970s; the network enterprise is focused on <b>leaner</b> <b>production</b> and altered relations to labor.|$|R
