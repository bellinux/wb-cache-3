40|$|In Germany the {{sustainability}} of fiscal policy is determined to a substantial part by the federal states (Bundeslaender). Their portion of the public debt amounts to nearly 40 percent. Econometric tests show that the fiscal policy of the federal states taken collectively is not sustainable. The requirement for fiscal sustainability is fulfilled only by two western Laender, Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia, and one eastern <b>Land</b> (<b>Saxony).</b> Furthermore, it is shown that the constitutional "golden rule" stipulating that borrowing should not exceed investment expenditures does not ensure the solvency of the states. This holds for theoretical reasons but also {{because there is a}} lack of clarity and enforceability. Finally, it is argued that the commitment of subnational governments to sustainable public finances could be strengthened by invigorating state-level tax and expenditure autonomy.

In its building application, Arado was represented by a building commissioner of the Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production (RMfRuK) based in Dresden.

5000|$|Following the {{downfall}} of Henry the Lion (11291195, Duke of Saxony 11421180), and the subsequent splitting of the Saxon tribal duchy into several territories, {{the name of the}} Saxon duchy was transferred to the lands of the Ascanian family. This led to the differentiation between Lower <b>Saxony,</b> <b>lands</b> settled by the Saxon tribe and Upper <b>Saxony,</b> the <b>lands</b> belonging to the House of Wettin. Gradually, the latter region became known as [...] "Saxony", ultimately usurping the name's original meaning. The area formerly known as Upper Saxony now lies in Central Germany.|$|R

The parties reached a settlement in 1957.|$|R
50|$|Lothair died in 1137, and Richenza moved {{swiftly to}} ensure the <b>lands</b> of <b>Saxony</b> went to her son-in-law, Duke Henry the Proud. On Pentecost the {{following}} year, however, the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire convened in Bamberg to elect Conrad III King of the Romans. Conrad vested the Ascanian count Albert the Bear with Saxony and Henry died soon after, {{in the autumn of}} 1139. Richenza fought hard for the inheritance of her grandson Henry the Lion, seeing to his education, and pushing for his right to be regarded as the heir to the Saxon duchy. Young Henry was finally appointed Duke in 1142; his mother Gertrude ruled as regent until his majority. Richenza however did not live to see her grandson succeed to the duchy. She died in 1141 and was buried next to her husband Emperor Lothair and her son-in-law Duke Henry the Proud in the Imperial Cathedral at Königslutter. Her grave goods included a simple and elegant lead crown.|$|R
50|$|Originally the {{territory}} {{belonged to the}} Duchy of Saxony but in 1180, after the imperial ban had been imposed on the Welf prince, Henry the Lion, he lost his ducal <b>lands</b> in <b>Saxony</b> and Bavaria. However, in 1235, Henry's grandson, Otto the Child, was promoted {{to the rank of}} prince {{as a result of the}} reconciliation between the Houses of Hohenstaufen and Welf and was given the allodial estates of the family claimed by them in the area between Lüneburg and Brunswick as the new and independent Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In the region west of Hanover, the Welfs had but few allodial possessions and so that area was disputed between the House of Welf and the bishops of Hildesheim and Minden. It was largely ruled by comital dynasties, such as the counts of Wölpe in the northwest, the counts of Hallermund in the southwest and the counts of Rhoden in the west and in Hanover.|$|R
5000|$|During the war, Stinnes {{extended}} his activities in Hamburg, and in 1916 he bought up the Woermann and the East African steamship lines. In these new undertakings, he became {{associated with the}} two greatest German shipping companies, the Hamburg-American Line and the North German Lloyd. His Hamburg interests continued to multiply in something like geometrical progression. He purchased half a dozen <b>landed</b> estates in <b>Saxony</b> to supply timber for pit props. At Flensburg in Schleswig, he secured control of the largest Baltic shipping concern, and proceeded {{to build a new}} fleet of ships, christening one of them the [...] "Hindenburg".|$|R
50|$|During {{these years}} Hatto did not neglect his own interests, for in 896 he secured for himself the abbey of Ellwangen and in 898 that of Lorsch. He {{assisted}} the Franconian {{family of the}} Conradines in its feud with the Babenbergs for supremacy in Franconia; after the battle of Fritzlar in 906 between the Babenbergs and Conradines he arranged for the capture and execution of Adalbert, count of Babenberg, breaking his promise of safe conduct. Hatto retained his influence during the entire reign of Louis the Child and on the king's death in 911 was prominent in securing the election of Conrad, duke of Franconia, to the vacant throne. When trouble arose between Conrad and Henry the Fowler, duke of Saxony, afterwards King Henry I, the attitude of Conrad was ascribed by the Saxons {{to the influence of}} Hatto, who wished to prevent Henry from securing authority in Thuringia, where the see of Mainz had extensive possessions. He was accused of complicity in a plot to murder Henry, who in return ravaged the archiepiscopal <b>lands</b> in <b>Saxony</b> and Thuringia.|$|R
