50|$|Prakash {{is known}} to have done {{extensive}} research in structural homology of seed proteins and the association-dissociation and denaturation profiles of these proteins. His work is reported to have assisted in the understanding of the behaviour of several seed proteins from a stability perspective and revealed more about their structural biology. His research findings have been documented by way of over 200 articles published in CFTRI publications and other peer reviewed national and international journals. His researches are known to have wide-ranging applications in commercial food industry and he holds 50 patents, some of them on preserved sugar cane juice, coconut sap (Neera) and baked snacks. Besides, he has written six books and 20 review chapters; <b>Leafy</b> <b>spices,</b> a reference guide on the botanical and agricultural aspects of agro-products yielding essential oils of <b>leafy</b> <b>spices,</b> is one among them. During his tenure as the head of CFTRI, he established the Advanced School of Protein Chemistry and Technology, for advanced research. His contributions are also reported behind the CFTRI initiative to supply 200,000 food packages to the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indian coasts, along with other areas.|$|E
40|$|Traditional leafy {{vegetables}} represent inexpensive but high quality nutritional sources, {{for the poor}} {{segment of the population}} especially where malnutrition is wide spread. The objectives of this research were a) to identify and document the traditional <b>leafy</b> vegetables and <b>spices</b> of Ebonyi State, and b) to assess their nutritional values with a view of enhancing their selection as components of cooked food. Market and field surveys were carried out for traditional <b>leafy</b> vegetables and <b>spices</b> in three major clans in Ebonyi North senatorial zone, Ebonyi State: Izzi, Izhia and Ngbo clans. Informal interviews were also conducted with some indigenes on the vegetables and spices identified, including where, when and how they were obtained for sale in the markets. Finally, proximate and Mineral content analysis of three of the traditional {{leafy vegetables}} was done to know their nutritional as well as mineral content. Results identified twenty-seven traditional leafy vegetables and five spices from 23 plant families. 46. 7 % of the plant collections were seen and collected from the wild, while 40 % were cultivated. 33. 3 % of the leafy vegetables were tree species, 30 % wer...|$|R
40|$|Humans can ingest gram {{amounts of}} plant {{secondary}} metabolites daily through diet. Many of these phytochemicals are bioactive beyond our current understanding because they act through weak negative biological feedback mechanisms, undetectable in vitro. Homeostatic-type assessments {{shed light on}} the evolutionary implications of the human diet from plants, giving rise to the metabolic plant feedback hypothesis. The hypothesis states that ancient diets rich in carbohydrates coincide with bulk dietary phytochemicals that act as nonspecific inhibitors of metabolic and inflammatory processes. Consequently, food-derived phytochemicals are likely to be equally effective as herbal medicines for these indications. In addition to the ubiquitous flavonoids, terpenoids, and fatty acids in the diet, the likely impact of chronic chlorophyll ingestion on human health is discussed, and data on its modulation of blood glucose levels are presented. A major deduction of this hypothesis is that starchy diets lacking plant secondary metabolites are associated with multimorbidity (lifestyle diseases) including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It is proposed that the intake of <b>leafy</b> vegetables, <b>spices,</b> and herbal remedies rich in phytochemicals matches the transition and genetic adaptation to early agriculture, playing a compensatory role in the mismatch of old genes and new diets...|$|R
