40|$|BACKGROUND The {{cardinal}} sign of airway obstruction stridor {{is well known}} to all medical practitioners. It may {{be defined as the}} presence of hoarse, high pitched, noisy respiration resulting from the turbulent passage of air through a narrow airway. Since stridor is nearly a manifestation of a disorder, which maybe mild or extremely grave, the process underlying the cause should be sought in every case. The investigation of an infant with stridor calls for various ancillary methods of examination in addition to clinical assessment. Though uncommon, managing a child with noisy breathing is seldom easy. A detailed history and a precise and meticulous examination are required for managing a stridulous child. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients attending ENT and Paediatric Department were included in the study. After taking a detailed history and examination, direct laryngoscopy was done. RESULTS 24 patients with stridor were studied. Of which, acute <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> were 14 cases, laryngomalacia 3 cases, foreign body bronchus 2 cases.

40|$|Parainfluenza viruses are {{important}} causes of respiratory disease in {{both children and}} adults. In particular, they are the major cause of the serious childhood illness croup (<b>laryngotracheobronchitis).</b> The infections produced by parainfluenza viruses {{are associated with the}} accumulation of ions and fluid in the respiratory tract. It is not known, however, whether this accumulation is because of a direct effect of the viruses on ion and fluid transport by the respiratory epithelium. Here we show that a model parainfluenza virus (the Sendai virus), in concentrations observed during respiratory infections, activates Cl- secretion and inhibits Na+ absorption across the tracheal epithelium. It does so by binding to a neuraminidase-insensitive glycolipid, possibly asialo-GM 1, triggering the release of ATP, which then acts in an autocrine fashion on apical P 2 Y receptors to produce the observed changes in ion transport. These findings indicate that fluid accumulation in the respiratory tract associated with parainfluenza virus infection is attributable, at least in part, to direct effects of the virus on ion transport by the respiratory epithelium...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY One {{hundred and}} ten {{children}} were studied 9 years after each {{had been in}} hospital for croup. They were evaluated with a questionnaire, physical examination, allergy skin testing, pulmonary function tests, and a histamine inhalation challenge. Fifty-seven of them had recurrent episodes of croup, and 33 were defined as allergic. The association between allergy and recurrent croup was highly significant. Airways hyper-reactivity was found in 23 of them, and was associated with allergy and recurrent croup. The group of children {{with a history of}} recurrent croup could be distinguished from the group with one or two episodes by male predominance, onset of the disease at a younger age, familial predisposition, a significantly greater association with allergy and airways hyper-reactivity, slightly lower expiratory flow rates in pulmonary function tests, and a tendency towards the subsequent development of asthma. Viral croup (acute <b>laryngotracheobronchitis)</b> is a common childhood respiratory infection charac-terised by inspiratory stridor, hoarse voice, and barking cough.

40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{randomized controlled}} trial of amoxycillin, co-trimoxazole, and placebo {{was conducted on}} 197 children presenting with presumed viral respiratory infections. Routine throat swabs were taken to exclude streptococcal diseases. The three disease categories studied [...] nasopharyngitis, pharyngotonsillitis, and bronchitis (including <b>laryngotracheobronchitis)</b> [...] showed a generally similar pattern of resolution irrespective of treatment. Nevertheless, seven out of 66 children receiving placebo were withdrawn from the trial with unremitting symptoms or complications thought to require antimicrobial treatment. Only two of 56 children receiving amoxycillin and none of 75 receiving co-trimoxazole were withdrawn. Three other children receiving amoxycillin and three receiving placebo were seen during the trial but further treatment was not thought to be necessary. Thus the return consultation rate in children receiving placebo therapy was 15 % compared with 4 % for those receiving antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobial treatment was associated with less nasal discharge on the eighth day of treatment. Placebo treatment allowed an earlier return to normal activity. There was {{a high incidence of}} possible side effects on all regimens including placebo.

We included randomized controlled trials with or without blinding. All studies treating children with a clinical diagnosis of croup with warm or cool humidified air delivered by steam or humidified tent whether inpatients, attenders at the Emergency Department or in the community were eligible. Main results. Three studies in emergency settings provided data on 135 patients with moderate croup for the main outcome (croup score). The combined results from 20 to 60 minutes in the three studies marginally favoured the treatment group with a weighted standardized mean difference of ? 0. 14 (95 % confidence interval = ? 0. 75 to 0. 47). No outcomes were significantly different between the groups. Conclusions. The croup score of children managed in an emergency setting with mild to moderate croup probably does not improve greatly with inhalation of humidified air.

40|$|Hoarseness, {{whooping}} cough and strider are {{elements of a}} syndrome of upper airway obstruction. In childhood, acute <b>laryngotracheobronchitis</b> Is by far rile commonest cause of this syndrome. Yet, the differential diagnosis includes a number of rare and severe entities. In many cases, the traditional distinction between viral and spasmodic types is not possible. The value of humidifying therapy has nor been established. In severe cases, nebulized adrenaline is of benefit bur should be reserved for hospital. The effect lasts only two hours and at times a rebound effect is observed. It is now realized that some patients treated with adrenaline can safely be discharged after a {{two to three hours}} observation. There is a large body of evidence that all children arriving at the emergency department with croup should receive steroids without delay. Tills policy results in a much better outcome, with important reduction in hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and incubations.

40|$|Tracheostomy is more {{hazardous}} {{in children}} than in adults, and carries special risks {{in the very}} young. The past 20 years have seen a large shift in the age distribution of tracheostomy. Whereas formerly the operation was done largely for management of epiglottitis and <b>laryngotracheobronchitis,</b> today the prime indication is subglottic stenosis in infants consequent upon intubation for respiratory distress syndrome and prematurity. We have reviewed experience with 57 tracheostomies in 56 children under 12 years old managed from a university hospital. All operations were done as elective procedures, in standard fashion, by otolaryngologists. Forty (70 %) were in children under 1 year old, the indications being upper airways obstruction (41), failed extubation (11), and long-term assisted ventilation (5). Subglottic stenosis was the commonest cause of obstruction (21 operations). In 91. 4 accumulated years with a tracheostomy there were 11 complications related to tracheostomy, one of which (a blocked tube) was fatal. Thirty-nine children were decannulated, the mean duration of cannulation being 21 months. In this series we suggest that the low morbidity and mortality rates were due to management by otolaryngologists; to postoperative intensive care; and, for the majority cared for at home, to careful education of parents and visits by specialist nurses...|$|E
40|$|Despite rapidly {{increasing}} measles immunization coverage in Harare city, measles remains endemic, and regular outbreaks occur.

Of 4357 cases of measles seen at primary health care centres and hospitals in Harare during the outbreak, 1399 (32 %) were severe or involved complications that required hospital admission. The peak incidence occurred among under- 2 -year-olds, followed by that among 5 - 7 -year-olds. Poor nutritional status was significantly more frequent among children who were hospitalized and among those who died.

Here, we describe vaccine testing in healthy 3 - to 6 -year-old hPIV- 1 -sero-positive children in a dose escalation study. One dose of the vaccine (5 105, 5 106, or 5 107 50 %egg infectious doses) was deliv-ered by the intranasal route to each study participant. The vaccinewaswell tolerated by all the study participants. Therewas no sign of vaccine virus replication in the airway in any participant.

No specific vaccine or an antiviral drug is currently approved for treatment of HPIV- 2 infections. In this project, a library of 14400 diverse compounds had been screened for anti-HPIV- 2 activities in cultures of African green monkey kidney cells. All compounds that inhibited the virus induced syncytium-forming activity in these cells were considered as hit compounds. Three hit compounds showed moderate anti-HPIV- 2 activity characterized by the IC 50 values of 20 µM and selectivity indices of approximately 5. This suggests that the antiviral activity of these compounds was due to targeting activities of cellular rather than viral components. Another hit compound, referred to as compound 5, showed anti-HPIV- 2 activity that was manifested as a reduction of area of the virus-induced plaques in cells at not cytotoxic concentrations. Interestingly, this compound did not inhibit initial infection nor the virus production in infected cells as revealed by the time-of-addition assay. Moreover, it showed no direct the virus-inactivating (virucidal activity) against HPIV- 2 particles. However, relatively short pre-treatment (4 hours) of the cells with compound 5 prior to the virus infection was sufficient for its plaque size-reducing activity suggesting that anti-HPIV- 2 activity of compound 5 was due to targeting activities of cellular rather than viral components.

Over the next three days, the child had increasing stridor and was admitted and again treated with racemic adrenaline and a four-day course of oral dexamethasone. She was subsequently discharged. White lesions were noted on the tongue and were treated with topical nystatin. Four days later, the child presented to the emergency room with recurrence of stridor and fever and new onset of drooling. She had a respiratory rate of 44 breaths/min, heart rate of 170 beats/min, blood pressure of 90 / 58 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 98 % and temperature of 39. 6 °C. She was in moderate respiratory distress, with marked stridor. Examination of the oropharynx revealed ulcerative lesions on the anterior tongue, hard and soft palate, and posterior pharynx. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 18. 1 x 109 /L (74 % neutrophils, 23 % lymphocytes and 3 % monocytes). Other hematological values were normal. A laryngobronchoscopy was performed and revealed that the mucosa of the laryngopharynx was studded with discrete white lesions on a background of mucosal inflammation with severe reduction of airway calibre requiring intubation (Figure 1). The subglottis and the tracheobronchial tree were severely inflamed but had no discrete lesions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Croup (<b>laryngotracheobronchitis)</b> is {{a common}} cause of upper airway {{obstruction}} in children with a peak incidence of 60 per 1000 child years in those aged between one and two years. It is characterised by hoarseness, a barking cough, and inspiratory stridor. These symptoms are thought to occur {{as a result of}} oedema of the larynx and trachea, which have been triggered by a recent viral infection. Para influenza virus type 1 is the agent most commonly identified in cases of croup. Severe cases are admitted to hospital and steroid treatment is established to reduce disease severity. Treatment with humidified air was previously widely used and is still commonly recommended as home treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of humidified air in the treatment of croup. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006) and EMBASE (1990 to January 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving children suffering from croup treated with humidified air. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently identified potentially relevant abstracts identified from the search and then assessed the full papers for inclusion and methodological quality. Outcome measures included mortality, ventilation, admission to hospital, re-contact with medical services, number of days off school and relief of symptoms; these were separately analysed for the week following treatment. Data extraction was performed by the two authors then entered by one and checked by the second author. Missing data were obtained from trails authors where possible. Data were analysed using Review Manager version 4. 2. Sensitivity and sub-group analysis were not possible due to the paucity of trials. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies in emergency settings provided data on 135 patients with moderate croup for the main outcome (croup score). The combined results from 20 to 60 minutes in the three studies marginally favoured the treatment group with a weighted standardised mean difference of - 0. 14 (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 75 to 0. 47). No other outcomes were significantly different between the groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The croup score of children managed in an emergency setting with mild to moderate croup probably does not improve greatly with inhalation of humidified air. Further research is needed in primary care settings, using a wider range of more sensitive outcome measures...|$|E
