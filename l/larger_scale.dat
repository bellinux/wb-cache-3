40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} (hybrid) <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> normal space and prove coarse geometric analogues of Urysohn's Lemma and the Tietze Extension Theorem for these spaces, where continuous maps are replaced by (continuous and) slowly oscillating maps. To do so, we first prove a general form {{of each of these}} results {{in the context of a}} set equipped with a neighbourhood operator satisfying certain axioms, from which we obtain both the classical topological results and the (hybrid) <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> results as corollaries. We prove that all metric spaces are hybrid <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> normal, and characterize those locally compact abelian groups which (as hybrid <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> spaces) are hybrid <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> normal.

40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>scale</b> {{structures}} play {{an important}} role in self-organization of drift wave turbulence. <b>Large</b> <b>scale</b> perturbations of plasma flow and magnetic field are spontaneously generated in generic electromagnetic drift wave turbulence via the action of Reynolds stress and electromotive force. Initial <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> perturbations are amplifed by positive feedback due to the modulations of wave packets by the shearing effect of the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> flow and/or by the perturbed <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> magnetic field. As a result, the propagation of small scale wave packets is accompanied by the instability of a low frequency, long wavelength components. Anomalous transport due to drift wave turbulence may also be unstable with respect to the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> perturbations of plasma profile. In this case the instability occurs as a result of a positive feedback response of the anomalous flux to the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> variations of plasma temperature...|$|R

According to “Code of design for low expansion foam extinguishing system” and relative study results abroad, the fire fighting systems are calculated and designed to deal with full surface fires of <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> floating roof tanks. It is shown that designing parameters provided by API are more credible and large foam monitors act as the main fire extinguish facilities. The fire water supplying system is designed according to “Fire prevention code of petrochemical enterprise design”.

40|$|Abstract. Superparameterization is a {{multiscale}} numerical method wherein solutions of prog-nostic equations {{for small}} scale processes on local domains embedded within the computational grid of a <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> model are computed {{and used to}} force the <b>large</b> <b>scales.</b> It was developed initially in the atmospheric sciences, but stands on its own as a nascent numerical method for the simulation of multiscale phenomena. Here we develop a stochastic version of superparameterization in a difficult one dimensional test problem involving self-similarly collapsing solitons, dispersive waves, and a tur-bulent inverse cascade of energy from small to <b>large</b> <b>scales.</b> We derive the nonlinear model equations by imposing a formal scale separation between resolved <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> and unresolved small scales; this allows the use of subdomains embedded within the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> grid to describe the local small scale processes. To decrease the computational cost, we make a systematic quasi-linear stochastic approximation of the nonlinear small scale equations and use the statistical mean of the nonlinear small scale forcing (the covariance) in the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> equations. The stochastic approximation al-lows the embedded domains to be formally infinite (unrealistically <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> are suppressed on the embedded domains). Further simplifications allow us to precompute the small scale forcing terms in the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> equations as functions of the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> variables only, which results in significan...|$|R
