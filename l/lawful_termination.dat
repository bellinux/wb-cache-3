50|$|Some of India's most {{controversial}} labour laws concern the procedures for dismissal {{contained in the}} Industrial Disputes Act 1947. A workman who has been employed {{for over a year}} can only be dismissed if permission is sought from and granted by the appropriate government office. Additionally, before dismissal, valid reasons must be given, and there is a wait of at least two months for government permission, before a <b>lawful</b> <b>termination</b> can take effect. Redundancy pay must be given, set at 15 days' average pay for each complete year of continuous service. An employee who has worked for 4 years in addition to various notices and due process, must be paid a minimum of the employee's wage equivalent to 60 days before retrenchment, if the government grants the employer a permission to lay off.|$|E
50|$|The Employment Protection act regulates Termination of {{employment}} and minimum notice times, priority of rehiring, and <b>lawful</b> reasons for <b>termination</b> (restricted to redundancy and personal reasons like misconduct). In case of termination due to redundancy, the law requires workplaces to fire their personal according {{to a list of}} seniority (turordningslista). Given similar tasks, the last employee to be hired {{will be the first to}} be fired. In the case of similar age amongst employees, priority is given to older employees.|$|R
40|$|The American Law Institute (ALI) {{has just}} {{completed}} the Restatement of the Law Third, Employment Law. Chapter 2 is entitled 2 ̆ 2 Employment Contracts: Termination. 2 ̆ 2 As the name suggests, the Chapter focuses on the law 2 ̆ 7 s difficult challenge of applying contract law to distinguish <b>lawful</b> <b>terminations</b> of employees from wrongful ones. The question is especially problematic because, on the one hand, employment law 2 ̆ 7 s long-existing default rule allows employers to terminate employees 2 ̆ 2 at will 2 ̆ 2 and without cause. Advocates of the at-will doctrine present several policies to support it, including freedom of contract and efficiency. On the other hand, employers seek to attract talented employees and, once employed, establish an 2 ̆ 2 orderly, cooperative and loyal work force. 2 ̆ 2 Toward that end, numerous judicial decisions and scholarly research reveal unsurprisingly that employers design their communications to attract employees and create loyal workers. It is no wonder, then, that contract law 2 ̆ 7 s approach to indefinite-duration employment issues includes decisions policing employer overreaching and thereby creating rules that limit employment at will. Given this clash of policies, the primary challenge for the reporters of the new employment restatement in Chapter 2 was to search the cases and identify {{the circumstances in which}} terminated employees should be entitled to legal protection, no easy task given the multitudinous and amorphous case law on employment discharge, the dynamic labor market atmosphere and, perhaps most important, contract law 2 ̆ 7 s lack of a unifying theory of its own. Related to this challenge, the ALI 2 ̆ 7 s conception of a restatement seemingly allows reporters to venture beyond describing the law (but cautiously). The reporters therefore had to decide what constitutes the appropriate mix of description and prescription in their efforts to assess the contradiction in employment policies. This essay focuses on Chapter 22 ̆ 7 s treatment of employment at will, on the one hand, and promissory estoppel and good faith, on the other, as examples of how Chapter 2 meets these challenges. The essay concludes that Chapter 2 establishes a useful framework and helpfully identifies the issues for the courts. Because promissory estoppel and good faith (and other contract doctrines) are themselves indistinct, however, Chapter 2 often cannot resolve the principle and counter-principle dilemma in particular cases and therefore cannot fully satisfy ALI 2 ̆ 7 s goal of clarifying and modernizing the law through restatements. For the same reason, I doubt that a project {{in the form of a}} restatement will be particularly helpful in enhancing employee protection if the playing field is uneven...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{thinking}} on abortion, reflected in recent legal developments around the world, has turned from concentration upon criminality {{in favor of}} female and family well-being. New laws enacted {{during the last decade}} are coming to focus upon conditions of health and social welfare of women and their existing families as indications for <b>lawful</b> <b>termination</b> of pregnancy. Regulations governing the delivery of services may be restrictive, however, so as to limit in practice access to means of safe, legal abortion made available in theory. Requirements may be imposed that only medical personnel with unduly high qualifications perform procedures, or that they be undertaken only in institutions meeting standards higher than similar health care requires. Approval procedures may be established involving second medical opinions or committees to monitor observance of the law, which may delay abortions and therefore increase their hazards. Parental and spousal consent requirements may exist in addition with the same effects, or to veto a pregnant female's request. Regulations may be employed more positively, however, to encourage contraceptive practice. A disappointment with legislative reform is that it may fail to improve circumstances if public resources are not applied to achieve the supply of services newly rendered legitimate, and illegal practice may persist...|$|E
40|$|The {{common law}} of lease sets out certain {{reciprocal}} {{rights and duties}} of lessors and lessees. It also provides for sui generis aspects such as the lessor’s hypothec {{and the protection of}} the lessee under the huur gaat voor koop rule. The relatively uncomplicated manner in which the common law has addressed specific issues pertaining to the law of lease has however been influenced by recent legislation that have an impact on various aspects of lease. The Rental Housing Act 50 of 1999 has entrenched parameters for the exercise of certain rights by the lessor and lessee and has introduced Rental Housing Tribunals to deal with unfair leasing practices. The Prevention of Illegal Eviction of and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 has radically impacted on the process that a lessor has to follow where he wishes to evict a lessee who remains in occupation of a leased premises after <b>lawful</b> <b>termination</b> of a lease agreement. Most recently the introduction of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008, which came into full operation at the end of March 2011, appears to {{have a significant impact on}} the law of lease in those instances where the Act finds application to a lease agreement. In this regard it must be observed that the Consumer Protection Act impacts on a lease agreement that falls within its scope in two ways: on the one hand section 14 of the Act which regulates fixed term agreements may find specific application to a lease agreement that falls within the scope of application of the said section. On the other hand, there are certain ‘general’ provisions of the Act that will find application generally to lease agreements that fall within the scope of application of the Act, even if they do not fall within the specific scope of application of section 14. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate how the various pieces of legislation indicated herein, impact on the common law of lease. The main focus will eventually be the impact of the Consumer Protection Act as such impact still has to manifest in practice. It will thus be endeavoured to present a holistic view of the ‘changing face of the law of lease’ in South Africa. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.
