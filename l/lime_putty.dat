25|$|The {{following}} {{is the process}} that was used when rescuing frescoes in La Fenice, a Venetian opera house, but the same process {{can be used for}} similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.|$|E
500|$|On April 19, 1999, the $1.6million, two-year {{phase two}} {{restoration}} began, scheduled for completion by May 2001. Five workers began repairing the cracks, killing biological growth, removing calcium deposits and pollution-blackened gypsum, and coating the [...] {{surface with a}} combination of <b>lime</b> <b>putty,</b> adobe cement and sand. The inoperable reflecting pool was not repaired in this phase. Although this phase was completed in 2001, its effects were not visible until the following year, when the temporary protective structure was unveiled. The repairs were expected to sustain the sculpture for about 30–50 years before any further repairs would be necessary.|$|E
5000|$|A matured <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> is [...] "thixotropic", {{meaning that}} when a <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> is {{agitated}} it changes from a putty into a more liquid state. This aids its use for mortars as it makes a mortar easier to work with. If left to stand following agitation a <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> will slowly revert from a thick liquid to a putty state.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe role {{of aging}} on {{rheological}} properties of <b>lime</b> <b>putties</b> was investigated by rotational rheometry, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and particle size distribution analyzes. Disaggregation of large clusters during aging and resulting microstructural enrichment of micron-sized particles {{was found to be}} one of the possible reasons for the continuous increment of plasticity and yield stress of <b>lime</b> <b>putties</b> during long-term aging. The extent of thixotropic and rheopectic behavior is affected by both calcination process and microstructure development during aging...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the slaking method {{on the characteristics of}} <b>lime</b> <b>putties</b> has been investigated. There has been used the same raw lime, calcined in a traditional kiln, to perform in situ traditional slaking processes as well as laboratory controlled slaking processes. The obtained <b>lime</b> <b>putties</b> were characterized using different instrumental techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), specific surface area (BET), particle size using laser dispersion and viscosity. Particle morphology using scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also studied. The amount of water used during slaking as well as the temperatures distribution give raise to differences in the particle size distribution and in the resulting hydration products.

40|$|Until the 19 th century, lime in {{construction}} renderings was used mostly as a paste. After {{the transformation of}} rock into lime, the latter was stored {{in such a way}} as to maintain its characteristics. For that purpose, tanks or big ditches were used to store lime, always covered by water to avoid its carbonation. Through this procedure, the quality of the material was guaranteed for many years. The evolution that occurred in the material’s storing processes led to a change in this procedure, i. e. the binders being used today are in most cases powdery mixtures. Lime slaking is done at the factory, with the necessary care to avoid its contact with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is not always achieved until its application in the work. In the present paper, the authors present some results concerning the mechanical behaviour of mortars made with <b>lime</b> <b>putties</b> with different maturation times. The authors also make an analysis of the microstructure of these <b>limes</b> <b>putties</b> and of each one of the mortars prepared with these materials, during the fresh phase and, later, in the hardening phase...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lime</b> <b>putty</b> {{is always}} non-hydraulic and will keep indefinitely stored under water and, {{as the name}} suggests, <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> {{is in the form}} of a putty made from just lime and water.|$|E
50|$|The slaking process {{involved}} {{in creating a}} <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> is an exothermic reaction which initially creates a liquid of a creamy consistency. This is then matured for 2 to 3 months - depending upon environmental conditions - to allow time for it to condense and mature into a <b>lime</b> <b>putty.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hydrated, non-hydraulic {{lime powder}} can be mixed {{with water to}} form <b>lime</b> <b>putty.</b> Before use putty is usually left {{in the absence of}} carbon dioxide (usually under water) to mature. Putty can be matured for as little as 24 hours or for many years; an {{increased}} maturation time improves the quality of the putty. There is an argument that a <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> which has been matured for an extended period (over 12 months) becomes so stiff {{that it is difficult to}} work.|$|E
40|$|The {{project was}} based on a design and {{construction}} of a lime kiln. The kiln was tested and described and it enabled to study the effects of traditional lime production on quality of lime. This also allowed to produce lime binders, which were commonly used in the past and were later on abandoned. Research and experimental works focused on quality of <b>lime</b> <b>putties</b> and determining the suitability of different types of previously used materials for production of lime binders. Detailed research of available resources related to the lime production was carried out. The important aim was creation of applied outputs that would be useful in practical care of historical buildings...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{the paper is the}} compilation, review and dissemination of updated scientific knowledge on lime theory and technology in the field of heritage conservation. The strong evidence of the last decade's research on the positive effect of the - not demonstrable by a chemical equation &#x 2013; 'key' missing link of the maturation process is highlighted. It is demonstrated that the exceptional perfor -mance characteristics of durable lime based mortars predominately rely on the capacity for rapid, efficient and extensive carbonation of the air-hardening phase of limes, in particular when matured (nanoparticle wet slaked) <b>lime</b> <b>putties</b> are used; and on the chemical and mechanical stability of the strength components (principally CSHs) of the hydraulic phase of limes, which is higher in their more crystalline forms of historical lime-pozzolan mixtures than in their amorphous forms of modern cements. Hence, physicochemical adhesion and cohesion bonds both at the lime matrix and at the binder/aggregate interfaces are ensured imparting minimization of cracks and durability to lime based mortars and historic masonries. The comprehensive documentation of the former leads to optimal materials and procedures to preserve our cultural heritage...|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} basement is almost completely above ground and has windows that are directly under {{those of the}} main floor above. The basement walls range in thickness from 1 to 3 feet and are constructed of rough fieldstones {{believed to have been}} excavated from the nearby fields. The basement windows are double hung-wooden sash with six-over-six panes. The water table which starts the brick construction contains relieving arches above the window openings. The water table is laid in English bond and separates the stone foundation below and the brick work of the first level above. It is unclear whether the water table is original or a later addition, but it is entirely mortared together with Portland cement, and not historically accurate <b>lime</b> based <b>putty</b> that is found in the brickwork above. Buttresses were added to the northeastern side in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{lime mortar}} is a {{combination}} of <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> and aggregate (usually sand). A typical modern lime mortar mix would be 1 part <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> to 3 parts washed, well graded, sharp sand. Other materials have been used as aggregate instead of sand. The theory is that the voids of empty space between the sand particles account for a 1/3 of the volume of the sand. The <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> when mixed at a 1 to 3 ratio, fill these voids to create a compact mortar. Analysis of mortar samples from historic buildings typically indicates a higher ratio of around 1 part lime to 2 part aggregate/sand was commonly used. A traditional coarse plaster mix also had horse hair added for reinforcing and control of shrinkage, important when plastering to wooden laths and for base (or dubbing) coats onto uneven surfaces such as stone walls where the mortar is often applied in thicker coats to compensate for the irregular surface levels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} tuckpointing {{requires}} that the excess <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> is [...] "cut" [...] away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife {{is a type of}} knife with a small sharp bent tip which allows the <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.|$|E
50|$|Frescos can be {{repaired}} by methods of detaching {{sections of the}} fresco. Surface repairs for frescos can be less invasive. Conservators can remedy cracks and minor detachments of frescos with injections of epoxy resin containing micronized silica and <b>lime</b> <b>putty.</b>|$|E
50|$|The double {{indirect}} method {{can be used}} when {{it is important to}} see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed. The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, sticky plastic or soft <b>lime</b> or <b>putty)</b> as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the {{indirect method}} described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill {{on the part of the}} operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved.This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use (patent n. 0000222556) under the name of his company, Sicis International Srl, now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl.|$|R
5000|$|Fine stuff {{mixed with}} sand {{is used for}} the setting coat. Fine stuff, or <b>lime</b> <b>putty,</b> is pure lime that has been slaked and then mixed with water to a semi-fluid consistency, and allowed to stand until it has {{developed}} into a soft paste.|$|E
5000|$|... "Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools" [...] are curved tuckpointing tools; that is, they do {{not have}} a flat bottom like the other tuckpointed tools but have a curved bottom surface which helps in {{applying}} <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> around rounded bricks. They are available in Standard and Beaded profiles so that rounded bricks can be tuckpointed.|$|E
50|$|In the 14th century, {{decorative}} plasterwork called pargeting {{was being}} used in South-East England to decorate the exterior of timber-framed buildings. This {{is a form of}} incised, moulded or modelled ornament, executed in <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> or mixtures of lime and gypsum plaster. During this same period, terracotta was reintroduced into Europe and was widely used for the production of ornament.|$|E
5000|$|Lime re-absorbs {{the carbon}} dioxide (CO2) emitted by its {{calcination}} (firing), thus partially offsetting the large amount emitted during its manufacture. The more hydraulic a lime, the less CO2 is reabsorbed during set, for example, 50% of CO2 is reabsorbed by NHL 3.5 during the set, compared to 100% of CO2 being reabsorbed by pure calcium hydroxide (fat <b>lime</b> <b>putty).</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{cornices}} and {{for setting}} {{when the second}} coat is not allowed time to dry properly, a special compound must be used. This is often gauged stuff, composed {{of three or four}} parts of <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> and one part of plaster of Paris, mixed up in small quantities immediately before use. The plaster in the material causes it to set rapidly, but if it is present in too large a proportion the work will crack in setting.|$|E
50|$|Marmorino is {{made from}} crushed marble and <b>lime</b> <b>putty,</b> which can be tinted to give {{a wide range of}} colours. This can then be applied to make many textures, from {{polished}} marble to natural stone effects. Widely used in Italy, its appeal has spread through North America especially, but now worldwide. Because of the hours of workmanship, the pricing places it in the high-end market. However, many examples can be seen in public buildings, bars, restaurants, etc.|$|E
50|$|Lime-ash is {{generally}} no longer available, so repairs and reconstruction are usually done using {{a mixture of}} <b>lime</b> <b>putty,</b> coal ash, Gypsum (Class A hemi hydrate fine casting plaster), unburnt loamy clay and burnt crushed tile. To this are added retardants such as Keratin (natural) or Sodium Citrate (manufactured). The bedding material is repaired with water reed 5 ft, or combed winter wheat which is the strongest form of straw, and chestnut laths which can be obtained in 4 ft lengths.|$|E
50|$|Dry slaking is when {{quicklime}} is slaked {{with just}} enough water to hydrate the quicklime, but remain as a powder and {{is referred to as}} hydrated lime. In wet slaking, a slight excess of water is added to hydrate the quicklime to a form referred to as <b>lime</b> <b>putty.</b> Because lime has an adhesive property with bricks and stones, it is often used as binding material in masonry works. It is also used in whitewashing as wall coat to adhere the whitewash onto the wall.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{material}} of the tombs was second-hand, some even still has pagan inscriptions on them from their previous use. Marble was used often, partially because it reflected light and was light in color. Clay bricks were the other common material that was used for structure and for decor. Roman concrete (volcanic rock, <b>lime</b> <b>putty,</b> and water — a combination which is incredibly resistant to wear) and {{a thin layer of}} stucco was spread over the walls of bare rock faces. This was not structural, only aesthetic, and was typically painted with frescoes.|$|E
50|$|On April 19, 1999, the $1.6 million, two-year {{phase two}} {{restoration}} began, scheduled for completion by May 2001. Five workers began repairing the cracks, killing biological growth, removing calcium deposits and pollution-blackened gypsum, and coating the 10000 sq ft {{surface with a}} combination of <b>lime</b> <b>putty,</b> adobe cement and sand. The inoperable reflecting pool was not repaired in this phase. Although this phase was completed in 2001, its effects were not visible until the following year, when the temporary protective structure was unveiled. The repairs were expected to sustain the sculpture for about 30-50 years before any further repairs would be necessary.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} fresco repair is the {{application}} of a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.|$|E
50|$|Non-hydraulic lime is {{primarily}} composed of (generally greater than 95%) calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2. Non-hydraulic lime {{is produced by}} first heating sufficiently pure calcium carbonate to between 954° and 1066 °C, driving off carbon dioxide to produce quicklime (calcium oxide). This is done in a lime kiln. The quicklime is then slaked - hydrated by being thoroughly mixed with enough water to form a slurry (<b>lime</b> <b>putty),</b> or with less water to produce dry powder — a hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide). Hydrated lime naturally turns back into calcium carbonate by reacting with {{carbon dioxide in the}} air, the entire process being called the lime cycle.|$|E
50|$|The park {{surrounding}} {{the house was}} extensive. An avenue extended to the southwest, and there were formal parterres to the southeast. The Kip illustration also shows a banqueting house, which survived as a ruin until 1966, when it was destroyed by vandals. An architectural drawing dated 1707 describes it as being 'after the Modell of the Duke of Ormonds at Richmond', and it consisted of two floors, the lower one a workspace and the upper serving as the dining area. Because the building was on a steep slope. both floors were accessible from ground level, and the south facade consisted of a single storey. This south facade was constructed of red rubbing bricks laid in Flemish bond with exceptionally fine jointing, consisting of {{a little less than}} 1/16 inch of slaked <b>lime</b> <b>putty.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{is the process}} that was used when rescuing frescoes in La Fenice, a Venetian opera house, but the same process {{can be used for}} similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.|$|E
5000|$|A load {{of mixed}} lime mortar may {{be allowed to}} sit as a lump for some time, without it drying out (it may get a thin crust). When ready to use, this lump may be remixed ('knocked up') again and then used. Traditionally on {{building}} sites, prior {{to the use of}} mechanical mixers, the <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> (slaked on site in a pit) was mixed with sand by a labourer who would [...] "beat and ram" [...] the mix with a [...] "larry" [...] (a wide hoe with large holes). This was then covered with sand and allowed to sit for a while (from days to weeks) - a process known as 'banking'. This lump was then remixed and used as necessary. This process cannot be done with Portland cement.|$|E
5000|$|Another similar skim coating {{is always}} {{done in a}} process called veneer plastering, {{although}} it is done slightly thicker (about 2 mm or 1/8 inch). Veneering uses a slightly different specialized setting compound ("finish plaster") that contains gypsum and <b>lime</b> <b>putty.</b> This application uses blueboard, which has special treated paper to accelerate {{the setting of the}} gypsum plaster component. This setting has far less shrinkage than the air-dry compounds normally used in drywall, so it only requires one coat. Blueboard also has square edges rather than the tapered-edge drywall boards. The tapered drywall boards are used to countersink the tape in taped jointing whereas the tape in veneer plastering is buried beneath a level surface. One coat veneer plaster over dry board is an intermediate style step between full multi-coat [...] "wet" [...] plaster and the limited joint-treatment-only given [...] "dry" [...] wall.|$|E
5000|$|Lime plaster was {{a common}} {{building}} material for wall surfaces in {{a process known as}} lath and plaster, whereby a series of wooden strips on a studwork frame was covered with a semi-dry plaster that hardened into a surface. The plaster used in most lath and plaster construction was mainly lime plaster, with a cure time of about a month. To stabilize the lime plaster during curing, small amounts of plaster of Paris were incorporated into the mix. Because plaster of Paris sets quickly, [...] "retardants" [...] were used to slow setting time enough to allow workers to mix large working quantities of <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> plaster. A modern form of this method uses expanded metal mesh over wood or metal structures, which allows a great freedom of design as it is adaptable to both simple and compound curves. Today this building method has been partly replaced with drywall, also composed mostly of gypsum plaster. In both these methods, a primary advantage of the material is that it is resistant to a fire within a room and so can assist in reducing or eliminating structural damage or destruction provided the fire is promptly extinguished.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, plaster or cement render that {{is applied}} to {{external}} brickwork on dwellings or commercial buildings can be one or two coats. In two coat render a base coat is applied with a common mix of 4 parts sand to one part cement and one part dehydrated lime and water to make a consistent mortar. Render is applied using a hawk and trowel and pushed on about 12 mm thick to begin. For two coat, some plasterers apply two full depth bands of render (one {{at the base of}} the wall and one around chest height) which are screed plumb and square and allowed to dry while applying the first coat over the remaining exposed wall. The render is then scratched to provide a key for the second coat. This method allows the rest of the wall to be rendered and screed off without the need to continually check if the second coat is plumb. Alternatively, both coats can be applied with the plasterer using a t-bar to screed the final coat until it is plumb straight and square. The first method is generally used where quality of finish is at a premium. The second method is quicker but can be several millimeters out of plumb. The second coat can be a slightly weaker mix 5/1/1, or the same as the base coat with maybe a water proofer in the mix added to the water to minimize efflorescence (rising of salts). Some plasterers used <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> in second coat instead of dehydrated lime in the render. The mortar {{is applied to}} about 5 mm thick and when the render hardens is screeded off straight. A wood float or plastic float is used to rub down the walls. Traditionally, water is splashed on walls using a coarse horsehair plasterers brush followed by immediately rubbing the float in a circular or figure 8 motion although a figure of 8 can leave marks. Many modern plasterers use a hose with a special nozzle with a fine mist spray to dampen walls when rubbing up (using a wood float to bring a consistent finish). Using a hose brings a superior finish and is more consistent in colour as there is more chance in catching the render before it has a chance to harden too much. After the work area is floated, the surface is finished with a wet sponge using the same method as floating with a wood float, bringing sand to the surface to give a smooth consistent finish.|$|E
40|$|A new {{interest}} in the preservation of mortars, plasters and decorative finishings in façades has emerged in certain European countries in the past thirty to forty years, {{with a view to}} understanding how they have evolved throughout History. There is a growing interest in learning about the composi-tion and execution techniques of original surfaces and a number of Heritage Institutions have encour-aged the systematic application of conservation in this area. Up to the XX century, limes were often used in work as <b>lime</b> <b>putty.</b> After the transformation of quick-lime into <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> the latter was stored to maintain its characteristics. Tanks or large pits were used to store the <b>lime</b> <b>putty,</b> always covered with water in order to prevent its carbonation. The quality of the material was guaranteed for many years with this process. The evolution of the storage processes for materials has led to a change in this procedure and in most cases binders are now used as powders. The influence of the maturation time of <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> has been studied. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the physical and microstructural changes on <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> due to the effect of ageing, focusing on the par-ticle size of the portlandite crystals and on the reorganization of the internal structure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> is a non-Newtonian fluid {{that can}} be either {{thixotropic}} or rheopectic depending on burning process of the lime, {{the presence of the}} quartz sand and other parameters. One of the most important <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> characteristics is its plasticity which affects its workability and use. It is possible to increase the <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> plasticity by mechanical activation. This work focuses on the effect of the mechanical activation of the <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> on its rheological behavior and on properties of lime hydrosilicate autoclaved materials. Fresh <b>lime</b> <b>putty</b> was activated in a high-speed mixer at 1000 RPM for 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes. Non-activated lime putties show rheopectic behavior. Rheopectic behavior becomes slightly more distinct after 1 min. of activation and then less distinct with increasing time of activation. After 10 min. of activation, the system shows no time-dependent properties, nor even slight thixotropic behavior. This trend can be related to process where smaller and smaller aggregates are fragmented in the suspension. The hydrosilicate materials were prepared in two series from quicklime and finely ground sand with the ratio C/S 0. 85, under hydrothermal conditions. The amount of xonotlite in hydrosilicate material increases with activation time as the increased amount of portlandite particles retards the reaction. 11. 3 Å tobermorite crystallizes more slowly and formation of xonotlite is accelerated...|$|E
