5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics {{for their new}} lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience because they {{make it easier for}} players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E
25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
500|$|The Redux version {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. They praised the game's overall atmosphere and story, but criticized the graphical update, which was considered insignificant. According to Mikel Reparaz, the game's visual update was disappointing {{as it did}} not <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the original PC version. Nevertheless, it was described as the [...] "definitive version" [...] of Last Light to play because of the inclusion {{of all of the}} previously-released downloadable content.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally intended}} to port existing Halo 3 assets to Reach and update them. For Halo 3, Bungie {{had been forced to}} shrink parts of the game to fit the game engine's constraints, but wanted to make Reach <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> its predecessors. [...] "The more we started looking into this, the more we found that realistically we could rebuild each asset from scratch with a huge increase in quality without significantly investing more time," [...] said Bungie 3D artist Scott Shepherd. [...] Texture resolution and polygon counts for models increased; the Reach assault rifle is constructed of more polygons than an entire Marine character from Halo 3. The prequel concept also gave the art team an opportunity to redesign key enemies, weapons, and elements of the series. Artists found inspiration in the original concept art for Halo: Combat Evolved; the shape for the redesigned Covenant Grunts came from a sketch that concept artist Shi Kai Wang created ten years earlier.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation had a 512 × 240 {{video mode}} which used up video memory that would {{normally}} be used for textures, but was effective in rendering shaded but untextured polygons at a sharper detail. Rubin pointed out that since the polygons on the characters were just a few pixels in size, shaded characters would <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> textured ones. Thus, polygons were emphasized over textures; this was advantageous in that it allowed the programmers more polygons {{to work with and}} allowed them to work around the PlayStation's lack of texture correction or polygon clipping. To give the game more of a resemblance to an animated cartoon, vertex animation was implemented rather than the standard skeletal animation with [...] "one-joint" [...] weighting; this allowed the programmers to use the more sophisticated three-to-four-joint weighting available in PowerAnimator. Because the PlayStation was unable to match this at runtime, the location of every vertex was stored in every frame at 30 frames a second. Gavin, Baggett, and Cerny attempted to invent assembly language vertex compressors for this manner of animation; Cerny's version was the most successful and the most complicated.|$|E
500|$|In his career, Russell {{won five}} regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965)—tied with Michael Jordan for second all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six awards. He was {{selected}} {{three times to}} the All-NBA First Teams (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960–62, 1964, 1966–68), and was a twelve-time NBA All-Star (1958–1969). Russell was elected to one NBA All-Defensive First Team. This took place during his last season (1969), {{and was the first}} season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected. In 1970, The Sporting News named Russell the [...] "Athlete of the Decade". Russell is universally seen {{as one of the best}} NBA players ever, and was declared [...] "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" [...] by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980. For his achievements, Russell was named [...] "Sportsman of the Year" [...] by Sports Illustrated in 1968. He also made all three NBA Anniversary Teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996). Russell ranked #18 on ESPN's 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century in 1999. In 2009, SLAM Magazine named Russell the #3 player of all time behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. Former NBA player and head coach, Don Nelson, described Bill Russell in a quote that says, [...] "There are two types of superstars. One makes himself look good at the expense of the other guys on the floor. But there's another type who makes the players around him <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> they are, and that's the type Russell was." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1UP.com's Garnett Lee {{rated the}} game a D-, calling the Dark Fall games [...] "woefully {{out of date}} point and click mysteries [...] Their stories play out more like an {{illustrated}} book. Screen after screen of lifeless scenes must be clicked on to find the little spot here or there that advances the plot." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote [...] "many users will have screensavers that <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Lights Out." [...] He concluded [...] "Lights Out more resembles a student project for a gaming college than a finished retail product [...] Even fans of style will want to spend their time elsewhere. As the new [...] shows, even the point and click adventure has grown some over the past decade. Lights Out has not." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite general {{symptoms}} and {{problems with the}} upper respiratory tract (such as high fever, headache, a dry irritating cough followed later by a productive cough with radiographs showing consolidation), there are in general few physical signs.

"I can't see you, dear, but I {{hope you}} <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> I do, for the yellow {{of my hair}} has washed into my eyes and the red of my cheeks is quite gone, I'm sure," [...] {{answered}} Dora, as her wet dress flopped in the breeze and the broken foot sticking up showed her that her blue boots were ruined.|$|E

6000|$|As {{they were}} announced, Mrs. Finch started {{up from a}} gilded sofa on which she had been reclining, reading a French brochure. Her dress was in the excess of the newest Parisian fashion, such as even to London eyes looked outre, and, {{as well as her}} hair, had the disordered look of being just off a journey. Her face had a worn aspect, and the colour looked fixed. Theodora, always either rigidly simple or {{appropriately}} splendid, did not like Violet to see her friend in such a condition, and could almost have shrunk from the eager greeting. 'Theodora Martindale! This is delightful! It is a real charity to look in on us to-day! Mrs. Martindale, how are you? You <b>look</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> last time I saw you.
