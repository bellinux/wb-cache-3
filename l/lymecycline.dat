Using topical products with a strong drying effect in combination with Epiduo can increase irritation.The use of adapalene/benzoyl peroxide in combination with oral antibiotics (<b>lymecycline)</b> has been studied; the combination was well tolerated and showed an improved success rate compared to those receiving only antibiotics (47.6% vs. 33.7%, P = 0.002).|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of <b>lymecycline</b> and minocycline {{in the treatment}} of acne vulgaris has been addressed. This was a multicenter, randomized, investigator-masked, parallel group trial involving patients with moderate to moderately severe acne vulgaris, receiving either <b>lymecycline</b> or minocycline for 12 weeks. Efficacy and safety evaluation was performed at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12 and completed by a pharmacoeconomic analysis including week 12 data. One hundred and thirty-six patients were enrolled. At week 12, the mean percent reductions in inflammatory count were 63 % and 65 %, and for total lesions counts 58 % and 56 % for <b>lymecycline</b> and for minocycline respectively. Median percent reduction in non-inflammatory count were 54 % and 47 % for <b>lymecycline</b> and for minocycline respectively. Eighty-seven per cent of all patients tolerated the treatments well. Treatment with <b>lymecycline</b> was found to be 4 times more cost-effective than with minocycline. Results showed that <b>lymecycline</b> has a comparable efficacy and safety profile to minocycline while being 4 times more cost-effective.

40|$|Background Oral {{antibiotics}} {{in association}} with a topical retinoid with or without benzoyl peroxide (BPO) are the recommended first-line option {{in the treatment of}} moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral <b>lymecycline</b> 300 mg with adapalene 0. 1 %-BPO 2. 5 % (A/BPO) fixed-dose gel in comparison with oral <b>lymecycline</b> 300 mg with a vehicle gel in subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Methods A total of 378 subjects were randomized in a double-blind, controlled trial to receive once-daily <b>lymecycline</b> with either A/BPO or vehicle for 12 weeks. Evaluations included percentage changes from baseline in lesion counts, success rate (subjects 'clear' or 'almost clear'), skin tolerability, adverse events and patients' satisfaction. Results the median percentage reduction from baseline in total lesion counts at week 12 was significantly higher (P < 0. 001) in the <b>lymecycline</b> with A/BPO group (- 74. 1 %) than in the <b>lymecycline</b> with vehicle group (- 56. 8 %). the success rate was significantly higher (47. 6 % vs. 33. 7 %, P = 0. 002) in subjects treated with <b>lymecycline</b> and A/BPO. Both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions were significantly reduced at week 12 (both P < 0. 001) with a rapid onset of action from week 2 for noninflammatory lesions (P < 0. 001) and week 4 for inflammatory lesions (P = 0. 005). the A /BPO and <b>lymecycline</b> combination was well tolerated. the proportion of satisfied and very satisfied subjects was similar in both groups, but the number in the A/BPO group who were ` very satisfied' was significantly greater (P = 0. 031). Conclusion These results demonstrate the clinical benefit of combining A /BPO with <b>lymecycline</b> in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} and microbiological efficacy of azithromycin in curing chlamydial infections {{in women with}} that of <b>lymecycline,</b> and {{with a view of}} the possibility of minimizing the problem of compliance by means of single-dose administration, 146 women with culture-positive Chlamydia trachomatis infections were randomly assigned to treatment with a 1 g bolus dose of azithromycin or a 10 -day course of <b>lymecycline</b> 300 mg twice daily. Clinical and microbiological evaluations were performed and adverse effects monitored at check-ups after 15 - 35 and 40 - 65 days. Of the 146 patients enrolled in the study, 120 were evaluable. At the second check-up, C. trachomatis was found to have been eradicated in all patients in both treatment groups. Of the 51 patients who had clinical signs and symptoms of genital infection at enrolment, 96 % (22 / 23) of those in the azithromycin group were considered cured (n = 18) or improved (n = 4), as compared with 100 % (28 / 28) of those considered cured (n = 22) or improved (n = 6) in the <b>lymecycline</b> group. Adverse events related, or possibly related, to treatment were reported by 16 (21. 6 %) of the <b>lymecycline</b> group, but by only 6 (8. 3 %) of the azithromycin group. The 2 drugs were comparable with regard to microbiological and clinical efficacy in the treatment of genital chlamydial infection in women.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{antibiotics}} {{represent a}} mainstay in acne treatment. However, studies comparing their efficacies are rare. AIM: To evaluate the clinical and in vivo antibacterial effect of <b>lymecycline</b> and minocycline at different dosages. METHOD: Eighty-six patients with {{moderate to severe}} acne were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, intent-to-treat study comparing in three parallel groups the effect of (1) <b>lymecycline</b> 300 mg daily for 12 weeks, (2) minocycline 50 mg daily for 12 weeks and (3) minocycline 100 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 50 mg daily for 8 weeks. Evaluations were made at the screening visit and at five on-treatment visits. They consisted of clinical counts of acne lesions and evaluations of bacterial viability using dual flow cytometry performed on microorganisms collected from sebaceous infundibula by cyanoacrylate strippings. RESULTS: Patients receiving minocycline 100 / 50 mg had the best clinical outcome, particularly in {{the reduction of the}} number of papules. By the end of the trial, the microbial response to minocycline 100 / 50 mg was also superior to either of the other two treatments. There were less live and more dead bacteria. CONCLUSION: In this trial, minocycline 100 / 50 mg was superior for the treatment of inflammatory acne when compared to <b>lymecycline</b> 300 mg and minocycline 50 mg. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Background. Acne is a {{dermatosis}} {{that involves}} an altered sebum pattern. Objectives. (1) To evaluate if a treatment based on antibiotics (<b>lymecycline)</b> can alter fatty acids {{contents of the}} sebum of patients with acne; (2) to evaluate if oral supplementation of fatty acids can interfere with fatty acids contents of the sebum of patients with acne; (3) to evaluate {{if there is any}} interaction in fatty acids contents of the sebum of patients with acne when they use both antibiotics and oral supplementation of fatty acids. Methods. Forty-five male volunteers with inflammatory acne vulgaris were treated with 300 [*]mg of <b>lymecycline</b> per day, with 540 [*]mg of γ-linolenic acid, 1, 200 [*]mg of linoleic acid, and 510 [*]mg of oleic acid per day, or with both regimens for 90 days. Every 30 days, a sample of sebum from the forehead was collected for fatty acids’ chromatographic analysis. Results. Twelve fatty acids studied exhibited some kind of pattern changes during the study: C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0, C 15 : 0, C 16 : 1, C 18 : 0, C 18 : 1 n 9 c+C 18 : 1 n 9 t, C 18 : 2 n 6 t, C 18 : 3 n 6, C 18 : 3 n 3, C 20 : 1, C 22 : 0, and C 24 : 0.

40|$|Hemolysis {{induced by}} long-wave {{ultraviolet}} radiation (UVA) and 8 different commercial tetracycline derivatives was studied in a model using human red blood cells. Demethylchlortetracycline and doxycycline were shown to have pronounced hemolytic properties causing 88 % and 85 % hemolysis, respectively, at a concentration of 50 μg/ml and 72 J/cm 2 of UVA. Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline caused maximally 18 % hemolysis at 200 μg/ml and <b>lymecycline</b> only 7 % at 100 μg/ml. Methacycline showed intermediate hemolytic effect of 36 % at 200 μg/ml. Minocycline had no hemolytic effect whatsoever. These experimental data correlate very well with clinical reports and comparative phototoxicity trials in humans. Photohemolysis may thus be of value for predicting tetracycline phototoxicity...|$|E
40|$|When {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocytes were stimulated with zymosan, a {{sharp rise in}} {{oxygen consumption}} was observed. In the presence of doxycycline, we observed a further increase in oxygen consumption when the phagocytosing cells were exposed to UV light.

Irradiation of the polymorphonuclear leukocytes for 20 min {{in the presence of}} doxycycline (10 micrograms/ml) before phagocytosis completely abolished the rise in oxygen consumption initiated by zymosan. Demethylchlortetracycline and light exposure also caused a marked reduction of polymorphonuclear leukocyte oxygen consumption, whereas oxytetracycline, <b>lymecycline,</b> chlortetracycline, and minocycline had only a slight or no photosensitizing effect.

40|$|Background: Effective {{management}} of acne vulgaris {{in primary care}} involves support (usually provided {{over a number of}} consultations) and prescribing effective treatments. However, consulting and prescribing patterns for acne in primary care are not well described. Objective: To describe the rate of primary care consultations and follow-up consultations; prescribing patterns, including overall use of acne related medications (ARM) and initial and follow-up prescribing, for acne vulgaris in the UK. Methods: UK primary care acne consultations and prescriptions for ARMs were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Annual consultation rates (between 2004 and 2013) by age and gender, new consultations and consultations in the subsequent year; prescribing trends, prescribing during a new consultation and over the subsequent 90 days and year were calculated, using number of registered patients as the denominator. Results: 65. 9 % of patients who had a new acne consultation had no further acne consultations in the subsequent year. 26. 6 %, 25. 2 %, 23. 5 % and 2. 8 % of patients were prescribed no ARM, an oral antibiotic, a topical antibiotic, or an oral plus topical antibiotic respectively during a new acne consultation. 59. 9 % and 38. 5 % of patients prescribed an ARM received no further ARM prescriptions in the following 90 days and one year respectively, despite most prescriptions being for 2 months or less.

40|$|This {{presentation}} is {{a summary of}} five different studies on the efficacy and tolerance of roxithromycin {{in the treatment of}} non-gonococcal genital infections. Three of the studies were double-blind comparative and two were open studies. Of the 924 out-patients whose data were analysed for clinical efficacy, 637 received treatment with roxithromycin 150 mg bd. The standard dose of roxithromycin, 150 mg bd for ten days, was compared with doxycycline 200 mg daily, <b>lymecycline</b> 300 mg bd and roxithromycin 450 mg once daily. The overall clinical success rate was 90 % (576 of 637 patients) for roxithromycin 150 mg bd. In the three comparative trials, no significant difference was found between the clinical success rates of roxithromycin 150 mg bd and the other drugs. The overall clinical success rate with roxithromycin 150 mg bd was 92 % (512 / 558) in nongonococcal urethritis and 81 % (64 / 79) in ccrvicovaginitis. Taking into account all patients treated with roxithromycin 150 nig bd, the bacteriological success rate was 90 % (444 / 492). In the comparative trials, no significant difference could be found between the treatment groups. Roxithromycin 150 mg bd was effective in eradicating 97 % (308 / 316) of the isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis, 88 % (149 / 170) of Ureaplasma urealytkum, 73 % (40 / 55) of Mycoplasma hominis and 57 % (13 / 23) of Gardnerella vaginalis. The present findings show that a high cure rate can be achieved with a ten-day course of treatment with roxithromycin and that it is at least as effective as the tetracyclines commonly used in the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis. A higher dosage than 300 mg/day of roxithromycin did not offer any clear advantage in terms of efficacy. The incidence of clinical adverse effects was low and the side-effects were in no case severe. No laboratory abnormalities attributable to roxithromycin were observed...|$|E
