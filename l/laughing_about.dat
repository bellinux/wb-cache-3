5|$|Bob Holly and the 1–2–3 Kid faced Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka next in {{the final}} match of the WWF Tag Team Championship tournament. Tatanka began the match by using his {{strength}} against Holly, but Holly soon turned the match around by performing a hurricanrana throw. Bigelow used his strength against his opponents, but the 1–2–3 Kid performed a hurricanrana on him as well. Bigelow regained the advantage by kicking the Kid {{in the back of}} the head and controlled the match until the Kid threw him out of the ring. Bigelow and Tatanka turned the match around again, using power moves to wear down their opponents. At one point, Bigelow held the Kid for Tatanka to attack, but Tatanka accidentally hit Bigelow instead. The match ended in a similar manner, as Tatanka knocked Bigelow off the top rope when Bigelow attempted to perform a moonsault. The 1–2–3 Kid pinned Bigelow to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the match, the crowd heckled Bigelow. He responded by pushing retired NFL player Lawrence Taylor, who was at ring side, <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> Bigelow's loss.|$|E

For example, a person {{with high levels of}} hostile attribution bias might see two people laughing and immediately interpret this behavior as two people <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> him/her, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign.|$|E

25|$|Rams quarterback Pat Haden was 10 of 21 for 123 yards passing, and two touchdowns. Jeb Blount was 8 of 21 for 83 {{yards for}} the Buccaneers, with two interceptions. On one play the Rams jumped offside, but the penalty was called against the Buccaneers. The {{officials}} corrected their mistake, but angered McKay by <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> it. The Rams lost Dennis Harrah {{for the season}} with a knee injury, and suffered injuries to Dave Elmendorf and Kevin McLain.|$|E
500|$|From 1995 he {{also spent}} three years at Talk Radio UK, {{presenting}} Starkey on Saturday, later Starkey on Sunday. [...] An interview with Denis Healey proved {{to be one of}} his most embarrassing moments: [...] "I mistakenly thought that he had become an amiable old buffer who would engage in amusing conversation, and he tore me limb from limb. I laugh about it now, but I didn't feel like <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> it at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E

I can <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> most things, but I can't <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> going away. I am honestly and sincerely too grateful for that." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 12 February 1979 ZIPRA {{shot down}} The Umniati, a Vickers Viscount, the second {{civilian}} airliner to be targeted by {{them with a}} Soviet-made SAM-7 missile, {{in an attempt to}} assassinate Walls, killing all 59 passengers on board. Walls and his wife were aboard a second Viscount which took off 15 minutes later, and which landed unharmed at Salisbury. The Zimbabwe African People's Union leader Joshua Nkomo appeared on British domestic television <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> these incidents, declaring that Walls was responsible for the passengers' deaths because he was the [...] "biggest military target", and this justified the action. The Rhodesian government responded to the attack by air-strikes on ZIPRA bases within the borders of Angola and Zambia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} and vocational {{experiences of the}} four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film [...] "were really more like play scenes". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. [...] "What this film talks about, I have been through," [...] Iñárritu recalled. [...] "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through {{the last years of}} my life." [...] Dinelaris described this aspect as [...] "a laughing look at oneself", but said {{it had to be done}} in a comedic way otherwise [...] "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was [...] "terrifying" [...] because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> the film.|$|E
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E
