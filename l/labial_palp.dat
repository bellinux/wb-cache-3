5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and <b>labial</b> <b>palp</b> of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E

50|$|It {{is a small}} moth with buff and brown-mottled ("potato"-colored) forewings. Like Autosticha, this moth has {{the second}} and third forewing vein {{emerging}} from a common stalk; unlike in that genus, the <b>labial</b> <b>palps</b> of S. testaceus males are beset with feathery hairs, while the <b>labial</b> <b>palps</b> of the females are inconspicuous and do not taper like those of both sexes of Autosticha.|$|R

50|$|The colour of {{the head}} is {{primarily}} dark brown with white markings.

50|$|At {{least some}} of these moths are {{characterized}} by a short scape and a triangular tuft of short hairs {{on the tip of}} the second <b>labial</b> <b>palp</b> segment. These traits are shared by the enigmatic Chelophoba melaina, and Clarke stated that it might be warranted to include this (or even all of Chelophoba) in Ethmiopsis. Ponomarenko eventually treated Chelophoba as a synonym of Ethmiopsis in 1997.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to Rhagastis acuta, Rhagastis hayesi and Rhagastis velata but {{distinguishable}} from the first two by the forewing upperside ground colour and from the last by {{the shape of the}} <b>labial</b> <b>palp,</b> which is strongly narrowed towards the base. The forewing upperside {{is similar to}} Rhagastis velata, but the ground colour ranges from pale grey to grey green (olive-green in Rhagastis velata). The intensity of the dark markings varies considerably from almost absent to strongly present.|$|E

50|$|The prementum bears a {{structure}} called the ligula; {{this consists of}} an inner pair of lobes called glossae and a lateral pair called paraglossae. These structures are homologous to the lacinia and galea of maxillae. The <b>labial</b> <b>palps</b> borne {{on the sides of}} labium are the counterparts of maxillary palps. Like the maxillary <b>palps,</b> the <b>labial</b> <b>palps</b> aid sensory function in eating. In many species the musculature of the labium is much more complex than that of the other jaws, because in most, the ligula, palps and prementum all can be moved independently.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 24-30 mm for males and 25-20 mm for females. It is similar to Pseudodolbina species but distinguishable {{by the presence of}} the field of microtrichia on the inner surface of the <b>labial</b> <b>palp</b> segment one and the choerocampine pilifer-palp hearing organ. The antennae are slightly clubbed, long, exceeding the apex of the forewing cell. The scales of head and body are narrow, semi-erect, giving a hairy appearance. The hindwing upperside is uniform brownish-grey.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{of these}} two [...] "ears" [...] {{consists}} of a chordotonal organ of a single sensory cell attached {{to the base of}} the labral pilifer, a bristled structure located next to the moth's tongue. This organ functions in conjunction with the <b>labial</b> <b>palp,</b> the second segment of which is inflated and free of scales. In its normal configuration thedistal lobe of the pilifer and the inner surface of the inflated palp segment are in close contact, the latter functioning as receiver.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to examine sensory structures on the mouthparts in Apis florea Fabricius (1787) from north western region (India) using scanning electron microscopy. Ultra morphological details revealed that mouthparts of the dwarf honey bees were studded with different sensory structures including sensilla chaetica (A, B and C); sensilla basiconica; sensilla trichodea C; nodulated-form sensilla trichodea C; hair membrane plate sensilla; branched processes and cuticular plate sensilla, which made the organism efficient in forage detection and collection. Sensilla chaetica were found on prementum, galea, <b>labial</b> <b>palps</b> and the glossa and made flow of liquid food to the buccal cavity convenient. Sensilla basiconica were found on <b>labial</b> <b>palps</b> and served probably as a thermoreceptor and hygroreceptor. Cuticular plate sensilla on <b>labial</b> <b>palps</b> and hair membrane plate sensilla found on galea may serve to adjust the segments of the organ and act as mechanoreceptors. The identification {{and analysis of the}} distribution of various types of sensilla on the tongue of A. florea should be helpful when addressing questions on the ecological and systematic characterisation of the species in future investigations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{variability}} of the Baetis fuscatus species-group (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae). This study contains three main topics: The first one is distinguishing between two highly similar species, Baetis scambus and Baetis fuscatus based on morfological structures, specifically their mouthparts - <b>labial</b> <b>palps.</b> To analyze {{the shape of the}} <b>labial</b> <b>palps,</b> I applied a computerized outline analysis. Second topic is focused on the validity of Baetis beskidensis as a distinct species based on the morphology and DNA sequences (obtained for the topotypical material for the first time). And finally, I also investigated some samples from Corsica in attempt to discover new species of the Baetis fuscatus species-group. I found that most probably {{it is not possible to}} distinguish between Baetis scambus and Baetis fuscatus based on the shape of their <b>labial</b> <b>palps.</b> Baetis beskidensis is morfologically different, but genetically not distinctly separated from other representatives of the Baetis fuscatus species-group. I didn´t discover any distinct morphological differences in specimens from Corsica, pointing to the possible existence of new species...|$|R
