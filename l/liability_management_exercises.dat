50|$|In {{order to}} protect the capital {{position}} of the Bank the Minister for Finance provided €4 billion in capital between June and September 2009. A <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> <b>exercise</b> was also undertaken in August 2009 and €1.8 billion of equity was realised on the buyback, at a significant discount, of subordinated debt instruments. In December 2009, the Minister committed to safeguard the Bank's regulatory capital position. As a result, the Minister issued of a promissory note for €8.3 billion on 31 March 2010, bringing the government's investment in Anglo Irish bank to €12.3 billion. Since then the notes have risen in value to cover €30.6 billion of the €34.7 billion cost of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Bank (€25.3 billion of the €29.3 billion cost of Anglo and €5.3 billion of INBS’s €5.4 billion cost).|$|R
40|$|At present, {{the market}} is {{severely}} mispricing Greece’s sovereign risk relative to the country’s fundamentals. As {{a result of the}} mispricing, financial intermediation in Greece has become dysfunctional and the privatisation of state-owned assets has stalled. This mispricing is partially due to an illiquid and fragmented government yield curve. A well-designed public <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> <b>exercise</b> can lead to a more efficient pricing of Greece’s government bonds and thereby help restore stable and affordable financing for the country’s private sector, which is imperative in order to overcome Greece’s deep recession. This paper proposes three measures to enhance the functioning of the Greek government debt market: i) Greece should issue a new five-year bond, ii) it should consolidate the 20 individual series of government bonds into four liquid securities and iii) it should offer investors a swap of these newly created bonds into dollar-denominated securities. Each of these measures would be beneficial to the Hellenic Republic, since the government would be able to reduce the face value and the net present value of its debt stock. Furthermore, this exercise would facilitate the resumption of market access, which is a necessary condition for continuous multilateral disbursements to Greece...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{are going}} to study asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> {{throughout}} the macroeconomic cycle in financial institutions. There are two important problems in financial institutions. The first is that asset and <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> has significant effects on the financial institution's value. The second is that in different stages of the macroeconomic cycle, the effect of asset and <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> approaches is not same. Therefore, the purpose of the thesis is to study how asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> causes economic consequences for financial institutions and in what capacity. In this thesis, based on the analysis of asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> and the economic cycle, we establish a dynamic system to simulate how a financial institution makes decision throughout economic cycles. In order to simulate the system, we established a model to reflect how the economic cycle affects the financial institution's value by using the economic relationship and we built up the decision making progress. Then we simulate the system through Matlab. From the simulation results, we can observe the changes of system in the given time horizon. by Jingsi Yan. Thesis (S. M.)

The issue of centralisation versus decentralisation of Crown asset and <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> is analysed both from a portfolio management perspective and from an organisational design perspective. Insights from private sector financial conglomerates are also incorporated. The paper concludes that individual Crown financial entities should each continue to be responsible for setting their own strategic asset allocation, after taking into account the nature of their liabilities. A central Crown body should, however, monitor and aggregate information from each of these entities and be delegated the responsibility and power to manage risks to the overall Crown balance sheet.

The major risks encountered in sovereign <b>liability’s</b> <b>management</b> are herein analyzed. The authors analyze the approach known {{under the name of}} assets and <b>liabilities</b> <b>management</b> (ALM) also presenting an advanced system for risk’s valuation (CAR- cost at risk). The result of the survey highlights the fact that the public debt management may create a series of traps, if we refer to the fact that after the years 1990 it has been considered as a separate public policy, with separate objectives with regard to the cost and risk generated by the public debt. This implies the analysis of the financial characteristics of the treasury flows of assets and selection, up to the possible level of the characteristic liabilities in order to contribute to the decrease of the budgetary impact over the liability service costs.

The analysis revealed that banks tend to take more risk over time.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance and}} development of the Mexican pension annuity market established {{as a consequence of the}} 1997 pension reform. The Mexican experience displays interesting characteristics providing lessons for other countries that still need to design the decumulation phase of their newly established second pillars. At the same, time it raises some technical and policy concerns that need addressing as they could hamper, in the future, the healthy development of the market. The paper concludes that: 1) general life insurance companies may better hedge longevity risk than specialized annuity companies; 2) competition should be based on prices rather than additional products; 3) better disclosure of options under the 1973 and 1997 social security laws should be given to disability and life annuitants; and 4) various measures should be taken to improve asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> including allowing companies to trade over the counter derivatives and substituting over time the regulatory asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> framework with an economic asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> framework.

40|$|Financial {{institutions}} require sophisticated {{tools for}} risk management. For company-wide risk management {{both sides of}} the balance sheet should be considered, resulting in an integrated asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> approach. Stochastic programming models suit these needs well and have already been applied in the eld of asset <b>liability</b> <b>management</b> to improve nancial operations and risk management. The dynamic aspect of the nancial planning problems inevitably leads to multiple decision stages (trading dates) in the stochastic program and results in an explosion of dimensionality. In this paper we show that dedicated model generation, specialized solution techniques based on decomposition and high performance computing are the essential elements to tackle these large scale nancial planning problems. It turns out that memory management is a major bottleneck when solving very large problems, given an e cient solution approach and a parallel computing facility.
