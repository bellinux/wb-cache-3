Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his head; and though it stunned him and crushed him down, it incited him. He gazed upon her in awe. In his mind, as in her own, the gulf widened; but faster than it widened, towered his ambition to win across it. But he was too complicated a plexus of sensibilities to sit staring at a gulf a whole evening, especially when there was music. He was remarkably susceptible to music. It was like strong drink, firing him to audacities of feeling,--a drug that laid hold of his imagination and went cloud-soaring through the sky. It banished sordid fact, flooded his mind with beauty, loosed romance and to its heels added wings. He {{did not understand the}} music she played. It was different from the dance-hall piano-banging and blatant brass bands he had heard. But he had caught hints of such music from the books, and he accepted her playing largely on faith, patiently waiting, at first, for the <b>lifting</b> <b>measures</b> of pronounced and simple rhythm, puzzled because those measures were not long continued. Just as he caught the swing of them and started, his imagination attuned in flight, always they vanished away in a chaotic scramble of sounds that was meaningless to him, and that dropped his imagination, an inert weight, back to earth.|$|E

40|$|We report {{progress}} on the equidistribution problem of automorphic forms on locally symmetric spaces. First, generalizing work of Zelditch-Wolpert we construct a representation theoretic analog of the micro-local lift, showing that (under a technical condition of non-degeneracy) every weak- * limit of the generalized Wigner measures associated to a sequence of Maass forms with divergent spectral parameters on a locally symmetric space Γ/K can be <b>lifted</b> to a <b>measure</b> on the homogeneous space Γ which is invariant by a maximal split torus A in G. Secondly, we consider the case where G � PGLd(R) and Γ < G is a lattice associated to a division algebra over Q of prime degree d. When the measures are associated to Hecke-Maass eigenforms, we generalize the work of Bourgain-Lindenstrauss to show that every non-trivial a ∈ A acts with positive entropy on each ergodic component of the <b>lifted</b> <b>measure.</b> Applying recent measure rigidity results of Einsiedler-Katok {{we find that the}} limit measure must be the Haar measure on Γ.

Instead, the tail lift coefficient based on tail area was independent of tail spread, tail aspect ratio and maximum tail span.

Flow visualization experiments reveal that an isolated tail generates leading edge vortices as expected for a low-aspect ratio delta wing, but that in the intact bird body-tail interactions are critical in determining tail aerodynamics: lifting vortices shed from the body interact with the tail and degrade tail lift compared with that of an isolated tail...|$|R
