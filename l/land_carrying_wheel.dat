50|$|The du Bousquet design had {{an unusual}} wheel arrangement; both trucks had six driving <b>wheels</b> and two <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{supporting}} the cylinders. Unlike many other articulated designs, these <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{toward the center}} of the locomotive, as were the cylinders. This arrangement is expressed in the French classification as 031+130, in the Whyte notation as 0-6-2+2-6-0T, or in the UIC classification as (C1')(1'C)t.|$|R
50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} in the frame, the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{designed}} as a Novotny-Klien axle.|$|R
50|$|Their rigidly mounted leading and {{trailing}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were also}} arranged as radial axles {{to allow for}} sideways motion of the wheels {{in relation to the}} locomotive frame, since the locomotive did not have separate bogie trucks. As on the Class Hd, this resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> on a steam {{locomotive}} is a wheel {{that is not}} driven, i.e. it is uncoupled and can run freely, unlike a coupled or driving wheel. It is also described as a running wheel and their axle may be called a carrying axle. A <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is referred to as}} leading wheel if it is at the front, or a trailing wheel if it is {{at the rear of the}} locomotive.|$|R
50|$|The 40 Tonners {{were found}} to be {{satisfactory}} in service, but the absence of leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> resulted in a rough ride.|$|R
50|$|The Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) had {{received}} similar locomotives, the Class T 4.I, that however were somewhat smaller and had smaller driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... two {{revolving}} units like bogies made up {{each one}} of a steam engine involving a group of driving wheels and possibly comprising <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|There were {{scarcely}} {{any differences}} between the various build series. Not until 1896 were minor changes made to the heating areas, the weights and the coal and water capacities. The rigid mounting of the driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{and the location of}} the cylinder {{just in front of the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> did not prove a success. The D IX locomotives could haul 170 t on the flat at a speed of 65 km/h, on routes with a 2% incline they could manage 95 tons at 20 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Three {{of these}} {{locomotives}} were also produced for the Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) as the T 4.II, but these had different dimensions, including smaller driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first thirty had 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{the latter}} twenty had 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b> The LNWR reused numbers from {{withdrawn}} locomotives, so the numbering system was completely haphazard. The 3 ft 9 in engines were numbered by 528, 531, 784, 1295, 1305, 1981-1985, 97, 111, 181, 196, 562, 616, 803, 1356, 1508, 2210, 139, 653, 834, 874, 1506, 1572, 1589, 1671, 1714, and 2165. The 3 ft 3 in engines were numbered 44, 527, 612, 762, 827, 875, 1427, 1764, 2196, 2446, 920, 935, 1164, 1219, 1523, 1536, 1551, 2077, 2223 and 2228.|$|R
50|$|The {{coupled axles}} were sprung {{underneath}} with leaf springs. Weight balancing was achieved using an equalising beam between the springs. The front <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> had leaf springs above the axles.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, Société Anonyme John Cockerill of Seraing in Belgium {{delivered}} {{four new}} 2-6-2+2-6-2 locomotives, numbered {{in the range}} from NG85 to NG88, which were so similar to the older locomotives that they were initially designated Class NG G13 as well. However, {{in view of the fact}} that all the <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were fitted with roller bearing axle boxes and arranged as swiveling pony trucks, compared to the Class NG G13 of which the inner <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement, it was soon decided to reclassify them to Class NG G16.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with Heusinger valve gear, piston {{valves and}} outside plate frames. Since {{they were to}} be used across the Namib Desert, they were equipped with dust covers to protect the motion from wind-blown sand. Their leading and trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were not mounted in separate bogie trucks, but were rigidly mounted and arranged as radial axles to allow for sideways motion of the wheels in relation to the locomotive frame. This resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The Prussian T 9 was a {{class of}} German steam {{locomotive}} which included several types of tank engine, all with six coupled <b>wheels</b> and two <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> operated by the Prussian state railways.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} {{there were three}} locomotives, Victoria, Britannia and Caledonia, all six wheeled tender engines, with five foot driving wheels and 3 ft 6in <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b> They had outside cylinders and inside bearings.|$|R
50|$|This rather {{distinctive}} locomotive had plate 10 ft wheels {{instead of}} the more usual spoked ones, the <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> being 5 ft. The 14 x 20 in cylinders were fed from a doubled-domed boiler.|$|R
50|$|Five 2-2-2 {{locomotives}} originally {{built by}} Stothert & Slaughter for the B&GR. These had 6 ft 6 in driving wheels and 3 ft. 6 in. <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> with cylinders of 15 in. dia. × 21 in. stroke.|$|R
50|$|A ferry slip is a {{specialized}} docking facility that receives a ferryboat or train ferry. A similar structure called a barge slip receives a barge or car float {{that is used}} to <b>carry</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicles across a body of water.|$|R
50|$|This {{system was}} not {{suitable}} for steam locomotives so Arnoux invented a separate system for them. The locomotives had a 2-4-2 wheel arrangement and the driving wheels were flangeless. The <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to pivot and were controlled by near-horizontal guide wheels.|$|R
50|$|Two express {{locomotives}} {{were provided}} from the Canada Works with 6 ft. 0 in. driving wheels and 3 ft. 6 in. <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{with a total}} wheelbase of 14 ft. 2 in. They had cylinders of 20 in. dia. × 15¼ in. stroke.|$|R
50|$|In 1851 the {{carriage}} portion was removed {{and the power}} unit rebuilt, presumably with {{a new pair of}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> making it an 0-2-2. Its use {{for the next few years}} is unclear, although it might have been moved to Taunton to pump water.|$|R
50|$|This {{locomotive}} {{worked the}} first train on the Great Western Railway {{when it opened}} on 4 June 1838.

50|$|This {{locomotive}} {{was withdrawn}} in 1843 but was rebuilt {{and returned to}} service in 1846.
