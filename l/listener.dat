5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the <b>listener,</b> fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the <b>listener</b> is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the <b>listener</b> to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing <b>listener</b> looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the <b>listener</b> is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the <b>listener</b> might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E

All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E

40|$|Prior investigations, using {{isolated}} {{words as}} stimuli, {{have shown that}} older <b>listeners</b> tend to require longer temporal cues than younger <b>listeners</b> to switch their percept from one word to its phonetically contrasting counterpart. The extent to which this age effect occurs in sentence contexts is investigated in the present study. The hypothesis was that perception of temporal cues differs for words presented in isolation and a sentence context and that this effect may vary between younger and older <b>listeners.</b> Younger and older <b>listeners</b> with normal-hearing and older <b>listeners</b> with hearing loss identified phonetically contrasting word pairs in natural speech continua that varied by a single temporal cue: voice-onset time, vowel duration, transition duration, and silent interval duration. The words were presented in isolation and in sentences. A context effect was shown for most continua, in which <b>listeners</b> required longer temporal cues in sentences than in isolated words. Additionally, older <b>listeners</b> required longer cues at the crossover points than younger <b>listeners</b> for most but not all continua. In general, the findings support the conclusion that older <b>listeners</b> tend to require longer target temporal cues than younger normal-hearing <b>listeners</b> in identifying phonetically contrasting word pairs in isolation and sentence contexts...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} adult <b>listeners</b> who speak the same native {{language}} but live in different linguistic environments differ {{in their use of}} prosodic cues that signal word boundaries in the native language. Non-utterance-final word-final syllables have higher fundamental frequency in French. Adult native French <b>listeners</b> living in France or in the US completed an artificial-language segmentation task where fundamental frequency cued word-final boundaries (experimental). Other native French <b>listeners</b> living in France completed the corresponding task without prosodic cues (control). Results showed that France French <b>listeners</b> outperformed US French <b>listeners</b> and control French <b>listeners,</b> but US French <b>listeners</b> did not outperform control French <b>listeners.</b> The poorer performance of US French <b>listeners</b> is attributed to their regular exposure to (and thus interference from) English, a language where fundamental frequency signals word-initial boundaries. This suggests speech segmentation is adaptive, with <b>listeners</b> tuning in to the prosody of their linguistic environment.

40|$|Hearing impairment, {{cochlear}} implantation, {{background noise}} and other auditory degradations {{result in the}} loss or distortion of sound information thought to be critical to speech perception. In many cases, <b>listeners</b> can still identify speech sounds despite degradations, but understanding of how this is accomplished is incomplete. Experiments presented here tested the hypothesis that <b>listeners</b> would utilize acoustic-phonetic cues differently if one or more cues were degraded by hearing impairment or simulated hearing impairment. Results supported this hypothesis for various listening conditions that are directly relevant for clinical populations. Analysis included mixed-effects logistic modeling of contributions of individual acoustic cues for various contrasts. <b>Listeners</b> with cochlear implants (CIs) or normal-hearing (NH) <b>listeners</b> in CI simulations showed increased use of acoustic cues in the temporal domain and decreased use of cues in the spectral domain for the tense/lax vowel contrast and the word-final fricative voicing contrast. For the word-initial stop voicing contrast, NH <b>listeners</b> made less use of voice-onset time and greater use of voice pitch in conditions that simulated high-frequency hearing impairment and/or masking noise; influence of these cues was further modulated by consonant place of articulation. A pair of experiments measured phonetic context effects for the "s/sh" contrast, replicating previously observed effects for NH <b>listeners</b> and generalizing them to CI <b>listeners</b> as well, despite known deficiencies in spectral resolution for CI <b>listeners.</b> For NH <b>listeners</b> in CI simulations, these context effects were absent or negligible. Audio-visual delivery of this experiment revealed enhanced influence of visual lip-rounding cues for CI <b>listeners</b> and NH <b>listeners</b> in CI simulations. Additionally, CI <b>listeners</b> demonstrated that visual cues to gender influence phonetic perception {{in a manner consistent}} with gender-related voice acoustics. All of these results suggest that <b>listeners</b> are able to accommodate challenging listening situations by capitalizing on the natural (multimodal) covariance in speech signals. Additionally, these results imply that there are potential differences in speech perception by NH <b>listeners</b> and <b>listeners</b> with hearing impairment that would be overlooked by traditional word recognition or consonant confusion matrix analysis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>listener’s</b> native language (L 1) {{and the types of}} noise on English vowel identification in noise. Method: Identification of twelve English vowels was measured in quiet and in long-term speech-shaped noise and multi-talker babble noise for English- (EN), Chinese- (CN) and Korean-native (KN) <b>listeners</b> at various signal-to-noise ratios. Results: Compared to non-native <b>listeners,</b> EN <b>listeners</b> performed significantly better in quiet and in noise. Vowel identification in long-term speech-shaped noise and in multi-talker babble noise was similar between CN and KN <b>listeners.</b> This is different from our previous study in which KN <b>listeners</b> performed better than CN <b>listeners</b> in English sentence recognition in multi-talker babble noise. Discussion: Results from the current study suggest that depending on speech materials, the effect of non-native listeners’ L 1 on speech perception in noise may be different. That is, in the perception of speech materials with little linguistic cues like isolated vowels, the characteristics of non-native <b>listener’s</b> native language may not play a significant role. On the other hand, in the perception of running speech in which <b>listeners</b> need to use more linguistic cues (e. g., acoustic-phonetic, semantic, and prosodic cues), the non-native <b>listener’s</b> native language background might result in a different masking effect...|$|R
