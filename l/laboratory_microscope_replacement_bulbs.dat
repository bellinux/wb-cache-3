30|$|With known {{amounts of}} plant {{structures}} used for measurements, the relative investment {{of a plant}} into the respective structures can be estimated. The N content of an average-sized <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> was measured as 470.40  ±  20.05  µg (n =  9). Bulbils were too small and occurred too rarely to measure N content. If {{the size of a}} bulb is approximated by the volume of a sphere with the diameter of the respective structure (replacement bulbs: 3.24  ±  0.69  mm; basal bulbils 1.26  ±  0.39  mm), the ratio between average volumes of <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> and bulbils is 17 : 1. If we assume that bulbils have the same N-content per unit volume as <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs,</b> the N content of an average bulbil can be estimated as 27.67  µg. The absolute N content for 100 seeds was measured as 259.97  ±  66.53  µg. Since a plant forms on average 68  ±  79 seeds (including plants with lacking seed set, see Table  2), the N content of 68 seeds would be 176.78  µg. Similarly, the vegetative parts of nine plants were measured (N content 79.10  ±  4.56  µg). Comparison of the absolute N contents of these structures gives the following picture: flowering plants of G. graeca allocate most of their resources (67.1 %) to the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs,</b> 3.9 % to the usually single basal bulbil, 25.2 % to an average of 68 seeds, and 3.8 % remain in vegetative plant structures.|$|R

30|$|Using a ruler {{and/or a}} digital caliper (precision ±  0.02  mm) we {{measured}} {{the diameter of}} the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> (including the thin tunic of the former parent bulb; see Schnittler et al. 2013) and the diameter/length of the usually single basal bulbil and its short to extremely short stolon. In addition, we recorded number of flowers, shoot height above ground, and numbers of basal and stem leaves. For all measures, the standard deviation (SD) is given. To determine a threshold for {{the diameter of the}} <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> needed to develop bulbils and/or flowers, these graphs were fitted against the equation y =  1 /[1  + e−(x−xo)/b] which describes a sigmoid function with xo as the threshold (the turning point of its slope). For the graphs, flowers with only the male function (aborted and much smaller capsules) were counted as 0.5, perfect flowers as 1 (capsules are of normal size and fertile).|$|R
30|$|Gagea lutea {{differs from}} the two arid-zone species by another {{important}} character: a switch in ontogenesis between bulbil production and seed production (Schnittler et al. 2009). If plants gain resources (indicated by larger <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs),</b> they produce first only bulbils, not flowers. Above a certain threshold in parent bulb size, only flowers, no bulbils, are developed. In such species, the resource threshold (expressed as diameter of the parent bulb) for bulbil production is always lower than that for flower/seed development (Schnittler et al. 2013). Species lacking a switch start to develop a single to several bulbils {{as soon as the}} <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> has reached a certain diameter and then continue to form them indefinitely throughout the life of the plant. In such species, the threshold for flower/seed development may be lower than that for bulbil development, as it is the case in G. bulbifera and G. graeca (Table  2). From this reason, a direct comparison in terms of resources allocated to bulbils vs. seeds is impossible due to the switch in G. lutea: plants of this species never invest simultaneously into seeds and bulbils.|$|R
30|$|Material from populations I, II and IV (Table  1) {{was used}} to {{determine}} absolute contents of carbon and nitrogen. Plants were dried for about 4  days in phosphorus pentoxide, and dry mass of the respective plant parts (seeds, <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> and vegetative structures) was determined with a precision of ±  1  µg (for seeds, 100 seeds were pooled for weighing). Several items of these plant structures were cut or pooled in a way that dry mass ranges between 6 and 15  mg. This weight corresponds with one average-sized <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb,</b> vegetative remains from a single plant, or ca. 100 seeds. Using replicate samples, a total of five replicates were measured except for basal bulbils. This procedure yielded 42 samples in total which were wrapped into tin foil and analyzed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content with an automatic analyzer Vario EL III. Using the means of 3 – 10 samples, N-contents were calculated and used as a resource estimator (compare Ashman 1994). Figures for N content per mg dry mass were used to estimate nitrogen content of the respective plant parts, and calculate their relative investments in terms of nitrogen incorporated.|$|R
30|$|The <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{are always}} close (1 – 3  cm) to the surface, and are {{hidden by the}} reddish-brown sheaths of the basal leaves. The first basal leaf, which is as well the first to decay during {{flowering}} season, develops the replacement bulb; the second, very rarely the third as well, develops usually one basal bulbil which is on a saccate enlargement of the basal leaf, which forms a short stolon. Larger non-flowering plants (34 of 114, mean bulb diam. 2.20  ±  0.40) developed a bulbil (Fig.  3 d–f). From 291 flowering plants measured, the weaker individuals (131 plants, mean bulb diam. 2.72  ±  0.56) did not yet develop a bulbil, the larger ones (160 plants, mean bulb diam. 3.24  ±  0.69  mm) supported a basal bulbil (diam. 1.26  ±  0.39  mm). Among these were two with a second, smaller basal bulbil (sister bulbil; diam. 1.17  ±  0.36  mm). Bulbils developed often on a short (0.42  ±  0.71  mm, range 0 – 4.01  mm) stolon. Compared with other species in the genus, the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> of G. graeca stay small even in richly flowering plants; the maximum bulb size recorded by us was 5.12  mm.|$|R
40|$|Polianthes tuberosa (Tuberose) is {{originally}} from Mexico {{and is the}} best known and cultivated species of the genus Polianthes (Sonea et al., l 979; Şelaru, 2007). In order to support tuberose lovers and growers, for leisure or economic purposes (Cantor and Pop, 2008), Polianthes tuberosa (tuberose) {{was introduced in the}} collection of flower species of the Fruit Research Station Cluj, and was monitored over several years of growth. The study monitored morphological and decorative characters, productivity, technological and behaviour characteristics of the species and its use. In terms of multiplication of tuberose, number of bulbs per plant is a determining factor. The rate of multiplication of the species depends directly on the number of trained <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The bifactorial experiment focused on the influence of the culture substrate and the diameter of planted bulbs on the number of bulbs per plant, and therefore plant productivity. Based on the resulted data it can be concluded that the two experimental factors significantly influenced the average number of formed <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> / plant. As a synthesis of results of the experiment we can conclude that the highest number of bulbs/plant, 12. 6, is observed on substrates a 3 : 30 % neutral peat...|$|R
2500|$|Low-power LEDs are {{sufficient}} for riding on well-lit streets, {{but do not}} generally project a very bright beam as {{it is difficult to}} collimate the output from multiple LEDs into a single usable beam. [...] This can be overcome by using a few very high-power LEDs - each with their own optics. It is now possible to buy LED equivalents for halogen rechargeable systems (including drop-in <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs),</b> and LED lights for dynamos. On a dynamo, LEDs produce more light than halogen lights at very low speeds (down to 3km/h according to one manufacturer).|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{the last}} version {{to use a}} 100-watt {{incandescent}} light bulb {{was replaced by a}} new version with a dedicated heating element, titled Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven. The replacement was due to the availability of better alternatives to the incandescent light bulbs that heated previous versions of the Easy-Bake Oven. This rendered all models that used light bulbs as their heating elements obsolete because the company no longer offers <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs.</b> However, some critics of the redesign indicated that halogen light bulbs emitted sufficient heat to replace incandescent bulbs.|$|R
5000|$|Holiday lights can be {{animated}} using special [...] "flasher" [...] or interrupter bulbs (usually a red tipped <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> {{included with}} the set) or by electronic controller. Flasher bulbs use a bi-metallic strip which interrupts the series circuit when the lamp becomes hot. An electronic holiday light controller usually has a diode bridge followed by a resistor-based voltage divider, a filter capacitor and a fixed-program microcontroller. The micro-controller has three or four outputs which are connected to transistors or thyristor which control interleaved circuits, each with lamps of a single color.|$|R

5000|$|The {{contents}} of a high-pressure lamp are inert gas (such as argon) and mercury. [...] There are no phosphors used, and the mercury is clearly visible {{if it is not}} in a gaseous state. During installation, even a small amount of oil from fingertips can cause the quartz envelope to fail in operation. Most commercial <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> come with a special pocket wipe, usually containing alcohol, to clean the bulb in case it is accidentally touched during installation. Because the bulb contains mercury, great care should be used if a bulb is broken, to prevent accidental contact or vapor exposure.|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{microscopy}} is {{a well-established}} technique for nanoscale imaging. Zone plates {{are used as}} microscope objectives and provide high resolution, approaching 10 nm, currently limited by fabrication issues. This Thesis presents zone plate optics that achieve either high resolution or phase contrast in x-ray microscopy. The high-resolution optics use high orders of the zone plate, which alleviates the demands on fabrication, and the phase-contrast optics are single-element diffractive optical elements that produce contrast by Zernike or differential-interference contrast methods. The advantage of phase contrast in x-ray microscopy is shorter exposure times, and is crucial in the hard x-ray regime. Microscopy in the absorption‑contrast region of the water-window (2. 34 - 4. 37 nm) also benefits from these optics. The development of the optics for a <b>laboratory</b> soft x-ray <b>microscope</b> spans from theoretical and numerical analysis of coherence and stray light to experimental implementation and testing. The <b>laboratory</b> <b>microscope</b> uses laser-produced plasma-sources in the water-window and is unique in its design and performance. It will be shown that the <b>laboratory</b> <b>microscope</b> {{in its current form}} is a user-oriented and stable instrument, and has been used in a number of applications. The implementation of a cryogenic sample stage for tomographic imaging of biological samples in their natural environment has enabled applications in biology, and 3 D x-ray microscopy of cells was performed {{for the first time with}} a laboratory instrument.  QC 2010113...|$|R

50|$|All {{miniature}} bulbs, {{including some}} LED sets, have a wedge base, though their designs are inconsistent with one another, making it somewhat {{difficult for the}} average consumer to change bulbs. To replace a bulb, the plastic base of the bulb must usually be changed by straightening the two wires and pulling the glass part out. Most <b>replacement</b> <b>bulbs</b> do not even include the bases anymore, despite getting only ten in a package and being charged nearly half {{the price of a}} new string of 100. For this reason, many Americans treat miniature holiday lights as disposable. In addition, colored lights tend to fade with even brief exposure to weather. Many LED sets are permanently wired, with bases that look like conventional pull-out bulbs.|$|R

Our main work was focused on photographing flagellates and infusorians, which are much faster-moving than bacteria.

30|$|Measuring or {{counting}} {{a number}} of morphological traits as demonstrated in Schnittler et al. (2009) quantifies these visible adaptations and allows to relate them to the resource status of the plant, here estimated {{by the size of}} the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb,</b> which carries the plant through the summer dormancy period into the next year (Levichev 1999, 2013). These measurements confirm reports about plant ontogenesis (Peruzzi et al. 2008). Although the age of the plants cannot be determined, the measurements allow to determine threshold (in terms of bulbil size) for the development of seeds and bulbils. For the species of the genus Gagea, the relation between sexual (seeds) and asexual (bulbils) reproduction seems to be a crucial adaptive trait (Schnittler et al. 2013) and is determined by these thresholds (as the diameter of the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> where 50 % of all plants develop the respective structure, Schnittler et al. 2009) and the number of seeds and bulbils. Therefore, resource allocation into seeds and bulbils can be assumed to be under high selective pressure. Several traits should influence the seed/bulbil ratio. First, seeds show a higher desiccation tolerance than bulbils, making them true dormant stages. A second factor, often seen in the genus Gagea, is partial or full sterility caused by high (and especially odd) ploidy levels. This constrains a higher investment into bulbils as the only remaining mode of reproduction. Third, large genome size, as often found in monocotyledonous plants, especially Liliales, (Leitch et al. 2010) tends to complicate meiosis and thus sexual reproduction. Taking these factors into account, species of Gagea in arid habitats should be diploid (or add least have a low even ploidy level) and have small genomes to allow predominant reproduction via seeds as the more drought resistant diaspore type. Indeed, a meta analysis of Liliaceae indicated counter selection against large genomes in arid climates (Carta and Peruzzi 2016).|$|R

30|$|These {{considerations}} {{suggest that}} it is not the failure of bulbils to recruit new plants, but the comparatively high seed production of Gagea graeca that leads to a high genetic diversity of the populations. Seed production should nevertheless face a limit in arid climates: the more and the earlier in ontogenesis resources will be invested in seeds, the lesser resources remain for the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> which guarantees survival of the plant. But the relation volume to surface which we must assume to be an important parameter for desiccation tolerance, decreases with decreasing diameter of the bulb. In contrast to G. bulbifera, where bulbs can hold effectively water via sclerophyllous roots (see Levichev 1999), the bulbs of G. graeca lack this adaptation and may thus face a high risk of desiccation during the long Mediterranean summer. This limits the proportion of resources invested into seeds, since plants with large bulbs can be expected to have a higher chance of survival. Indeed, the average size of the bulbils is higher in G. graeca in comparison to G. bulbifera (3 vs. 2.5  mm), and so is the proportion of nitrogen invested into the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> (62 % vs. 36 %, Table  2). However, figures for relative investment into plant parts cannot be compared directly from two reasons: first, the measurements for G. lutea were obtained at the peak of flowering season, these for G. bulbifera near seed maturation, whereas the measured plants of G. graeca were already completely dried at the time of measurement. Therefore, storage processes may have been not yet completed in the first two species; which should lead to an underestimation of the relative investment into dormant parts (bulbs, bulbils, seeds) but overestimation for vegetative parts in the first two species. Second, G. lutea shows a switch – bulbils and seeds are never found at one plant, which does not allow a direct comparison.|$|R

The widespread launch at retail stores, however, was not until Earth Day, April 22. Although the subsidized price was expected to be $22 in the first year, $15 in the second and $8 in the third, the bulb was initially selling for $50-$60 (without rebates) as of July 2012. As of March, 2013 Home Depot began offering the bulbs for $15 in stores. Many stores sold out, and according to Philips customer service the L-prize bulb has been discontinued.|$|R

One hundred and thirty-six Yanomami patients were studied {{for the presence of}} malaria parasites. Thirty-three patients (24 %) were positive for malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae). Twenty-one (64 %) of the positive patients had < 100 parasites/microl. Both RDTs showed poor sensitivity (24. 2 % for OptiMAL-IT) and 36. 4 % for FalciVax) but good specificity (99 % both for OptiMAL-IT) and FalciVax). Field and laboratory microscopy showed sensitivities of 94 % and 91 %, respectively. The kappa coefficient was 0. 90, indicating a high agreement between field and laboratory microscopy. We conclude that (i) adequate slide reading cannot be substituted by either of the two RDTs in the Venezuelan Amazon and (ii) the use of a light source such as that described above makes slide reading more feasible than hitherto in remote areas without electricity...|$|R
30|$|In {{accordance}} with the general habit of the plants, our {{data suggest that the}} two species from arid environments (Gagea graeca and G. bulbifera), although belonging to divergent clades in phylogenetic trees, are more similar in life history than to G. lutea from a humid climate (Table  2). Not directly accessible is plant age, where the most remarkable differences may be expected. Since in Gagea the plants replace all structures of the vegetation body completely every year, and only the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> survives dormancy periods, only a mark-revisit approach over several years would provide reliable age data. In the field we found for G. graeca only a low proportion (28 %) of non-flowering plants. Looking for the distribution of plants over size classes of 0.25 bulb diameter, the highest number of plants (56) was found for 2.50 – 2.75  mm diam. We therefore assume that G. graeca is a short-lived perennial and may flower and produce seeds already in the second year of its life (see also Peruzzi et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|International audienceNew energy {{efficient}} lighting technologies can significantly reduce household electricity consumption, but adoption has been slow. A unique dataset of German households {{is used in}} this paper to examine the factors associated with the replacement of old incandescent lamps (ILs) with new {{energy efficient}} compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs). The 'rebound' effect of increased lamp luminosity in the transition to energy efficient bulbs is ana-lyzed jointly with the replacement decision to account for household self-selection in bulb-type choice. Results indicate that the EU ban on ILs accelerated the pace of transition to CFLs and LEDs, while storage of bulbs significantly dampened {{the speed of the}} transition. Higher lighting needs and bulb attributes like energy efficiency, environmental friendliness, and durability spur IL replacement with CFLs or LEDs. Electricity gains from new energy efficient lighting are mitigated by 23 % and 47 % increases in luminosity for CFL and LED replacements, respectively. Model results suggest that taking the <b>replacement</b> <b>bulb</b> from storage and higher levels of educa-tion dampen the magnitude of these luminosity rebounds in IL to CFL transitions...|$|R
