5|$|The 1997–98 {{season was}} Manchester United's sixth {{season in the}} Premier League, and their 23rd {{consecutive}} season in the top division of English football.

To make matters worse, United entered March still in contention for a League and European double after opening up a 12-point gap, regardless of the fact that nearest challengers Arsenal had three games in hand. Thus, the season ended with only the Charity Shield in the cabinet.|$|E

(John Wetteland broke the record the next year by saving 24 straight). After keeping his ERA at 0.00 through {{the first two months}} of the season, he was selected to his seventh and final All-Star Game, thereby becoming only the fourth player to be an All-Star for four different teams (after Walker Cooper, George Kell and Goose Gossage). Smith did not fare well for the next month, pushing his ERA {{all the way up to}} 5.40. Regardless, the Angels held a double-digit lead in the division and seemed set for the postseason. Instead, California suffered one of the worst collapses in major league history, blowing the entire double-digit lead in less than six weeks. While the rest of the team was reeling, Smith reverted to his early-season form and pitched fantastically for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> only blowing one save attempt in that span. He finished the season with 37 saves and a 3.47 ERA, which was more than a point higher than the league average.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} half-season with Rovers, Hamilton made only three {{substitute}} appearances {{as the team}} finished fourth in the division. Over the next three seasons, he became a more {{integral part of the}} Blackburn side, playing 70 matches and scoring five goals. In the 1984–85 season, he found his first-team opportunities limited, being given just three starts. He spent the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of the season out on loan at struggling Cardiff City, who were eventually relegated to the Football League Third Division in May 1985 after finishing second-bottom of the Second Division. Upon return from his loan spell in south Wales, Hamilton stayed at Blackburn for one more season, making 33 league appearances and scoring three goals in 1985–86. After a total of 114 league appearances and seven goals for Rovers, he left the club prior to the 1986–87 season and joined Third Division club Wigan Athletic for a fee of £16,000. In his first season, he helped them to a fourth-placed finish and a place in the play-offs.
