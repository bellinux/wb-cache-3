40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a cooperative communication system where transmission is done via relay nodes using rateless codes. The relays have buffers that can queue messages that arrive from the source. While queuing the messages substantially increases the system throughput, it also increases the end-to-end message transmission times {{due to the}} additional queuing delays at the relay nodes. In this paper we suggest a novel load balancing scheme at the relay queues that exploits the unique properties of rateless codes. We show that it can substantially reduce the queuing delays while retaining most of the throughput. We provide – and verify with simulations – a theoretical analysis of this system, a simplifying and accurate approximation, and stability conditions for the system.

40|$|Abstract-Peer-to-peer {{relaying}} {{is commonly}} used in real-time applications to cope with NAT and firewall restrictions and provide better quality network paths. As relaying is not natively supported by the Internet, it is usually implemented at the application layer. Also, in a modern operating system, the processor is shared, so the receive-process-forward process for each relay packet may take {{a considerable amount of}} time if the host is busy handling some other tasks. Thus, if we happen to select a <b>loaded</b> <b>relay</b> node, the relaying may introduce significant delays to the packet transmission time and even degrade the application performance. In this work, based on an extensive set of Internet traces, we pursue an understanding of the processing delays incurred at relay nodes and their impact on the application performance. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) we propose a methodology for measuring the processing delays at any relay node on the Internet; 2) we characterize the workload patterns of a variety of Internet relay nodes; and 3) we show that, serious VoIP quality degradation may occur due to relay processing, thus we have to monitor the processing delays of a relay node continuously to prevent the application performance from being degraded...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a game theoretic <b>relay</b> <b>load</b> {{balancing}} {{and power}} allocationscheme is proposed for downlink transmission in a decode-and-forward orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based cellular relay network. A {{system with a}} base station communicating with multiple users via multiple relays is considered. The relays have limited power, which must be divided among the users they support. In traditional scheme, each relay simply divides its transmit power equally among all its users. Moreover, each user selects the relay with the highest channel gain. In this work, we do not apply the traditional relay scheme. It is because the users are distributed randomly, and by applying the traditional relay selection scheme, it may happen that some relays have more users connected to them than other relays, which results in having unbalanced <b>load</b> among the <b>relays.</b> In order to avoid performance degradation, achieve <b>relay</b> <b>load</b> balancing, and maximize the total data rate of the network, a game theoretic approach is proposed, which efficiently assigns the users to relays.

However, heavy computational <b>load</b> (at <b>relay)</b> and a limited number of SUs (i.e., two) make the bi-directional CR system with multi-antenna relay impractical.
