25|$|The {{injuries}} of {{the survivors}} ranged from light to critical and were inflicted either from gunshots and/or during accidents while fleeing. The victims' ages ranged from the late teens to their 60s. Among the injuries were two women who were friends and employees at a local high school. One of them, a librarian, jumped {{on top of the}} second woman, a schoolteacher, to save her life and was shot through the leg. Both women were ultimately shot, but the woman who was jumped on was able to stand up and pull the fire alarm. Also injured were the cousin of Louisiana Representative Charles Boustany and her husband. Egedahl, the last victim discharged, <b>left</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center on August 14. One victim was shot four times.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers have {{discussed}} {{the presence of a}} theme, with Milton Savage deducing that [...] "track titles would imply an underlying conceptual framework to Wavering Radiant, with 'Hall of the Dead' preceding 'Ghost Key', and 'Threshold of Transformation' closing the album in epic circumstances – Turner, it seems, has <b>left</b> <b>our</b> world behind for exploration of another beyond the lives led by mortal men." [...] Isis releases have always had a thematic basis; as Andrew Rennie dissects, [...] "Isis's four previous full-lengths have clear story arcs, but Wavering Radiant themes are open to interpretation, giving it added appeal." [...] Over time, Turner has become reluctant to divulge the thematic particulars of any given album and on Wavering Radiant he has been equivocal. The act of explaining the thematic basis of an album erodes Turner's [...] "connection" [...] with the music, and he has spoken of how that relationship is something he [...] "wishes to preserve". He also asserts that retaining this synergy with the music allows him to commit more to the album's live performances. Similarly, he has also spoken of how [...] "eople have a tendency to focus on one narrow aspect of the overall concept or misinterpret it." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Salisbury concert, Tim Quy {{left the}} band to pursue other projects.

The letter entitled [...] "For {{the love of}} my people I will not stay silent", called on the church to resist the Camorra's rule, which he called [...] "a form of terrorism". He also denounced the Casalesi clans' business practices: [...] "Extortion that has <b>left</b> <b>our</b> region with no potential for development; kickbacks of 20 per cent on construction projects; illegal drug trafficking, which has created gangs of marginalised youth and unskilled workers at the beck and call of criminal organisations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Federal {{extradition}} hearings {{were held}} to compel the six indicted men to come from Michigan to Illinois for trial. During the hearings, principal witness Sidney Jenks, president of the shipbuilding company that built Eastland, testified that her first owners wanted a fast ship to transport fruit, and he designed one capable of making [...] and carrying 500 passengers. Defense counsel Clarence Darrow asked whether he had ever worried about {{the conversion of the}} ship into a passenger steamer with a capacity of 2,500 or more passengers. Jenks replied, [...] "I {{had no way of knowing}} the quantity of its business after it <b>left</b> <b>our</b> yards... No, I did not worry about the Eastland." [...] Jenks testified that an actual stability test of the ship never occurred, and stated that after tilting to an angle of 45° at launching, [...] "it righted itself as straight as a church, satisfactorily demonstrating its stability." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1839 Semyon Leskov {{lost his}} job through a row and intrigue, having brought upon himself {{the wrath of the}} {{governor}} himself. [...] "So we <b>left</b> <b>our</b> house in Oryol, sold what we had in the city and bought a village with 50 peasants in the Kromy region from general A. I. Krivtsov. The purchase was made mostly on credit, for mother was still hoping to get her five thousand off of Strakhov which never came. The tiny village father had bought was eventually sold for debts," [...] Leskov later remembered. What the Leskovs, with their three sons and two daughters, were left with was a small Panin khutor, one very poor house, a watermill, a garden, two peasants' houses and 40 dessiatins of land. This is where Nikolai had his first experiences with oral folklore and the 'earthy' Russian dialecticisms he would later become famous for reviving in his literary work.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 May 1942 after photographing German destroyers berthed at {{the port}} of Kiel, Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant D. W. Stevenson photographed 'heavy {{construction}} work' near the Peenemünde aerodrome. [...] Later in the month Constance Babington Smith decided the scale was too small ... then something unusual caught my eye ... some extraordinary circular embankments ... I then dismissed the whole thing from my mind. [...] Then a year later on 22 April 1943, Bill White and Ron Prescott in RAF de Havilland Mosquito DZ473 were sent from Leuchars to photograph damage from Allied bombing at the Stettin railyards: [...] "On leaving Stettin, we <b>left</b> <b>our</b> cameras running all down the north coast of Germany, and when the film was developed, it was found to contain pictures of Peenemünde." [...] The Medmenham interpreters studied the elliptical earthworks (originally photographed in May 1942) and noticed an [...] "object" [...] long projecting from what was thought to be a service building, although it had mysteriously disappeared on the next frame.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the fall}} {{campaign}} the Democrats hammered away at other issues, charging that Eisenhower had supposedly <b>left</b> <b>our</b> defenses in a weakened state, allowing the Soviets to pull {{ahead in the}} missile and space races. [...] This charge was to be repeated in the 1960 election and eventually proven false during the succeeding Kennedy administration. [...] Worst of all, for the GOP, the economy was only then just {{coming out of a}} brief, but sharp recession that began in the summer of 1957. [...] By the spring of 1958, industrial production had declined 14 percent and corporate profits fell 25 percent, resulting in unemployment peaking at 7.5 percent. [...] President Eisenhower's popularity, in turn, as measured by the Gallup poll tumbled from 79 percent in early 1957 to his lowest point ever of 52 percent in November 1958. [...] Tracking polls had shown that with the launching of Sputnik in October 1957, which seemingly indicated that the U.S. was behind the Soviets technologically, the Democrats popularity exceeded that of the GOP. [...] Aggravating this trend in the Deep South was the Republican Administration's stand in enforcing desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas that same year. [...] Further, when the average voter was asked by the Gallup Poll what his or her impression was of the Republican Party, the answers were [...] "selfish and rich" [...] and the [...] "businessman's party", while the Democrats were viewed as representing the middle class.|$|E
