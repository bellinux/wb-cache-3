The core of the framework consists of a virtualized operating system and an emulated hardware platform integrated with a general purpose network simulator ns- 3. Besides an ability of experimenting with the real code base as in the real deployments our framework allows testing the boundary effects of different hardware components {{on the performance of}} distributed applications and protocols. All in all the presented framework allows to substantially shorten the development cycle of WSN applications. Godkänd; 2013; 20130304 (<b>lauril...</b>|$|E

However, cost-benefit of deploying traditional ITS is retarded by expensive equipment, infrastructure, installation and maintenance. The demo presents a replica of a real world experimental ITS application using recently proposed Road Surface Network architecture. The demonstrated "intelligent roundabout'' application is intended to warn and inform drivers about an upcoming roundabout and to prevent driving straight into collision. We show a lab prototype system consisting of: an authentic sensor node platform enabled for car detection, secure multihop communications and the running light application, a base station with system control center.

These results are related to the identification of the design principles of dependable networking mechanisms for WSANs. In our work, and hence, in this deliverable, we follow the layered model of networking protocol stacks: We identify the most important dependability concepts and models at the physical, MAC (Medium Access Control), routing, and transport layers, and we analyze existing networking protocols from the different layers proposed in the literature with respect to the identified dependability properties.

For this purpose we present a general design flow to help engineering WSAN applications. The semantic centreis a knowledge base it allows to describe requirements, environment, components and the whole system. The presented model-driven scheme as part of the component description is able to predict the properties of theoverall system based on static properties of components in context of the given environment. For more complex dynamic properties a novel simulation approach is presented that combines network simulations with actual properties of the operating system and the software stack. Operations of the development flow are supported by various tools. First examples indicate the effectiveness of the proposed design flow and promiseto improve engineering of WSAN system in future.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} a new {{methodology for}} the systematic composition of {{wireless sensor networks}} utilizing component-based modeling of MAC protocols. The methodology is intended for the use in applications that have a predefined topology and traffic pattern while requiring dependable performance, which is typical for critical infrastructures. The need for such methodology stems from the variety of applications with different performance and dependability requirements {{on the one hand}} and unavailability of unified system architectures for sensor networks on the other. The paper suggests a work flow for the composition of protocols where the performance requirements and characteristics of the installation environment are used in the selection for components and their parametrization. It is shown how different instances of MAC protocols (known as monolithic solutions) could be achieved by different parameterizations of an abstract MAC model. For the selection of the components and parameterizations deterministic models for the communication process are suggested in order to quantify the significance of parameters and components for the performance. The quantification is expected to be achieved using concept from the areas of control structure design and performance limitations in control theory. Godkänd; 2009; 20090831 (<b>lauril...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{need for}} mobility {{has led to}} transportation problems like congestion, accidents and pollution. In order to provide safe and efficient transport systems great efforts are currently being put into developing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and cooperative systems. In this paper we extend proposed solutions with autonomous on-road sensors and actuators forming a wireless Road Surface Network (RSN). We present the RSN architecture and design methodology and demonstrate its applicability to queue-end detection. For the use case we discuss the requirements and technological solutions to sensor technology, data processing and communication. In particular the MAC protocol is detailed and its performance assessed through theoretical verification. The RSN architecture is shown to offer a scalable solution, where increased node density offers more precise sensing as well as increased redundancy for safety critical applications. The use-case demonstrates that RSN solutions may be deployed as standalone systems potentially integrated into current and future ITS. RSN may provide both easily deployable and cost effective alternatives to traditional ITS (with a direct impact independent of penetration rate of other ITS infrastructures - i. e., smart vehicles, safe spots etc.) {{as well as provide}} fine grain sensory information directly from the road surface to back-end and cooperative systems, thus enabling a wide range of ITS applications beyond current state of the art.

40|$|Most of {{the current}} IT-infrastructures at Universities were {{designed}} and deployed at times of mostly campus based education, following the "one solution fits all" approach. Nowadays, with {{the growing number of}} courses given on distance and unique requirements on software content in almost every course in all disciplines the existing infrastructure became extremely stiff and inefficient. In many cases it fails providing flexible services with acceptable quality both to teachers and students. Another problem appears with the all growing mobility of students in the scope of Erasmus Mundus programme and numerous bilateral agreements between universities. The uncertainty in number of students to be handled in each semester (even in the scope of a particular course) makes it difficult for the IT departments to estimate the need and to correspondingly dimension the IT-system. Normally, IT administrations at universities over-dimension their infrastructures in order to stay competitive and provide satisfactory quality of experience. This obviously leads to an increased cost associated with purchasing and maintaining the equipment. Besides the economical component the environmental impact becomes one of the critical factors that universities have to deal with nowadays. Universities as governmental organizations need to take environmental considerations into account when implementing European Union policies on ICT sustainability. Cloud technology and specifically infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers is an excellent alternative to an outdated inefficient local infrastructures. Early 2012 Luleå University of Technology started a project on adopting cloud technology for implementing the university's IT-infrastructure. This work-in-progress article will describe the results of its pre-study phase aiming at understanding a feasibility of integrating and/or migrating key infrastructure components into an IaaS system and opening ways for making university's resources more accessible to wider public. Numbers of logistical, technical and education related challenges, however, make such transition far from being trivial. This article focuses on the educational aspect of the pre-study. Specifically, work flows in education process of several courses in different disciplines in natural and engineering sciences were analysed from the student and teacher perspectives. In the article a schematic of a sustainable IT infrastructure adjusted to the needs of higher education will be drafted. Further, technical readiness and challenges of using cloud technology for university scale IT-infrastructure will be discussed. Godkänd; 2014; 20130618 (<b>lauril...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the surface tension of calcium hydroxide (CH) associated with different substances (deionized distilled water, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, 2 % chlorhexidine digluconate, Otosporin, 3 % sodium lauryl ether sulphate; Furacin, PMC Furacin) using tensiometer. The action of the substances studied on the dentinal structure enhances the property of surface tension. This method consists in the application of force to separate a platinum ring immersed in the substances. Thus, torsion was applied to the screw until the platinum ring separated during substances testing. Considering the methodology applied, the following can be concluded: distilled water alone or associated with CH presented a high surface tension (70. 00 and 68. 40 dynes/cm); calcium hydroxide in association with anionic detergent showed low surface tension (31. 60 dynes/cm); camphorated paramonochlorophenol plus CH presented low surface tension (37. 50 dynes/cm); 2 % chlorhexidine associated with calcium hydroxide showed high surface tension values (58. 00 dynes/cm); Otosporin plus calcium hydroxide showed low surface tension (35. 40 dynes/cm); paramonochlorophenol Furacin mixed with calcium hydroxide presented surface tension equal to 45. 50 dynes/cm; sodium hypochlorite presented high surface tension (75. 00 dynes/cm). Antimicrobial agents more indicated in endodontics, i. e. CH, chlorhexidine and hypochlorite, presented the highest surface tension.

40|$|O alisamento químico é o método mais empregado para melhorar a penteabilidade e a estilização de cabelos afro-étnicos. O cabelo é composto basicamente de três partes: cutícula, córtex e medula. O {{principal}} constituinte é uma proteína, a queratina. O tratamento com agente alcalino, redutor e/ou oxidante, provoca modificações nessa estrutura, ocasionando danos que podem ocorrer na camada superficial (cutícula) ou em toda a fibra, atingindo inclusive o córtex e modificando as propriedades físico-químicas do cabelo, pois o torna mais quebradiço, frágil, sem brilho, áspero e com mais dificuldade para ser penteado e desembaraçado. O emprego de agentes condicionadores auxilia na melhora dos atributos físicos e sensoriais do cabelo tornando-o mais resistente e facilitando o manuseio. Neste estudo foi preparado um creme-base alisante com tioglicolato de amônio acrescido de agentes condicionadores pré-escolhidos e adicionados no momento do uso. A formulação-base foi submetida ao estudo de estabilidade física por dois meses. Foram realizados testes de: quantificação da perda de proteína equivalente em albumina, empregando-se o método de Lowry modificado por Peterson; penteabilidade e tração de ruptura. Os resultados indicaram que a adição de óleo de jojoba e de silicones, como <b>Lauril</b> PEG/PPG 18 / 18 meticona e Ciclopentasiloxano (e) PEG- 12 polímero de dimeticone reticulado, melhoram os atributos físico-químicos e sensoriais das mechas de cabelo afro-étnico, sendo indicado como agentes condicionadores que poderão ser acrescidos à formulação do creme-base alisante. Chemical hair relaxing is {{the most}} common used method to improve combability and styling on afro-ethnic hair. The hair is basically composed of three parts: cuticle, cortex and medulla. The main basic element is a protein, the keratin. The treatment with an alkaline reducing agent and/or an oxidant agent causes modifications in this structure, and related damages that can occur in the superficial layer (cuticle) through ali the fiber, reaching the cortex and modifying the physical-chemical properties of the hair. In that case, the hair becomes more fragile, it has no shine, gets rough and it is very difficulty to comb and to detangle it. Conditioning agents can improve the physical and sensorial attributes of the hair, thus allowing it to become more resistant and making it easier to take care of. In this study a hair straightener cream-base with ammonium thioglycolate was prepared and the selected conditioning agents added at the moment of the use. The straightener cream-base was submitted to the physical stability study for two months. The tests had been carried through: quantification of protein loss of albumine equivalent, using the Lowry method modified by Peterson; the combability and rupture traction. The results have indicated that the addition of Jojoba oil and silicones as Lauryl PEG/PPG- 18 / 18 methicone; and Cyclopentasiloxane (and) PEG- 12 dimethicone crosspolymer, improve the physical-chemical and sensorial attributes of the afro-ethnic hair tresses, being indicated as conditioning agents that could be added in a hair straighteners cream formulation to help its care...|$|E
40|$|Clouds, Communicating Machines, Social Networking, Big Data, {{innovative}} web-services are {{the buzz}} words that currently ramp up {{the interest in}} computer science education amongst potential students. The current trend in CS education is to introduce an innovation component into the content of undergraduate and graduate courses facilitating {{out of the box}} thinking. In the fall of 2012 the content of three undergraduate courses running in parallel at Luleå University of Technology were aligned in the theoretical and practical parts projecting the individual contents to a holistic scenario of the Internet of Things. The practical goal of the trial was to provide skills of developing innovative, cutting-edge IT solutions. The trial courses were: Wireless sensor networks, Distributed applications, and Network programming. The first two courses are given on the fourth year while the later course is given on the second year of the CS program. The theoretical content of three courses allowed creating a scenario covering the whole technology chain of the Internet of Things: gathering and communicating sensory data; scalable and distributed processing of big data; value-added, human relevant network services. In the practical part students in the three courses (total 60) acted as start-up companies in the respective technology domain. These ``start-ups'' were assigned a task to deliver a common holistic system given time, performance and budget constrains. This task required students in a particular course to constantly communicate to other students outside the course's boundaries. Through these activities students were trained on skills for industrial level development and integration of complex IT systems. On a technical side all courses were conducted using Amazon Web Services as a common computing platform. This choice allowed us to draw interesting conclusions about students work load, the degree of their actual involvement in the learning process as well as economical costs. In the sensor network course a pedagogy-oriented, close-to-reality, real-time simulation environment was used to substantially facilitate experimentation with large quantities of communicating sensors. Using AWS as a platform for the other two courses gave students a possibility of experimenting with hundreds of servers while training the skills in developing commercial scale software. As a result of evaluations in the respective courses we conjecture that the goal of the trial is successfully achieved. The innovative component was highly valued by the majority of students. Most of the students confirmed that exposing them to the ``big picture'' and product-based learning substantially increased their involvement and motivation in the learning process. On the technical side several non-conventional applications of the theoretical content were observed in all three courses. One of the successful resulting systems featured a unique integration of real-time sensory data with a popular social network. The full article will describe the details of the courses' structure along with the associated logistical and technical challenges. We present the illustrative achievements as well as the analysis of students' feedback. The article will be concluded with the discussion of learned positive and negative lessons put in the context of recent theories in CS education. Godkänd; 2014; 20130618 (<b>lauril...</b>|$|E

The study of the interaction of porphyrin with the micelles was performed using the techniques of optical absorption and electrochemistry. The experimental results obtained of spectroscopy measurements show that both in acidic and in alkaline medium, a shift of the spectrum of porphyrin to longer wavelengths and a isosbestic point at 433 nm and 437 nm for the acid and basic medium respectively, caused by protonation and deprotonation of the porphyrin. There was an effective interaction between the porphyrin and the SDS micelles. In the presence of CTAB micelles and BRIJ 78 no significant changes and the concentrations of HCl and NaOH suggesting no interaction of porphyrin with the surfactant CTAB, and a small interaction with surfactant BRIJ. The voltammetric results showed that the effect of substituents can affect the peaks of oxidation and reduction and as a result alter the energy required to oxidize or reduce the TMPyP. A similar behaviour of porphyrin in buffer was observed. In the presence of SDS micelles, the porphyrins have energies of GAP- like porphyrin in buffer. Already in the presence of micelles of CTAB and BRJ 78 the energies of GAP were lower. Thus, the results indicate that there is an effective interaction with the SDS micelle, a small interaction with the micelle BRIJ and no interaction with the micelle of CTAB.
