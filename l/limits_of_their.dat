5|$|The Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) is {{a common}} species of wren that is a {{resident}} in {{the eastern half of}} the United States of America, the extreme south of Ontario, Canada, and the extreme northeast of Mexico. Severe winters restrict the northern <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests, farm edges and suburban areas. This wren is the state bird of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The woodland's {{position}} on the transition zone between the wheatbelt and the jarrah forest determines amphibian populations, with several species existing at the eastern or western <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range. Herpetofauna includes the western marsh frog (or golden flecked burrowing frog, Heleioporus barycragus) which is generally restricted to the western Darling Range. There are at least 98 species of bird in the woodland, including the almost flightless malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|E
5|$|The crisis showed Muhammad {{that many}} of his men had reached the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying to pay for their {{defection}} and offering them a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiating with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement, protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased.|$|E

5|$|The {{living and}} {{economic}} activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot. The larger settlements {{could have had}} over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents, but more typically there were just several homes {{with no more than}} 30 inhabitants. From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses. As the Germanic people before them, the Slavs left vacant regions between developed areas for separation from strangers and to avoid conflicts, especially along the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tribal territories.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the late}} spring of 1940, Fighter Command had been {{preparing}} to meet a possible air attack on the British Isles coming only from due east, from Germany itself; prior to the German victory in Western Europe. The possibility that France might fall and Britain would continue to fight on had not been considered. An air attack from Germany meant the Luftwaffe's bombers would operate beyond the range of their fighters and be vulnerable to attack. If twin-engine fighters, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110s were used, they would be fighting at the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{breeding area}} {{depends on the}} presence of waters that are free of sea ice during the breeding season. Therefore, while Greenland and Spitsbergen offer suitable breeding sites, the arctic regions have summers that are too short to allow the northern gannets to lay their eggs and raise a brood, which requires between 26 and 30 weeks. The southern <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> distribution mainly depends {{on the presence of}} sufficient prey.|$|R

5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount Hope at 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow blindness and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, {{he had to be}} carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1942, the 2/33rd {{deployed}} to New Guinea, where the Kokoda Track campaign was reaching its climax as the Japanese advanced on Port Moresby. Embarking on the Katoomba in late August, they landed at Port Moresby on 9 September. Four {{days later the}} battalion was thrown into battle against the Japanese around Ioribaiwa, leading the 25th Brigade forward. As the Japanese advance continued, the Australians withdrew back to Imita Ridge. As the 25th Brigade withdrew, the 2/33rd formed a rearguard, covering the withdrawal. After completing the movement rearwards, the battalion subsequently assumed a position in depth on the right. The Japanese then began to withdraw, having reached the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supply line, and the Australians pursued {{them back to the}} beachheads on the northern coast where the Japanese had originally landed in July. Throughout October and November, the battalion fought significant engagements at Myola and Gorari, before being thrown into further fighting around Gona in late November and early December. Casualties were heavy, {{and by the time the}} Japanese beachhead had been destroyed, the battalion was withdrawn to Port Moresby, the battalion had been reduced to only two companies; early in January 1943, the main body of 2/33rd returned to Australia upon the transports Both and Duntroon. The rear detail followed in the middle of the month aboard the Taroona. Total casualties sustained by the 2/33rd during this period had included 46 dead and 121 wounded.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the history}} written prior to the 1950s had a {{distinctive}} racist slant to it. By the 1970s and 1980s, historians were using archaeological records, black folklore, and statistical data to develop a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Individuals were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of their activities, within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> situation and despite its precariousness. Historians who wrote in this era include John Blassingame (Slave Community), Eugene Genovese (Roll, Jordan, Roll), Leslie Howard Owens (This Species of Property), and Herbert Gutman (The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} high ambient {{temperatures}} on the behaviour of Magpies (Pica pica) was assessed in northern Cyprus, which marks the southern <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> European range. Magpies actively selected their thermal environment when temperatures rose above 31 C, by retreating to shaded areas. On {{days when the}} temperature was higher, Magpies appeared {{to spend more time}} perched in the shade and less time foraging. Flying and foraging activities were generally restricted to cooler parts of the day. Magpies were rarely seen panting or drinking and gular fluttering was not observed. We suggest that utilisation of shade is important for Magpies to regulate their body temperature, allowing them to remain common at the southern <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range despite experiencing high temperatures...|$|R
