25|$|The parish saw {{a little-known}} skirmish. On 14 June 1497 the first Cornish Rebellion was {{launched}} against Henry VII, the rebels were marching from Cornwall, to Kent unbeknown to the King, and having already passed Guildford, had a skirmish {{with some of}} the outposted royal troops on the road from Guildford to London. The troops fell back or were outmanoeuvred, for they had lost the rebels on the 16th and were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> on the Portsmouth Road again near Kingston when they were actually on the border of Kent. Old maps mark the place where the road crosses the stream which joins the Wey near Send as St. Thomas's Waterings.|$|E

25|$|On {{one visit}} to Benalla in 1876, Dan {{was arrested for}} {{stealing}} a saddle. The police let him go when they could not get enough evidence. Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They {{had gone to a}} shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door. They were charged with violent assault, damage to property (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth £113.

In court, the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth £10.|$|E
25|$|Navajo scouts {{accompanied}} the United States Army when it investigated many civilian-Navajo confrontations. For example, between June 14 and September 28, 1883 {{there were five}} different Navajo reservation related activities. Lieutenant Parker, with ten enlisted men and two scouts, {{went up to the}} San Juan River to separate Navajos and citizens who encroached on Navajo land. Lieutenant Guy, with seventeen enlisted men and two scouts, and Captain Smith, with 56 enlisted men and five scouts helped the local Indian agent deal with unhappy Navajo chiefs. This involved Manuelito, Torlino, Grando Muncho and fifty armed Navajos who were upset by raids of citizens and other tribes on their people and livestock. In another action: Lieutenant Lockett, with forty-two enlisted men, were joined by Lieutenant Holomon at Navajo Springs. Evidently a citizen named Houck and or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son and 100 armed Navajos were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> It is evident from these four months of military reports from the field that the officers tended to trust the Navajo version of events.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, she {{published}} an autobiography where she detailed how she met Constanzo and the group, her experiences {{when she was}} allegedly taken hostage by Constanzo, her mistreatment by authorities, and her versions of the story. Aldrete claimed she visited Constanzo in Mexico City and was then taken hostage after Constanzo decided to not let her go because he believed that {{she would go to}} the police and tell them where they were hiding. She claimed that Constanzo {{and the rest of the}} group were unaware of the killings that occurred in Matamoros until they found out that the police was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> but went into hiding nonetheless because they feared for their lives. She detailed her alleged mistreatments in jail, and how she underwent beatings, psychological torture, rape, and an unfair trial. Her version of Constanzo's death was different than the official one; she stated that Constanzo was executed by the police when they raided the apartment. She also questioned the police's decision to burn down the shack in Santa Elena, since it was crucial for the investigation and probably contained the fingerprints of the murderers.|$|E

25|$|In the end, five American battleships were sunk, {{three were}} damaged, and eleven other cruisers, destroyers, and {{auxiliaries}} were sunk or seriously damaged. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately dive and torpedo bombers, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so {{the commander of the}} First Air Fleet, Naval Lieutenant-General Chuichi Nagumo, withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu. Nagumo had absolutely no idea where the American carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Much has been made of Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot, he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E

Just before the prison warden reveals who set them up, Kirk and McCoy are beamed aboard Enterprise by Captain Spock, who had assumed command and undertaken an investigation in Kirk's absence.
