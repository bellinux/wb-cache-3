5|$|Codex Alexandrinus {{was written}} a {{generation}} after codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, {{but it may}} still belong to the fourth century. It cannot be <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the fifth. Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 5th century.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are stored in a position <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that Nicholas was born <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 1230s, as he was styled Magister by 1259, indicating that by that date he possessed a Master's degree. It was rare for someone under twenty years old or even older to have such a qualification in this period. The university or universities he attended are not known.|$|E

5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{published}} in November 2006 suggested that Education Secretary Alan Johnson was exploring ways {{to raise the}} school leaving age in England to 18, just over 40 years <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> last rise in 1972, pointing to the decline in unskilled jobs {{and the need for}} young people to be equipped for modern day employment.|$|E
5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' {{influence}} has been found or suspected {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him. Almost all that he wrote seems to have disappeared within two centuries, though, so it is unlikely that any writer <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 2nd centuryBC read any but a few of his lines.|$|E

5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, {{who reached}} Eldamar <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a {{different}} but closely related tongue, usually called Telerin. It {{was seen by}} some Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya. This {{was not the case}} with the Teleri for whom their tongue was distinct from Quenya. After the Vanyar left the city of Túna, Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer.|$|E
5|$|The Srikula (family of Sri) {{tradition}} (sampradaya) focuses worship on Devi in {{the form}} of the goddess Lalita-Tripura Sundari, who is regarded as the Great Goddess (Mahadevi). Rooted in first-millennium Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir Valley, Srikula became a force in South India no <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> seventh century, and is today the prevalent form of Shaktism practiced in South Indian regions such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Tamil areas of Sri Lanka.|$|E

5|$|Áed, Constantine's father, succeeded Constantine's {{uncle and}} namesake ConstantineI in 876 but {{was killed in}} 878. Áed's short reign is glossed as being of no {{importance}} by most king lists. Although the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, ConstantineII cannot have been born any <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> year after his father's death, that is 879. His name may suggest that he was born rather earlier, {{during the reign of}} his uncle ConstantineI.|$|E
5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|After {{the date}} of the writ of {{election}} and at least two clear days before nomination day, a candidate or prospective candidate must provide the Registrar of Political Donations with a report stating all the donations received from permissible donors that amount to at least $10,000 received during the 12 months preceding the declaration mentioned in the next sentence. He must also submit to the Registrar a declaration stating, to the best of his knowledge and belief, that he did not receive any other donations required to be mentioned in the donation report, and that only donations from permissible donors or allowable anonymous donations were accepted. If this paperwork is in order, the Registrar will issue a political donation certificate not <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> eve of nomination day stating that the candidate has complied with the provisions of the Act.|$|E

5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the extinction of the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings had been made as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that the extinction of the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> novel.|$|E
5|$|Djibouti {{received}} a universality invitation from FINA {{to send a}} male swimmer to the Olympics. Bourhan Abro, a son of diplomant Ahmed Abro, competed in the men's 50 m freestyle at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium. He has competed for Djibouti in swimming at other international competitions. Abro arrived at Rio <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest of the delegation and joined them there. Abro competed in the second heat and finished {{with a time of}} 27.13, placing 74th among 85 competitors. He needed a time of 22.10 to advance to the semifinals.|$|E

5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder {{seems to have been}} widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|If the Community Committee {{accepts a}} {{community}} declaration, it must then refer the declaration {{to the appropriate}} Community Sub-Committee for consideration. If the Community Sub-Committee concludes that the declarant belongs to that community, it must issue a community certificate to the applicant. Otherwise, it must inform the declarant in writing that the application has been rejected. The decision must be communicated to the declarant no <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> eve of nomination day. All decisions of the Community Committee and its Sub-Committees are final, and a community certificate is conclusive of the matters it certifies– they {{are not subject to}} appeal or review in any court.|$|E
5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no <b>later</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
