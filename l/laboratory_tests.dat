40|$|SummaryIntroductionLaboratory {{testing and}} {{reporting}} are error-prone and redundant due to repeated, unnecessary requests and delayed or missed reactions to laboratory reports. Occurring errors may negatively affect the patient treatment process and clinical decision making. Evaluation on <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> and <b>Laboratory</b> Information System (LIS) {{may explain the}} root cause to improve the testing process and enhance LIS in supporting the process. This paper discusses a new evaluation framework for LIS that encompasses the <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> cycle and the socio-technical part of LIS. MethodologyLiterature review on discourses, dimensions and evaluation methods of <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> and LIS. A critical appraisal of the Total Testing Process (TTP) and the human, organization, technology-fit factors (HOT-fit) evaluation frameworks was undertaken {{in order to identify}} error incident, its contributing factors and preventive action pertinent to <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> process and LIS. ResultA new evaluation framework for LIS using a comprehensive and socio-technical approach is outlined. Positive relationship between laboratory and clinical staff resulted in a smooth <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> process, reduced errors and increased process efficiency whilst effective use of LIS streamlined the testing processes. ConclusionThe TTP-LIS framework could serve as an assessment as well as a problem-solving tool for the <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> process and system...|$|R

5|$|<b>Laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> {{have shown}} that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E

A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E

It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus.

The results of the ASPS Vernier System (AVS) pointing stability tests conducted in a laboratory environment are documented.

The AVS and the suspension were modelled and incorporated into a simulation of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>test.</b> Error sources were identified and pointing stability sensitivities were determined via simulation.

The successful prediction of <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> results provides increased confidence in the analytical understanding of the AVS magnetic bearing technology and allows confident prediction of in-flight performance.

5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume.
