5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
