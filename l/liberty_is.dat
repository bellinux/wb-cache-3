5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of <b>liberty</b> <b>is</b> the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of <b>liberty</b> <b>is</b> the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of <b>liberty</b> <b>is</b> the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of <b>liberty</b> <b>is</b> the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

5|$|Extracts of {{the speech}} {{appeared}} in The New Yorker on June 10. Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that <b>liberty</b> <b>is</b> safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{part of the}} Millfield estate {{south of}} Tyburn Road (now Oxford Street), the street was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and was laid out around 1704. It was a fashionable address in the 18th century, but its {{character}} changed to commercial and retail use {{by the end of}} the 19th. Most of the street's original buildings have since been demolished. Great Marlborough Street has had an association with the law since the late-18th century; Marlborough Street Magistrates Court subsequently became one of the most important magistrates courts in London. The department store <b>Liberty</b> <b>is</b> on the corner of Great Marlborough Street with Regent Street and sports a Mock Tudor facade.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} store <b>Liberty</b> <b>is</b> {{on the corner}} of Great Marlborough Street and Regent Street. The founder, Arthur Lasenby Liberty, was unable to expand or modernise the existing shop front due to Crown planning restrictions, so he bought numerous properties on Great Marlborough Street in 1925, and rebuilt them in a Mock Tudor design {{as an extension of the}} store. It was Grade II* listed in 1972. Palladium House was built {{on the corner of}} Great Marlborough Street and Argyll Street in 1928 by Raymond Hood and Gordon Jeeves. It featured an Art Deco design inspired by the Paris Exhibition of 1925 and was extended in 1935. It is now a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|These {{fundamental}} rights help {{not only in}} protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal <b>liberty</b> <b>is</b> available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of <b>Liberty</b> <b>is</b> directly opposite the III, and the Mint had trouble getting the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{courts of}} law make {{judgments}} about whether individuals are acting {{under their own}} free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics.

So for example Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, and the Stoic Chrysippus.|$|E
