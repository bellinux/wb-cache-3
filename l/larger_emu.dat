Forecast error variance decomposition results show that the real estate markets of <b>larger</b> <b>EMU</b> economies (Germany, France, Netherlands) became more integrated with other European markets after the establishment of the EMU in 1999. By contrast, increased real estate market integration is not found for some smaller EMU economies (Belgium and Spain).

40|$|Has the {{formation}} of the European Monetary Union reduced the impact of national borders on cross-border market convergence? This paper extends Engel and Rogers (1996) well known work on border effects to cities across Western Europe over the period 1995 oe 2002 and finds two key results. First, cross-border relative prices tend to be more volatile than prices between locations not separated by a border. This result is robust to a variety of potential explanations for border effects, such as uneven sampling bias, idiosyncratic price shocks, and incomplete exchange rate-pass through. Turning our attention to cross-border price volatility before and after {{the formation}} of the EMU, the effects vary by country size. Within the EMU, cross-border price volatility has not changed between the —small“ countries, but has fallen significantly between the <b>large</b> <b>EMU</b> countries. Between the EMU and the UK, cross-border volatility has increased between the UK and the small EMU countries, but there has been no significant change between the UK and the <b>large</b> <b>EMU</b> countries. These results are consistent with the fact that exchange rates are more likely to adjust to price differentials between small countries than between large countries. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} in {{addition}} to fiscal rules in the European Monetary Union (EMU), some support can be found from financial markets to keep rising public debt in check. EMU likely has an overall positive impact on the ability of both markets and market participants for EMU government bonds to price such securities correctly, which would in turn discipline profligate EMU governments. However, apart from fiscal rules like the Stability and Growth Pact, some regulatory issues will still have to be addressed to ascertain the functioning of markets for EMU government bonds. It is concluded that regulatory efforts should concentrate on competition policy by the EU Commission in Brussels for EMU financial markets and banks, as well as on an EMU-wide authority for the ECB in Frankfurt to monitor and combat systemic risk. However, the Basel accords on capital requirements for banks should not be made legally binding, since leaving risk-taking and risk measurement to banks individually likely helps overcome competitive distortions in a <b>larger</b> <b>EMU</b> capital market. monetary union, fiscal stability, banking system, banking regulation...|$|E

However, it generally does not encompass country-specific money overhang measures as predictors of inflation. Hence, aggregate money overhang is an important, but by far not an exhaustive, indicator for the disaggregate level...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{operation}} of national coordinated wage-bargaining systems in EMU has produced low inflation rates, EMU-wide inflation has been above the ECB target rate for the last 3 years. By contrast, under the ERM, inflation rates declined steadily after 1992 to below 2 per cent in both the last 2 years of the regime. It is argued {{that this was the}} consequence of two low-inflation incentives under ERM: (i) the Maastricht inflation condition for EMU entry; and (ii) the combination of the Bundesbank threat to raise interest rates if German wage and price inflation rose above acceptable limits, linked to the need for other ERM members to follow low German inflation to stay within the exchange-rate bands. These incentives no longer operate under EMU, where individual economies do not have an incentive to contribute to low EMU-wide inflation.

Most discussions focus on the costs of forsaking monetary autonomy – that countries which give up a separate national currency give up recourse to an independent monetary response to economic shocks.

These two shock scenarios are implemented into the QUEST model of the European Commission for the three largest Euro area countries—France, Germany and Italy. For both types of shocks we analyze the response of the economy under two alternative fiscal rules: (a) no SGP rule and (b) the SGP rule. Sticking to the SGP rule would have been advantageous (at least in the long-run) in case of the supply shock. In the case of a symmetric demand shock (a quick downturn, followed by an equivalent upturn) the SGP rule would have been neutral over the cycle, although harmful in the very short-run...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{economic}} forecasts {{increase the}} probability that firstly, the EMU can start as planned on January 1, 1999 and secondly, that it will start with {{a large group of}} countries. The economic implications of the artificially unification of "hard-currency" and "soft-currency" countries are analysed by means of macroeconomic model simulations. The results of a <b>large</b> "non-optimal" <b>EMU</b> are as expected. On the one hand, there are positive income effects for all countries � although unevenly distributed over the participants � on the other hand, the internal (inflation) and external (value of the Euro vis-à-vis the Dollar) stability are at risk. The "hard-currency" group will be the major winner (in terms of real GDP and employment), whereas the "soft-currency" group has to carry the adjustment costs to a regime of fixed exchange rates (Euro) which results in slower growth, decline in employment and a deterioration of their budgetary position. The necessary convergence of prices and interest rates leads to an increase (decrease) of inflation and interest rates in the "hard-currency" countries ("soft-currency" countries). If the EMU will start with a large group there will be a tendency to devalue the Euro against the Dollar. As a consequence of the uneven economic performance of a <b>large</b> (non-optimal) <b>EMU</b> I would suggest to start the EMU with a core group of "hard-currency" countries.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{international}} monetary system will evolve into a bipolar structure consisting of a dollar area and a euro area, each of which attracting other countries to their gravitational centers. A deepening and widening of NAFTA and the EU will enlarge the sphere of influence of both currencies; trade wars will restrict them. The yen is a big question mark. The deep and still unresolved financial crisis in Japan works against the enlargement of the yen; deregulation of its financial markets, with the attendant decline in transaction costs, goes in the opposite direction. Our conclusion is that the yen area will be {{much smaller than the}} dollar and the euro area and, consequently, the two large blocs will shape the international monetary system of the 21 st century in a critical way.

The first series of tests (σ-tests) are that standard deviations and/or coefficients of variation of cross-sections of national measures are diminishing over time, relative to a group of non-EMU countries. Evidence of convergence was found for inflation rates, short- and long-term nominal interest rates, and ex post real short-term rates, but not for real per capita GDP.
