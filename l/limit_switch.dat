25|$|In May 2009, four {{children}} became ill when the attraction failed {{to stop at}} the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an emergency stop switch due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> were to fail.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this design}} could present a {{challenge}} to one who is troubleshooting a convertible top malfunction. The system consists of a spiderweb of solenoids, relays, <b>limit</b> <b>switches,</b> electric motors, a hydraulic pump/reservoir, hydraulic directional valves and cylinders.

50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot air furnace that uses three {{thermostatic}} switches for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or <b>limit</b> <b>switch)</b> opens the stoker circuit when {{the air in the}} furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective {{of the fact that the}} room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three thermostatic switches, not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the fan switch and the <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It must be {{held that}} Minneapolis-Honeywell has been so using its patent as to tend to create a {{monopoly}} in an unpatented device. Minneapolis-Honeywell has been licensing others and has offered to license Mercoid to manufacture, use and sell a single device which embodies within itself two elements of the Freeman patent, namely, the two thermostats which are placed in the furnace hood, one being the fan switch and the other being the <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> This device, embodying these two elements, is [...] [...] [...] an unpatented device. The Freeman patent is not a patent on either the fan switch or the <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> or both of them. It is a patent on a system of furnace control, which requires three thermostats for its operation. It happens that two of those thermostats are a fan switch and a <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> The court is {{of the opinion that}} it follows, from what has been said, that both complaints, that of Mercoid and that of Minneapolis-Honeywell, must be dismissed for want of equity.|$|E

50|$|Inductors {{are also}} {{employed}} in electrical transmission systems, {{where they are}} used to <b>limit</b> <b>switching</b> currents and fault currents. In this field, they are more commonly referred to as reactors.|$|R
50|$|Switches can be {{designed}} to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a float switch), the turning of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (a <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> or microswitch), or presence of a magnetic field (the reed switch). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a sail switch ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. Pressure switches respond to fluid pressure.|$|E

50|$|The Turn-OFF {{switching}} transient of silicon-based power bipolar semiconductor devices, caused by stored {{charge in the}} device during the forward conduction state, <b>limits</b> <b>switching</b> speed of the device, which in turn limits {{the efficiency of the}} application it is used within.|$|R
50|$|Many linear {{encoders}} include built-in limit switches; either optical or magnetic. Two <b>limit</b> <b>switches</b> {{are frequently}} included such that on power-up the controller can {{determine if the}} encoder is at an end-of-travel and in which direction to drive the axis.|$|R

50|$|Automation Master {{connects to}} the Control System/PLC and emulates the real world I/O by reading and writing the PLC's {{internal}} I/O images. The simulator can receive the Control System/PLC's outputs, and respond with the inputs in real time {{without the need for}} any hard-wired physical I/O.A simulator emulates the real time response to the Control System/PLC actions based upon a model which duplicates the operation of the automated system. For example, if the Control System/PLC sets a digital output to start a motor to raise a door, the model, within milliseconds, provides the Control System/PLC with an auxiliary contact closure to indicate that the motor has been started. Shortly, the door closed <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> is turned off as the door begins to rise. As long as, the Control System/PLC keeps on the output signal which raises the door, the door in the model continues to rise. When the door is fully open, the model turns on the door open <b>limit</b> <b>switch,</b> and the PLC responds by turning off the motor which raised the door. The model sees the Control System/PLC turn off the motor and drops out the motor's auxiliary contact.|$|E
50|$|Measuring {{devices and}} {{instruments}} are categorized {{according to the}} physical quantities {{they are designed to}} measure. These vary internationally, e.g., NIST 150-2G in the U.S. and NABL-141 in India. Together, these standards cover instruments that measure various physical quantities such as electromagnetic radiation (RF probes), time and frequency (intervalometer), ionizing radiation (Geiger counter), light (light meter), mechanical quantities (<b>limit</b> <b>switch,</b> pressure gauge, pressure switch), and, thermodynamic or thermal properties (thermometer, temperature controller). The standard instrument for each test device varies accordingly, e.g., a dead weight tester for pressure gauge calibration and a dry block temperature tester for temperature gauge calibration.|$|E
50|$|The torque {{switching}} is {{not only}} used for torque seating in the end position, but it also serves as overload protection over the whole travel and protects the valve against excessive torque. If excessive torque acts upon the closing element in an intermediate position, e.g. due to a trapped object, the torque switching will trip when reaching the set tripping torque. In this situation the end position is not signalled by the <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> The controls can therefore distinguish between normal operation torque switch tripping {{in one of the}} end positions and switching off in an intermediate position due to excessive torque.|$|E

The FACTS is the {{advanced}} Technology with powerful power electronics devices. In this paper series and shunt compensators are used as FACTS devices to obtain the compound compensation with current <b>limiting</b> <b>switch.</b> Cost of FACTS devices will increase with their size and requires high power ratings. But here the structure used is such that combination of current <b>limiting</b> <b>switch</b> and FACTS devices will decrease the required power ratings and size of compensating units. This method {{can be used to}} reduce the cost of both compensators ratings and to improve the power quality effectively. The test method is applied to distribution system and suitable results are obtained...|$|R
