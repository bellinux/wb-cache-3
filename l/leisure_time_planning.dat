This paper, through an analysis and synthesis of existing measures of individual attitudes/approaches to time, a subsequent qualitative study, and large quantitative survey study (N= 683) identifies a five factor structure for time-related individual differences (Time Personality) and reports on the development of five complementary measurement scales : <b>Leisure</b> <b>Time</b> Awareness, Punctuality, <b>Planning,</b> Polychronicity and Impatience.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the influence of <b>leisure</b> <b>time</b> physical activity and BMI on recovery from persistent back pain among men and women in a general population. Methods: The study population (n= 1836) in this longitudinal cohort study consisted of participants reporting persistent back pain in the baseline questionnaire in 2002 - 2003. Data on <b>leisure</b> <b>time</b> physical activity, BMI and potential confounders were also collected at baseline. Information on recovery from persistent back pain (no back pain periods >= 7 days during the last 5 years) was obtained from the follow-up questionnaire in 2007.

Results: Compared to a sedentary <b>leisure</b> <b>time,</b> all measured levels of <b>leisure</b> <b>time</b> physical activity were associated with a greater chance of recovery from persistent back pain among women. The adjusted Risk Ratios was 1. 46 (95 % CI: 1. 06, 2. 01) for low <b>leisure</b> <b>time</b> physical activity, 1. 51 (95 % CI: 1. 02, 2. 23) for moderate <b>leisure</b> <b>time</b> physical activity, and 1. 67 (95 % CI: 1. 08, 2. 58) for high <b>leisure</b> <b>time</b> physical activity.
