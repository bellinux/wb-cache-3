5|$|Heskey was an England {{international}} at under-16, under-18, under-21, B {{and senior}} levels. He made his England debut against Hungary in a 1–1 draw in 1999. He lost {{his place in}} the squad after UEFA Euro 2004, during which he failed to shine and was the subject of much criticism. After a long <b>lay-off</b> from international duty, Heskey was recalled to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers in September 2007. He retired from international football following the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having attained 62 caps and scored 7 goals for his country.|$|E

5|$|Next, Iniesta sent a {{pass through}} the inside-left channel to Larsson whose one touch, right foot <b>lay-off</b> quickly {{released}} Eto to equalise for Barcelona. Four minutes later Belletti passed through the inside-right channel to Larsson. After controlling the ball, Larsson made a left footed return pass to Belletti. Belletti ran onto control the ball with his left foot. He then used his right to shoot through Almunia's legs to score at the near post. This was Larsson's second assist for Barcelona since he joined the game.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute after}} this, Liverpool scored through captain Gerrard, who {{connected}} with Riise's cross and lofted a header past Dida. Soon afterwards, Liverpool scored again as Šmicer beat Dida with a long-range {{shot into the}} bottom left-hand corner to leave Liverpool a goal behind. Three minutes after Šmicer's goal, Liverpool were awarded a penalty, after Gerrard made a run into the Milan box for Baros' <b>lay-off</b> and was brought down by Gennaro Gattuso. Xabi Alonso's penalty was saved, but he scored from the rebound to equalise for Liverpool. Milan and Liverpool had chances {{to take the lead}} after this, but Clarence Seedorf and Riise failed to score.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Triumph International {{came under}} fire after a female {{president}} of a local union was dismissed in Thailand. She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T-shirt on which a political statement could be seen. The company's management had {{the view that the}} appearance had harmed their public image and therefore laid off the staff member in question. The international work council of the company, Triumph International Labor Union, protested and collected 2,500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president, supported in solidarity in Germany, inter alia, by the ver.di youth. In November 2008, the Labor Court in Bangkok found the <b>lay-off</b> to have been lawful.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, Nokia {{announced}} 4,000 <b>lay-offs</b> to move manufacturing from Europe and Mexico to Asia. In March 2012, Nokia {{laid off}} 1,000 employees from its Salo, Finland factory {{to focus on}} software.

5|$|His injury {{problems}} {{started as}} early as 1980, when he was 15 years old and saw Glentoran's physio Bobby McGregor to resolve a groin strain; Whiteside said that the highly physical massage he was subjected to damaged his pelvis and robbed him of his natural pace. His lack of pace was later seen as the one weakness in his game. Six weeks into his apprenticeship, in July 1981, and an innocuous looking challenge by a Preston North End player in an 'A' team game saw Whiteside requiring an operation on his right knee. Had the injury occurred {{a couple of years}} later he would have been able to have pioneering keyhole surgery, which could potentially have saved his career. After a seven-month <b>lay-off</b> and a further operation to remove cartilage, he returned to fitness in January 1982. He had to adapt his playing style to compensate for his damaged knee and pelvis, and developed well under youth team coach Eric Harrison.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{first entered}} into the {{electronic}} accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based accounting software developer in 1960. The software division was doing well in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came {{at a cost of}} more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed CEO in 1989. He led the company's first large-scale <b>lay-off</b> in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in profit and revenues.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, {{the company}} cut 2,000 jobs, the biggest <b>lay-off</b> {{in its history}} and the first major layoff since November 12, 2002 when the company laid off 10% of its {{workforce}} (200 employees). The <b>lay-off</b> reduced the workforce by around 11%, from 19,000 employees to 17,000.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, after {{a two-year}} <b>lay-off</b> from {{competitive}} chess, Botvinnik won a tournament in Sverdlovsk, scoring 1½ out of 2 against each of his seven competitors – who included Smyslov, Vladimir Makogonov, Boleslavsky, and Ragozin. Chessbase regards this {{as one of the}} fifty strongest tournaments between 1851 and 1986.|$|E
25|$|Slowing growth {{prompted}} {{the company to}} undertake a <b>lay-off</b> of 2,000 employees {{in the summer of}} 2011. In September 2011, the company's BlackBerry Internet Service suffered a massive outage, impacting millions of customers for several days. The outage embarrassingly occurred as Apple prepared to launch the iPhone 4S, causing fears of mass defections from the platform.|$|E

25|$|After {{a length}} injury <b>lay-off,</b> which {{kept him out}} of {{international}} cricket for nearly two years, Gul returned to the Pakistan fold in 2006. Firstly with quiet away series against Sri Lanka then followed by a tour to England in 2006. Gul was quickly made the lead bowler in the side due to the injuries to other front line bowlers. Gul to 18 wickets in four tests, justifying the selectors faith in him.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2008 {{the global}} sale slump in piston-engined {{aircraft}} impacted {{the company and}} it laid off 100 workers, or 8% of its workforce. This included 79 people at the main plant in Duluth, Minnesota and 29 employees at the composite construction plant in Grand Forks, North Dakota. After this round of <b>lay-offs</b> Cirrus had 1,230 employees remaining. Company COO Brent Wouters stated that the <b>lay-offs</b> were due to [...] "not selling as many airplanes as we'd hoped to this year." ...|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 2007, Salihamidžić {{signed a}} {{four-year}} pre-deal with Juventus. He joined them the following June after {{his contract with}} Bayern had expired. In his first season, under coach Claudio Ranieri, Salihamidžić was a regular starter, albeit injury <b>lay-offs,</b> and made 30 official appearances for his new club, scoring an impressive five goals which included two in a 3-2 victory against Milan on 12 April 2008. His second and third season with the club, however, proved to be less successful as he suffered from several injury <b>lay-offs.</b>|$|R

However, Woakes was dropped for the final two matches of the series.|$|E
25|$|Sharapova {{finally made}} her Fed Cup debut in February 2008, in Russia's quarterfinal tie against Israel. She won both her singles rubbers, against Tzipora Obziler and Shahar Pe'er, helping Russia to a 4–1 victory. For the semifinals, {{she was given}} {{permission}} to skip the tie, with Tarpishchev announcing {{that she will be}} on the team for the final. However, the date of the final coincided with the <b>lay-off</b> from her shoulder injury, and thus she did not play.|$|E
25|$|The 1970–71 {{season was}} simply {{disastrous}} for Blackpool. The same {{team that had}} achieved success the previous season found life in Division One remarkably difficult. Only four victories were achieved, {{and at the end}} of the season they were relegated, along with Lancashire neighbours Burnley, whence they came. Even the return of Tony Green after a long injury <b>lay-off</b> failed to inspire the team. The fact that 28 players were used illustrates that there was no consistency to Shannon's starting-eleven selections.|$|E
