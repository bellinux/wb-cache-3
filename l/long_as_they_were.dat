5|$|Unlike in Western Europe where priests {{were clearly}} demarcated from the laymen, the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the rest of society. Readers and subdeacons were drawn from the laity and expected to be at least twenty years of age while priests and bishops had to be at least 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> married before ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried.|$|E

Pittston Coal Company also had to pay around $10million for the retirement benefits plan for pre-1974 miners. In return Pittston was permitted to operate {{seven days a week}} as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> closed from 8am–4pm on Sundays. Miners were also put on a rotating schedule where every 28 days they would work one week for 4 days, 10 hours each day.|$|E

5|$|The Macdonald Liberals easily won {{re-election}} in 1949 and 1953, but the Conservatives made steady gains under Robert Stanfield, their new leader. The Conservatives for example, {{drew attention to}} kickback schemes under which brewing companies, wineries and distilleries contributed to the Liberal party {{in exchange for the}} right to sell their products in government liquor stores. The Liberals seemed secure against such allegations however, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald. However, Macdonald suffered a slight heart attack on April 11, 1954, and was admitted to hospital where he died in his sleep two nights later, just four months before his 64th birthday.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still {{not entitled to}} vote. This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could {{be seen to be}} withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E

5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|When the barons of England revolted against John in 1215, Maulay {{was given}} command of Corfe Castle by John. Along with Corfe, Maulay was also given custody of John's younger son, Richard of Cornwall. He was also given Gomshall in Surrey. In 1216 {{he was given}} the office of Sheriff of Dorset and Somerset, where he {{made a name for himself}} with his exactions and heavy profiteering. Besides the custody of Richard of Cornwall, Maulay was also {{responsible}} for supervising the confinement of John's niece, Eleanor of Brittany, who, as the daughter of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, elder brother of King John, had a strong claim to the English throne and had been held captive since 1202. At times, he was also responsible for keeping John's wife, Isabella of Angouleme and his heir, Prince Henry, safe from rebels, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> at Corfe.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated {{at the north end of}} the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E

5|$|The Berlin Wall was a {{specific}} {{piece of the}} Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. The Berlin Wall stretched approximately 28 miles (45km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120km) {{around the edges of}} West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of the Berlin Wall in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of the Berlin Wall reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for the number of visitors to the Berlin Wall, as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the Berlin Wall received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit the Berlin Wall, which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> presented as educational in nature.|$|E
