In the context of REDD+, agroforestry has the potential for reducing degradation by supplying timber and fuelwood that would otherwise be sourced from adjacent or distant forests. In fact, agroforestry has been used in several protected area <b>landscape</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> and within conservation as one way of alleviating pressure on forests, thereby reducing deforestation. However, enabling market infrastructure, policies on tree rights and ownership and safeguards would be necessary for agroforestry and other tree-based systems in the landscape to effectively contribute to the goals of REDD+ and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) ...|$|R

40|$|Known as {{biogeochemical}} hotspots in <b>landscapes,</b> riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> exhibit considerable potential concerning mitigation {{of groundwater}} contaminants such as nitrate, but may in return enhance {{the risk for}} indirect N 2 O emission. Here we aim to assess and to compare two riparian grey alder forests in terms of gaseous N 2 O and N 2 fluxes and dissolved N 2 O, N 2, and NO 3 - in the near-surface groundwater. We further determine {{for the first time}} isotopologue ratios of N 2 O dissolved in the riparian groundwater in order to support our assumption that it mainly originated from denitrification. The study sites, both situated in Estonia, north-eastern Europe, receive contrasting N loads from adjacent uphill arable land. Whereas N 2 O emissions were rather small at both sites, average gaseous N 2 -to-N 2 O ratios inferred from closed-chamber measurements and He-O laboratory incubations were almost four times smaller for the heavily loaded site. In contrast, groundwater parameters were less variable among sites and between landscape positions. Campaign-based average 15 N site preferences of N 2 O (SP) in riparian groundwater ranged between 11 and 44 ‰. Besides the strong prevalence of N 2 emission over N 2 O fluxes and the correlation pattern between isotopologue and water quality data, this comparatively large range highlights the importance of denitrification and N 2 O reduction in both riparian grey alder stands...|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} paradigms of {{the past}} decade involve the preservation of biodiversity through the use of <b>landscape</b> corridors and <b>buffer</b> <b>zones,</b> as well as the integration of economic growth through sustainable use. The International Biosphere Reserve (IBR) program, as defined in the Seville Strategy, encourages locations already involved in conservation to continue to protect biodiversity and foster harmonious relationships between humans and their environment through sustainable development. An excellent example of an IBR is the Mammoth Cave Area Biosphere Reserve (MCABR) in south-central Kentucky. In order to measure the significance of the implementation of the Seville Strategy in the MCABR, a methodology was developed which not only measures the implementation level of the Seville Strategy, but also the policies involved in the implementation procedure. Twenty-four indicators, designed by the authors of the Seville Strategy, were analyzed. These indicators were broken down into three categories, administrative, research, and educational indicators. The results of the analysis show that the implementation of the MCABR has {{had a significant impact on}} the biodiversity, environmental management, and sustainable development of the Mammoth Cave area.

40|$|Abstract. It is popularly {{accepted}} that vegetated <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> {{are effective in}} removing water pollutants from surface runoff. However, there is a paucity of detailed information about establishing and maintaining <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> under different conditions, particularly in large catchments with diverse land uses. This paper reviews information on the application and effectiveness of vegetated <b>buffer</b> <b>zones,</b> and seeks to provide guidelines on their use for water quality control. Investigations into the use of <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> are grouped here into three major categories: tudies of runoff plots or confined field areas; studies of operational forestry catchments; and studies of agricultural catchments. The degree of effectiveness of <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> for water pollution control in all these categories is generally attributed either to physical properties of the <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> (such as width, slope, vegetative cover, or soil type) or {{to the type of}} pollutant encountered. However, it is clear that although <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> have been shown to work well under small scale, experimental conditions, they lack success for water quality control on a broad catchment basis. In this respect, it is important hat runoff must enter a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> as shallow, overland flow in order to be slowed or detained, and that excessively channelised runoff will pass through a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> unhindered. <b>Buffer</b> <b>zones</b> positioned close to sources of surface water pollution are therefore mor...|$|R

The research will focus on the level of compliance of the <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> guideline among the developer. Failure to comply with the <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> guidelines will contribute to noise pollution. A <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> is created as noise abatement in the noise polluted areas which could be designed in various forms such as a recreational park and a barrier wall.

40|$|Includes Figures, Tables, Charts, Maps, Appendix and Bibliography. Text in English, Spanish. Many geographers {{have tested}} whether {{protected}} areas save forest, but they usually focus on parks and reserves, management units that have internationally recognized standing and familiar objectives. <b>Buffer</b> <b>zones</b> have received considerably less attention {{because of their}} ambiguous rules and often informal designation. Although <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> are often dismissed as an ineffective conservation tool, their prevalence in the Amazon and especially in Peru (where they cover over 10 % of the country) calls for increased attention. This study examines the effectiveness of <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> in the Peruvian Amazon to: a) prevent deforestation and b) limit the extent of extractive concessions (a primary goal of <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> legislation). I employ annual deforestation data from the Hansen et al (2013) Global Forest Change dataset with covariate matching to determine the impact of 13 <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> on deforestation from 2007 - 2012. I find that despite uncertainty in management authority, <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> are associated with fewer extractive concessions and less deforestation. To understand causality of the result I draw on interviews with government officials and NGO employees in Lima and around the Tambopata National Reserve, the site of my case study. The approval process for extractive concessions in <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> appear to slow legal extractive activities, but management of illegal activities is ambiguous and less effective.

40|$|Riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> {{can improve}} {{water quality and}} enhance habitat, but a {{comprehensive}} yet rapid method that can assist the resource manager in assessing the effectiveness of buffers is not available. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe and illustrate the use of a newly developed field-based evaluation tool for riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> in agricultural catchments. The <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> Inventory and Evaluation Form (BZIEF) incorporates criteria-based scoring systems developed from literature review, subsequent peer-review, and then a pilot field study. Use of the BZIEF is demonstrated by comparing <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> in three catchments established for water quality and habitat improvement under the Water Fringe Option agrienvironment scheme in England in order to assess whether the buffers were likely to provide environmental enhancement. Results among the three catchments were generally similar; <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> scored highly for their abundant vegetation cover, lack of erosion, stream habitat quality, and sufficient width. Furthermore, previous grassland or arable land use did not substantially affect <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> ratings. However, the BZIEF indicated that inappropriate soil characteristics in one catchment were likely to constrain <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> effectiveness for improving water quality. In another catchment, poor riparian vegetation diversity and structure may yield ineffective habitat enhancement, according to the BZIEF. It was concluded that the BZIEF might be a useful tool for <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> comparison and monitoring, even though more work is needed to test and validate the method. For example, the BZIEF could be used to target appropriate locations for <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> and is flexible, so could be adapted for different policies, objectives and regions...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> (BZ) {{concept has}} been {{introduced}} in Nepal as {{a key component of}} the national biodiversity conservation strategy to mitigate the impacts of protected areas on local communities, and thereby reduce adverse impacts of local people on protected areas. Unlike traditional <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> programmes which are mostly limited to creating a protective layer and/or distributing economic benefits to local people, the <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> management approach in Nepal integrates livelihoods and conservation issues and their linkages in a more holistic and balanced manner. The programme has been successful in establishing a network of community institutions and in mobilising large numbers of local communities in conservation and community development. The research findings clearly indicate that the current <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> management approach based on park revenue sharing for community development has been successful in developing positive attitudes among local people towards protected areas. There is also evidence of improvement in the condition of forests and biodiversity in the <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> and a decrease in pressure inside the protected areas for basic forestry resources. The BZ communities also feel empowered by the <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> management programme. These outputs suggest that if properly designed, the <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> management programme can achieve both conservation and development objectives ensuring the long-term integrity of the protected areas. At the same time, however, the research has also revealed that the existing incentives and institutional arrangements adopted in the <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> management programme were necessary but not sufficient to address present and potential challenges in Chitwan National Park. There is a need to use additional instruments to demonstrate <b>Buffer</b> <b>Zone</b> management as a viable conservation governance strategy to expand conservation into the areas beyond park boundaries ensuring greater stability of the Park.
