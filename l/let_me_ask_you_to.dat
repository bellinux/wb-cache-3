"Now, my lads," [...] said he, {{shutting}} the book, [...] "that's all I've {{got to say}} to you to-day, but before closing, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think like men--not like children--about what we have been reading. The service of God is not a mere matter of ceremonies. Jesus Christ came to save you and me, not so much from punishment, as from sin itself. It is a great salvation. Those of you who may have been swimming with the current know and care nothing about the power of sin. If you think you do, my lads, turn up stream. Try to resist sin, and you'll learn something new. Only those who are made willing and strong by the Spirit of God can do it successfully. No doubt that remark will set adrift a lot o' thoughts and questions in your minds. To all of them I give you a short text as a good course to steer by: `Ask, and ye shall receive.' Ask light and ask wisdom.|$|E

"If, in your close {{intimacy}} with them, it seems strange {{that they should}} never have betrayed themselves, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> consider the circumstances and you will understand the apparent anomaly. Remember {{that they had been}} living as husband and wife, to all intents and purposes (except that the marriage-service had not been read over them), for fifteen years before you came into the house; and bear in mind, at the same time, that no event occurred to disturb Mr. Vanstone's happiness in the present, to remind him of the past, or to warn him of the future, until the announcement of his wife's death reached him, in that letter from America which you saw placed in his hand. From that day forth--when a past which he abhorred was forced back to his memory; when a future which she had never dared to anticipate was placed within her reach--you will soon perceive, if you have not perceived already, that they both betrayed themselves, time after time; and that you r innocence of all suspicion, and their children's innocence of all suspicion, alone prevented you from discovering the truth.|$|E
6000|$|I pass on {{from that}} now, as I merely wished {{to explain to}} you what I meant {{by the use of}} the term [...] "Geographical Distribution." [...] As I said, there is another aspect, and a much more {{important}} one, and that is, the relations of the various animals to one another. The horse is a very well-defined matter-of-fact sort of animal, and we are all pretty familiar with its structure. I dare say it may have struck you, that it resembles very much no other member of the animal kingdom, except perhaps the zebra or the ass. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> look along these diagrams. Here is the skeleton of the horse, and here the skeleton of the dog. You will notice that we have in the horse a skull, a backbone and ribs, shoulder-blades and haunch-bones. In the fore-limb, one upper arm-bone, two fore arm-bones, wrist-bones (wrongly called knee), and middle hand-bones, ending in the three bones of a finger, the last of which is sheathed in the horny hoof of the fore-foot: in the hind-limb, one thigh-bone, two leg-bones, ankle-bones, and middle foot-bones, ending in the three bones of a toe, the last of which is encased in the hoof of the hind-foot. Now turn to the dog's skeleton. We find identically the same bones, but more of them, there being more toes in each foot, and hence more toe-bones.|$|E

Nearly [...] {{everything}} in the fore-turret is worked by steam and hydraulic power, [...] so that comparatively few men are required to move the iron monsters. [...] <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> imagine the men at their stations. Some are inside [...] the turret, and as guns and turret move in concert the men inside move [...] with them. Those outside the turret stand at its base, and are [...] therefore below the iron deck and protected by the iron sides of the [...] ship. The insiders revolve, aim, and fire the gun; the outsiders [...] load. The first lieutenant, standing {{at the base of}} the tower, close [...] to the hole by which it is entered, so that he may be heard by both [...] out and insiders, shouts, `Close up,' in the voice of a Stentor. At [...] this some men grasp levers, others stand by wheels which let on [...] respectively hydraulic power and steam. The captain of the tower, [...] seated on an elevated position, puts his head through a man-hole in [...] the roof of the turret, which hole is covered with a bullet-proof iron [...] hood, having a narrow opening in front. He surveys the supposed [...] enemy, and his duty is to revolve the tower, take aim, and let go the [...] firing machinery, i.e. pull the trigger. The outsiders stand by the [...] locking bolt, levers, shot-racks, etcetera. Then, in the attitude of [...] ready-for-action, all become motionless attentive statues--a regular [...] tableau-vivant.|$|E

60|$|These two lectures are fragmentary and ill-arranged, but not, I think, diffuse or much compressible. The entire gist and {{conclusion}} of them, however, {{is in the}} last six paragraphs of the third lecture, which I would beg the reader to look over not once nor twice, (rather than any other part of the book,) for they contain the best expression I have yet been able to put in words of what, so far as is within my power, I mean henceforward both to do myself, and to plead with all over whom I have any influence, to do also according to their means: the letters begun {{on the first day of}} this year, to the workmen of England, having the object of originating, if possible, this movement among them, in true alliance with whatever trustworthy element of help they can find in the higher classes. After these paragraphs, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> read, by the fiery light of recent events, the fable at p. 170 {1}, and then paragraphs 129-131 {2}; and observe, my statement respecting the famine at Orissa is not rhetorical, but certified by official documents as within the truth. Five hundred thousand persons, AT LEAST, died by starvation in our British dominions, wholly in consequence of carelessness and want of forethought. Keep that well in your memory; and note it as the best possible illustration of modern political economy in true practice, and of the relations it has accomplished between Supply and Demand. Then begin the second lecture, and all will read clear enough, I think, to the end; only, since that second lecture was written, questions have arisen respecting the education and claims of women which have greatly troubled simple minds and excited restless ones. I am sometimes asked my thoughts on this matter, and I suppose that some girl readers of the second lecture may at the end of it desire to be told summarily what I would have them do and desire in the present state of things. This, then, is what I would say to any girl who had confidence enough in me to believe what I told her, or to do what I asked her.|$|E

[...] He {{walked up and down}} the room half-a-dozen times before he spoke again, while she stood by the table {{watching}} him. [...] "I wish," [...] she said, [...] "I knew what it is that troubles you." [...] To this he made no answer, but went on walking till she came up to him, and putting both her hands upon his arm said, [...] "It will be better, Will, that I should go;--will it not? Speak to me, and say so. I feel that it will be better." [...] Then he stopped in his walk and looked down upon her, as her hands still rested upon his shoulder. He gazed upon her for some few seconds, remaining quite motionless, and then, opening his arms, he surrounded her with his embrace, and pressing her with all his strength close to his bosom, kissed her forehead, and her cheeks, and her lips, and her eyes. His will was so masterful, his strength so great, and his motion so quick, that she was powerless to escape from him till he relaxed his hold. Indeed she hardly struggled, so much was she surprised and so soon released. But the moment that he left her he saw that her face was burning red, and that the tears were streaming from her eyes. She stood for a moment trembling, with her hands clenched, and with a look of scorn upon her lips and brow that he had never seen before; and then she threw herself on a sofa, and, burying her face, sobbed aloud, while her whole body was shaken as with convulsions. He leaned over her repentant, not knowing what to do, not knowing how to speak. All ideas of his scheme had gone from him now. He had offended her for ever,--past redemption. What could be the use now of any scheme? And as he stood there he hated himself because of his scheme. The utter misery and disgrace of the present moment had come upon him because he had thought more of himself than of her. It was but a few moments since she had told him that she trusted him next to her God; and yet, in those few moments, he had shown himself utterly unworthy of that trust, and had destroyed all her confidence. But he could not leave her without speaking to her. [...] "Clara!" [...] he said;--"Clara." [...] But she did not answer him. [...] "Clara; will you not speak to me? Will you not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> forgive me?" [...] But still she only sobbed. For her, at that moment, we may say that sobbing was easier than speech. How was she to pardon so great an offence? How was she to resent such passionate love? ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus, much - alas! {{how little}} - about {{the wonders of}} the deep. We, who are no deep-sea dredgers, must return humbly to {{the wonders of the}} shore. And first, as after {{descending}} the gap in the sea-wall we walk along the ribbed floor of hard yellow sand, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give a sharp look-out for a round grey disc, about as big as a penny-piece, peeping out on the surface. No; that is not it, that little lump: open it, and you will find within one of the common little Venus gallina. - The closet collectors have given it some new name now, and no thanks to them: they are always changing the names, instead of studying the live animals where Nature has put them, in which case they would have no time for word-inventing. [...] Nay, I verify suspect that the names grow, like other things; at least, they get longer and longer and more jaw-breaking every year. [...] The little bivalve, however, finding itself left by the tide, has wisely shut up its siphons, and, by means of its foot and its edges, buried itself in a comfortable bath of cool wet sand, till the sea shall come back, and make it safe to crawl and lounge about on the surface, smoking the sea-water instead of tobacco. Neither is that depression what we seek. Touch it, and out poke a pair of astonished and inquiring horns: it is a long-armed crab, who saw us coming, and wisely shovelled himself into the sand by means of his nether-end. Corystes Cassivelaunus is his name, which he is said to have acquired from the marks on his back, which are somewhat like a human face. [...] "Those long antennae," [...] says my friend, Mr. Lloyd (6) - I have not verified the fact, but believe it, as he knows a great deal about crabs, and I know next to nothing - [...] "form a tube through which a current of water passes into the crab's gills, free from the surrounding sand." [...] Moreover, it is only the male who has those strangely long fore-arms and claws; the female contenting herself with limbs of a more moderate length. Neither is that, though it might be, the hole down which what we seek has vanished: but that burrow contains one of the long white razors which you saw cast on shore at Paignton. The boys close by are boring for them with iron rods armed with a screw, and taking them in to sell in Torquay market, as excellent food. But there is one, at last - a grey disc pouting up through the sand. Touch it, and it is gone down, quick as light. We must dig it out, and carefully, for it is a delicate monster. At last, after ten minutes' careful work, we have brought up, from a foot depth or more - what? A thick, dirty, slimy worm, without head or tail, form or colour. A slug has more artistic beauty about him. Be it so. At home in the aquarium (where, alas! he will live but for a day or two, under the new irritation of light) he will make a very different figure. That is one of the rarest of British sea- animals, Peachia hastata (Pl. XII. Fig. 1), which differs from most other British Actiniae in this, that instead of having like them a walking disc, it has a free open lower end, with which (I know not how) it buries itself upright in the sand, with its mouth just above the surface. The figure on the left of the plate represents a curious cluster of papillae which project {{from one side of the}} mouth, and are the opening of the oviduct. But his value consists, not merely in his beauty (though that, really, is not small), but in his belonging to what the long word-makers call an [...] "interosculant" [...] group, - a party of genera and species which connect families scientifically far apart, filling up a fresh link in the great chain, or rather the great network, of zoological classification. For here we have a simple, and, as it were, crude form; of which, if we dared to indulge in reveries, we might say that the Creative Mind realized it before either Actiniae or Holothurians, and then went on to perfect the idea contained in it in two different directions; dividing it into two different families, and making on its model, by adding new organs, and taking away old ones, in one direction the whole family of Actiniae (sea- anemones), and in a quite opposite one the Holothuriae, those strange sea-cucumbers, with their mouth-fringe of feathery gills, of which you shall see some anon. Thus there has been, in the Creative Mind, as it gave life to new species, a development of the idea on which older species were created, in order - we may fancy - that every mesh of the great net might gradually be supplied, and there should be no gaps in the perfect variety of Nature's forms. [...] This development is one which we must believe to be at least possible, if we allow that a Mind presides over the universe, and not a mere brute necessity, a Law (absurd misnomer) without a Lawgiver; and to it (strangely enough coinciding here and there with the Platonic doctrine of Eternal Ideas existing in the Divine Mind) all fresh inductive discovery seems to point more and more.|$|E
