40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to highlight the effectiveness of <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> in tropical office buildings to enhance interior daylighting quality. Daylight simulation was performed for custom <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> for a typical office floor of Dhaka City in Bangladesh, to determine the best possible location under overcast sky conditions. Six alternative models of a 3 m high study space were created with varying heights of <b>light</b> <b>shelves.</b> The 3 D models were first generated in the Ecotect to study the distribution and uniformity of daylight in the interior space with split- flux method. These models were then exported to a physically-based backward raytracer, Radiance Synthetic Imaging software to generate realistic lighting levels for validating and crosschecking the Ecotect results. The results showed that for achieving light levels closest to specified standards, <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> at a height of 2 m above floor level perform better among the seven alternatives studied including the alternative where no <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> are present. Finally, the decisions were verified with DAYSIM simulation program to ensure the compliance of the decisions with dynamic annual climate-based daylight performance metrics...|$|R

50|$|Light {{shelves are}} an {{effective}} way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure, this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> outside the window. Usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave. The <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to illuminate the ceiling. This reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows, reducing the need for general illumination.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> is a {{horizontal}} surface that reflects daylight deep into a building. Light shelves are placed above eye-level and have high-reflectance upper surfaces, which reflect daylight onto {{the ceiling and}} deeper into the space.|$|E
50|$|In {{the cold}} winter, a natural <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> is created {{when there is}} {{snow on the ground}} which makes it reflective. Low winter sun (see Sun path) {{reflects}} off the snow and increases solar gain through equator-facing glass by one- to two-thirds which brightly lights the ceiling of these rooms. Glare control (drapes) may be required.|$|E
50|$|To {{cope with}} summer temperatures, {{interior}} and exterior <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> associated with solar protection will be {{set up in the}} building. These systems will be sized using engineering tools such as the sun path diagram of Reunion Island as well as different software tools which will establish the design and evaluation of the most satisfactory option. According to the results obtained, the most appropriate solution consists in creating a specific system {{on each side of the}} building. Thanks to this design, natural daylighting will be provided with the exterior <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> in summer, whereas in winter, when the solar height is lower, the interior <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> will play this key role.|$|R

50|$|Alternatives to <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> for window {{daylighting}} include blinds and louver systems, both {{of which}} can be interior or exterior.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} light shelves extend a fair {{distance}} {{into a room}} may result in interference with sprinkler systems. In Canada, they cannot exceed 1200 mm (4 ft.) in width if sprinklers are present or the design will require integration with sprinkler system to cover the floor area under the <b>light</b> <b>shelf.</b> They also require a higher than average floor-to-ceiling heights {{in order for them}} to be effective, or daylight may be inadvertently redirected into occupants' eyes.|$|E
50|$|Architectural light shelves {{have been}} proven to {{reduce the need for}} {{artificial}} lighting in buildings. Since they can reflect light deeper into a space, the use of incandescent and fluorescent lighting can be reduced or completely eliminated, depending on the space. Light shelves make it possible for daylight to penetrate the space up to 2.5 times the distance between the floor and the top of the window. Today, advanced <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> technology makes it possible to increase the distance up to 4 times. In spaces such as classrooms and offices, light shelves {{have been proven}} to increase occupant comfort and productivity. Furthermore, incorporating light shelves in a building design is admissible for the LEED point system, falling under the “Indoor Environment Quality: Daylight & Views” category.|$|E
50|$|The center showcases {{a variety}} of environmentally-friendly {{technologies}} that provide opportunities to learn how construction and operations can {{be sensitive to the}} surrounding environment. The nearly 11000 sq ft facility is certified by the U.S. Green Building Council as LEED Silver. The center utilizes a closed-loop geothermal heating and cooling system and also has a living/green roof, composed of 6 - 8 in of soil substrate and native plants of the park. The roof absorbs and filters approximately 1000000 gal of water annually, and during rain events slowly releases the water into adjacent biodetention areas over the course of hours and days, thus decreasing the volume of water that contributes to flash-flooding of the nearby streams. The 60-vehicle parking lot is permeable and allows water to slowly absorb in the ground, while recharging the local aquifer. Various other technologies in the building include light sensitive overhead lighting which automatically adjusts to daylight levels, as well as auto-off lights, and light shelves in the classrooms allow reflected sunlight to penetrate deeper into the building, saving electricity architectural <b>light</b> <b>shelf.</b> Flash heaters are installed in building faucets negating the need for inefficient water heaters. Park trails are paved in part with locally derived reused asphalt millings containing 6 percent pulverized glass.|$|E

40|$|AbstractModern {{envelope}} {{technologies and}} architectural trends often encourage {{the construction of}} buildings with large glazing surfaces. Glazed facades are often proposed {{with the intent to}} guarantee high daylight levels and wide exterior views. However, an increasing attention is nowadays recognized to glare issues and indoor comfort levels. Consequently, <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> are often proposed to help reducing glare issues, providing better illumination distribution, and increasing the homogeneity of daylight distribution into the spaces. In this paper, the impact of <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> over the illuminance levels in a south facing office building in Toronto is evaluated. The Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) is considered as the metric of analysis. Annual simulations for four different window-to-wall ratios (WWR) are compared with and without <b>light</b> <b>shelves.</b> Results show that <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> enhance the UDI levels mainly in the first six meters in front of the windows, and provide a more homogeneous daylight distribution with an increase of the UDI for any considered WWR. Finally, this paper shows that WWR above 35 % result in increasing daylight quantity with higher glare issues, and in case of the adoption of floor to ceiling windows, WWR above 35 % are not advantageous in terms of daylighting...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>shelves</b> are {{typically}} used in high-rise and low-rise office buildings, {{as well as}} institutional buildings. This design is generally used on the equator-facing side of the building, which is where maximum sunlight is found, {{and as a result}} is most effective. Not only do <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> allow <b>light</b> to penetrate through the building, they are also designed to shade near the windows, due to the overhang of the shelf, and help reduce window glare. Exterior shelves are generally more effective shading devices than interior shelves. A combination of exterior and interior shelves will work best in providing an even illumination gradient.|$|R

50|$|Natural day {{lighting}} was {{a difficult}} task for the CH2 team due to the building's orientation and position in relation to surrounding buildings, and the requirement for a deep open plan office space. The best design techniques for CH2 to allow the most natural light included a synergy between windows size and air ducts, <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> to reflect <b>light</b> into the office area, vaulted ceilings to allow further light penetration, shading on north, west, and east façades, and finally timber louvres to control light penetration from the afternoon western sun. The <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> {{were placed on the}} north façade which in turn will create a soft indirect light on the roof space. These <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> are placed externally and made of fabric in a steel frame. The vaulted ceilings allow for more natural light filtering to the deeper parts of the office space. Locating the windows at the highest point of the curve improved this technique. The east facing façade uses a perforated metal system for shading that also acts like a thermal chimney. Heat rises pulling air through {{the eastern part of the}} building allowing it to be naturally ventilated. The north facing façade is composed of steel trellises and balconies supporting vertical gardens nine stories high. The foliage protects the building from the sun and also filters sunlight for a reduction of indoor glares. <b>Light</b> <b>shelves</b> are used to provide shading as well as reflect natural light into the building. These <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> are placed externally and made of fabric in a steel frame. The west facing façade is covered with a system of timber louvres that pivot to optimise the penetration of natural light and views. These louvres also protect the façade from the harsh western sun. The louvres open and close depending on the amount of sun that is hitting the western façade. The louvres are made from untreated recycled timber and are moved by a computer-controlled hydraulic system. The building also uses artificial lighting throughout to provide a sufficient amount of light when natural light is not available. These lights use the low-energy T5 luminaries which achieve a lighting power density of less than 2.5 watts/m² per 100 lux.|$|R
40|$|In {{tropical}} climate, {{there is}} actually abundant quantity of daylight but yet to be utilised. The excessively high and unpredictable external illuminance could cause non-uniform indoor illuminance distribution and visual discomfort. In order to improve daylighting quality in contemporary high-rise open plan offices, proper design of internal shading should be investigated. A base model was derived from previous case studies for simulation using Radiance. Various venetian blinds, vertical blinds and <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> were configured for the experiment. Daylight factor (DF) was evaluated for quantitative performance; work plane illuminance (WPI) distribution and vertical plane luminance ratio were investigated for qualitative performance. The findings demonstrated that generally blinds were not a good potential for daylight utilisation but good in reducing luminance contrast. <b>Light</b> <b>shelves</b> improved performances in DF and WPI distribution but increased the luminance contrast. Hence, integrations of <b>light</b> <b>shelves</b> and partial venetian blind (45 closed) were proposed as the effective designs for all orientations. The highest improvements of 31. 8 % in WPI distribution and 66. 7 % in luminance ratio were achieved for south and east orientations, respectively. This paper demonstrates that with proper internal shading design, effective daylighting depth can be significantly improved from typically used 2. 5 H rule of thumb to 3. 6 H...|$|R
40|$|As {{daylight}} is dynamic, {{there is}} no one common solution for all scenarios. Understanding of sky conditions is the fundamental to effective daylighting. It is more critical in tropical climate where the sky is predominantly intermediate with inconsistent presence of direct sunlight (DSL). Thereby, daylighting performances of several <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> configurations were experimented with physical scaled model under actual tropical sky conditions. External illuminance and indoor work plane illuminance (WPI) levels were measured concurrently in a reference model and a test model for comparisons. Daylight ratio or daylight factor and WPI uniformity ratio were computed for analysis. From the results, different optimum cases were identified for various sky conditions. Light shelves performed the best under intermediate sky with DSL from low angle. The highest improvement in WPI at deep room area and WPI uniformity were 24. 87 % and 364. 96 %, respectively. The performances of light shelves under overcast sky were better than <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> under intermediate sky without DSL. This paper concluded that designing <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> by responding to changeable sky conditions and DSL is more crucial than considering the façade orientations. Dynamic <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> was proposed to configure the optimum cases for each tropical sky conditions...|$|E
40|$|Daylight can be {{considered}} {{as one of the most}} important principles of sustainable architecture. It is unfortunate that this is neglected by designers in Tehran, a city that benefits from a significant amount of daylight and many clear sunny days during the year. Using a daylight controller system increases space natural light quality and decreases building lighting consumption by 60 %. It also affects building thermal behavior, because most of them operate as shading. The <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> is one of the passive systems for controlling daylight, mostly used with shading and installed in the upper half of the windows above eye level. The influence of <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> parameters, such as its dimensions, shelf rotation angle and orientation on daylight efficiency and visual comfort in educational spaces is investigated in this article. Daylight simulation software and annual analysis based on climate information during space occupation hours were used. The results show that <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> dimensions, as well as different orientations, especially in southern part, are influential in the distribution of natural light and visual comfort. At the southern orientation, increased <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> dimensions result in an increase of the area of the work plane with suitable daylight levels by 2 %– 40 % and a significant decrease in disturbing and intolerable glare hours...|$|E
40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>shelf</b> was {{developed}} to create uniform indoor illuminance. However, in hot climates the unshaded clerestory above the shelf transmits high solar heat gain. In dense urban context, these advantages and disadvantages might vary regarding the context and position of the fenestration. This study employed an integrated energy simulation software to investigate the effectiveness of <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> application in a tropical urban context in terms of building energy consumption. Radiance and EnergyPlus based simulations performed the effects of urban canyon aspect ratio and external surface albedo on the daylighting performances, space cooling load, {{as well as the}} lighting energy consumption of the building equipped with lightshelves in 2 humid tropical cities. Comparison of the energy performances of 3 fenestration systems, i. e. fenestration without any shading device, with overhangs, and with light shelves, yielded some recommendations concerning the best application of <b>light</b> <b>shelf</b> on the certain floor levels and aspect ratio of the urban context...|$|E
