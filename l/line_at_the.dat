5|$|Passenger numbers fell {{during the}} 1960s, {{and the line}} became {{economically}} unviable. Following a train crash in 1965, the owners closed the <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of September that year. The tunnel still exists, but no trace remains of the stations.|$|E
5|$|All three {{captured}} {{ships were}} taken into the Royal Navy. The name of Alexandre reverted to the former Alexander, and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by Alexanders presence in the <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Nile in 1798 under Captain Alexander Ball. Tigre retained her French name, while Formidable, as there was already a ship of that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS Belleisle, apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle Île {{in the aftermath of}} the battle. Belleisle had a long and successful career, fighting at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 under Captain William Hargood.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E

5|$|At 2:15 pm on 1July 1965, {{one of the}} two-car yellow trains {{lost control}} while {{approaching}} the lower terminus and ran {{off the end of}} the rails before smashing into a building. The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the cab and suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries. Although the station was repaired and services were resumed, Pleasurama decided to close the <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 1965 holiday season. Services stopped on 26September 1965.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter, {{seeking a}} more {{defensive}} posture closer to Beaver Creek, advanced {{for a short}} period then circled the supply wagons in a defensible area. This was possible because his mounted troopers fought a mobile delaying action. On his command, Carpenter's men rushed inside at the gallop. They dismounted and took up a defensive firing <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gap between the wagons they had just entered.|$|E
5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E

5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' {{the witch}} Erichtho by making her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions {{in accord with the}} Christian providence that controls the advancement of the Commedias plot <b>line.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the Lucanian Erichtho is both marginalized and subordinated to a higher power. In this sense, Dante's rewriting of Erichtho also undoes Lucan's subversion of the original Virgilian model.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Paris {{sometimes}} {{found itself}} on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns. In the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris {{continued to be a}} mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet and the surrealist Salvador Dalí.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war between North Korea and South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United States mobilized a large contingent of troops to send into the beleaguered country. Initially, units occupying Japan were called into the country, but forces were eventually dispatched from the United States. In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter, where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan.|$|E

5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver <b>Line.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, {{all the way}} to Track H from east to west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, {{all the way to}} H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this had not been a problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Imjin River, forcing it back 50 miles {{and allowing the}} Chinese to capture Seoul. The 24th Infantry Division was then reassigned to IX Corps to replace the 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions, which {{had been placed in}} reserve due to heavy losses. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled.|$|E

5|$|Quainton Road {{station was}} built on a curve in the <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nearest point to the Duke's estates at Wotton. Six miles (10km) {{northwest}} of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to Akeman Street. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{had spent most of}} their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but {{it is likely that the}} station had a single timber-covered earth platform and minimal buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.|$|E
