If the lease is at market rent, then the <b>leased</b> <b>fee</b> value and the fee simple value are equal. However, if the tenant pays {{more or less than}} market, the residual owned by the <b>leased</b> <b>fee</b> holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the fee simple value.|$|E

40|$|Ground leased {{property}} trades {{at a discount}} relative to the fee interest. We explore contractual alternatives that would be Pareto preferred by owners of the <b>leased</b> <b>fee</b> estate and the leasehold interest. The sharing {{of the value of}} the residual claim between the owner of the <b>leased</b> <b>fee</b> and the leasehold and a lease extension clause triggered by redevelopment can enhance the value of the asset to both parties. The results suggest that employing such contractual terms in ground leases in the United States would lead to outcomes more consistent with the fee simple case. Escalation clauses also have a potential impact on the timing and intensity of redevelopment. Copyright 2001 by the American Real Estate and Urban Ecopnomics Assocaition. ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the option}} to redevelop a {{property}} is valuable, ground leased property should trade at a discount relative to fee simple property because of the impairment {{of the value of}} that option resulting from the foreshortened horizon of the leaseholder. This discount would be over and above the discount that results from the leaseholder’s non-existent residual claim to the property. We evaluate alternative contractual arrangements that may be more incentive compatible between the owner of the <b>leased</b> <b>fee</b> and the leasehold. We find that a lease extension clause causes the lessee to defer development and develop at much higher density. Sharing {{of the value of the}} residual claim between the owner of the <b>leased</b> <b>fee</b> and the leasehold also increases the intensity of redevelopment but results in earlier redevelopment. Also, we find that a more realistic escalation clause causes redevelopment to occur sooner but at similar density...|$|E
40|$|The Land Reform Act {{as amended}} was a misapplication of eminent domain because it {{violated}} {{both the public}} use and just compensation clauses of the Fifth Amendment. There was no rational nexus linking eminent domain with the public purpose of reducing the price of land; the high price was due to natural and governmental restrictions on land supply rather than oligopoly. The Act provided for compensation for the condemned <b>leased</b> <b>fee</b> at below market value; compensation was based on controlled lease rents and excluded the reversionary interest in improvements. ...|$|E

5000|$|In August 2006, at an {{international}} tender auction, Butorović's company HTUP Park won 30-year lease rights to Hotel Varadin located on the Petrovaradin Fortress. Under {{the terms of the}} lease agreement that was signed by then Novi Sad mayor Maja Gojković and HTUP Park representative Kosta Kliska, Butorović's company took on the obligation of investing at least €6 million into the 5,405 square meter property while it was under no obligation of paying a <b>lease</b> <b>fee</b> to the city for the first 5 years of the agreement. Furthermore, once the first 5 years were up in September 2011, it agreed to pay the <b>lease</b> <b>fee</b> of €3.8 per square meter (€21,000 per month) to the city of Novi Sad. The price was ridiculous for a baroque hotel, considering that the average <b>lease</b> <b>fee</b> in Novi Sad was at least twice that. Butorović reportedly invested €6.5 million in the hotel renovation and re-opened it as Hotel Leopold I in June 2007. This however was never confirmed, since no-one ever had any control of how the deal was executed. That is how it was possible that Butorović never paid a single euro for the use of this historic monument.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether Rhode Island has {{the authority}} to lease marinas their submerged lands, and if so, is the fee structure of the CRMC 2 ̆ 7 s proposed plan equitable to marinas in the State? The thesis determined that under the powers of the Public Trust Doctrine, Rhode Island has the right to implement a marina leasing program, but implementation of a program may prove to be problematic for the State. The thesis identified that the CRMC 2 ̆ 7 s proposed lease rate would be inequitable to marinas in Rhode Island. Marinas subject to the CRMC program would pay the same <b>lease</b> <b>fee</b> per slip, although marinas generate significantly different incomes from their slips, depending on factors like size and location. This study recommends that CRMC adopt the fee system used by Maine and Michigan, which charges marinas a <b>lease</b> <b>fee</b> based on a percentage of their slip 2 ̆ 7 s revenues. Under this fee system all marinas will pay the same percentage of their slip incomes to Rhode Island as a <b>lease</b> <b>fee.</b> As a policy question, this thesis advocates that the CRMC move forward with a marina leasing program in the future. A marina leasing program if implemented properly would benefit both the public and marinas in Rhode Island...|$|R
