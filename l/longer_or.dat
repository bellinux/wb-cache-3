5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually stay there for six months; occasionally, they may even stay <b>longer</b> <b>or</b> return to the water in autumn. Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E

25|$|Helium is less soluble than {{nitrogen}} in body tissues, {{but as a}} consequence of its very small molecular weight of 4, compared with 28 for nitrogen, it diffuses faster as is described by Graham's Law.

Decompression of saturated tissues will be faster for helium, but unsaturated tissues may take <b>longer</b> <b>or</b> shorter than with nitrogen depending on the dive profile.|$|E

25|$|A woman's orgasm {{may last}} {{slightly}} <b>longer</b> <b>or</b> {{much longer than}} a man's.

For some women, on some occasions, these contractions begin soon after the woman reports that the orgasm has started and continue at intervals of about one second with initially increasing, and then reducing, intensity. In some instances, the series of regular contractions is followed by a few additional contractions or shudders at irregular intervals. In other cases, the woman reports having an orgasm, but no pelvic contractions are measured at all.|$|E

The Director now rewards players for taking <b>longer</b> <b>or</b> more difficult paths through each episode by providing useful equipment, such as special ammo packs or higher tier weapons, along these riskier paths.|$|E
