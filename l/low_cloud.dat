5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of poor weather and <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover, the two pilots circled the palace at altitudes of around , periodically diving {{out of the}} clouds to re-attack before darting back into them. The airstrike caught the Saigon garrison off guard and, in the confusion, {{they were unable to}} determine whether the aircraft were acting alone or with ground forces. Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from Bien Hoa Air Base in pursuit of the two rebel planes. Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with 50-calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke-filled streets as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|An armed {{reconnaissance}} by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being lost as the formation, {{at very low}} level because of the <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> base, was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The RAF believed {{that none of the}} lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters, however, and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations. This summation was odd considering the evidence available. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory. Several of the returning RAF bombers clearly had small arms damage from machine gun rounds, making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect.|$|E
40|$|How {{tropical}} <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> {{change with}} climate remains the dominant source of uncertainty in global warming projections. An analysis of an ensemble of CMIP 5 climate models reveals {{that a significant}} part of the spread in the models’ climate sensitivity can be accounted by differences in the climatological shallowness of tropical <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> in weak-subsidence regimes: models with shallower <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> in weak-subsidence regimes tend to have a higher climate sensitivity than models with deeper <b>low</b> <b>clouds.</b> The dynamical mechanisms responsible for the model differences are analyzed. Competing effects of parameterized boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are found to be essential. Boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are typically represented by distinct parameterization schemes in current models—parameterization schemes that often produce opposing effects on <b>low</b> <b>clouds.</b> Convective drying of the boundary layer tends to deepen <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> and reduce the cloud fraction at the lowest levels; turbulent moistening tends to make <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> more shallow but affects the low-cloud fraction less. The relative importance different models assign to these opposing mechanisms contributes to the spread of the climatological shallowness of <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> and thus to the spread of low-cloud changes under global warming...|$|R

5|$|The {{first strike}} against Kaafjord was {{launched}} on 22 August. While flying conditions were poor due to <b>low</b> <b>cloud,</b> Moore decided to attack that day {{as some of}} his ships were starting to run low on fuel and would soon need {{to move away from}} Norway to refuel. At 11:00 am a force comprising 32 Barracudas, 24 Corsairs, 11 Fireflies, 9 Hellcats and 8 Seafires was launched from the three fleet carriers. No Avengers were dispatched as the cloudy conditions were unsuitable for the execution of their task. Because few mines were available and the Avengers could not safely land while still carrying these weapons, the mine-dropping element of the plan would fail if the aircraft were unable to locate Tirpitz and had to dump their loads into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN central column was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann flew {{his first}} combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann's wingman. When they {{encountered}} 10 enemy aircraft below, Hartmann, obsessed {{by the idea}} of scoring his first success, opened full throttle and became separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it instead. He then ran for cover in <b>low</b> <b>cloud,</b> and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel. Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew. Twenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first kill, an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, {{but by the end of}} 1942, he had added only one more victory to his tally. As with many high-scoring aces, it took him some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot.|$|E

5|$|Tuđman {{spent the}} night in a Croatian Air Force and Air Defence command posta tunnel running under the Gornji Gradwhere {{information}} on the movement of Yugoslav aircraft was relayed. In the morning, Yugoslav General Andrija Rašeta informed the press that his superiors may decide to attack Zagreb as a form of pressure on Tuđman. Three air raid alarms were sounded during the morning of 7 October because the Yugoslav Air Force deployed as many as 30 to 40 combat jets in the Zagreb area, and numerous tip-offs of imminent air raids were received from Yugoslav military bases. During the morning, Yugoslav Air Force jets were observed taking off from bases near Pula and Udbina in Croatia and Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No flights were recorded taking off from Željava Air Base, presumably because of <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover in the area. At 1:30pm, the Croatian Army captured a Yugoslav military communications centre and radar post near Velika Buna, south of Zagreb, hindering Yugoslav Air Force control of aircraft in the area. It is believed that the event affected the timing of the raid on the Banski dvori, the official residence of the President of Croatia at the time.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, {{acting as}} Squadron Leader, No. 825 Squadron FAA {{took off with}} his Fairey Swordfish {{formation}} at 12:25 to attack the ships. No. 411 and 64 Squadron were to escort the FAA but arrived over Manston 15 minutes late and missed the rendezvous. The only unit to keep to mission orders was Squadron Leader Brian Kingcome's No. 72 Squadron. Unaware of the Swordfish squadron's location, they ran into each other by fortunate accident. Owing to <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover, they dropped to between 50 and 100 feet. The heavy German fighter cover {{put an end to}} the protection the Spitfire's could provide as the RAF fighters now had to look after themselves. The Spitfires and Swordfish were engaged by Fw 190s of 8 staffel and 9 staffel./JG 26 led by Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Gerhard Schöpfel of III./JG 26. The Fw 190s were just relieving fighters of JG 2. Frail and slow, the Swordfish forced German pilots to lower their undercarriages to prevent overshooting the biplanes. In the event all six Swordfish were shot down. The Spitfires destroyed three Fw 190s in return. Several Swordfish managed to fire off their torpedoes but none found their mark. Lieutenant Commander Esmonde was shot down and killed by an Fw 190. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. Only five of the original eighteen Swordfish crew survived. No. 41 Squadron RAF claimed three Bf 109s (most likely from JG 1) destroyed and one damaged off the Belgian coast. No. 72 Squadron claimed three Fw 190s destroyed and four damaged in the battles around 13:00. No. 410 Squadron claimed two Bf 109s destroyed and two damaged in the same dogfights. The German ships consumed very little ammunition, as the action had been carried out largely by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The {{stand down}} order had meant RAF Bomber Command's {{contribution}} to the proceedings came relatively late in the day. It dispatched a total of 73 bombers at between 13:55 and 14:50 (GMT). None of the attackers succeeded in hitting their targets. At 14:35 nine Bristol Beauforts from No. 42 Squadron led by W.H Cliff took off. Arriving over Manston at 14:50 they found other aircraft from No. 407 RCAF orbiting. It took nearly 30 minutes to form a proper formation. With several other squadrons they attacked the Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen at heights of between 60 and 100 feet but their torpedoes missed. No losses were suffered by No. 42 Squadron. The Hudsons struck at between 400 and 900 feet. Two RCAF bombers were lost without success. No. 217 Squadron nearly achieved a hit on Gneisenau, but the ship turned away, just missing the salvo. Later, another wave of 134—137 bombers intercepted the ships between 16:00 and 17:05. Only 20 crews managed to make attacks owing to poor training (Bomber Command crews were not trained to hit naval targets), a <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> base (700 metres) and poor visibility (sea level visibility was between 1,000 and 2,000 yards). Nine bombers were lost. Another formation of 35 Vickers Wellington aircraft attempted a strike between 17:50 and 18:15, losing two of their number. The most notable raid in this action was by six Beauforts from No. 86, three from No. 217 and three from No. 22 Squadron. Wing Commander C. Flood, No. 86 Squadron led the attack in the only ASV-loaded aircraft. Locating the German ships in the darkness they attacked, but heavy AAA fire scattered the bombers and no successes were achieved. Of the 242 bombers that {{took part in the}} missions, it is likely only 39 conducted attacks, though it is possible that a further 16 carried out attacks, suggesting a total of 54 aircraft actually released their bombs against the ships. Of this total 15 of those were shot down. RAF Fighter Command also threw in fighter-bombers to try and inflict damage, operating Hawker Hurricanes over the Dover area.|$|E

The comparisons of CVS parameters obtained from four different approaches show that 1) by using the method developed by Wang and Rossow rawinsonde observations (raob’s) can sample all <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> and determine their boundaries accurately, but oversample <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> by about 10 %, mistaking clear moist layers for clouds; 2) cloud-base heights less than 200 m in the radar data are ambiguous, but can {{be replaced by the}} values measured by ceilometer; and 3) the practical limit on the accuracy of marine boundary layer cloud-top heights retrieved from satellites appears to be about 150 – 300 m mainly due to errors in specifying the atmospheric temperature and humidity in the inversion layer above the cloud.
