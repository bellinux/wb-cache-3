5|$|A {{catastrophic flood}} in March 1913, {{known as the}} Great Dayton Flood, led to the {{creation}} of the Miami Conservancy District, a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton, in 1914. Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several <b>locations</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city hosted the Dayton Project, a branch of the larger Manhattan Project, to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs. The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters moved down from the {{mountains}} and waited in hidden <b>locations</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city; they were assisted by RPF sympathisers residing in the area. On {{the morning of the}} 23rd they attacked. The Rwandan forces in the area were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although the Rwandan police and army did succeed for a while in repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR forces were assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, however, the defending forces were defeated, and the RPF held the whole of the city.|$|E

5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the bow of the ship and in a few other <b>locations</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> wreck was found the {{earliest}} dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E
