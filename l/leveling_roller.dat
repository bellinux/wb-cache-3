40|$|Abstract. In this paper, powder {{spreading}} {{property in}} Wood-Plastic Composite(WPC) Selective Laser Sintering(SLS) rapid prototyping(RP) process is studied. WPC is {{more suitable for}} make parts by SLS according to its advantages, such as low-cost and green biological etc [...] But as wood power is mainly composed of wood fiber and wood fibers have irregular shapes, easy to aggregate and block power spreading process, spreading powder uniformly on bed by <b>leveling</b> <b>roller</b> is difficult, resulting in bad shape quality of parts. In order to further improve powder spreading property of RP process, with optimal design of components, viscosity reducer calcium is added into WPC. Finally, as result of better powder spreading property, shape quality of the parts made by WPC is improved greatly and have good {{as well as with}} good laser sintering properties...|$|E
40|$|The common {{grades of}} steel used in roll forming are: hot rolled carbon steel, high {{strength}} low alloy and recovery annealed cold rolled sheet. These steels {{are prone to}} ageing and are often skin passed and/or roller leveled to eliminate ageing as it can lead to problems in forming. In roll forming, shape defects such as bow, twist and camber are considered to be related to very small plastic strains in the longitudinal direction and hence knowledge of the material properties in the elastic plastic transition range is necessary if the process is to be modelled accurately. Previous studies with aluminium have indicated that skin pass rolling can lead to residual stresses in the strip. In this work, the study was extended to aged carbon steel and to the effect of <b>roller</b> <b>leveling</b> on both aged material and strip that had been given a light cold rolling to simulate a skin pass treatment. The results suggest that <b>roller</b> <b>leveling</b> reduced the magnitude of residual stresses resulting from skin pass rolling. The significant differences observed between tensile and bending test results, at and near, the elastic plastic transition reinforces the need to consider bending properties when assessing the effect of prior processing on strip for roll forming. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} {{numerical}} {{analysis of the}} process of <b>roller</b> <b>leveling</b> of long products. The problem of multiple elastic plastic bending is solved by a program in Matlab, which is based on the Finite Element Method. The aim is to provide a simple, user friendly tool, capable of quick and reliable analysis of the process without the necessity to work with large multipurpose FEM packages. Direct solution of the problem is formulated, starting from the roll intermeshing and product geometry. Roller loading, product deflection, curvature and plastification are the output parameters of the program. With fast and reliable solution of the direct problem, optimal setting of the leveling process will be sought in an iterative process...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to determine residual stress distribution in sheet material from data collected in a free bending test. It may be used where the residual stress distribution is symmetrical about the mid-surface as {{it is usually the}} case for frequently-used sheet metal post-processing techniques such as skin-pass or temper rolling, tension- and <b>roller</b> <b>leveling.</b> An existing inverse technique is used to obtain a residual stress profile and material constants that provide the best fit in a finite element analysis of bending with the experimentally derived moment-curvature relation. The method is verified for bending of a low-carbon stainless steel using measurement of residual stress by X-ray diffraction. The residual stresses were induced in the sheet by cold rolling. The technique described here can be used industrially as a rapid method of investigating residual stresses in incoming sheet. In processes where the deformation is principally one of bending, such as cold roll forming, it is known that residual stresses have an influence on shape defects and springback and the method presented here can be used to determine whether incoming sheet is suitable for further processing and also as a means of obtaining improved material data input for numerical simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (tension or <b>roller)</b> <b>leveling</b> or by {{skin-pass}} rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of skin passing on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of skin passing on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during skin passing, and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the skin passing process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the skin pass condition...|$|R
