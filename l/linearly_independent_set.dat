2500|$|A linear {{combination}} of any system of vectors with all zero coefficients is the zero vector of V. If {{this is the}} only way to express the zero vector as a {{linear combination}} of v1, v2, ..., vk then these vectors are linearly independent. Given a set of vectors that span a space, if any vector w is a linear combination of other vectors (and so the set is not linearly independent), then the span would remain the same if we remove w from the set. Thus, a set of linearly dependent vectors is redundant in the sense that there will be a linearly independent subset which will span the same subspace. Therefore, we are mostly interested in a <b>linearly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>set</b> of vectors that spans a vector space V, which we call a basis of V. Any set of vectors that spans V contains a basis, and any <b>linearly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>set</b> of vectors in V can be extended to a basis. It turns out that if we accept the axiom of choice, every vector space has a basis; nevertheless, this basis may be unnatural, and indeed, may not even be constructible. For instance, there exists a basis for the real numbers, considered as a vector space over the rationals, but no explicit basis has been constructed.|$|E
