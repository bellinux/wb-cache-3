Beyoncé appears {{standing in front of}} a purple background, draped by large and billowing garments. As the song progresses, her emotions are heightened; zoomed shots of tears trickling down her cheeks are shown. A man appears behind Beyoncé and begins closely embracing her in endearment. The man is nondescript, and his muscular arms grip Beyoncé's body before taking her through a series of dips and bends, while he remains mostly in the background. With tears still rolling down her cheeks, Beyoncé chants to her love interest to make love to her on the song's vocal finale. As the guitar melodies close the song, Beyoncé is seen engulfed by the colorful light and special effects. The video ends with the camera returning to a glistening Beyoncé with blackened scenery in the background.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To assess nailfold {{capillary}} {{density and}} dimensions {{in patients with}} primary Raynaud's phenomenon (PRP), limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (LSSc) and diffuse cutaneous SSc (DSSc), and healthy control subjects. Methods. Using the technique of nailfold video capillaroscopy, capillary density and dimensions were averaged from all visible capillaries in a 3 mm length of the nailfold from right and <b>left</b> <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> of each subject. Twenty healthy control subjects, 15 patients with PRP, 13 patients with DSSc and 21 patients with LSSc were examined. Intra-observer and inter-observer variability were calculated in 18 and 23 patients, respectively. Results. There were significant trends for capillary density to fall and for all dimensions to rise across the four groups (P < 0. 0001 for density and all dimensions, order healthy controls, PRP, DSSc and LSSc). Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility studies showed that although there was good correlation between and within observers, the limits of agreement were between ± 25 – 50 % indicating lack of reproducibility. Conclusions. Microcirculatory abnormalities can be quantified using the technique of video capillaroscopy and were most marked in patients with LSSc...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{patterns}} of fingerprints {{is important in}} anthropology and medical genetics, chiefly because of their diagnostic usefulness. In the present work, we studied the frequencies of various types of skin ridges of the first phalanx in patients with sever oligospermia or azospermia. In a double-blind case-control study, we determined the frequencies of fingerprints in 880 first phalanxes belonging to 48 men with sever oligospermia and 40 men with azospermia. We determined the types of fingerprints based on Galton classification. Also their FRC, TFRC and AFRC were calculated. Then the results were compared {{with each other and}} general population as control group. The most frequent type of fingerprint in both case groups was "Loop". Frequencies of different types among two groups of cases were statistically different (P< 0. 005). Also they were statistically different with general population (P< 0. 005). The largest mean of FRC in men with oligospermia was belonging to the <b>left</b> <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> (23. 1) and the second to the right thumbs (21. 91). The largest mean of FRC in men with azospermia was belonging to the right thumbs (23. 6) and the second to the right <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> (22. 6). The mean of TFRCs in men with oligosoermia and azospermia were 106. 8 and 114. 39, respectively, and the mean of AFRCs in those two groups were 14 and 11, respectively; their differences were not statistically significant. It can be concluded that qualitative feathers of the fingerprints of men with oligospermia and azospermia were different {{with each other and with}} general population.

5000|$|In Western cultures, {{a wedding}} ring is {{traditionally}} worn on the <b>ring</b> <b>finger.</b> This developed from the Roman [...] "anulus pronubis" [...] when the man gave a ring to {{the woman at the}} betrothal ceremony. Blessing the wedding ring and putting it on the bride's finger dates from the 11th century. In medieval Europe, the Christian wedding ceremony placed the ring in sequence on the thumb, index, middle, and <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> of the <b>left</b> hand. The <b>ring</b> was then <b>left</b> on the <b>ring</b> <b>finger.</b> In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. For example, a Greek Orthodox bride wears the <b>ring</b> on the <b>left</b> hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding. In England, the 1549 Prayer Book declared [...] "the ring shall be placed on the left hand". By the 17th and 18th centuries the ring could be found on any finger after the ceremony — even on the thumb.|$|R
40|$|The {{skeleton}} is {{the third}} most common site for metastasis of malignant carcinoma after the lung and liver, most frequently involving the ax-ial skeleton and the proximal ends of long bones, ribs, and vertebrae. 1 Acrometastasis, metastasis to hands or feet, comprises only 0. 1 % of all metastases. The distal phalanx is most frequently involved, followed by metacarpals and remaining phalanges. 2, 3 Acro-metastases typically arise from primary lung, kidney, and breast tumors in decreasing order of frequency. 3 Here, we report 2 cases of hand acrometastasis, one from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the other from renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Acrometastasis, a poor prognostic indicator of survival, requires the plastic hand surgeon to understand prognosis and treatment to appropriately manage these patients. CASE 1 A 30 -year-old man presented to the clinic for bleed-ing masses of the <b>left</b> <b>ring</b> and small <b>fingers.</b> His medical history consists of Hepatitis B and HCC with metastasis to the brain and phalanges of the left hand. He under-went 2 craniotomies, Gamma knife treatment for the brain metastasis, and chemotherapy and radiation to the left hand. Physical examination revealed blistering masses of the <b>left</b> <b>ring</b> and small <b>fingers</b> that bled and enlarged over several days and weeks, respectively, be-fore presentation (Fig. 1). The hand was nonfunctional, diffusely tender, and exhibited muscular wasting. Radio-graphs demonstrated an aggressive lesion in the second metacarpal and a transverse lucent lesion with nondis-placed fracture in the fourth distal phalanx (Fig. 2). Sur-gical treatment consisted of palliative amputation to the middle phalanx of the <b>ring</b> and small <b>fingers.</b> With an uneventful recovery, the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5 on chemotherapy. The wounds healed without complication (Fig. 1). Disclosure: The authors have no financial interest to declare {{in relation to the}} content of this article.
