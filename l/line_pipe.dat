40|$|Installing <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> {{by means}} of the reeling {{installation}} method seems to be an attractive combination, because it provides the opportunity of eliminating the demanding welds from the critical time offshore and instead preparing them onshore. However, reeling of <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> is not yet proven technology. From previous research it is known that <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> undergoing high plastic strains during reeling, exhibits liner wrinkling and extensive ovalisation. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the possibility of installing <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> {{by means of}} the reeling installation method. A combination of pure bending numerical models and full scale four point bend tests were used to reach the objective. The cascade of events exhibited by the <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> in pure bending was fully understood. Liner wrinkling appeared to be the main failure mode of <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> during bending. The sensitivity of the wrinkling behaviour of the confined liner in pure bending for several geometric, material and contact parameters was examined by means of a parameter study. From this study it is concluded that reeling of <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> can become technically feasible, most effectively by adjusting the geometric and contact parameters of the <b>lined</b> <b>pipe.</b> Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of bi-metal <b>lining</b> <b>pipes</b> {{is more and}} more extensive because of low cost and resistance to corrosion. The inner diameter of bi-metal <b>lining</b> <b>pipe</b> decreases 1 mm∼ 8 mm as compared to carbon steel pipe. It's necessary to reevaluate the transporting capacity and friction loss of bi-metal pipes. The flow frictional characteristics and transporting capacity of bi-metal <b>lining</b> <b>pipe</b> whose outer diameter ranged from φ 114 mm to φ 324 mm were studied. Studies showed that the inner surface roughness affected transporting capacity much more than the flow cross section in condition of the same pipe size. Wall thickness of <b>lining</b> <b>pipe</b> had little effects on the transporting capacity when it was less than 4 mm. The friction of bi-metal <b>lining</b> <b>pipe</b> was less than carbon steel pipe. Therefore, the transporting capacity of bi-metal <b>lining</b> <b>pipe</b> was higher than carbon steel pipe by 23 %- 46 % in condition of the same pipe size and pressure drop, and the transporting distance was much farther. Research results in the paper provide reliable guidance for designing bi-metal lining gas pipelines...|$|R

The {{exploitation}} of high acid wells is facing severe corrosion {{challenges in the}} A and B gas fields in Sichuan, thus using <b>lined</b> steel <b>pipe</b> is a reliable and cost-effective anti-corrosion measure.

So {{it is necessary to}} make evaluation for corrosion of <b>lined</b> steel <b>pipe.</b> In this paper, taking welding gap of L 245 / 825 <b>lined</b> steel <b>pipe</b> as example, the anti-SSC performances of L 245 / 825 straight and ring welding gaps in NACE A solution were studied by CR method, and anti-cracking performances of them were evaluated by laboratory experiments.
