Compliance with environmental norms of coal pyrolysis or gasification of various type of coals, feasible combustion systems and energy production facilities are needed in today's modern technology, also enable the production of liquid and gaseous coal fuels. However, raw materials and chemical nature of them requires a variety of adaptation methods. This study examined the high sulfur and ash types of K?tahya, Denizli, Aydin, Soma lignite, Sirnak asphaltite and lignite. The representative samples were taken from local areas of the lignites.

30|$|In the Tahe {{oilfield}} in China, {{heavy oil}} is commonly lifted using the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology. However, {{due to the}} lack of <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> the production of heavy oil has been seriously limited. Thus, a new compound technology of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending and electric heating is discussed in this paper, which aims to reduce the usage of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and maintain heavy oil production. Based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation, a pressure and temperature coupling model is developed. The heat-transfer parameters are calculated by using Hasan–Kabir method and the pressure drop is calculated by using Hagedorn–Brown method. The model also considers the blend effect of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and heavy oil, and the heating effect of electric rod. Example calculation shows that only electric heating or <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology cannot meet the requirement.

25|$|Recently {{there has}} been a large {{increase}} in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as <b>oil,</b> <b>coal,</b> and natural gas. One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, <b>oil,</b> <b>coal,</b> and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy.
