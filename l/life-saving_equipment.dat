500|$|Some East Germans {{tried to}} escape by jumping {{overboard}} from East German ships docked in Baltic harbours. So many East Germans attempted to flee this way in Danish ports that harbourmasters installed extra <b>life-saving</b> <b>equipment</b> on quaysides where East German vessels docked. The GDR's government responded by stationing armed Transportpolizei (Trapos) on passenger ships to deal forcefully with escape attempts. On one occasion in August 1961, the Trapos caused an international incident in the Danish port of Gedser, when they beat up a would-be escapee on the quayside and opened fire, hitting a Danish boat in the harbour.

25|$|The {{department}} had serious problems: The dispatching system {{could not identify}} {{the exact location of}} structures like the United States Capitol or the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dispatchers sent crews to the wrong locations or in the wrong directions, firefighters didn't know how to use <b>life-saving</b> emergency <b>equipment</b> such as defibrillators, injuries to civilians during fires were on the increase, fire engines and ambulances were having more accidents while responding to calls, and ambulances took twice as long to respond to calls (11 minutes and 21 seconds) than the national average. The training structures at the fire academy were in serious disrepair, trainees were found extensively cheating on tests, there were equipment and employee shortages, and equipment was old and in disrepair. Three firefighters died in 1999 in two months, creating a deep morale problem. (Prior to the incidents, just a single firefighter had died in 11 years.) Few had little experience overseeing the provision of emergency medical care, although 80 percent of calls in D.C. were of that nature. Few was also only the second fire chief hired from outside the department, and had extremely poor relations with the firefighter's union.|$|R
2500|$|A May 2001 {{performance}} report {{showed that}} the D.C. fire department was deteriorating rapidly under Few's leadership. Halfway through the budget year, Few met only one of four major goals (filling 120 firefighter vacancies). The number of injuries to firefighters and civilian injuries and deaths had far outstripped the year's goals, and building inspections were far below the expected level. Ambulances were supposed to reach patients 90 {{percent of the time}} within eight minutes. Few changed this to 70 percent without explanation, and still the department could not reach the goal. The department was also caught manipulating data in an attempt to improve the response times. (For example, fire engines with paramedics aboard often responded faster to a medical emergency than a paramedic-driven ambulance with <b>life-saving</b> <b>equipment.</b> DCFEMS began incorporating fire engine response times and neglected to make the changed clear.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press, however, {{took issue}} with Ellerbe's assessment. The news agency {{reported}} that 40 paramedics left the department during Ellerbe's tenure, but just two had been hired in the same period. It also reported that [...] "the new hires and equipment still leave the District of Columbia well short of the staffing levels in similar-sized cities". Whereas most similarly-situated EMS departments deployed more than 70 paramedics per shift, DCFEMS had just 35—and 21 of those were not riding ambulances (with their <b>life-saving</b> <b>equipment)</b> but riding on fire engines. DCFEMS {{officials said they had}} no plan {{to increase the number of}} paramedics per shift. The firefighters' union said the short staffing meant that roughly five of the 14 advanced life support ambulances available each day were downgraded to basic life support because they were staffed only with EMTs. They also said incidents of mandatory overtime were increasing because there were so few paramedics.|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2013, DCFEMS again {{failed to}} provide timely {{ambulance}} service to an injured D.C. police officer. A call was placed to DCFEMS to provide an ambulance at about 3:52 or 3:53 P.M. A fire truck reached the scene first, and an advanced life support ambulance was then summoned. It left its station at 3:55 P.M. After it did not arrive, a basic life support ambulance was dispatched at 4:06 P.M., arriving two minutes later. The advanced life support ambulance arrived after the officer had been taken to the hospital. The advanced life support ambulance was [...] away and needed 15 minutes to reach {{the site of the}} incident. A DCFEMS spokesperson could not explain why there were no advanced life support ambulances any closer to the incident. However, the department admitted that half the city's advanced life support ambulances were downgraded to basic life support on September 10 due to severe shortages of personnel trained to use their advance <b>life-saving</b> <b>equipment.</b> (The department relies on lesser-trained EMTs to staff ambulances when there are too few paramedics.) ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis addresses the problem encountered by non-profit medical centers in formulating budgets for capital expenditure decisions. Using Naval Regional Medical Center (NRMC) San Diego {{as an example}} a benefit/cost model was developed. The costs used in the authors analysis were those that {{were considered to be}} relevant and incremental. The benefits derived were a composite weighting of four factors determined from a survey of the chiefs of service at NRMC San Diego. These four factors are utilization rate of <b>equipment,</b> <b>life-saving</b> potential, greater dependability of service and better diagnosis and evaluation of patient needs. The composite rating was then extended over the estimated economic life of the equipment and divided by the net cost to determine an index of service. Finally, equipment proposals were ranked by index of service. This model was determined by the author and senior hospital administrators to be very useful in tentative ranking of equipment proposals.

40|$|The {{neonatal}} {{intensive care}} unit (NICU) is frequently occupied by newborns who are marginally viable, or critically unwell, and could be considered terminally ill. It is a busy, highly technical environment with an arsenal of <b>life-saving</b> medical <b>equipment</b> at its disposal, and advances in technology used in this field stretch the boundaries of viability. Despite technological advances, increases {{in the margins of}} viability and highly skilled healthcare delivery, some newborns will still die in the NICU. In recent years, palliative care for the neonatal population has become increasingly topical and part of the lexicon of contemporary neonatal practice. Evidence-based protocols are available to inform this model of care, yet in reality, provision of palliative care to newborns is ad hoc. The reasons why implementing a palliative model of care have been problematic are unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the barriers and facilitators to palliative care practice in neonatal nursing, and to develop policy recommendations to improve this area of practice. This exploratory research was conducted to answer two research questions: 1) What are the barriers and facilitators to palliative care practice in neonatal nursing? 2) How can the identified issues be addressed to inform policy and clinical guidelines in the practice environment? Phase one of this investigation developed, pilot tested, and administered an instrument to identify the barriers and facilitators to practice. Data analysis identified three subscales that indicated facilitators and barriers to palliative care practice. The second phase of this study used a translational research approach, utilizing interpretive methods to explore and contextualise the population study findings to inform policy development to improve palliative care practice in neonatal nursing. This research has identified that the facilitators that do exist for palliative care practice are subject to caveats that impinge markedly upon these facilitators. Furthermore, the barriers that were identified pose threats to the integration of a palliative model of care into Australian neonatal nursing practice. Thus, the overall results from this research have lead to a composite understanding of the barriers and facilitators to palliative care practice in Australian neonatal nursing, which may account for the gap between support of palliative care for marginally viable and critically ill newborns, and the application of this model of care in clinical practice. Translating the survey findings into policy directives that are applicable to the clinical environment has resulted in the development of recommendations that are aimed at improving palliative care practice in the NICU...|$|R
