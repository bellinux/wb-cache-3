60|$|Here {{she read}} {{that there were}} plenty of {{apparent}} instances of this in Scripture, and that it was formed into a recognized system in the early Church. With reference to direct acts of deception, it was argued that since there were confessedly cases where killing is no murder, might there not be cases where lying is no sin? It could not be right--or, indeed, anything but most absurd--to say in effect that no doubt circumstances would occur where every sound man would tell a lie, and would be a brute or a fool if he did not, and to say {{at the same time that}} it is quite indefensible in principle.

In this paper we compare existing practices in the EU to WTO rules and to other WTO Members. Our comparative analysis reveals that the EU's "lesser-duty rule", which limits {{the magnitude of the}} Antidumping duty to the level of domestic injury caused by dumped imports, results in a lower average duty level in EU cases, particularly when compared to the US. In terms of the "Sunset Clause", which limits the duration of protection to 5 years, the EU presents a lower share of measures lasting beyond this limit as compared to other users of Antidumping. In recent years, the number of case initiations by the EU has decreased. There has also been a shift towards the imposition of duties and away from the use of price undertakings as a protectionist measure. In line with other WTO members, an increasing share of cases are targeted against China, where it used to be predominantly Central-European countries and Japan, as well as other low or middle income countries.

40|$|As medidas {{antidumping}} são uma exceção ao livre comércio e como tal deveriam ser usadas com restrição. No entanto, desde o GATT 1947 há preocupação com o uso abusivo de tais medidas, podendo ser o mecanismo utilizado não apenas para possibilitar a recuperação da indústria doméstica prejudicada pelas importações objeto de dumping, objetivo do Acordo Antidumping (AAD), mas com o fim de proteger a indústria nacional da concorrência estrangeira. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente trabalho é apresentar as principais características do AAD firmado ao final da Rodada Uruguai que culminou na constituição da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), incluindo seus antecedentes históricos e a possibilidade de aplicação discricionária, demonstrando como uma norma surgida no plano internacional em decorrência de um acordo multilateral vem sendo utilizada pelo Brasil, com a finalidade de se demonstrar a possibilidade de uso das medidas antidumping como barreira à entrada no mercado brasileiro. Confirmada a possibilidade de uso abusivo desse instrumento de defesa comercial, ainda que no plano teórico, uma vez que não é possível analisar os efeitos reais das medidas aplicadas, serão apresentadas as formas de contrabalanço ao protecionismo atualmente existentes no próprio AAD e sua incorporação e utilização pelo Brasil bem como a possibilidade de questionamento de tais medidas como práticas anticompetitivas com fundamento na legislação antitruste perante as autoridades de defesa da concorrência. Serão ainda analisadas outras possibilidades de contrabalanço ao uso exacerbado das medidas antidumping em debate e viabilidade das mesmas no cenário atual em que se verifica, de um lado, o aumento de uso de tais medidas pelos países Membros da OMC, destacando-se o Brasil e, de outro lado, impasse nas negociações multilaterais, cabendo aos Membros tomarem decisões unilaterais sobre a aplicação de tais medidas, seu grau de intensidade e forma de aplicação a depender da proteção que se pretende garantir à indústria nacional. Antidumping {{measures are}} {{an exception to}} the free trade and as such they should be used with restrictions. However, since GATT 1947 there is a concern regarding the abuse in the use of such measures, being possible the use of the instrument not only to make possible the recovery of the domestic industry that was injured by the dumped imports, purpose of the Antidumping Agreement (ADA), but also with the purpose of protecting the domestic industry of the foreign competition. Thus, the purpose of this Masters Thesis is to present the main aspects of the ADA signed {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round, that led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including its historical background and the possibility of discretionary application, being demonstrated how a rule emerged in an international level as part of a multilateral agreement has been used by Brazil. The purpose is to demonstrate the possibility of the use of the antidumping measures as a barrier to entry in the Brazilian market. Being confirmed the possibility of the abusive use of this trade defense instrument, even if only in theory, since it is not possible to analyze the actual impacts of the applied measures, it will be present the possibilities to counterbalance the protectionism that are established in the ADA, namely the public interest clause and the <b>lesser</b> <b>duty</b> rule, and their adoption and use by Brazil and possibility of challenging such measures as anticompetitive practices based on the antitrust law before the Brazilian Antitrust Authority. Additional possibilities under debate and their feasibility to counterbalance the abuse in the use of the antidumping measures will also be analyzed in the actual scenario where, on one hand, there is the increase of such measures by WTO Members in general and mainly Brazil and, on the other hand, there is an impasse in the multilateral negotiations.

40|$|Abstract. Multi-stage {{cascaded}} quasi Z-source inverter (qZSI) {{features a}} <b>lesser</b> shoot-through <b>duty</b> ratio {{for the same}} boost factor of the input voltage, but the traditional qZSI has the disadvantage of possessing increased shoot-through ratio and very high component stress at the same voltage boost factor. The whole idea of this work is to present a multi-stage cascaded quasi Z-source inverter for application to photovoltaic power system. Three-stage cascaded qZSI is obtained by adding two diodes, two inductances and three capacitances to the traditional quasi Z-source network. Due to the cascaded structure and qZSI topology, the proposed system acquires all the advantages of impedance inverter that can realize boost/buck function in a single-stage with improved reliability, lower component rating, constant DC current from source and good power quality. Besides, the three-stage cascaded solution the shoot-through duty cycle by 25 % at the same voltage boost factor. The topological characteristics of three-stage cascaded qZSI system is analysed and operating principles are discussed. An experimental prototype is built to test the three-stage cascaded qZSI module. Simulation and experimental results are presented {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the proposed system...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Upper Canadian historiography has {{emphasized}} {{the role of}} the Family Compact and the flow of authority from the provincial centre. It has stressed the dominance of the York elites and their control of the province through constitutional structure, the imposition of a Conservative ideology or patronage. Local magistrates, however, governed the districts and formed a counterweight to the Family Compact. The Lieutenant-Governor appointed magistrates to administer all district affairs and to judge all petty debt and petty crime. Once appointed the decisions of the magistracy were final and the distant officials at York did not interfere. While the provincial government appointed the magistracy, their prestige and appointment was derived as much from district influence as from their connections with York. Previously appointed officials recommended suitable candidates who were often merchants and shopkeepers who provided district credit. Some were land promoters and entrepreneurs who developed the district commercial infrastructure. Many had historic roots in the Niagara, suffered the effects of the American Revolutionary War and served as militia officers during the war of 1812 - 14. A constellation of economic, social and political interests bound the magistrates to regional not central interests. Although the magistracy formed an elite group with numerous legislated powers, they did not act alone. The magistracy appointed constables to serve writs, warrants and subpoenas, to apprehend criminals and to ferry people {{back and forth from the}} magistrates to the district gaol, to oversee township elections and to perform a myriad of <b>lesser</b> <b>duties.</b> The township constabulary was crucial to the workings of the judicial system and spread the authority of the magistracy throughout the district. While some constables came from the upper reaches of their society, the magistracy selected the constabulary primarily from respectable farmers, innkeepers and local artisans. The majority was appointed from loyalist families and many had fought for the British as Butlers Rangers. Fathers and sons from this group had an historic allegiance to British institutions that was further expressed during the war of 1812 - 14. For their patriotism they had received bountiful land grants and had a vested interest in the new province. Constables as neighbours, relatives and friends acted as the bridge between the authority of the magistracy and the community. This study finds that coincident interests, district prominence and a supportive constabulary solidified the rule of the magistracy at the local level. The provincial government was many miles away and had little influence in local affairs. The traditional stress on the importance of an all powerful York-based rule has skewed the picture. Although connected to the provincial elite by their appointment, local judicial elites acting independently of the provincial government sustained local governance at the level of the district...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work evaluates amine-blend solvent {{systems for}} CO 2 {{post-combustion}} capture applications for a 600 MWe conventional coal-fired power plant. The equilibrium-based Aspen Plus® absorption/desorption simulation tool {{was used for}} this evaluation. The total amine blends concentration was kept at the value of 30 wt% for all different systems. Monoethanolamine (MEA) and diethanolamine (DEA) of weight variation of 3, 5, 10 and 15 % are blended with 2 -amino- 2 -methylpropanol (AMP), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Fixed cross heat exchanger approach temperature of 10 °C and stripper bottom temperature of 120 °C are used as design specifications. These design specifications are used to screen each blend without CO 2 loading through sensitivity analysis. The AMP with 3, 5, 10 and 15 wt% blended DEA (the activator) was found to require <b>lesser</b> reboiler <b>duty</b> in comparison with 30 wt% MEA, with lowest value of 3. 17 GJth/tonCO 2 for 5 wt% DEA activation. The promising four blends are further optimized using varying CO 2 loadings. The blend of 5 wt% DEA and 25 wt% AMP with lean loading of 0. 07 molCO 2 /molblend requires the lowest reboiler duty of 3. 03 GJth/ton-CO 2 and lowest recirculation rate of 14. 882 m 3 /ton. Absorber temperature profiles indicate temperature changes depend significantly on the lean loading.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of HistoryDonald J. MrozekThis work {{examines}} Maxwell M. Rabb's role in {{the area}} of civil rights and race relations from January 1953 through May 1958 during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Rabb was the first Secretary to the Cabinet, a position created by Eisenhower. In his <b>lesser</b> known <b>duty,</b> Max Rabb quietly developed many aspects of President Eisenhower's civil rights program. Chapter One describes Rabb's pivotal role in ending segregation in the military establishment to include the Navy and the Veterans Administration. In this chapter Rabb is a lone operator, personally meeting with principal actors in the Eisenhower Administration and U. S. Congress to end segregation. Chapter Two examines how Rabb participated in and helped to develop the various organizations of the White House. As the organizations within the Eisenhower White House matured, Rabb was able to use them as roads into the problem of civil rights and to use their power to advance civil rights. The final chapter focuses on the confluence of race relations and human rights on the one hand with U. S. domestic and foreign policy on the other. The chapter uses four cases studies to illustrate the growing importance of American race relations in world affairs after World War II. Max Rabb's participation in each case serves as a reminder that the American domestic sphere had become a cause of international concern and could damage the credibility of U. S democratic values in the a world where racial sensitivity was on the rise and increasingly a factor in international relations. This work ends by concluding that Rabb's effectiveness was severely limited by President Eisenhower's narrow understanding of the limits of government. Rabb was a New Deal Republican serving in the administration of a man who rejected the activism required by New Deal Liberalism. Though Rabb served Eisenhower well, it was Eisenhower who failed to sense the full scope of the problems in U. S. civil rights and race relations...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, {{there have been}} three {{significant}} events that have fundamentally changed the way that business is conducted: the slew of corporate collapses in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, the global financial crisis that started around 2007 - 8 and, more recently, rapid changes resulting from information technology, often referred to as ‘digital disruption’. The impact that information technology has on business is significant and the reach of digital disruption cuts across the very fabric of society. Though changes in information technology and digital disruption bring with it boundless opportunities for reward, there is often no reward without risk and changes in information technology and digital disruption has significant and important consequences for those managing businesses, which in the case of companies, is the board of directors. The central question posed by this dissertation is whether the pervasiveness of information technology and information technology risk has changed virtually every aspect of business and thereby also the statutory duty of care and diligence of all directors as set out in s 180 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The hypothesis laid out in this dissertation is that directors’ statutory duty of care and diligence has broadened due to information technology and its resultant risk {{in much the same way}} as corporate governance measures, risk management, ongoing disclosure and financial literacy requirements have changed the way that directors go about their business as a consequence of corporate collapses and the global financial crisis. The dissertation sets about making this case by classifying business risk into the following categories: strategic risk, legal, regulatory and compliance risk, financial, financial reporting and disclosure risk, operational, business continuity and disaster risk, and people, reputation, customer and market risk. A strong case is then made that information technology and information technology risk is inextricably linked to each risk category and to every aspect of the business of a company and is, therefore, in the remit of all the directors. Particularly in so far as the link between strategic risk and IT is concerned, all of the members of the board must have a reasonable understanding of the impact of IT on the business, as sound business strategy requires an understanding of the business of the company, which undoubtedly includes IT pervasively. But, boards are made up predominantly of non-executive directors who are not involved in the day-to-day business activities of a company, evidenced by an analysis of the composition of the boards of the ten largest listed companies in Australia and their board committees. Further, though there is an emergence of Digital directors, the scope of their responsibilities is usually limited to transformation related to digital disruption. It is, therefore, on that basis that this dissertation presents an analysis of the objective general duty of care and diligence of all directors in the context of IT and concludes that, based on case law, the objective general duty of care and diligence of each director, irrespective of whether they are non-executive or executive directors, are: •	That each director must be familiar with the impact of IT on the business, as IT is fundamental to the business; •	To understand the impact of IT on the business so that they remain informed about the business; •	To understand the impact of IT and IT risk on strategy and how IT strategy affects most, if not all business areas; •	To give direction about IT and to monitor IT; •	All of which may be summarised as being ‘IT literate’. Therefore, just as directors must be financially literate, without necessarily being accounting experts, they must be IT literate, without necessarily being IT experts. In the case of companies that have appointed a Digital director, IT director, CIO or others, these directors and officer can play an important in advising the board at a strategic level of the role that IT can play, but this does not change the objective general duty of care and diligence.
