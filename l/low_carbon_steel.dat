25|$|One of {{the most}} famous steels {{produced}} in the medieval Near East was Damascus steel used for swordmaking, and mostly produced in Damascus, Syria, in the period from 900 to 1750. This was produced using the crucible steel method, based on the earlier Indian wootz steel. This process was adopted in the Middle East using locally produced steels. The exact process remains unknown, but it allowed carbides to precipitate out as micro particles arranged in sheets or bands within the body of a blade. Carbides are far harder than the surrounding <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> so swordsmiths could produce an edge that cut hard materials with the precipitated carbides, while the bands of softer steel let the sword as a whole remain tough and flexible. A team of researchers based at the Technical University of Dresden that uses X-rays and electron microscopy to examine Damascus steel discovered the presence of cementite nanowires and carbon nanotubes. Peter Paufler, a member of the Dresden team, says that these nanostructures give Damascus steel its distinctive properties and are a result of the forging process.|$|E

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> {{exhibit the}} high {{positive}} rate sensitivities of flow stress and dynamic strain ageing effect (DSA) {{associated with high}} warm rolling temperatures. This leads to poor formability of warm rolled and annealed sheet [1, 2]. One approach to lower the rate sensitivity of these steels is to remove the carbon from solid solution by adding carbide forming elements such as Cr [1, 3, 4]. The aim of this work was to investigate solute segregation and Cottrell atmosphere formation in warm rolled <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> The <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> used in this investigation contained 0. 17 ± 0. 01 at. % C, 0. 32 ± 0. 02 at. % Mn, 0. 55 ± 0. 01 at. % Cr with and without addition of 0. 0072 at. % P. The atomic level microstructural characterizations were performed in the ORNL local electrode atom probe. This state-of-the-art instrument features a substantially larger field of view and a significantly faster data acquisition speed compared to previous three-dimensional atom probes [6]. These improvements facilitate the characterization of low densities of microstructural features such as dislocations. The results revealed that DSA had occurred during warm rolling of alloyed <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> Several C and C-Cr clusters were observed distributed relatively uniformly in the ferrite matrix, as shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|The {{critical}} role of manganese sulphide (MnS) inclusions for {{the initiation of}} the short-term growth of pitting or localized corrosion of <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> has long been recognized. Classical results show that pitting probability and pitting severity increases with increased sulphide concentration for <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> {{as a result of}} magnesium sulphides acting as local cathodes for initiating pitting corrosion. However, the iron carbides (cementite) in steels can also act as local cathodes for initiation of pitting corrosion. Herein it is proposed that there is competition between pits for cathodic area and that this will determine the severity of pitting and general corrosion observed in extended exposures. Preliminary experimental data for immersion exposures of up to 56 days in natural seawater of three <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> show, contrary to conventional wisdom, greater pit depths for the steels with lower S content. However, the pit depth results are consistent with lower C/S ratios. This is considered to support the concept of cathodic competition between C and S.
