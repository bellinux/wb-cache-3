After having been granted the right to establish services to Amsterdam in early 1996, the airline started Guangzhou–Beijing–Amsterdam, its first <b>long-haul</b> <b>route,</b> in November 1996.

50|$|These {{bilateral}} restrictions seriously impeded BCal's {{efforts to}} successfully build {{a network of}} short-haul, European feeder services that was essential to provide sufficient transfer traffic for its <b>long-haul</b> <b>routes</b> from Gatwick. Furthermore, these restrictions {{made it difficult to}} offer its passengers a more frequent service on certain <b>long-haul</b> <b>routes</b> that could have attracted more high-yield business traffic. It also left the airline with an incomplete network, which resulted in a weak route structure. This, in turn, constituted a major competitive disadvantage.|$|R

25|$|Slots {{left by the}} US {{carriers}} (and {{the collapse}} of Zoom, XL Airways UK and Sterling) were taken by EasyJet, Flybe, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. A number of full-service airlines have established or resumed operations at the airport, including Aeroflot, Cathay Pacific, Swiss International Air Lines and Turkish Airlines. This {{is part of the}} airport's strategy to attract higher-spending business travellers (countering its dependence on European low-cost and charter markets), increasing year-round capacity utilisation by smoothing peaks and troughs in traffic. Gatwick's success in persuading these airlines to launch (or re-launch) routes to overseas destinations important for business and leisure travel was aided by a lack of comparable slots at Heathrow. On 16 June 2015, it was announced that Canadian airline WestJet would begin flights to Gatwick in the spring of 2016. This was followed by an announcement on 25 June 2015 by Air Canada Rouge that it would begin a seasonal service from Gatwick to Toronto on 20 May 2016. On 20 April 2017, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced its first <b>long-haul</b> <b>route</b> operated by Norwegian Air UK from Gatwick to Singapore.|$|E

The aim of this study is to analyze whether the low cost business model is applicable for <b>long-haul</b> <b>routes,</b> which parts of the model are transferable to long-haul services, what competitors responses might be and whether there is potential for low cost airlines operating in Scandinavia to gain frequent, well paying and demanding business travelers on their future <b>long-haul</b> <b>routes.</b> Method: In this study a survey method with structured questionnaire distributed by e-mail has been used to collect the primary data. The main source of secondary data has been airline industry literature, newspapers, magazines and data provided by aviation statistical organizations.
