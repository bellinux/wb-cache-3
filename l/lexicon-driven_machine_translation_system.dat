Many hybrid <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> have been successful in improving the accuracy of the translations, and there are several popular <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> which employ hybrid methods.

40|$|Abstract—Online text <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> {{are widely}} used {{throughout}} the world freely. Most of these <b>systems</b> use statistical <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> (SMT) {{that is based on}} a corpus full with translation examples to learn from them how to translate correctly. Online text <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> differ widely in their effectiveness, and therefore we have to fairly evaluate their effectiveness. Generally the manual (human) evaluation of <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> (MT) <b>systems</b> is better than the automatic evaluation, but it is not feasible to be used. The distance or similarity of MT candidate output to a set of reference translations are used by many MT evaluation approaches.

5000|$|This {{approach}} involves serially {{processing the}} input multiple times. The most common technique used in multi-pass <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> is to pre-process the input with a rule-based <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>system.</b> The {{output of the}} rule-based pre-processor is passed to a statistical <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> <b>system,</b> which produces the final output. This technique is used to {{limit the amount of}} information a statistical system need consider, significantly reducing the processing power required.
