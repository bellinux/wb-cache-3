30|$|Vehicular {{networks}} {{are considered to}} be a special form of ad hoc networks because of their high-level dynamic topologies. From sparse and fast highways to congested and slow downtown traffic, these network structures are naturally desired to operate in the optimum way. However, the extreme conditions caused by high mobility render vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to a short-lived nature. Despite their inherent constraints, VANETs are also a promising heterogeneous network type, since they are planned to consist of contemporary cellular networks, next-generation wireless networks along with vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) <b>link</b> <b>support</b> as well as device-to-device communications options [8]. In order to encompass all of the aforementioned tasks and constraints, the IEEE 802.11 p/ 1609 work group strives to establish a standard known as wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) [9].|$|E

30|$|Different {{with the}} other schemes, two novel routing metrics are {{proposed}} in [28]. The first one is link occupancy ratio (LOR), {{which is used to}} measure the occupancy level of a link, and based on this estimation, it selects links which are “freer” and the most available to transmit data traffic. Then, motivated by the inability of LOR to measure the accurate link capacity to support a specific amount of data, especially when links have a same LOR but different bandwidth values, the authors define Residual Link Capacity (RLC), it represents accurately how much of additional traffic can the <b>link</b> <b>support,</b> and by being relative to the amount of transmitted data, it allows a more efficient routing. The idea of this paper gives us a new thinking about how to define link quality properly in different kinds of network environments.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we discuss two {{experiments}} on the role that comprehension monitoring skills play in selecting the reading order of hypertextual information and comprehending this information. In the first experiment, learners who could be characterized as learners with low prior knowledge comprehended the hypertext better when they selected a coherent reading order. Further, number of links per page {{had no effect on}} cognitive load or comprehension. Finally, <b>link</b> <b>support</b> enhanced comprehension. In the second experiment, we showed that low prior knowledge learners are able to select a high coherent reading order strategy provided that these learners have high monitoring skills with regard to their comprehension process. We conclude that an important characteristic of hypertext comprehension is the skill to monitor the level of coherence and regulating the reading order is in this respect essential...|$|E

The mission concept evolves about one or more buoyant stations (balloons and/or airship) operating at varying altitudes in Titan's atmosphere.

Use of buoyant stations are favored over a fixed site lander for two reasons: (1) adaptable to several possible surface physical states and topographies; and (2) capable of exploring both the atmosphere and surface with regional and possibly global mobility. Auxiliary payload concepts investigated include tethered packages and sounding rockets deployed from the buoyant station, and haze probes and surface penetrators deployed from the orbiter. The paper describes science objectives and payloads, propulsion system/mass delivery trades, balloon design requirements and deployment/motion characteristics, and communications link geometry and data characteristics...|$|E
