2500|$|The HS.404 is an autocannon {{originally}} designed and produced by Hispano-Suiza. It was widely used as both an aircraft, naval and land based {{weapon in the}} 20th century by French, British, American and numerous other military services, particularly during the Second World War. The cannon is {{also referred to as}} Birkigt type 404, after its designer Marc Birkigt, and later versions based on British development are known as 20mm Hispano. Firing a 20 mm calibre projectile, it delivered a useful load of explosive from a relatively <b>light</b> <b>weapon.</b> This made it an ideal anti-aircraft weapon for mounting on light vehicles, as well as a fighter aircraft gun, replacing the multiple 7.62 mm (.30 calibre) and [...]303 inch (7.7 mm) machine guns commonly used in military aircraft of the 1930s. The HS.404 was produced by the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza.|$|E
40|$|This annexe {{provides}} {{supplementary information}} on the methodology used in Chapter 1, ‘Emerging from Obscurity’, to calculate the average value estimate of USD 4. 3 billion for annual authorized international transfers of ammunition for small arms and <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> between 2006 and 2009. The estimate, and {{the process by which}} it was derived, is part of a multi-year effort to reassess the Small Arms Survey’s current estimate of USD 4 billion for the annual authorized international trade in small arms and <b>light</b> <b>weapons,</b> and their parts, accessories, and ammunition. Estimating annual <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> ammunition transfers Basic methodology Because of the almost complete absence of data on transfers of <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> ammunition in the public domain, 1 the study makes use of the slightly more plentiful data on public procurement 2 of ammunition. Publicly available records were used to build a fairly complete picture of government procurement of <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> ammunition for a sample of countries. By analysing the identity and location of the contractor supplying the ammunition, the authors categorized purchases as either imports or domestic procurement for each of these countries. They then identified a number of factors (‘independent variables’) believed to predict levels of <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> ammunition procurement by states. These variables were used in conjunction with the data on imports by the sample countries to generate an estimated level of <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> ammunition procurement for every country outside the sample. The USD 2. 5 billion estimate of average annual authorized transfers of <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> ammunition is the sum of the data on imports for the sample countries and the import estimates for every other country in the world. Sample The authors were able to compile what they believe to be fairly complete data on government procurement (including imports) of <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> ammunition for te...|$|R

60|$|At {{this moment}} {{the man who}} had butchered the savage a few minutes before {{advanced}} towards the girl with his heavy club. Jack uttered a yell that rang like a death-shriek among the rocks. With one bound he leaped over a precipice full fifteen feet high, and before the savages had recovered from their surprise, {{was in the midst of}} them, while Peterkin and I dashed through the bushes towards the prisoners. With one blow of his staff Jack felled the man with the club; then turning round with a look of fury he rushed upon the big chief with the yellow hair. Had the blow which Jack aimed at his head taken effect, the huge savage would have needed no second stroke; but he was agile as a cat, and avoided it by springing to one side, while at the same time he swung his ponderous club at the head of his foe. It was now Jack's turn to leap aside; and well was it for him that the first outburst of his blind fury was over, else he had become an easy prey to his gigantic antagonist. But Jack was cool now. He darted his blows rapidly and well, and the superiority of his <b>light</b> <b>weapon</b> was strikingly proved in this combat; for while he could easily evade the blows of the chief's heavy club, the chief could not so easily evade those of his light one. Nevertheless, so quick was he, and so frightfully did he fling about the mighty weapon, that although Jack struck him almost every blow, the strokes had to be delivered so quickly that they wanted force to be very effectual.|$|E
