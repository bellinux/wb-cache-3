5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 about 36.7 {{million people}} were <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> and it {{resulted}} in 1 million deaths. There were 300,000 fewer new HIV cases in 2016 than in 2015. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV {{is believed to have}} originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified {{in the early part of}} the decade.|$|E

From battling homelessness to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support, and urge young people to join with their friends in making civic service a part of their lifestyle. That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive, and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince's Trust, profits from which help change young lives.|$|E

5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

We analysed 44 individual and three group interviews with the people most affected by HIV in the UK: black African heterosexual {{men and women and}} gay men (mostly white). We found that participants had similar as well as contextually different needs when it came to negotiating safe sex, assimilating prevention knowledge. The themes that emerged included taking 'additional responsibility' for partners, negotiating with partners who are willing to have unprotected (anal or vaginal) sex, links with mental health, constructing the moral 'other' and power differences.

For the implementation of the Ryan White HIV/ AIDS Program (RWHAP) Metropolitan (Part A) and State (Part B) programs, HRSA HAB and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate to ensure the appropriate HIV and AIDS surveillance data are used in determining eligibility and funding allocation amounts. In FY 2017, HRSA used total counts of persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed <b>HIV</b> infection non-AIDS and persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever clas- sified as AIDS to calculate funding allocation amounts for eligible jurisdictions. The number of persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed <b>HIV</b> infection non-AIDS and the number of persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS are used to determine funding levels for RWHAP Parts A and B. For FY 2017, CDC provided HRSA with data files containing the total number of persons reported <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed <b>HIV</b> infection non-AIDS and the total number of persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS through calendar year 2015 for all jurisdic- tions. The number of persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed <b>HIV</b> infection non-AIDS and the number of persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS were added together to arrive at the total number of persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed <b>HIV</b> infection non-AIDS and infection ever classified as AIDS for each eligible area: eligible metropolitan area (EMA), transitional grant area (TGA), emerging community (EC), state, and territory.

40|$|This paper {{elucidates}} one of {{the main}} existential problems faced by people <b>living</b> <b>with</b> an <b>HIV</b> positive diagnosis [...] the disruption in their routine orientation towards time {{and the way in which}} this has the capacity to affect their lives more generally. Drawing upon research with people who have been <b>living</b> <b>with</b> an <b>HIV</b> positive diagnosis for at least five years, the paper aims to illuminate the "provisional existence" imposed upon the individual by the diagnosis and suggests that this ambiguous position underpins the many psychological and social problems confronted by them. In addition, however, the paper argues that in order for the individual to adjust effectively to <b>living</b> <b>with</b> an <b>HIV</b> positive diagnosis, it is necessary for him/her to develop alternative ways of conceiving and living within time, which "compensates" for the loss of the temporal assumptions that existed prior to diagnosis. The various ways in which individuals manage to do this are documented in this paper, as is the failure to do so and the psychosocial consequences ensuing from this. It is further argued that the ability to achieve compensatory temporal understanding is related to the individual's more general "existential orientational framework", of which temporal perspective is a constituent component. Finally, the implications of such findings are discussed for the targeting of appropriate intervention strategies. HIV long-term survival time death...|$|R
