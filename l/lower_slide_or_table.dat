60|$|As {{he swung}} Helen around, the low hum of voices inside the saloon {{suddenly}} rose to sharp, hoarse roars, {{accompanied by a}} scuffling of feet and crashing of violently <b>sliding</b> chairs <b>or</b> <b>tables.</b> Dale let go of Helen and leaped toward the door. But a silence inside, quicker and stranger than the roar, halted him. Helen's heart contracted, then seemed to cease beating. There was absolutely not a perceptible sound. Even the horses appeared, like Dale, to have turned to statues.|$|R

30|$|Extended shallow planar soil slide is the {{mechanism}} releasing {{the most of}} material volume even {{if the number of}} cases measured is lower in relation to embankment shallow planar soil <b>slide</b> <b>or</b> shallow soil slip (13 cases detected for extended shallow planar soil slide against 150 cases for embankment shallow planar soil <b>slide</b> <b>or</b> shallow soil slip). This observation could be {{explained by the fact that}} extended shallow planar soil slides are clearly a much larger phenomenon than the fewer embankment slips defined as embankment shallow planar soil <b>slide</b> <b>or</b> shallow soil slip and involve greater quantities of soil material. Moreover, 16 cases of significant gully erosion were detected and involved lower quantities of soil material. Nevertheless, regarding the damaged areas, embankment shallow planar soil <b>slide</b> <b>or</b> shallow soil slip are clearly responsible for most of the road maintenance needed and also represent a large part of agriculture land losses, especially in terraces subject to failure processes but also due to land down-slope buried by deposits. Extended shallow planar soil slides are also playing an important role in burying agriculture lands.|$|R
50|$|As a tilting {{breechblock}} {{closes on}} the breech, it is tilted {{up at the}} rear but it drops into a recess {{at the end of}} its forward travel - thus locking the breech closed. Firing forces are transmitted to the locking shoulder at the rear of the recess. To unlock the breech, a <b>slide</b> <b>or</b> carrier moving rearward uses a wedge like arrangement acting on the sides of the breechblock to tilt it up at the rear and lift it clear of the locking shoulder. The breechblock is then pulled rearward by the <b>slide</b> <b>or</b> carrier to expose the breech. In the closed position. the <b>slide</b> <b>or</b> carrier can also help locate the breechblock in its locking recess. The carrier <b>or</b> <b>slide</b> can be operated by lever or pump actions or by gas, for automatic and semiautomatic fire.|$|R

However, the exact manners of how rearrangement occurs were not been extensively provided by previous researchers. It is probably be one of the interlayer <b>sliding</b> <b>or</b> dissolution–diffusion–precipitation at intergranular boundary, or intra-transfer of water, or stress and drying-induced re-crystallization of gelled-like particles.|$|R

5000|$|In sailing, pintles insert into {{gudgeons}} {{that are}} normally {{affixed to the}} transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder <b>slides,</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>or</b> clips into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and a pivot clevis pin is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons {{are attached to the}} rudder. In any case, the fitting with the hole is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a Rudder Stop).Really good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a solid sleeve, flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as [...] "consumable".|$|R
