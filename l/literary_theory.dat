5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in <b>literary</b> <b>theory,</b> literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism. According to this <b>literary</b> <b>theory,</b> contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of <b>literary</b> <b>theory,</b> criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
5|$|Preface to Plato had a {{profound}} impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of <b>literary</b> <b>theory,</b> particularly structuralism. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not {{literary}} criticism {{should be considered}} a separate field of inquiry from <b>literary</b> <b>theory,</b> or conversely from book reviewing, is a matter of some controversy. For example, the Johns Hopkins Guide to <b>Literary</b> <b>Theory</b> and Criticism draws no distinction between <b>literary</b> <b>theory</b> and {{literary criticism}}, and almost always uses the terms together to describe the same concept. Some critics consider literary criticism a practical application of <b>literary</b> <b>theory,</b> because criticism always deals directly with particular literary works, while theory may be more general or abstract.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{at finding}} {{out how we}} can benefit from comparing Chinese and Western poetics when translating texts of traditional Chinese <b>literary</b> <b>theories</b> into English. We will try to find out, {{from the perspectives of}} comparative poetics, the difficulties and solutions in translating traditional Chinese <b>literary</b> <b>theories</b> into English. We will also see how comparative poetics would affect the translating strategies and the readers’ understanding of the translated texts. The paper starts with a comparison and analysis of the four English translations of the “Shen Si” (《神思》) chapter in WXDL. The comparisons and analyses expose problems in translating traditional Chinese <b>literary</b> <b>theories</b> into English, but it also gives us some insights. We find that some characteristics of the text, such as the critical terms, the figurative use of language, and the numerous quotes and illusions, impose lots of challenges to the translating. We also find that a comparative study of Chinese and Western poetics in many ways is helpful to the translation of the texts of traditional Chinese <b>literary</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|R

Comclusions and recommendationsThis thesis investigates how teachers responded to various perceptions {{that a new}} senior English curriculum was influenced by conflicting <b>literary</b> <b>theories.</b> It analyses teachers' responses to the English Stage 6 Syllabus, introduced in 2000 in New South Wales, Australia, which challenged existing paradigms, unsettling established beliefs and practices. Controversy about whether and how teachers of this Syllabus were to emphasise multiple <b>literary</b> <b>theories</b> significantly affected teachers' work. The major focus {{of the study is}} how teachers respond to syllabus innovations which they see as ambiguous or in conflict with their personal epistemological and pedagogical beliefs. The study found high levels of teacher anxiety associated with an educational innovation seen to de-stabilise existing attitudes and practices without commensurate benefits to students. Lack of theoretical clarity in a mandated syllabus is seen to lead teachers to assign paramount authority to examiners' reports, causing the assessed curriculum to dominate the other dimensions of curriculum in practice.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of humour {{have been the}} subject of much study and investigation, starting with and up to our days. Much of this work is based on <b>literary</b> <b>theories,</b> put forward by some of the most eminent philosophers and thinkers of all times, or medical theories, investigating the impact of humor on brain activity or behaviour. Recent functional neuroimaging studies, for instance, have investigated the process of comprehending and appreciating humor by examining functional activity in distinctive regions of brains stimulated by joke corpora. Yet, there is precious little work on the computational side, possibly due to the less hilarious nature of computer scientists as compared to men of letters and sawbones. In this paper, we set to investigate whether <b>literary</b> <b>theories</b> of humour can stand the test of algorithmic laughter. Or, in other words, we ask ourselves the vexed question: Can machines laugh? We attempt to answer that question by testing whether an algorithm - namely, a neural network - can "understand" humour, and in particular whether it is possible to automatically identify abstractions that are predicted to be relevant by established <b>literary</b> <b>theories</b> about the {{mechanisms of}} humor. Notice that we do not focus here on distinguishing humorous from serious statements - a feat that is clearly way beyond the capabilities of the average human voter, not to mention the average machine - but rather on identifying the underlying mechanisms and triggers that are postulated to exist by <b>literary</b> <b>theories,</b> by verifying if similar mechanisms can be learned by machines...|$|R

25|$|Lyric {{poetry is}} a formal type of poetry which expresses {{personal}} emotions or feelings, typically spoken {{in the first}} person.
