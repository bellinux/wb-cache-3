6000|$|... 'And {{that you}} are the fastest eater, Sire,' said a <b>large-faced,</b> benevolent-looking person who had been {{whispering}} to Marshal Berthier.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes," [...] agreed Pesita, not {{wishing to}} admit any ignorance of plain American even before a despised gringo. [...] "But the <b>large-faced</b> dick--what might that be? I have spend {{much time in the}} States, but I do not know that." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was just}} {{eighteen}} {{years of age}} {{when he came to}} the throne. People said he was handsome then; but I don't believe it. He was a big, burly, noisy, small-eyed, <b>large-faced,</b> double-chinned, swinish-looking fellow in later life (as we know from the likenesses of him, painted by the famous HANS HOLBEIN), and it is not easy to believe that so bad a character can ever have been veiled under a prepossessing appearance.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{through a}} {{warehouse}} which presented every {{indication of a}} thriving business, Mr Cheeryble (for such Nicholas supposed him to be, from the respect which had been shown him by the warehousemen and porters whom they passed) led him into a little partitioned-off counting-house like a large glass case, in which counting-house there sat--as free from dust and blemish {{as if he had}} been fixed into the glass case before the top was put on, and had never come out since--a fat, elderly, <b>large-faced</b> clerk, with silver spectacles and a powdered head.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Skinner, when he appeared, was a <b>large-faced</b> man, with a lisp and a squint {{that made}} him look over the top of your head, slashed {{slippers}} that appealed to Mr. Bensington's sympathies, and a manifest shortness of buttons. He held his coat and shirt together with one hand and traced patterns on the black-and-gold tablecloth with the index finger of the other, while his disengaged eye watched Mr. Bensington's sword of Damocles, so to speak, with an expression of sad detachment. [...] "You don't want to run thith Farm for profit. No, Thir. Ith all the thame, Thir. Ekthperimenth! Prethithely." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. John Dounce {{was an old}} boy of {{the latter}} class (we don’t mean immortal, but steady), a retired glove and braces maker, a widower, {{resident}} with three daughters—all grown up, and all unmarried—in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. He was a short, round, <b>large-faced,</b> tubbish sort of man, with a broad-brimmed hat, and a square coat; and had that grave, but confident, kind of roll, peculiar to old boys in general. Regular as clockwork—breakfast at nine—dress and tittivate a little—down to the Sir Somebody’s Head—a glass of ale and the paper—come back again, and take daughters out for a walk—dinner at three—glass of grog and pipe—nap—tea—little walk—Sir Somebody’s Head again—capital house—delightful evenings. There were Mr. Harris, the law-stationer, and Mr. Jennings, the robe-maker (two jolly young fellows like himself), and Jones, the barrister’s clerk—rum fellow that Jones—capital company—full of anecdote!—and there they sat every night till just ten minutes before twelve, drinking their brandy-and-water, and smoking their pipes, and telling stories, and enjoying themselves {{with a kind of}} solemn joviality particularly edifying.|$|E
60|$|The man moved {{a little}} further away, {{as soon as he}} could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was {{fortunate}} in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the <b>large-faced</b> King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.|$|E
60|$|The day {{was hot and}} sunny, {{the town}} in the zenith of its dulness, and with the {{exception}} of these few idlers, not a living creature was to be seen. Suddenly, the loud notes of a key-bugle broke the monotonous stillness of the street; in came the coach, rattling over the uneven paving with a noise startling enough to stop even the <b>large-faced</b> clock itself. Down got the outsides, up went the windows in all directions, out came the waiters, up started the ostlers, and the loungers, and the post-boys, and the ragged boys, as if they were electrified—unstrapping, and unchaining, and unbuckling, and dragging willing horses out, and forcing reluctant horses in, and making a most exhilarating bustle. ‘Lady inside, here!’ said the guard. ‘Please to alight, ma’am,’ said the waiter. ‘Private sitting-room?’ interrogated the lady. ‘Certainly, ma’am,’ responded the chamber-maid. ‘Nothing but these ’ere trunks, ma’am?’ inquired the guard. ‘Nothing more,’ replied the lady. Up got the outsides again, and the guard, and the coachman; off came the cloths, with a jerk; ‘All right,’ was the cry; and away they went. The loungers lingered a minute or two in the road, watching the coach until it turned the corner, and then loitered away one by one. The street was clear again, and the town, by contrast, quieter than ever.|$|E
