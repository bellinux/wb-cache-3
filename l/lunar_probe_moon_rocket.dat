50|$|To {{return to}} Earth, the escape {{velocity}} of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the <b>Moon.</b> <b>Rockets</b> must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing. These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any <b>moon</b> departure <b>rocket</b> must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a <b>moon</b> landing <b>rocket,</b> increasing the latter's required size. The <b>Moon</b> departure <b>rocket,</b> larger <b>moon</b> landing <b>rocket</b> and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.|$|R

5000|$|The {{failure was}} {{described}} as [...] "especially disappointing" [...] since it was the final launch in the Able probe series as its successor, the Ranger program, was in the works. In the end, the US space program would not see a completely successful <b>lunar</b> <b>probe</b> until Ranger 7 four years later. It also marked the final launch in {{the first generation of}} <b>lunar</b> <b>probes,</b> which used direct ascent trajectories and would give way to the second generation probes which had parking orbits.|$|R
