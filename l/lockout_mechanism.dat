50|$|Following {{release of}} the initial {{accident}} findings, Airlines PNG added the Beta <b>Lockout</b> <b>mechanism</b> as a modification to all their Dash 8s meaning that inadvertent selection of Ground Beta whilst airborne at speed is no longer possible. Subsequently, Transport Canada {{in conjunction with the}} aircraft manufacturer released an Airworthiness Directive making it a mandatory requirement that all operators Worldwide make these modifications.|$|E
50|$|Both the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega Master System {{benefit from}} limited homebrew development, {{as there is}} no {{physical}} <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanism,</b> thereby easing the operation of software on these platforms. Homebrew efforts for the Mega Drive/Genesis have grown, as there are now several full games scheduled for release in physical form, such as Rick Dangerous 1 & 2 and a port of Teenage Queen. Pier Solar and the Great Architects and Frog Feast for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Mighty Mighty Missile for the Sega Mega-CD are examples of homebrew games already released for Sega consoles.|$|E
5000|$|The Yak Bak WarpR {{provided}} {{users with}} the ability to alter the recording via a pitch dial that would speed up or slow down the sound, thereby making the voice sound higher or deeper. This model was more popular than previous ones as the novelty of voice recording became more enticing once users could [...] "warp" [...] their voices. This [...] "warping" [...] option also became a staple of all future models. As {{was the case with the}} Yak Bak 2, the Yak Bak WarpR also contained a <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanism</b> which disabled the Say button.|$|E
5000|$|Lockout {{refers to}} a {{mechanism}} to disable a suspension mechanism to render it substantially rigid. This may be desirable during climbing or sprinting to prevent the suspension from absorbing power applied by the rider. Some <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanisms</b> also feature a [...] "blow off" [...] system that deactivates the lockout when an appropriate {{force is applied to}} help prevent damage to the shock and rider injury under high unexpected loads.|$|R
40|$|Keypads are {{commonly}} used to enter personal identification numbers (PIN) which are intended to authenticate a user {{based on what they}} know. A number of those keypads such as ATM inputs and door keypads provide an audio feedback to the user for each button pressed. Such audio feedback are observable from a modest distance. We are looking at quantifying the information leaking from delays between acoustic feedback pulses. Preliminary experiments suggest that by using a Hidden Markov Model, {{it might be possible to}} substantially narrow the search space. A subsequentbrute force search on the reduced search space could be possible without triggering alerts, <b>lockouts</b> or other <b>mechanisms</b> design to thwart plain brute force attempts...|$|R
40|$|While {{trawling}} online/offline password guessing {{has been}} intensively studied, {{only a few}} studies have examined targeted online guessing, where an attacker guesses a specific victim's password for a service, by exploiting the victim's personal information such as one sister password leaked from her another account and some personally identifiable information (PII). A key challenge for targeted online guessing is to choose the most effective password candidates, while the number of guess attempts allowed by a server's <b>lockout</b> or throttling <b>mechanisms</b> is typically very small. We propose TarGuess, a framework that systematically characterizes typical targeted guessing scenarios with seven sound mathematical models, each of which is based on varied kinds of data available to an attacker. These models allow us to design novel and efficient guessing algorithms. Extensive experiments on 10 large real-world password datasets show the effectiveness of TarGuess. Particularly, TarGuess I~IV capture the four most representative scenarios and within 100 guesses: (1) TarGuess-I outperforms its foremost counterpart by 142 % against security-savvy users and by 46 % against normal users; (2) TarGuess-II outperforms its foremost counterpart by 169 % on security-savvy users and by 72 % against normal users; and (3) Both TarGuess-III and IV gain success rates over 73 % against normal users and over 32 % against security-savvy users. TarGuess-III and IV, for the first time, address the issue of cross-site online guessing when given the victim's one sister password and some PII...|$|R
50|$|Several compilers are {{available}} for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but like the Atari 2600, most development directly applies assembly language. One impediment to NES homebrew development is the relative difficulty involved with producing physical cartridges, although third party flash carts do exist, making homebrew possible on original NES hardware. Several varieties of custom integrated circuits are used within NES cartridges to expand system capabilities; most are difficult to replicate except by scavenging old cartridges. The hardware <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the NES further complicates construction of usable physical cartridges. However, the NES-101 removed the 10NES lockout chip so any game, whether homebrew, unlicensed, or another region of an official game, can be played. The 10NES chip can eventually be permanently disabled by performing a minor change to the hardware.|$|E
5000|$|Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots sees Old Snake {{sent back}} to Shadow Moses Island to re-acquire Metal Gear REX (left {{abandoned}} after the events of Metal Gear Solid) which has become Liquid Ocelot's new target. Liquid plans to remove REX's railgun to launch nuclear weapons since REX predates the SOP system of no ID <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanism</b> (sans the PAL interface). Arriving at the old hangar, Snake finds the damaged Metal Gear but discovers that Liquid has already removed the railgun. Later, Snake uses REX to confront Liquid piloting Metal Gear RAY. Even though RAY was developed as an anti-Metal Gear weapon and REX being handicapped (as the radome was still damaged and its railgun gone), Otacon reveals that REX has a [...] "street fighter" [...] program to execute kicking moves which Liquid was apparently not aware of. Snake and REX manage to fight Liquid to a stalemate; Otacon credits this to his assistance. REX is not seen destroyed {{and what happened to}} the mecha after the battle is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} found the propellers oversped because the Captain pulled the power levers through the flight idle gate {{and into the}} ground beta range during flight. This was prohibited by the Aircraft Flight Manual. Although a 'beta lockout' mechanism did exist for DHC-8-100,-200, and -300 series aircraft which prevented the propellers from going into reverse even if the power levers were moved into the beta range during flight, this mechanism was only required by regulation to be installed in DHC-8 aircraft operating in the USA. It was not required to be fitted to DHC-8 aircraft in Papua New Guinea, {{and it was not}} fitted to MCJ. If a beta <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanism</b> had been installed on the aircraft, the double propeller overspeed would not have occurred when the power levers were moved below the flight idle range and in the ground beta range during flight. Installation of this mechanism is now mandatory on DHC-8 aircraft worldwide by 19 June 2016. If the pilots had followed the standard emergency procedures detailed in company manuals, they would have given themselves more time to manage the emergency, consider their options, and carry out the approach and forced landing.|$|E
40|$|Bechtel Nevada/NSTec {{recently}} announced deployment of their fifth generation streak camera. This camera incorporates many advanced features beyond those currently available for streak cameras. The arc-resistant driver includes a trigger <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanism,</b> actively monitors input trigger levels, and incorporates a high-voltage fault interrupter for user safety and tube protection. The camera is completely modular and may deflect over a variable full-sweep time of 15 nanoseconds to 500 microseconds. The camera design {{is compatible with}} both large- and small-format commercial tubes from several vendors. The embedded microprocessor offers Ethernet connectivity, and XML [extensible markup language]-based configuration management with non-volatile parameter storage using flash-based storage media. The cameraâ€™s user interface is platform-independent (Microsoft Windows, Unix, Linux, Macintosh OSX) and is accessible using an AJAX [asynchronous Javascript and XML]-equipped modem browser, such as Internet Explorer 6, Firefox, or Safari. User interface operation requires no installation of client software or browser plug-in technology. Automation software can also access the camera configuration and control using HTTP [hypertext transfer protocol]. The software architecture supports multiple-simultaneous clients, multiple cameras, and multiple module access with a standard browser. The entire user interface can be customized...|$|E
40|$|Richard N Dalby 1, Joachim Eicher 2, Bernd Zierenberg 21 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA; 2 Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, GermanyAbstract: The Respimat&reg; Soft Mist&trade; Inhaler (SMI) (Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Ingelheim, Germany) was {{developed}} {{in response to the}} need for a pocket-sized device that can generate a single-breath, inhalable aerosol from a drug solution using a patient-independent, reproducible, and environmentally friendly energy supply. This paper describes the design and evolution of this innovative device from a laboratory concept model and the challenges that were overcome during its development and scaleup to mass production. A key technical breakthrough was the uniblock, a component combining filters and nozzles and made of silicon and glass, through which drug solution is forced using mechanical power. This allows two converging jets of solution to collide at a controlled angle, generating a fine aerosol of inhalable droplets. The mechanical energy comes from a spring which is tensioned by twisting the base of the device before use. Additional features of the Respimat&reg; SMI include a dose indicator and a <b>lockout</b> <b>mechanism</b> to avoid the problems of tailing-off of dose size seen with pressurized metered dose inhalers. The Respimat&reg; SMI aerosol cloud has a unique range of technical properties. The high fine particle fraction allied with the low velocity and long generation time of the aerosol translate into a higher fraction of the emitted dose being deposited in the lungs compared with aerosols from pressurized metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers. These advantages are realized in clinical trials in adults and children with obstructive lung diseases, which have shown that the efficacy and safety of a pressurized metered dose inhaler formulation of a combination bronchodilator can be matched by a Respimat&reg; SMI formulation containing only one half or one quarter of the dose delivered by a pressurized metered dose inhaler. Patient satisfaction with the Respimat&reg; SMI is high, and the long duration of the spray is of potential benefit to patients who have difficulty in coordinating inhalation with drug release.
