5|$|Although this {{question}} is brought up {{now for the first}} time to be decided by this Court, we consider it as having been <b>long</b> <b>since</b> settled in public opinion. In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted, and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of opinion in favor of the negative of the proposition.|$|E
5|$|As for The Five, {{the group}} had <b>long</b> <b>since</b> dispersed, Mussorgsky had died in 1881 and Borodin had {{followed}} in 1887. Cui continued to write negative reviews of Tchaikovsky's music but was seen by the composer as merely a critical irritant. Balakirev lived in isolation and was confined to the musical sidelines. Only Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he was 6 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had <b>long</b> <b>since</b> died, while his father and brother were {{continuously}} active in the Roman military, commanding armies in Germania and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish-Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as city prefect of Rome; or possibly even Marcus Cocceius Nerva, a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the area {{developed}} into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has <b>long</b> <b>since</b> disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: {{the wreck of the}} passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|Few skyscrapers {{were built}} in London before the late 20th century, owing to {{restrictions}} on building heights originally imposed by the London Building Act of 1894, which followed {{the construction of the}} 14-storey Queen Anne's Mansions. Though restrictions have <b>long</b> <b>since</b> been eased, strict regulations remain to preserve protected views, especially those of St Paul's, the Tower of London and Palace of Westminster, as well as to comply with the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority.|$|E

5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, <b>long</b> <b>since</b> replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{as they were in}} a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had been heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had <b>long</b> <b>since</b> been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that {{in the minds of the}} authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E
5|$|Petilius Cerialis took {{a number}} of reconstituted Batavi units with him to Britain, and the Batavi regiments {{continued}} to serve with special distinction in Britain and elsewhere {{for the rest of}} the 1st century and beyond.

50|$|The 1981 Cleveland Browns {{season was}} the team's 32nd {{season with the}} National Football League.In a highly disappointing season filled {{with a number of}} key {{injuries}} at different stretches during the campaign, the Browns finished the year with five straight defeats, their <b>longest</b> losing streak <b>since</b> 1975, and dropped seven of their final eight games.

5|$|The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was {{bestowed}} by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de Magminot or Maminot, {{bishop of}} Lisieux, {{one of the}} eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle. Maminot held the head of his barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814, he built himself a castle, or castellated mansion at Deptford, of which all traces had by then <b>long</b> <b>since</b> been buried in their ruins, but from the remains of some ancient foundations which had been discovered the site was probably on the brow of Broomfield, near the Mast Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court.|$|E
5|$|The Senne had <b>long</b> <b>since</b> {{lost its}} {{usefulness}} as a navigable waterway, {{being replaced by}} canals, including the Charleroi Canal. The Senne {{had always been a}} river with an inconsistent flow, often overflowing its banks. In times of heavy rainfall, even the sluice gates were unable to regulate the flow of the river which was often swollen by numerous creeks flowing down from higher ground. Making matters worse, within the city the river's bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to demographic pressure. The supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded water flow and caused water levels to rise even further, exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste.|$|E
5|$|The Sociedad de Beneficencia (Society of Beneficence), {{a charity}} group {{made up of}} 87 society ladies, was {{responsible}} for most charity works in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Perón. Fraser and Navarro write {{that at one point}} the Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but that those days had <b>long</b> <b>since</b> passed {{by the time of the}} first term of Juan Perón. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the Sociedad was supported by the government.|$|E

5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers who cared little for the {{buildings}}. For a brief time, the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had <b>long</b> <b>since</b> been taken down and sold.|$|E
5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the quarry had <b>long</b> <b>since</b> been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though {{at some point}} they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E
5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have <b>long</b> <b>since</b> moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
