5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
25|$|British Columbian {{introduced}} species include: common dandelion, ring-necked pheasant, Pacific oyster, brown trout, black slug, European starling, cowbird, knapweed, bullfrog, purple loosestrife, Scotch broom, Himalayan blackberry, European earwig, tent caterpillar, sowbug, grey squirrel, Asian <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> English ivy, fallow deer, thistle, gorse, Norway rat, crested mynah, and Asian or European gypsy moth.|$|E
25|$|Some {{riparian}} restoration efforts may {{be aimed}} at conserving particular animal species of concern, such as the Valley elderberry <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> in central California, which is dependent on a riparian tree species (blue elderberry, Sambucus mexicana) as its sole host plant. When restoration efforts target key species, consideration for individual species’ needs (e.g., minimum width or extent of riparian vegetation) are important for ensuring restoration success.|$|E

25|$|Stressed trees {{can also}} be {{attacked}} by psyllids {{to the point of}} defoliation. Grubs hatch from eggs laid on the edges of leaves and burrow into the leaf to suck nutrients, the tree's own latex shielding the insect. Caterpillars of the moth species Eustixis caminaea can strip trees of their leaves. The tree is also a host for the <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> species Agrianome spinicollis.|$|E
25|$|In total, {{there are}} 46,000 acres that {{are owned by}} the {{preserve}} with almost 40,000 acres of that being used for agricultural production. Of those 46,000 acres, approximately 12,500 acres are easement lands and 16,500 acres are fee-owned lands. Currently the Cosumnes River Preserve uses {{both public and private}} lands as a location for migratory birds throughout the year as well preserving natural riparian oak woodlands, vernal pools, wetlands, and grasslands. The Elderberry <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> California giant garter snake, and the Swainson's hawk are three threatened or endangered species that have been found living on the preserve.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant {{of the two}} is a <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> (Phymatodes nitidus) that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. This cuts the vascular water supply to the cone scales, allowing the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open {{over the next several}} months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully open them. The other agent is the Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasi) that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. The squirrels are active year round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.|$|E
