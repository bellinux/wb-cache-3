500|$|Sophie Grace Chappell argues that, without {{external}} reasons for action, it becomes impossible {{to maintain that}} {{the same set of}} moral reasons applies to all agents equally. In cases where someone has no internal reason to do what others see as the right thing, they cannot be blamed for failing to do it, because internal reasons are the only reasons, and blame, Williams wrote, [...] "involves treating the person who is blamed <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had a reason {{to do the right thing}} but did not do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Damon did {{the voice}} of Spirit in the {{animated}} movie Spirit Stallion of the Cimmaron (2002) and later played a conjoined twin in Stuck on You (2003), which received a 60% Rotten Tomatoes score and mixed critical reception. He played a fictionalized version of Wilhelm Grimm alongside Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's fantasy adventure The Brothers Grimm (2005), which was a critically panned commercial failure; The Washington Post concluded, [...] "Damon, constantly flashing his newscaster's teeth and flaunting a fake, 'Masterpiece Theatre' dialect, comes across <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> got lost {{on the way to}} an audition for a high school production of The Pirates of Penzance." [...] Later that year, he appeared as an energy analyst in Syriana.|$|E

After Franky leaves in tears, Liv tells Mini {{that she needs to}} be more mature and act <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> old enough to be in college. Mini then asks Liv where Grace went, not knowing that Grace, having liked Franky from the start, had left the party to hang out with her and make amends.|$|R

500|$|One of Murray's {{friends in}} the Society, E. O. James, {{described}} her as a [...] "mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge without reserve, or, be it said, much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts!" [...] Davidson described her as being [...] "not at all assertive... never thrust her ideas on anyone. [...] she behaved in fact rather <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect, or perhaps, of the Freemasons, but never on any account got into arguments about it in public." [...] The archaeologist Glyn Daniel observed that Murray remained mentally alert into her old age, commenting that [...] "her vigour and forthrightness and ruthless energy never deserted her".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to other {{characters in the}} Final Fantasy series, whose personality traits were molded to fit a story, Toriyama conceived Lightning's basic personality before XIIIs narrative had been finalized. She has a cold demeanor, which was meant to clash in an entertaining way with Snow's outspokenness. Nomura commented that Lightning has [...] "a strong element of mystery about her character". She originally had a flirtatious aspect to her personality, which was transferred to Oerba Yun Fang when Fang was changed from male to female. For Lightning Returns, the developers wanted to portray Lightning in several different lights, in {{contrast to}} her static personalities in prior appearances. One of their highest priorities was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become deeply vulnerable as a result. Designer Yuji Abe elaborated that, because of her losses and newfound vulnerability, Lightning came across as darker, slightly numbed to her surroundings, and [...] "like a puppet, <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> doesn't quite have her real self inside." [...] He elaborated that this effect shows [...] "the kind of vulnerability she has, and it's the point from which she starts to change afterward." [...] The decision to expand her personality in this way was originally suggested by Yoshinori Kitase, who was concerned that Lightning's coolness in previous games had {{made it difficult for}} players to bond with her.|$|E
500|$|John Robinson, the {{governor}} of Essex County Jail, was then called by the defence. Robinson testified that during Lamb's time in the county jail, his conduct had been impeccable except for an incident five weeks before the trial, on 10 December 1966, when he had, for no apparent reason, gone on what Robinson called a [...] "rampage". In an episode lasting three hours, the defendant had smashed over 100 windows, set fire to blankets and broken plumbing, causing cells to flood. [...] "I was amazed by what I saw," [...] Robinson said. [...] "The pupils were dilated <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> comes in heavy on narcotics—except their eyes appear sunk in and his were bulged out." [...] George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary then told the court that Lamb lived in a fantasy dream world, which had existed in his mind since early childhood, and {{had been in a}} pre-psychotic state when released from jail on 8 June 1966. This, he said, had boiled over into an [...] "acute schizoid episode" [...] {{on the night of the}} shootings. In cross-examination, Scott was pressed as to why he had allowed Lamb's release from Kingston if this was the case; he replied that although the prison officers had been concerned about Lamb's mental state on his release, there had not been conclusive grounds to certify him insane at that time.|$|E
5000|$|Boyle {{managed to}} attract {{criticism}} in August 2008 when complaints were received about comments he made regarding British Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington on Mock the Week, {{saying that she}} [...] "looks <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> looking at themselves {{in the back of}} a spoon". The BBC ruled that the jokes were indeed [...] "humiliating" [...] and [...] "risked offending the audience", while also calling Boyle [...] "a brilliant member of the team". Despite this, Adlington's agent said that simply admitting mistakes was not enough, saying: [...] "By giving Frankie Boyle a rebuke they fail to discourage others from doing the same." [...] Adlington later went on to comment on this issue.|$|R

500|$|... "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics; {{most of which}} were positive about Houston's 'soulful' performance and vocal maturity. Jean Rosenbluth of Los Angeles Times praised the song, saying [...] "Houston's elegant 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' [...] exude maturity without resorting to the relentlessly big vocals that characterize so many R records aiming for adult audiences." [...] Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Sounding <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has just emptied her lungs after holding her breath a long time, Houston brings a surprisingly mature, world-weary tone to the song." [...] Robert Hilburn, pop music critic of Los Angeles Times, noted Babyface's achievement in the song, saying [...] "he [...] brings Houston down to earth, trading her normal vocal exuberance for convincing warmth." [...] Larry Flick of Billboard called the song [...] "a surprisingly understated shuffle-ballad with soul and far more interesting vocal colors than all the shrieking can provide."

[...] Anthony Violenti of The Buffalo News gave the song a positive review, commenting that Houston's vocals were intoxicating. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in their review of the soundtrack, viewed the song as [...] "easy and understated". Steve Knopper of Newsday wrote that the song was [...] "irresistibly catchy" [...] and irritating at the same time. However, Patricia Smith of The Boston Globe wrote that the [...] "Shoop Shoop"s were [...] "annoying". While reviewing Houston's compilation Whitney: The Greatest Hits (2000), Christine Galera of Orlando Sentinel also expressed her dislike for the song, stating the songs from Waiting to Exhale, including [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] and [...] "Why Does It Hurt So Bad," [...] were too mellow.|$|E

2500|$|Her autobiography, June Allyson by June Allyson (1982), {{received}} generally complimentary reviews {{due to its}} insider look at Hollywood {{in one of its}} golden ages. A {{more critical}} appraisal came from Janet Maslin at the New York Times in her review, [...] "Hollywood Leaves Its Imprint on Its Chroniclers", [...] who noted: [...] "Miss Allyson presents herself as the same sunny, tomboyish figure she played on screen in Hollywood... <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has come to inhabit the very myths she helped to create on the screen." [...] Privately, Allyson admitted that her earlier screen portrayals had left her uneasy about the typecast [...] "good wife" [...] roles she had played.|$|E
2500|$|... "There's nobody like Ichiro {{in either}} league—now or ever. He exists {{strictly}} {{within his own}} world, playing a game 100 percent unfamiliar to everyone else. The game has known plenty of 'slap' hitters, but none who sacrifice so much natural ability {{for the sake of}} the art... Ichiro, a man of wondrous strength, puts on impressive power-hitting displays almost nightly in batting practice. And he'll go deep occasionally in games, looking very much <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> could do it again, often... the man lives for hits, little tiny ones, and the glory of standing atop the world in that category. Every spring, scouts or media types write him off, swearing that opposing pitchers have found the key, and they are embarrassingly wrong".|$|E
2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one of our local people from home was like ‘why don't you ask him about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming. I suppose it was one really small thing that you just do and it just turned into a big thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The character's {{clothing}} was created and designed by Hiromu Takahara, the main designer at Japanese fashion house Roen. Takahara's key {{inspiration for the}} style and coloring of the {{clothing was}} [...] "jet black", which were meant to exemplify and {{be representative of the}} game's dark atmosphere. In addition, Takahara designed the outfit along the same lines as the asymmetric designs common to Roen's clothing lines. His outfit was designed to make Noctis look <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> went to a high-class pub. Unlike previous protagonists, a real set of Noctis' clothes was created by Roen and kept in the office for reference by the development staff: this was due to previous experiences when Nomura had been constantly asked what materials his characters' outfits were made of by the graphics teams. An aspect of his design central to the story was a ring he wore on his right hand, while the gloves he wore were simply for [...] "design purposes". Noctis' original design when the game was first revealed was a temporary one used while his final look was being created. It was based on the game's script to give a visual impression in trailers. Takahara also designed a formal suit worn by the character in the opening section of the game. All Roen designs, including Noctis' suit, were retained when Versus XIII was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV as the team felt wrong about removing them despite the other changes.|$|E

The darkness even of the room you are in is full of ancient and discarded but quite unsubjugated powers and purposes.... They thrust ambiguous limbs and claws suddenly out of the darkness into the light of your attention. They snatch things out of your hand, they trip your feet and jog your elbow.
