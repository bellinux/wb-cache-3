40|$|We {{examined}} the resistance phenotype and the genetic basis of <b>lincosamide</b> modification in 25 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus spp. inactivating lincomycin and clindamycin. The strains were resistant {{to high levels}} of lincomycin but remained susceptible to clindamycin. However, MBCs and inoculum effects showed that the activity of clindamycin was impaired. The distribution in these strains of nucleotide sequences related to linA and linA', the genes encoding <b>lincosamide</b> nucleotidylation in Staphylococcus haemolyticus BM 4610 and S. aureus BM 4611, respectively, was studied by dot blot hybridization.

40|$|Introduction: Group B {{streptococcus}} (GBS) is {{a significant}} human pathogen. GBS colonizes the vagina {{and it is one}} of the most important causes of early neonatal sepsis and meningitis. In many countries, screening of pregnant women and intrapartal use of antibiotics are common practice. Macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistant strains of GBS are a significant problem, because these antibiotics are the second line therapy in case of penicillin allergy. Aim: Our aim was to investigate the frequency of antibiotic resistant strains of GBS and to detect macrolide resistance phenotypes in GBS strains obtained from pregnant women in Belgrade. Material and Methods: 105 GBS isolates were obtained from vaginal swabs of pregnant women attending two Gynecology and Obstetrics Centers in Belgrade. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and D test were performed on Mueller Hinton agar. Results: Macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistance was found in 30. 4 %, and 23. 8 % of isolates, respectively. There was a high frequency of tetracycline resistant strains (88. 6 %). Most frequent macrolide resistant phenotype was iMLSb (macrolide and inducibile <b>lincosamide</b> resistance) (62. 4 %). Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that there is a high level of macrolide resistance among GBS isolates in Serbia and the active surveillance is needed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lincosamides</b> prevent {{bacteria}} replicating by {{interfering with}} the synthesis of proteins. They bind to the 23s portion of the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and cause premature dissociation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome. <b>Lincosamides</b> do not interfere with protein synthesis in human cells (or those of other eukaryotes) because human ribosomes are structurally {{different from those of}} bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Macrolide (including {{erythromycin}} and azithromycin) and <b>lincosamide</b> (including clindamycin) antibiotics {{are recommended}} {{for treatment of}} penicillin-allergic patients with Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis. Resistance to erythromycin in S. pyogenes can {{be as high as}} 48 % in specific populations in the United States. Macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistance in S. pyogenes is mediated by several different genes. Expression of the erm(A) or erm(B) genes causes resistance to erythromycin and inducible or constitutive resistance to clindamycin, respectively, whereas expression of the mef(A) gene leads to resistance to erythromycin but not clindamycin. We studied the resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin and clindamycin at an urban tertiary-care hospital. Of 196 sequential isolates from throat cultures, 15 (7. 7 %) were resistant to erythromycin. Three of these were also constitutively resistant to clindamycin and had the erm(B) gene. Five of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were resistant to clindamycin upon induction with erythromycin and had the erm(A) gene. The remaining seven erythromycin-resistant isolates were susceptible to clindamycin even upon induction with erythromycin and had the mef(A) gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis and emm typing demonstrated that the erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes comprised multiple strains. These results demonstrate that multiple mechanisms of resistance to macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> antibiotics are present in S. pyogenes strains in the United States...|$|R

50|$|However, some M. morganii strains are {{resistant}} to penicillin, ampicillin/sublactam, oxacillin, first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, <b>lincosamides,</b> fosfomycin, colistin, and polymyxin B.

50|$|The {{primary means}} of {{bacterial}} resistance to macrolides occurs by post-transcriptional methylation of the 23S bacterial ribosomal RNA.

50|$|The <b>lincosamides,</b> as the {{hydrochloride}} salts, are bitter to taste, so for oral formulation {{they are}} given as the palmitate esters, or formulated in capsules.

40|$|Streptococcus uberis {{isolates}} (n = 55) {{were obtained}} from milk samples of cases of mild clinical mastitis in 55 dairy cows from 35 herds serviced by one veterinary practice in Mayenne, France. Isolates were tested for macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistance by using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Erythromycin resistance was detected in 12 of the 55 (22 %) isolates based on agar disc diffusion testing and MIC measurements, and was encoded by ermB. This gene also conferred phenotypic resistance to pirlimycin based on MIC measurements, but the D-test was needed for detection of the resistance phenotype in the agar disc diffusion test. Isolates with ermB were also highly resistant to the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin. Seventeen of the 55 isolates (31 %) were classified as resistant to spiramcyin only and as having intermediate susceptibility to spiramycin based on agar disc diffusion testing and MIC measurements, respectively. The genetic mechanism behind this phenotype and its clinical relevance are unknown. The efflux pump gene mefA was not detected {{in any of the}} 55 isolates in this study. Pirlimycin resistance without macrolide resistance was encoded by the <b>lincosamide</b> resistance gene linB in 4 isolates. Based on current guidelines, some linB-positive isolates would be classified as susceptible by using phenotypic tests, and alternative values for the interpretation of the agar disc diffusion test are suggested. We conclude that the agar disc diffusion test is a useful indicator for macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistance of Strep. uberis in veterinary practice, provided that the D-test is used for detection of pirlimycin resistance...|$|R
