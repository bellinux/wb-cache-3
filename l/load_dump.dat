5000|$|Rarely, {{more extreme}} cases of voltage {{fluctuation}} can {{occur when the}} car battery is disconnected while the engine is running, or when the car receives a jump start. When the battery is disconnected while the engine is running, a <b>load</b> <b>dump</b> transient can produce very high voltages as the built in voltage regulator has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant, the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds, during which the alternator output voltage will exceed its intended value. The <b>load</b> <b>dump</b> transient may also ruin the diodes in the alternator by exceeding their breakdown voltage.

40|$|The power {{requirements}} of automotive alternators are increasing significantly {{due to the}} introduction of new vehicle electrical loads. Moreover, the possible transition to a 42 V electrical system is introducing new concerns regarding the <b>load</b> <b>dump</b> overvoltage transient of alternators. This thesis makes several contributions to the power density, efficiency, and transient performance of future alternators. A comparison and design optimization of four alternator types is conducted to identify the least cost alternator that meets the challenging requirements of future automobiles. Alternator designs with conventional diode rectifiers and switched-mode rectifiers are investigated. It is found that optimized Lundell alternators are capable of meeting the demands of future systems, and that wound field synchronous machines may also be competitive.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} a dc-dc centralised based architecture using Matlab/Simulink for <b>load</b> <b>dump</b> analysis. As the electrical load varies for various driving conditions such as day or night, summer or winter; and city or country side, the analysis of load change is a very important parameter for system behaviour. In order to study the 42 V power generation dynamic performance under load variations, step change in loads have been investigated. A detailed mathematical model for a 3 -phase, 4 kW and 42 V Lundell alternator average electrical equivalent circuit along with the DC/DC converter based architectures for dual-voltage systems has been covered in previous publications. Aspects of the steady-state output current capabilities, transient behaviour due to <b>load</b> <b>dump</b> on the 14 / 42 V buses and the behaviour of the system model under different loads are assessed and results discussed. The performance of the 42 V Lundell alternator with the interleaved six-phase buck dc-to-dc converter system is modelled using Simulink software to assess the effectiveness of the model and its transient behaviour. The simulated results are presented for the transient characteristics of the system for load dumps. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{excavator}} is {{a typical}} hydraulic heavy-duty human-operated machine used in general versatile construction operations, such as digging, ground leveling, carrying <b>loads,</b> <b>dumping</b> <b>loads</b> and straight traction. Normally backhoe excavators are working under worst working conditions. Due to severe working conditions, excavator parts are subjected to high loads and must work reliably under unpredictable working conditions. Thus, {{it is necessary for}} the designers to provide not only a equipment of maximum reliability but also of minimum weight and cost, keeping design safe under all loading conditions. The force analysis and strength analysis are important steps in the design of excavator parts. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is the most powerful technique used to evaluate strength of the structures working under high loads.

40|$|In 1990 Flödeskommittén {{released}} {{new guidelines}} which redefined {{the method used}} to determine design flows. The method, combined with more complete measurements of flow variations, has resulted in higher design flows which in turn call for increases in the discharge capacity of hydropower plants. This work is still in progress. Since many Swedish hydropower stations were constructed in the 1950 's and 60 's they require modernization. Today Statkraft owns and operates 55 hydropower stations in Sweden several of which have a discharge capacity below the design flow. For this reason, the dam safety of these hydropower stations is reduced. According to current guidelines the turbine flow is not added to the discharge capacity since {{the availability of the}} electrical grid is not guaranteed during extreme flows. When the electric grid is unavailable the generator has no load and cannot produce an electric torque. Without the electric torque the turbine accelerates which may result in equipment failure. This thesis considers the introduction of an alternative local load where the generator power can be dumped as heat, hence termed <b>dump</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> has the potential to increase the discharge capacity by adding the turbine flow. However, operation of the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> requires the availability of the generator and turbine, making the discharge capacity dependent on the status of the plant. In turn, achieving a sufficient discharge capacity is of primary concern to dam operators since it determines dam safety. Consequently, this thesis evaluates the effects on dam safety when utilizing a local load to increase the discharge capacity. Three different designs were evaluated; a medium to high voltage electrode water boiler, electrodes submerged in the river and a low voltage electric water boiler. The evaluation shows that all three designs are feasible and can be used to increase the discharge capacity provided the generator and turbine have high availability. The complexity and number of components constituting the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> should be minimized {{to reduce the risk of}} malfunctions and redundancy should be introduced for key components when feasible. The <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> power should be controlled using voltage regulation but further work is required to determine the specifics of this governor. The results also show that the cost of the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> is a fraction of the cost of a new spillway. However, the topic is controversial and the <b>dump</b> <b>load</b> requires practical testing in order to evaluate operational reliability...|$|R

A multi-section stator winding and interleaved rectifier arrangement is introduced that enables high power levels to be achieved using small semiconductor devices, and which greatly reduces the output filter capacitor requirements.

40|$|Abstract—Portable microsystems, which {{typically}} incorporate transceivers, analog/digital converters, microprocessors, and others, require several fast on-chip supplies to both function and save energy. Linear regulators are fast and compact, but also lossy, and although switched inductors are efficient, power inductors are bulky, {{which is why}} supplying several functions with one inductor is often an optimal compromise. Responding quickly to individual disruptions, however, is challenging when sharing one inductor with other loads, and bucking and boosting the battery voltage normally require more power switches. The 1. 25 -MHz single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converter presented here employs a buck stage to buck and boost 3. 6 V to 0. 8, 1. 2, and 4. 5 V and uses nested hysteretic current-mode control to respond within 1 µs to 20 -mA load dumps across 0. 8 and 1. 2 V and 2 µs to 5 -mA <b>load</b> <b>dump...</b>|$|E
40|$|The source, nature, and {{frequency}} of occurrence of transients must be identified and a representative standard test wave chosen for proof testing. The performance of candidate suppressor devices then can be evaluated against the withstand goals set for the equipment. The various suppressors divide into two classes of generic behavior. The key to a universal procedure for evaluating both classes lies in representing transients as quasi-current sources of defined current impulse duration. The available surge current is established by the Thevenin equivalent transient voltage and source impedance. A load line drawn on the V-I characteristic graph of the suppressor quickly determines the clamping voltage and peak current. These values then {{can be compared to}} the requirement.
