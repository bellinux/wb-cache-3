It was limited to solid samples, however, <b>liquid</b> <b>sample</b> recently can also be measured in TC/EA-IRMS system by adapting an autosampler for liquids. The drawback of TC/EA is the relatively big sample size (~ mg), which is smaller than offline combustion/reduction but larger than GC/pyrolysis. It cannot separate different compounds as GC/pyrolysis does and thus only the average for the whole sample can be provided, {{which is also a}} drawback for some research.|$|E
25|$|For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass {{spectrometry}} a solid or <b>liquid</b> <b>sample</b> {{is mixed with}} a matrix solution, to help the sample avoid processes such as aggregation or precipitation, while helping the sample remain stable during the ionization process. The matrix crystallizes with the sample and is then deposited on a sample plate, which can be made {{of a range of}} materials, from inert metals to inert polymers. The matrix containing the sample molecules is then transferred to the gas phase by pulsed laser irradiation. The makeup of the matrix, interactions between the sample and the matrix, and how the sample is deposited are all extremely important during sample preparation to ensure the best possible results.|$|E
25|$|Thermospray {{was first}} {{developed}} {{as a way to}} effectively remove solvent and vaporize samples more easily. This method involves the <b>liquid</b> <b>sample</b> from the LC flowing through an electrically heated vaporizer that simply heats the sample, removing any solvent and therefore putting the sample in the gas phase. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is similar to thermospray in the principle of removing the liquid solvent from the sample as much as possible, creating charged sample molecules either in small droplets or in gas form. Studies have shown that ESI can be as much as ten times more sensitive than other ionization methods coupled to LC. The spray methods are particularly useful considering that non-volatile samples can be analyzed easily through this method since the sample is not itself turned into a gas, the liquid is simply removed, pushing the sample into a gaseous or mist phase.|$|E

500|$|Fenn did {{not start}} his Nobel-winning {{research}} until later in his career. [...] He was semi-retired when he first published his research on electrospray ionization for mass spectrometry. [...] Fenn felt that his work in electrospray ionization received [...] "a kick in the pants" [...] when proteomics emerged. [...] In 2001, more than 1700 papers on proteomics were published, many using electrospray ionization. [...] Electrospray ionization provides {{a way to get}} accurate information about the mass of a large molecule very quickly, even when it is in a mixture of other molecules. [...] The <b>liquid</b> <b>sample</b> is introduced into an electrospray source (at atmospheric pressure) and desolvated with a flow of heated nitrogen gas. [...] This forms small droplets which evaporate in a region under vacuum, which increases the charge on the droplets. [...] For large molecules like proteins, this often results in multiply charge species. [...] Increasing the charge on the molecules, decreased the mass-to-charge ratio, which allows the mass to be more easily determined.|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} detection of microorganisms in <b>liquid</b> <b>samples</b> generally requires their enrichment or isolation. The aim {{of our study}} was to evaluate the capture and pre-concentration of bacteria by immobilized particular cationic antimicrobial peptides, called synthetic anti-lipopolysaccharide peptides (SALP). For the proof-of-concept and screening of different SALP, the peptides were covalently immobilized on glass slides, and the binding of bacteria was confirmed by microscopic examination of the slides or their scanning, in case of fluorescent bacterial cells. The most efficient SALP was further tethered to magnetic beads. SALP beads {{were used for the}} magnetic capture of Escherichia coli in <b>liquid</b> <b>samples.</b> The efficiency of this strategy was evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Covalently immobilized SALP were capable of capturing bacteria in <b>liquid</b> <b>samples.</b> However, PCR was hampered by the unspecific binding of DNA to the positively charged peptide. We developed a method for DNA recovery by the enzymatic digestion of the peptide, which allowed for a successful PCR, though the method had its own adverse impact on the detection and, thus, did not allow for the reliable quantitative analysis of the pathogen enrichment. Immobilized SALP can be used as capture molecules for bacteria in <b>liquid</b> <b>samples</b> and can be recommended for the design of the assays or decontamination of the fluids.
