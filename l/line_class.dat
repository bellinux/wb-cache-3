5|$|From 21 November 1944, {{when the}} Flåm Line {{received}} electric traction, Class 64 trains {{were also used}} there. The Flåm Line is even steeper and more curved than the Hardanger Line, so the trains received track brakes. In 1947, El 9 locomotives were delivered for the Flåm <b>Line.</b> <b>Class</b> 64 trains continued to be used periodically on the Flåm Line when there was insufficient availability of El 9s, {{as well as in}} periods with very little or very much traffic.|$|E

From 1986 the first Sprinter trains operated on the <b>line,</b> <b>Class</b> 150s, subsequently replaced by Class 156 units from 1988. From this time, the service operated hourly between Birmingham New Street and Ely with alternate services serving Cambridge, from 1991 Stansted Airport, and Norwich.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a new infinite family of (q^ 2 − 1) / 2 -tight sets in the hyperbolic quadrics Q+(5,q), for q≡ 5 or 9 mod 12.

This {{is the second}} known infinite family of nontrivial Cameron–Liebler <b>line</b> <b>classes,</b> the first family having been described by Bruen and Drudge with parameter (q^ 2 + 1) / 2 in PG(3,q) for all odd q. The study of Cameron–Liebler <b>line</b> <b>classes</b> {{is closely related to}} the study of symmetric tactical decompositions of PG(3,q) (those having the same number of point <b>classes</b> as <b>line</b> <b>classes).</b> We show that our new examples occur as <b>line</b> <b>classes</b> in such a tactical decomposition when q≡ 9 mod 12 (so q= 3 ^(2 e) for some positive integer e), providing an infinite family of counterexamples to a conjecture made by Cameron and Liebler (in Linear Algebra Appl 46, 91 – 102, 1982); the nature of these decompositions allows us to also prove the existence of a set of type (1 / 2 *(3 ^(2 e) − 3 ^e), 1 / 2 *(3 ^(2 e) + 3 ^e)) in the affine plane AG(2, 3 ^(2 e)) for all positive integers e.

40|$|AbstractCameron–Liebler <b>line</b> <b>classes</b> {{arose from}} {{an attempt by}} Cameron and Liebler to {{classify}} those collineation groups ofPG(n,q) which have {{the same number of}} orbits on points as on lines. They satisfy several equivalent properties; among them, constant intersection with spreads. Cameron and Liebler conjectured that, apart from some ‘obvious’ examples, no sets of lines of this type exist inPG(3,q). This paper introduces a connection between Cameron–Liebler <b>line</b> <b>classes</b> inPG(3,q) and blocking sets inPG(2,q), and uses it to provide the strongest results to date concerning the non-existence of certain of these sets. In addition, a complete classification of Cameron–Liebler <b>line</b> <b>classes</b> inPG(3, 3) is obtained, with the main result being that there is, essentially, a unique counterexample to Cameron and Liebler's conjecture in this space...|$|R
25|$|The Bratsberg and Brevik Line were {{electrified}} {{before the}} Vestfold Line, between 1936 and 1949. Electrification of the Vestfold Line {{took place in}} three segments. First the segment from Eidanger to Larvik was taken into use on 15 October 1956, then the segment from Larvik to Tønsberg on 20 May 1957 and finally the segment from Tønsberg to Drammen on 1 December 1957. NSB reallocated most and later all of their El 8 locomotives to Drammen District, resulting in them being frequently used on the Vestfold <b>Line.</b> <b>Class</b> 66 multiple units were introduced on the Vestfold Line on 28 May 1967. They ran on trains to Skien until 3 June 1973, after which it only served to Larvik. They were retired on 21 May 1977. El 11 locomotives were used on the Vestfold Line from the 1970s. From the late 1970s and early 1980s, these were replaced with El 13.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{striped bass}} ever taken by angling was an 81.88-lb (37.14-kg) {{specimen}} {{taken from a}} boat in Long Island Sound, near the Outer Southwest Reef, {{off the coast of}} Westbrook, Connecticut. The all-tackle world record fish was taken by Gregory Myerson on the night of August 4, 2011. The fish took a drifted live eel bait, and fought for 20 minutes before being boated by Myerson. A second hook and leader was discovered in the fish's mouth when it was boated, indicating it had been previously hooked by another angler. The fish measured 54in length and had a girth of 36in. The International Game Fish Association declared Myerson's catch the new all-tackle world record striped bass on October 19, 2011. In addition to now holding the All-Tackle record, Meyerson's catch also landed him the new IGFA men’s 37-kg (80-lb) <b>line</b> <b>class</b> record for striped bass, which previously stood at 70lb. The previous all-tackle world record fish was a 78.5-lb (35.6-kg) specimen taken in Atlantic City, New Jersey on September 21, 1982 by Albert McReynolds, who fought the fish from the beach for 1:20 after it took his Rebel artificial lure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. On a {{stack of}} stable maps, the cotangent <b>line</b> <b>classes</b> are {{modified}} by subtracting certain boundary divisors. These modified cotangent <b>line</b> <b>classes</b> are compatible with forgetful morphisms, and are well-suited to enumerative geometry: tangency conditions allow simple expressions in terms of modified cotangent <b>line</b> <b>classes.</b> Topological recursion relations are established among their top products in genus 0, yielding effective recursions for characteristic numbers of rational curves in any projective homogeneous variety. In higher genus, the obtained numbers are only virtual, due to contributions from spurious components of the space of maps. For the projective plane, the necessary corrections are determined in genus 1 and 2 to give the characteristic numbers in these cases. Introduction. Gromov-Witten invariants and enumerative geometry. The Gromov-Witten invariants of a nonsingular algebraic variety X are defined via integrals over associated moduli stacks of maps from curves to X (cf.
