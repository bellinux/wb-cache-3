60|$|And {{the effect}} of a bodega is picturesque, too, though in a {{different}} way. It is a bright and cheerful spot, a huge shed with whitewashed walls and an open roof supported by dark beams; great casks are piled up, impressing you in their vast rotundity with a sort of aldermanic stateliness. The whole place is fragrant with clean, vinous perfumes. Your guide carries a glass and a <b>long</b> <b>filler.</b> You taste wine after wine, in different shades of brown; light wines to drink with your dinner, older wines to drink before your coffee; wines more than a century old, of which the odour is more delicate than violets; new wines of the preceding year, strong and rough; Amontillados, with the softest flavour in the world; Manzanillas for the gouty; Marsalas, heavy and sweet; wines that smell of wild-flowers; cheap wines and expensive wines. Then the brandies--the distiller tells you proudly that Spanish brandy is made from wine, and contemptuously that French brandy is not--old brandies for which a toper would sell his soul; new brandies like fusel-oil; brandies mellow and mild and rich. It is a drunkard's paradise.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S.A, the Saint Luis Rey {{trademark}} was registered by Altadis. In 2008, Altadis {{was acquired}} by the British tobacco giant Imperial Tobacco (now Imperial Brands). Imperial now markets the Altadis USA line of non-Cuban cigars with the Saint Luis Rey brand name incorporating a blend of Honduran and Nicaraguan or Peruvian <b>long</b> <b>filler</b> tobaccos and a Nicaraguan binder and wrapper.|$|E
5000|$|Quality cigars {{are still}} handmade. An {{experienced}} cigar-roller can produce hundreds of very good, nearly identical, cigars per day. The rollers keep the tobacco moist — especially the wrapper — and use specially designed crescent-shaped knives, called chavetas, {{to form the}} filler and wrapper leaves quickly and accurately. Once rolled, the cigars are stored in wooden forms as they dry, in which their uncapped ends are cut to a uniform size. From this stage, the cigar is a complete product that can be [...] "laid down" [...] and aged for decades if kept as close to 21 °C (70 °F), and 70% relative humidity. Once purchased, proper storage is typically in a specialized wooden humidor. Some cigars, especially premium brands, use different varieties of tobacco for the filler and the wrapper. <b>Long</b> <b>filler</b> cigars are a far higher quality of cigar, using long leaves throughout. These cigars also use a third variety of tobacco leaf, called a [...] "binder", between the filler and the outer wrapper. This permits the makers to use more delicate and attractive leaves as a wrapper. These high-quality cigars almost always blend varieties of tobacco. Even Cuban long-filler cigars will combine tobaccos {{from different parts of}} the island to incorporate several different flavors.|$|E
50|$|The concert {{began at}} 7:30 p.m. and ended at 3:20 a.m. - the longest Phish concert {{up to that}} point. This is also the longest volume in the Live Phish Series {{consisting}} of material from one night (Volume 16 is the <b>longest</b> including <b>filler)</b> clocking in at just over four hours.|$|R
40|$|Fillers {{belong to}} the most {{frequently}} used beautifying products. They are generally well tolerated, but any one of them may occasionally produce adverse side effects. Adverse effects usually last as <b>long</b> as the <b>filler</b> is in the skin, which means that short-lived fillers have short-term side effects and permanent fillers may induce life-long adverse effects. The main goal is to prevent them, however, this is not always possible. Utmost care has to be given to the prevention of infections and the injection technique has to be perfect. Treatment of adverse effects is often with hyaluronidase or steroid injections and in some cases together with 5 -fluorouracil plus allopurinol orally. Histological examination of biopsy specimens often helps to identify the responsible filler allowing a specific treatment to be adapted...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{incremental}} systems are perceived as more reactive, natural, and easier to use than non-incremental systems. However, previous work on incremental NLG has not employed recent advances in statistical optimisation using machine learning. This paper combines the two approaches, showing how the update, revoke and purge operations typically used in incremental approaches can be implemented as state transitions in a Markov Decision Process. We design a model of incremental NLG that generates output based on micro-turn interpretations of the user’s utterances and is able to optimise its decisions using statistical machine learning. We present a proof-of-concept study in the domain of Information Presentation (IP), where a learning agent faces the trade-off of whether to present information as soon as it is available (for high reactiveness) or else to wait until input ASR hypotheses are more reliable. Results show that the agent learns to avoid <b>long</b> waiting times, <b>fillers</b> and self-corrections, by re-ordering content based on its confidence. ...|$|R
40|$|In two experiments, we {{investigated}} comprehension monitoring in 10 - 12 years old children differing in reading comprehension skill. The children's self-paced reading times (Experiment 1) and eye fixations and regressions (Experiment 2) were measured as they read narrative texts {{in which an}} action of the protagonist was consistent or inconsistent {{with a description of}} the protagonist's character given earlier. The character description and action were adjacent (local condition) or separated by a <b>long</b> <b>filler</b> paragraph (global condition). The self-paced reading data (Experiment 1), the initial reading and rereading data (Experiment 2), together with the comprehension question data (both experiments), are discussed within the situation model framework and suggest that poor comprehenders find difficulty in constructing a richly elaborated situation model. Poor comprehenders presumably fail to represent character information in the model as a consequence of which they are not able to detect inconsistencies in the global condition (in which the character information is lost from working memory). The patterns of results rule out an explanation in terms of impaired situation model updating ability. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Phonation {{distortion}} leaves relevant {{marks in}} a speaker's biometric profile. Dysphonic voice production {{may be used}} for biometrical speaker characterization. In the present paper phonation features derived from the glottal source (GS) parameterization, after vocal tract inversion, is proposed for dysphonic voice characterization in Speaker Verification tasks. The glottal source derived parameters are matched in a forensic evaluation framework defining a distance-based metric specification. The phonation segments used in the study are derived from <b>fillers,</b> <b>long</b> vowels, and other phonation segments produced in spontaneous telephone conversations. Phonated segments from a telephonic database of 100 male Spanish native speakers are combined in a 10 -fold cross-validation task to produce the set of quality measurements outlined in the paper. Shimmer, mucosal wave correlate, vocal fold cover biomechanical parameter unbalance and a subset of the GS cepstral profile produce accuracy rates as high as 99. 57 for a wide threshold interval (62. 08 - 75. 04 %). An Equal Error Rate of 0. 64 % can be granted. The proposed metric framework is shown to behave more fairly than classical likelihood ratios in supporting the hypothesis of the defense vs that of the prosecution, thus ofering a more reliable evaluation scoring. Possible applications are Speaker Verification and Dysphonic Voice Grading...|$|R
40|$|The authors herein {{report the}} {{feasibility}} of suprachoroidal buckling (SCB) procedure as a new approach for treating different forms of retinal detachment (RD) by creating suprachoroidal indentation (buckling effect). With this technique, specially designed devices, i. e. a catheter or cannula, are guided in the suprachoroidal space to reach the target area. Then, a suprachoroidal <b>filler</b> (<b>long</b> lasting hyaluronic acid) is injected to indent the choroid creating SCB, thereby closing retinal tears and supporting the overlying retina. This procedure was performed to treat both myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM), including myopic macular holes, as well as peripheral retinal breaks. SCB may be used alone or in conjunction with vitrectomy. In myopic patients, restoration of retinal layers was achieved in all eyes with myopic foveoschisis. Most eyes with macular hole detachments demonstrated closure of the holes. All peripheral retinal breaks were adequately buckled and closed in a single procedure. The buckling effect was long enough in duration to seal the tears and promote adequate chorioretinal scarring. The procedure was safe and relatively simple in terms of reaching the treatment area and injecting the filler. SCB adds to our surgical options for treating selected cases of peripheral retinal tears and rhegmatogenous RD, and avoids potential problems of episcleral buckles. Moreover it may avoid vitrectomy in selected cases of rhegmatogenou...|$|R
