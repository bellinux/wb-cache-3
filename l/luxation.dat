5|$|Lens <b>luxation,</b> {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior <b>luxation</b> (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior <b>luxation</b> (where the lens slips forward). Posterior <b>luxation</b> is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior <b>luxation,</b> the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior <b>luxation</b> also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens <b>luxation</b> is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{hardy breed}} with few breed {{specific}} health problems. The main hereditary problem {{highlighted by the}} American Sealyham Terrier Club is an eye condition called lens <b>luxation,</b> for which there are DNA tests. Lens <b>luxation</b> is {{a condition in which}} the lens slips out of position in the eyeball due to the weakening of the fibers that holds it in place.|$|E
5|$|This breed {{is equally}} {{suitable}} {{as a family}} dog or a working terrier, given the right training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two prevalent conditions being lens <b>luxation</b> and canine degenerative myelopathy.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar <b>luxation,</b> {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|Other eye {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include cataracts in juveniles, corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment. Non-eye breed related {{conditions which}} may affect a Parson are deafness and patella <b>luxation.</b> The average lifespan of a Parson Russell Terrier is between 14 and 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Patellar <b>luxation,</b> {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E

5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar <b>luxation,</b> ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|Two genetic health {{concerns}} {{seen in the}} breed are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar <b>luxation</b> and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens <b>luxation.</b> Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
50|$|In cattle, {{it occurs}} mainly craniodorsally or caudoventrally, but other {{directions}} are possible. A typical stance {{is seen in}} craniodorsal <b>luxations,</b> with a shortened limb, and a protrusion of greater trochanter.|$|R

5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens <b>luxation,</b> a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E

40|$|Open {{surgical}} fixation {{was performed}} on four hip joints in three dogs who were suffering from caudoventral hip <b>luxations</b> for which closed reduction had previously failed. Stabilization of the joint was achieved with a ventral coxofemoral approach, which augmented {{the function of the}} transverse acetabular ligament using a sling implant through a bone tunnel (n = 1), a sling implant around two pelvic screws (n = 1), or an internal fixator plate (n = 2). Transverse acetabular ligament augmentation resulted in successful joint stabilization in all cases, and should be considered for the surgical reduction of caudoventral hip <b>luxations</b> in dogs. The use of an internal fixator plate, while preserving soft-tissue blood supply and resulting in minimal to no long-term arthritic changes, may provide an optimal outcome...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgical {{treatment}} options for sternoclavicular joint <b>luxations</b> {{described in the}} literature are numerous, although all have limitations. Therefore, there is no favorable surgical treatment for sternoclavicular <b>luxations</b> when nonoperative treatment has failed. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: We developed the polydioxanone (PDS) envelope plasty, a modification of the figure-of-eight technique, using a PDS ligament. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 39 patients (40 joints), treated with a PDS envelope plasty for invalidating sternoclavicular <b>luxations.</b> The minimum followup was 10 months (average, 52 months; range, 10 - 171 months). The Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant-Murley shoulder score, and subjective categorical results were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: In most patients, postoperative functional shoulder scores were excellent (mean Constant-Murley score, 90, range, 52 - 100; mean SST, 10; range, 2 - 12). Ninety percent of patients had an improvement of shoulder function at followup. Only minor complications occurred. Thirteen percent of patients had spontaneous postoperative subluxations. However, the postoperative shoulder function improved in all these patients. CONCLUSIONS: The PDS envelope plasty is a simple procedure, a modification of the best-reported technique. We have promising results with high shoulder scores. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence...|$|R
25|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs {{when there is a}} backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as <b>luxation.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Hereditary {{orthopedic}} {{diseases are}} mainly found in purebred dogs. [...] Hip dysplasia {{is a common}} problem that primarily affects larger breeds.

Over time it often causes arthritis in the hips. Dysplasia can also occur in the elbow joint. [...] Luxating patellas can be a problem for smaller breeds. It can cause lameness and pain in the hind legs.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{diagnostic}} tests {{are available for}} concerned Aussie owners to check the overall health of a dog.

The OFA database also includes the results for eye exams performed by a Canine Eye Registration Foundation [...] veterinarian, {{but only if the}} owner of the Aussie submits the results. This database is a great resource to investigate the lineage and related health of the progenitors of some dogs, at least regarding hip ratings.|$|E

40|$|Diseases of {{the cornea}} and lens {{are common in}} captive pinnipeds; {{environmental}} factors including water qual-ity and salinity, light intensity, nutrition, and spatial charac-teristics (eg, orientation of sun on wet and dry areas, depth, exhibit surface color [for reflected light], and animal loading per cubic meter [because of potential water-quality effects]) have been reporteda as the most likely predominant causes. On the basis of results of a study by Dunn et al,b most captive pinnipeds are now housed in saltwater rather than freshwater.
