5000|$|Ogof Nadolig is a cave in the Alyn Gorge near Cilcain, Flintshire, Wales. It {{is mostly}} crawling, 300 m long, {{and ends with}} a shaft {{up to the surface}} and <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> manhole <b>cover.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{that same}} year, the Oude Kerk became {{home to the}} {{registry}} of marriages. It was also used as the city archives; the most important documents were <b>locked</b> in <b>a</b> chest <b>covered</b> with iron plates and painted with the city’s coat of arms. The chest was kept safe in the iron chapel.|$|R
50|$|The {{smart key}} allows {{the driver to}} keep the key fob {{pocketed}} when unlocking, locking and starting the vehicle. The key is identified via one of several antennas in the car's bodywork and a radio pulse generator in the key housing. Depending on the system, the vehicle is automatically unlocked when a button or sensor on the door handle or trunk release is pressed. Vehicles with a smart-key system fitted have a mechanical backup, usually {{in the form of}} a spare key blade supplied with the vehicle. Some manufacturers hide the backup <b>lock</b> behind <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> for styling.|$|R
5000|$|Entry to {{the cave}} is via <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> manhole <b>cover,</b> the keys to which are held by the RFDCC, which has an access {{agreement}} with the landowners, the Forestry Commission. A 30 m shaft with a fixed ladder gives access to the first chamber known as [...] "Autumn Frenzy".|$|R
50|$|The risk of firemen {{tying down}} the safety valve remained. This was {{encouraged}} by them being fitted with easily adjustable wing nuts, the practice of adjusting the boiler's working pressure via the safety valve being an accepted behaviour well into the 1850s. It was later common with Salter valves {{for them to be}} fitted in pairs, one adjustable and often calibrated for use as a gauge, the other sealed inside <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>cover</b> to prevent tampering.|$|R
50|$|The {{focus of}} the phone is the high quality {{playback}} of music and video, as well as photography. The camera {{is located on the}} back of the phone, behind a slider and features a xenon flash. On the side of the phone, there is a shutter button, and a button which allows you to switch between still and video modes. Next to this is a rocker switch for zooming in and out. Also on this side is a button for playback of photos or video. The other side of the phone has <b>a</b> sliding <b>lock</b> button and <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> slot for <b>a</b> MicroSD card.|$|R
5000|$|The {{common storage}} box for tools, instruments, glassware, artworks, etc. is a sturdy box {{made to be}} longer-lasting and better-finished than a {{shipping}} box or crate. For instance, a box might be a rigid paperboard box instead of a corrugated box. Or {{it could be a}} wooden box with a sanded surface and mitered corners instead of a crude crate construction. A storage box {{may or may not have}} dunnage or cushions that protect the contents if the box is upended or shaken, and usually does not have hinges, latches or <b>locks,</b> but simply <b>a</b> <b>cover.</b> Boxwood gets its name from its superior properties for manufacturing this type of box, although those properties are equally useful when making a decorative box.|$|R
50|$|A {{geneticist}} {{who works}} as a part-time instructor for the Ambulance department, he is a university graduate from abroad and is noted to be very handsome with an appearance of a 20-year-old. He is very polite, using honorific speech at all times, which contributed to his immense popularity in Butei High. It turns out {{he was the one who}} had captured and imprisoned Riko after her parents died. He was seeking Lupin's superior genetic material to add to his collection (possibly himself as well,) but, as it seemed she was severely lacking in talent and ability, he treated her as a worthless failure. This entailed abuse, long stretches of being <b>locked</b> in <b>a</b> cell <b>covered</b> in dirt with nothing to do but sit, and constant comments on how she was a failure while she was still dealing with her parents' deaths.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, such as {{equipment}} used in schools, community centers, or other public places, {{the equipment is}} designed so that {{some or all of}} the switches are hidden behind <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> <b>cover.</b> Some public address systems are sold in tamper-resistant designs that make it harder for unauthorized members of the public to activate the system or change the settings. The switches are at the rear of the unit; only LED lights are on the front of the panel. When the unit is rack-mounted into a wall or rack unit, this means that only official personnel (who are able to access the back of the panel) can change the settings or use the unit. Another variant on this design is to cover the switches with <b>a</b> <b>locked</b> panel. In some cases, such as the sound system in a bar or club, the locked cover may be made from transparent plexiglass, so that the sound engineer can verify the sound system settings and switches (yet at the same time, the locked panel prevents mischief-minded club patrons from tampering or altering the amplifier or equalizer settings).|$|R

2500|$|In the {{following}} year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was [...] "swept up" [...] by the excitement engendered {{by the many}} scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored {{to find a way}} to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping [...] "night owl" [...] hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> <b>cover.</b> Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches. Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.|$|R
