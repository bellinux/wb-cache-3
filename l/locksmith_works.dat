5000|$|It is a {{characteristic}} of court arts generally speaking, that design and craftsmanship are collaborative in nature. Beneman collaborated with what Watson has called [...] "a galaxy of talented craftsmen", instancing the ébéniste Guillaume Kemp, the bronziers Forestier, Thomire and Bardin, and the sculptors Boizot and Martin. [...] To them might be added the ciseleur-doreur Galle. For a unique commission like the royal bureau plat of 1786, Martin provided a wax model of the original desk, Girard painted studies of fruit and flowers {{to be followed by}} Bertrand's designs, that were cut apart for the marquetry-cutters in Guillaume Kemp's workshop, Bardin and Thomire for finishing and mounting gilt-bronze myrtle moldings, gilded by Galle; Gosselin stamped in gilt the Morocco leather writing surface; Benneman sub-contracted the <b>locksmith's</b> <b>work</b> incorporated in his ébénisterie; his workers were paid 785 livres and he personally received 508 livres.|$|R

Returning to Sömmerda, he in 1824 founded a company to manufacture percussion caps. It was there that he designed the needle rifle.|$|R
50|$|Historically, locksmiths {{constructed}} or repaired {{an entire}} lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production {{has made this}} less common; {{the vast majority of}} locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many <b>locksmiths</b> also <b>work</b> on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service electronic locks by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.|$|R

40|$|The houses {{doors and}} gates belong to discreet, but very {{significant}} monuments. There {{were more than}} 12 joineries in Polička, where 85 carved gates and doors were made during the period 40 - 80 years in 19 th century and they were unique in whole Czech republic. 35 of them have preserved. Classicism appeared in Bohemia {{during the reign of}} kaiser Joseph II. (1780 - 1790) and it entered to Polička in 1841, when the buildings of schools for boys were built and faded until the eighties. The big town fire in 1845 caused outstanding classicist reconstruction. The publication treats on following topics very closely: The submitters - citizens of Polička - decorated gates were an subject of reputation. The joiners - there are the detailed lists of the masters and descriptions of their hoboes journeys. Construction of the gates and doors. The motives of decoration. The colour scheme of the gates and facades - the most common gate colours were ochre, brown and green - gate dichromatism is much modern.

They had four children: elder {{brothers}} Vasily and Nikolai, and twins Anatoly and Lyubov; all four competed in swimming, though brother Anatoly quit at a young age. There was no pool in Krasnodar until 1967, and therefore they trained in the Kuban River, which was heated all through {{the year by the}} nearby thermal power station. She graduated from the Kuban State University of Physical Education in Krasnodar. After retiring in 1976 she worked as a swimming coach. In the 2000s she was still competing in the masters category.|$|R
5000|$|Desperate, Tom surreptitiously {{uses his}} cell phone to contact his friend Wayne, {{who is in the}} audience. When Wayne's phone rings, it {{momentarily}} disrupts the performance; Wayne leaves the concert hall in embarrassment. As he plays, Tom texts Wayne, but the usher (who is revealed to be working with Clem) kills Wayne. Clem tells Tom to look up, and Tom sees Wayne's body on the rafters. Wayne's girlfriend Ashley leaves the hall in search of him, but she is also killed by the usher. Clem then tells Tom that instead of performing Beethoven's [...] "Tempest Sonata", as Norman originally announced, he must perform [...] "La Cinquette" [...] flawlessly, as an embedded lock in the piano depends on a flawless performance. Clem further reveals that the release of said lock would yield a key to a safe deposit box containing Patrick Godureaux's disappeared fortune; Clem himself is the <b>locksmith</b> who <b>worked</b> with Godureaux to construct the mechanism. Tom insists that he can only perform [...] "La Cinquette" [...] with sheet music.|$|R
5000|$|After Bess convinces Harry {{to take a}} job in a <b>locksmith</b> factory, Harry <b>works</b> as a lock tester while {{fantasizing about}} {{escaping}} from one of the factory's large safes. On Halloween, Harry and Bess attend a special magicians' dinner at the Hotel Astor, during which magician Fante offers a prize to anyone who can free himself from a straitjacket. Harry accepts the challenge and, through intense concentration, extricates himself from the jacket, greatly impressing Fante. Afterward, however, Fante advises Harry to [...] "drop it," [...] noting that Johann Von Schweger, a German magician, retired {{at the height of his}} career after performing a similar feat, fearful of his own talents. Bess then persuades Harry to give her his prize, a single, round-trip boat ticket to Europe, so that she can cash it in for a down payment on a house.|$|R
50|$|When the {{doorbell}} rings, {{he opens it}} to find a young, hunchbacked female locksmith who says that she is here to fix a lock in the house. Hesitant, he tells {{that one of the}} room's lock upstairs needs fixing. As they interact, Samsa notices that he is unable to understand some of the common words she uses. When she tells him that she needs to take the lock to her family of <b>locksmiths</b> for further <b>work,</b> he asks her why she rotates her arm so often. She says that her brassiere is uncomfortable on her; while telling him this she notices that he has a visible erection. Offended, she scorns him before he says that he has no idea what he is doing. Before she leaves, he asks her if she could return so that they could talk, as he is still confused about most of the world. She says perhaps they can do so when she returns the lock, before she walks back to her family through military-occupied Prague.|$|R
60|$|He {{ran down}} {{and told the}} porter that she was {{certainly}} in the room. He had had a letter from her and feared a terrible accident. He suggested breaking open the door. The porter, who had been sullen and disinclined to listen, became alarmed; he could not take the responsibility of breaking into the room; they must go for the commissaire de police. They walked together to the bureau, and then they fetched a locksmith. Philip found that Miss Price had not paid the last quarter's rent: on New Year's Day she had not given the concierge the present which old-established custom led him to regard as a right. The four of them went upstairs, and they knocked again at the door. There was no reply. The <b>locksmith</b> set to <b>work,</b> and at last they entered the room. Philip gave a cry and instinctively covered his eyes with his hands. The wretched woman was hanging with a rope round her neck, which she had tied to a hook in the ceiling fixed by some previous tenant {{to hold up the}} curtains of the bed. She had moved her own little bed {{out of the way and}} had stood on a chair, which had been kicked away. It was lying on its side on the floor. They cut her down. The body was quite cold.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{points out}} that creators and {{copyright}} owners recognize, {{whether or not they}} admit it, that traditional copyright law is simply not up to the job we have tried to assign it in cyberspace. In fact, copyright owners in reality do not rely on copyright to protect themselves there, except in purely incidental ways. Instead, they use one of four strategies in distributing their content – the strategies of the Naysayer, the Locksmith, the Subverter and the Explorer. The Naysayers try to avoid problems by staying away from on line distribution altogether; the <b>Locksmiths</b> shroud their <b>works</b> in digital rights management systems and restrictive contracts; the Subverters find ways to bend the rules of copyright to limit their effect, often in ways that the statute 2 ̆ 7 s drafters could never have anticipated; and the Explorers push copyright aside altogether in favor of developing their own creative forms of distribution. The Naysayer strategy has already amply been shown to be a failure. The characteristic in greatest supply today in the delivery of information goods in cyberspace is willingness to experiment, with individuals and entities mixing and matching aspects of the other three strategies to suit their own needs, hoping in the process {{to find new ways to}} market their work, earn a living, and thrive in a digital environment. Whatever the end result, the paper posits that emerging solutions will share three fundamental characteristics. First, they will owe relatively little to formal copyright, even if that law continues to play an important role in the analog world. Second, they will give up on attempts to thoroughly lock down works in the effort to prevent unauthorized copying and uses. Third, if digital rights management remains part of the ultimate strategy, its design will take account of what the users – and not just the content owners – view as fair and equitable. What will actually turn out to be the “best” ways to disseminate content in cyberspace is hard to guess: whether a single version of the Creative Commons license will emerge, or a variety of them will continue to be used; whether some modest iterations of DRMs will turn out to be useful and palatable; whether financing through auctions will prove feasible, or whether instead creators will find it more practical merely to post content and let whoever wants it take it for free. Maybe systems will emerge that no one has thought of yet. The objective of policy makers during this period of ferment should be simple: do no harm. Erect no unnecessary roadblocks that will derail efforts to find out what is efficient, preserves incentives and is acceptable to the public. What should not happen is for everyone to remain stuck on arguing how to make the existing legal regime “fit” in cyberspace, simply because it is the way things have been done for centuries. The truth is that out there in cyberspace, copyright has pretty much been left behind...|$|R
