Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> involved at all.

500|$|The nightly in-character guest {{interviews}} were initially {{of concern to}} Colbert, who worried his character's belligerent nature would be off-putting to guests. However, since the show's debut, {{he says he has}} found he is able to [...] "slide the intensity" [...] of his behavior depending on his interviewee's ability to respond to his aggressive approach. Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his favorite part of the show, because it allows him to improvise. Colbert advises his guests to disabuse the character of his ignorance. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> away with anything. Don't try to play my game. Be real. Be passionate. Hold your ideas. Give me resistance. Give me traction I can work against." ...|$|E

[...] Fynn experiences a period of angst, blaming God, but when he visits Anna's grave and sees {{it to be a}} riot of flowers, he lets go of his anger against God. The answer, he realizes, is [...] "Anna is in my middle". This particular reference is to a conversation between Anna and Fynn. God is part of everybody and everybody is part of God. Fynn walks away from her graveyard with renewed hope.|$|R

Ward's sixth studio album Hold Time and contributed a cover version of The Smiths' [...] "Please, Please, Please, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Get</b> What I Want" [...] to the (500) Days of Summer soundtrack.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog {{described}} the song as a [...] "rap/singing mash-up." [...] Coined as a [...] "new brand of hood majesty," [...] {{the song is}} accompanied by a simple beat, which includes finger snaps and [...] "xylophone clings." [...] Lean Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Rap's spitfire explores her softer side, sampling Annie Lennox on her honey-tongued ode to a good man."

[...] Minaj makes several references in her lines to well known people, which includes Bruce Willis in Die Hard, as well as Adam and Eve.

His demo was {{originally}} called [...] "Swamp".

2500|$|A {{member of}} the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Zaitsev affirmed {{his belief in the}} Soviet Union and the future of communism, {{including}} the communist ideals of a workers' paradise. The New York Times reported that by the 1980s, he became disillusioned with the Party. Zaitsev told the newspaper that at mandatory party meetings he [...] "began to defend the right to be free, as it says in the Communist charter. They constantly tried to distract me, not to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> in. I'd be stuck in the elevator or I'd be sent off to some other event." [...] This disillusionment led to Zaitsev quitting the party in the late 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Their first full-length, Answer That and Stay Fashionable was {{released}} July 4, 1995, on Wingnut Records, and {{was produced by}} Tim Armstrong.

Porter {{was impressed by the}} basic riff Marr showed him, but felt the song needed something else. Their discussion turned to the early recordings of Elvis Presley, which led to an impromptu jam session of the song [...] "That's All Right". During the jam, Marr worked on his chord progression for [...] "Swamp", which inspired the arrangement.|$|E

Lady Constance is usually introduced by a statement {{along the lines}} of [...] "what is that coming towards us? – It's huge – It's a rhinoceros!" [...] – [...] "No, it's me!!!" [...] and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again", and always by rousing cheers from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the [...] "Henry VIII" [...] sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen. [...] Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: [...] "..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, your very own – and there's enough to go round – twice -...". [...] In the [...] "Dentisti" [...] sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series Daktari, Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in [...] "Jack The Ripper", Lady Constance is invited to: [...] "please, sit down anywhere ... or in your case, everywhere".

2500|$|The {{mandolin}} {{has been}} used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations. Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents. The instrument has also {{found its way into}} British rock music. The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose [...] "Fog on the Tyne" [...] was the biggest selling UK album of 1971–72. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do, and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of the Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire. McGuinness Flint, for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single, When I'm Dead And Gone, is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and played mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in the Incredible String Band. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please Please <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Get</b> What I Want by the Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse. It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit [...] "Dance Tonight." [...] That {{was not the first time}} a Beatle played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name. The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people. Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin. This song was left off their debut album, and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.|$|E
