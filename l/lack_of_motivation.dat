5|$|Schizophrenia is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E

5|$|The novel's {{characters}} represent polarities of contrasting morality.

The {{patriarch of the}} Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event {{in the life of}} Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.|$|E

She began the winter in Östersund with the best season start of her career, beating Tora Berger by 0.2 seconds in the sprint to claim her 25th World Cup win. She also came third in the individual and the pursuit, and took the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader. On 6 December 2011, Neuner announced her retirement from biathlon {{by the end of the}} season on her homepage. She explained her early departure from the sport (at age 25) with a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> and her desire for a normal life.

When produced in normal levels, norepinephrine creates a sense of well-being, but low levels of norepinephrine cause symptoms of depression, lack of arousal and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> In humans, this leads to then a negative feedback mechanism whereby we seek out pleasurable activities to remove the negative affect caused by the low levels of norepinephrine, therefore increasing our reward dependence.|$|E

30|$|Low-stakes {{assessments}} do {{not have}} consequences for the test-takers. Currently, motivational research indicates that a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> test-taking <b>motivation</b> can decrease students’ performance in low-stakes assessments. However, little research has explored the domain-specific and situation-specific aspects <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> simultaneously. Research examining differences in test-taking motivation among students in different types of schools is also limited.

Concepts of organizational justice later expanded upon the fundamentals of Equity Theory and pointed to the importance of fairness perceptions in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Teachers play {{a crucial}} role in the {{implementation}} of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a classroom environment, the goal of intervention should ultimately be to apply external control, as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits. Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation,</b> apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.|$|E

At the end of each 2 -week block, students were tested individually on their assigned list of words.

25|$|There {{has also}} been a lot of {{criticism}} of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.|$|E
25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation,</b> objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E

40|$|Among the {{characteristic}} features of depression is a diminishment in or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> action and <b>motivation.</b> In this paper, I consider a dominant philosophical account which purports {{to explain this}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> action or <b>motivation.</b> This approach comes in different versions but a common theme is, I argue, an over reliance on psychologistic assumptions about action–explanation and the nature <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> As a corrective I consider an alternative view that gives a prominent place to the body in motivation. Central {{to the experience of}} depression are changes to how a person is motivated to act and, also as central, are changes to bodily feelings and capacities. I argue that broadly characterizing <b>motivation</b> in terms <b>of</b> bodily capacities can, in particular, provide a more compelling account of depressive motivational pathology...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} why working mothers choose to not exclusively breast feed their infants in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. Methods : The study used a qualitative design with a phenomenological approach. Data collection in this study involved focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. In-depth interviews with 9 working women not exclusively breastfeeding. Focus group discussions two comprising of 21 respondents were husbands, in-laws, mother’s family, healthcare provider, workplace representatives, religious and community leaders. Result : Study findings indicated that the primary reason for working women to not exclusively breastfeed, because <b>of</b> a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>motivation,</b> pressures <b>of</b> a high workload, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> permitted time off, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure and concerns about losing employment due to time off. Obstacles included fear of losing employment, maternal physical factors (low/no milk production), psychological factors (stress/anxiety/frustration), <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> facilities and supporting infrastructure. Conclusion : The predominant reasons behind non-exclusive breastfeeding were <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>motivation,</b> high workload, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> permitted time off, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> supporting infrastructure and fear of losing employment. The external obstacles for providing exclusive breastfeeding were economic factors, the mother’s ability to produce milk, psychological factors, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> supporting infrastructure.

This culminated with Kahn allowing a seemingly soft shot by Roberto Carlos into the net against Real Madrid in the first knockout-round of the 2003–04 Champions League season, contributing to the elimination of his team from the competition. The Daily Mail criticized him for his mistake: [...] "Once again on the big occasion Kahn was undone by a Brazilian, {{just as he was}} in the 2002 World Cup Final. Only this time it was a Roberto Carlos free-kick which he let slip, not a Rivaldo shot, for a goal as embarrassing as it is potentially catastrophic for Bayern".
