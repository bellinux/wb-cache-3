5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late Ordovician species of trilobites that spent portions of their lives in the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s, Procter & Gamble {{began to}} market a new product, an {{inexpensive}} soap that floats in water. The company called the soap Ivory. William Arnett Procter, William Procter's grandson, began a profit-sharing {{program for the}} company's workforce in 1887. By giving the workers {{a stake in the}} company, he correctly assumed that they would be less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on strike.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the reasons}} for the {{relationship}} are not clear, there also exists a relationship between procrastination and eveningness; that is, those who procrastinate more are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to sleep later and wake later. It is known that conscientiousness increases across the lifespan, as does morningness. Procrastination too decreases with age. However, even controlling for age, there still exists a relationship between procrastination and eveningness, which is yet to be explained.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents, {{costs are}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up for {{currently}} operating and new nuclear power stations, {{due to increased}} requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats. However many designs, such as the currently under construction AP1000, use passive nuclear safety cooling systems, unlike those of Fukushima I which required active cooling systems, this largely eliminates the necessity to spend more on redundant back up safety equipment.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this, {{one of which is}} the lax {{attitude}} some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times.” The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> undetected, resulting in {{a significant impact on the}} bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.|$|E
25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles you to a free movie if you bring a friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a movie when perhaps you wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|In a Soap Opera Weekly issue, editor Carolyn Hinsey and Soap Opera Digest/All My Children editor Mara Levinsky {{sat down}} to debate Maggie's sexual orientation. Hinsey felt that Maggie was a [...] "flip-flopper" [...] {{and that it was}} odd that she could [...] "jump between the sexes" [...] as quickly as she did when, in reality, she wanted Bianca. Levinsky argued Maggie's {{confusion}} and frustration. [...] "She's on the rebound, and as likely if not <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out with a guy to try to forget Bianca than a girl," [...] Levinsky stated. [...] "Maggie knows she's attracted to Bianca, but Bianca is the only girl she's ever been attracted to." ...|$|R

25|$|Two of {{the four}} EPRs under {{construction}} (in Finland and France) are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost. Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats. While first of their kind designs, such as the EPRs under construction are behind schedule and over-budget, of the seven South Korean APR-1400s presently under construction worldwide, two are in S.Korea at the Hanul Nuclear Power Plant and four are at the largest nuclear station construction project {{in the world as}} of 2016, in the United Arab Emirates at the planned Barakah nuclear power plant. The first reactor, Barakah-1 is 85% completed and on schedule for grid-connection during 2017.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} reasons for the {{relationship}} between number of species and area, both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species. The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of island biogeography as described by MacArthur and Wilson. Large areas have large populations, which are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.|$|E
25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless and <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{unnoticed by}} passengers. For example, {{it may be}} prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E

25|$|Female {{resistance}} to mate guarding {{has also been}} researched {{in the context of}} the menstrual cycle. Pillsworth, Haselton and Buss (2004) found that women are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> want to mate with males they are not currently pair bonded with during the ovulation period of their menstrual cycle. They also show higher mate guarding resistance in general during oestrus. This is supported by the finding that during ovulation women who are both single or in a monogamous partnership with a man are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> social gatherings where they may meet alternative mates. This is said to support the female dual mating strategy theory, as during oestrus women may be seeking out mates with strong genes.|$|R
25|$|High {{rates of}} major {{depressive}} disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those who abuse alcohol. Whether it is more true that {{major depressive disorder}} causes self-medicating alcohol abuse, or the increased incidence of the disorder in alcohol abusers {{is caused by the}} drinking, is not known though some evidence suggests drinking causes the disorder. Alcohol misuse is associated with a number of mental health disorders and alcoholics have a very high suicide rate. A study of people hospitalised for suicide attempts found that those who were alcoholics were 75 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on to successfully commit suicide than non-alcoholic suicide attempters. In the general alcoholic population the increased risk of suicide compared to the general public is 5-20 times greater. About 15 percent of alcoholics commit suicide. Abuse of other drugs is also associated with an increased risk of suicide. About 33 percent of suicides in the under 35s are due to alcohol or other substance misuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between dependency- and constituency-based grammars derives {{in large part}} from the initial division of the clause. The constituency relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as {{the root of all}} clause structure. Tesnière's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and has no place in linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax as something real, then one is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down the path of constituency grammar, whereas if one rejects this division, then the only alternative is to position the verb as the root of all structure, which means one has chosen the path of dependency grammar.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia faces many historical, cultural, {{social and}} {{political}} obstacles that have restricted progress in education for many centuries. According to UNESCO reviews, most people in Ethiopia feel that work {{is more important than}} education, so they start {{at a very early age}} with little to no education. Children in rural areas are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to school than children in urban areas. Though gradually improving, most rural families cannot afford to send their children to school because parents believe that while their children are in school they cannot contribute to the household chores and income. Social awareness that education is important is something that Ethiopia lacks but has improved gradually. There is a need to change the importance of education in the country's social structure, and children should be encouraged and required to attend school and become educated. The society of Ethiopia expects teachers and parents to use corporal punishment to maintain order and discipline. Most believe that through punishing children for bad habits they in turn learn good ones. Also since the mid-1970s there was a drastic loss of professionals who left the country, mostly for economical reasons. Many educated Ethiopians sought higher salaries in foreign countries thus many of those who managed to finish higher education emigrated from Ethiopia creating an endless shortage of qualified professionals in every sector of the country. Now the custom of sending academics abroad with the risk of a brain drain is being replaced by expansion of masters and doctoral programs to up-grade academic staff. Instead, foreigners have been funding programs for leadership, management and pedagogic skills or sending staff to help strengthen teaching and management practices.|$|E

500|$|Bumblebees do not {{exhibit the}} [...] "bee dances" [...] used by honeybees to tell other workers the {{locations}} of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more. These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings, which may stimulate other bees to start foraging. Another stimulant to foraging activity {{is the level of}} food reserves in the colony. Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots, and when little is left or when high quality food is added, they are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out to forage.|$|E
