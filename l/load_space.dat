25|$|In 1954 Land Rover {{launched}} a second iteration station wagon, this time {{aimed at the}} commercial user who needed an off-road vehicle for carrying passengers without car-like comforts. Based on the commercial panel van variant Land Rover, it had seats fitted to the <b>load</b> <b>space</b> and windows cut into the sides. While available with features such as an interior light, heater, door and floor trims and upgraded seats, the station wagon retained the base vehicle's tough and capable suspension - {{as well as its}} mediocre road performance.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{opens with}} Inna {{walking on the}} beach {{promenade}} and spotting a young street musician with his guitar. After she grabs all the banknotes out of his little suitcase and runs away, the musician follows the singer to brace her, but she convinces him to spend all the money. Together they start buying ice cream and stealing clothes in a shop. At sunset, Inna and the musician meet some friends {{on the beach at}} a bonfire. After spending the night in a tent on the beach, they secretly ride along on the <b>load</b> <b>space</b> of a pick-up truck the next morning and leave the town. Subsequently, Inna and the man arrive in a desert and hitch a ride by holding a sign reading [...] "Anywhere". After getting a ride, they leave the car on a motel next to the road, where Inna enters to sing on a stage. The singer then tries to make a phone call, with the musician flirting with a blond girl at the bar. Inna kisses her on the mouth and then chooses a jukebox track. This is followed by the singer and him renting a room for the night.|$|E
2500|$|The 1954 {{model year}} brought major changes. The [...] {{wheelbase}} model {{was replaced by}} an [...] wheelbase model, and a [...] "Pick Up" [...] version was introduced. The extra wheelbase was added behind the cab area to provide additional <b>load</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{whether or}} not equal sub-division and re-distribution of the total load on a beam {{as a series of}} discrete loads enables load ratios (target ratios), similar to those between uniformly loaded and mid-span point loaded simply supported and clamped beams, to be achieved, assuming either equal deflection or strength limits. This is pertinent to the design of pultruded GFRP beams, which behave linear elastically and have inherently low flexural stiffness. Simply supported and clamped beams subjected to four symmetric, equally spaced groups of equal point loads are analysed and formulae for their maximum deflections and moments are presented. These are then converted to load ratios for equal deflection and strength limits. It is shown that load ratios similar to the target ratios are achievable and the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>spacing</b> ratios λ are given. The investigation is then extended to consider whether the effects of varying the load magnitudes and <b>load</b> <b>spacing</b> ratios, whilst keeping the total load constant, allow the target load ratios to be achieved. It is shown that the target ratios can be achieved, and the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>spacing</b> ratios are given for a range of <b>load</b> and <b>spacing</b> factors, δ and γ...|$|R

2500|$|The Series IIA FC {{launched}} in 1962 {{was based on}} the Series IIA 2.25-litre petrol engine and [...] chassis, with the cab positioned over the engine to give more <b>load</b> <b>space.</b> Export vehicles were the first Land-Rovers to get the 2.6-litre petrol engine. Most examples had an ENV (heavy duty) rear axle, a matching front axle came later. Tyres were large 900×16 types on deep-dish wheel rims to spread the ground weight of this heavy vehicle. These vehicles were somewhat underpowered for the increased load capacity (...) , and most had a hard working life. Less than 2,500 were made, and most had a utility body, but surviving examples often have custom bodywork. With an upgraded powertrain, they {{can be used as a}} small motorhome.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{interior}} {{changes were}} to the seating layout. Legislation from the European Union outlaws the inward-facing seats used {{in the rear of}} previous Land Rover 4x4s. The 2007 Defender replaced the four inward-facing seats with two forward-facing seats. This made the Defender 90 4x4 a four-seater vehicle (reduced from six or seven), and the Defender 110 4x4 a seven-seater (reduced from nine). This brought the Defender in line with its competitors which have generally used this layout for many years. A new bodystyle was introduced on the 110 4x4 chassis- the [...] "utility". This was a five-door 4x4 body but with the rearmost seats removed and the rear side panels left without windows, producing a five-seater vehicle with a secure, weatherproof <b>load</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{difficulties}} are inherent to rib design: {{the multiplicity of}} load cases involved and the mechanism through which the loads are transferred from neighboring components such as spars and skin panels to the rib itself. Both difficulties can be overcome or significantly alleviated by the optimization procedure devised in this paper. The basic idea is to optimize ribs against an entire <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> rather than individual load cases one at a time. The <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> must be judiciously chosen in order to encompass all possible load cases and {{to take into account}} the load transfer mechanisms and possible special features of the rib under consideration such as stress concentration points, reinforcements and cutouts. The <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> used in the present investigation is spanned by a series of piecewise linear basis functions defined on the rib boundary at selected points. Larger <b>loading</b> <b>spaces</b> can be considered by increasing the number of basis functions. This burdens the numerical procedures but ultimately renders the optimal ribs obtained more robust and less sensitive in the sense that more load cases or more load transferring mechanisms due to a variety of maneuvers will not result in buckling 2. Keywords: buckling, arbitrary shaped plates, uncertain loading In most investigations conducted in the past addressing buckling optimization of plates [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the distribution of the applied loading remains fixed and uniform during the optimization procedure such that the load magnitude is the parameter to be maximize...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is to identify, characterise and qualitatively {{evaluate}} the existing measures for increasing the utilisation of <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> in intermodal road-rail freight line trains. Normally, these trains operate like intercity passenger trains, because they make short unit load transhipment stops along rail corridors in order to travel comparatively small and short flows. The measures for <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> utilisation include adapting the train’s capacity, changing the departure times, altering the train routes and sending trucks to different terminals as well as replacing rail transport with trucks. Some of the measures require improved information sharing, and executives can strengthen the effect of the measures by adding decision support systems and price incentives to transport buyers...|$|R

2500|$|Rover {{released}} the estate body-style of the 75, called Tourer, in 2001. It {{was designed to}} offer Rover customers {{a greater degree of}} practicality while retaining the 75's sleek looks and high-class image. The tailgate is fitted with a separate opening rear screen, allowing owners to drop items into the boot, without having to lift up the whole door. Once the door is opened, however, the <b>load</b> <b>space</b> is up to 1,480mm wide and 2,060mm long. [...] With the seats up there is a competitive 400 to 680 litres of cargo space, and with the seats folded down (in a 60:40 ratio complete with centre load-through hatch) there is 1,222 litres available, making it more of a 'lifestyle' estate than all-out load lugger.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Escort {{was sold}} as a two-door saloon (with {{circular}} front headlights and rubber flooring on the [...] "De Luxe" [...] model). The [...] "Super" [...] model featured rectangular headlights, carpets, a cigar lighter and a water temperature gauge. A two-door estate was introduced {{at the end of}} March 1968 which, with the back seat folded down, provided a 40% increase in maximum <b>load</b> <b>space</b> over the old Anglia 105E estate, according to the manufacturer. The estate featured the same engine options as the saloon, but it also included a larger, [...] clutch, stiffer rear springs and in most configurations slightly larger brake drums or discs than the saloon. A panel van appeared in April 1968 and the 4-door saloon (a bodystyle the Anglia was never available in for UK market) in 1969.|$|E
