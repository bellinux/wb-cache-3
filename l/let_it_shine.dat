The new CD To Ella (recorded live and dedicated to her friend Ella Fitzgerald upon hearing of her death before walking on stage), was released in 1998 on Silverwolf Records, followed by three releases on M.C. Records in partnership with pianist/arranger/producer Seth Farber and record producer Mark Carpentieri. These included Blues Everywhere I Go, a 2000 Grammy-nominated blues/jazz band tribute album to the great lady blues singers of the 1920s and 1930s; Looking for a Home, a 2002 W.C. Handy Award-nominated band tribute to Lead Belly; and the 2007 Grammy-nominated Gonna <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> <b>Shine,</b> a live album of gospel and spiritual songs supported by Seth Farber and The Holmes Brothers. These recordings and active touring led to guest appearance on fourteen new albums by other artists between 1999 and 2006 and the re-release of 45 old Odetta albums and compilation appearances.|$|E
5000|$|Jesus then {{speaks of}} a lamp on a stand, that one does not put it under {{concealment}} but <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> <b>shine.</b> He says, [...] "For whatever is hidden {{is meant to be}} disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear," [...] (4:22-23) the last sentence being, judging from all available texts, a favorite saying of Jesus. This is also in Luke 11:33 and perhaps in Matthew 10:26-27. [...] "'Consider carefully what you hear,' he continued. 'With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.'" [...] (4:24-25) The Scholars Version translates these verses like such: [...] "...The standard you apply will be the standard applied to you, and then some. In fact, to those who have, more will be given, and from those who don't have, even what they do have will be taken away!"

50|$|Uvere {{released}} his first Christmas song “Best Night” in December 2012. Uvere {{teamed up with}} good friend, Geoff Rockwell, to produce “Best Night” when he recognized the lack of holiday rap songs. “The song captures, in my opinion, what a great night during the holidays would feel like,” said Uvere. True to form, Uvere uses the catchy song {{to shed light on}} serious issues - poverty, in this case - while keeping lyrics optimistic. Uvere raps: “Man it's feeling like that time of year/ But poverty has the/ young ones shedding some tears/ Man have no fear/ We bout to/ Pave/ bring the light/ Bout to open up/ The door <b>let</b> <b>it</b> all <b>shine</b> bright.” During its three minutes and fifty-three seconds, “Best Night” utilizes the sounds of the season, featuring bells underscoring the lyrics. Christmas rap was a risk Uvere was willing to take and it paid off.|$|R

5000|$|Stacey Anderson of Pitchfork said, [...] "Fuck" [...] {{is short}} and snappy, gone too fast in an album that could've been {{streamlined}} to <b>let</b> moments like <b>it</b> <b>shine.</b> But maybe <b>it's</b> the sound of floodgates opening." [...] Keith Harris of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Restless versatility {{is all over the}} LP, generating the emotional crests and sensory overload a festival crowd demands, but with a nuance that'll make it work even if you aren't shirtless in the desert." [...] Jonathan Wroble of Slant Magazine said, [...] "If the burden on electronic producers is to establish personality beyond a dense network of light displays and computer processing, this album gets Flume halfway there: It shows him as unquestionably human (overeager, alternately flashy and timid, sometimes more in awe than in control), but still a bit faceless." [...] The Sydney Morning Heralds Craig Mathieson gave the album a positive review, stating that [...] "the record is intoxicating and eclectic." [...] Ben Thompson of The Observer said, [...] "Distinguished guests - UK nearly siren AlunaGeorge, rapper Vince Staples--are ushered respectfully through a series of viable electronic hinterlands, where a couple of them, notably perennial cameo supplier Little Dragon and Wu Tang vet Raekwon, manage to put down roots in actual songs." ...|$|R

6000|$|For only {{an instant}} my curiosity was piqued, and then I {{replaced}} the torch in my pocket-pouch, but my fingers had not unclasped from it when there rushed to my memory the {{recollection of the}} conversation between Lakor and his companion when the lesser thern had quoted the words of Thurid and scoffed at them: [...] "And what think you of the ridiculous matter of the light?

Bear it on your shoulders and your breast; <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>shine</b> on your weapons and your standards. It will be the pledge of victory or the palm of martyrdom, and remind you, that, as your Saviour died for you, so you ought to die for Him." [...] Outcries of different kinds broke out, but all were for the holy war. Adhemar de Monteil, Bishop of Puy, a neighboring See, first asked for the Cross, and thousands pressed after him, till the numbers of Crosses failed that had been provided, and the cardinals and other principal persons tore up their robes to furnish more.|$|E
60|$|It {{had brought}} him to knowledge, to knowledge--yes, this was the beauty of his state; which came to {{resemble}} more and more that {{of a man who}} has gone to sleep on some news of a great inheritance, and then, after dreaming it away, after profaning it with matters strange to it, has waked up again to serenity of certitude and has only to lie and watch it grow. This was the drift of his patience--that he had only to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>shine</b> on him. He must moreover, with intermissions, still have been lifted and borne; since why and how else should he have known himself, later on, with the afternoon glow intenser, no longer at the foot of his stairs--situated as these now seemed at that dark other end of his tunnel--but on a deep window-bench of his high saloon, over which had been spread, couch-fashion, a mantle of soft stuff lined with grey fur that was familiar to his eyes and that one of his hands kept fondly feeling as for its pledge of truth. Mrs. Muldoon's face had gone, but the other, the second he had recognised, hung over him in a way that showed how he was still propped and pillowed. He took it all in, and the more he took it the more it seemed to suffice: he was as much at peace as if he had had food and drink. It was the two women who had found him, on Mrs. Muldoon's having plied, at her usual hour, her latch-key--and on her having above all arrived while Miss Staverton still lingered near the house. She had been turning away, all anxiety, from worrying the vain bell-handle--her calculation having been of the hour of the good woman's visit; but the latter, blessedly, had come up while she was still there, and they had entered together. He had then lain, beyond the vestibule, very much as he was lying now--quite, that is, as he appeared to have fallen, but all so wondrously without bruise or gash; only in a depth of stupor. What he most took in, however, at present, with the steadier clearance, was that Alice Staverton had for a long unspeakable moment not doubted he was dead.|$|E
