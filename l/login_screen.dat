25|$|A {{lock screen}} is a {{computer}} user interface element used by various operating systems. They regulate immediate access to a device by requiring that the user perform a certain action {{in order to receive}} access, such as entering a password, using a certain button combination, or performing a certain gesture using a device's touchscreen. While most lock functions on PC operating systems only utilize a <b>login</b> <b>screen,</b> lock screens on mobile devices often provide more functionality beyond unlocking the phone: such as notifications for emails and text messages, a date and time display, or shortcuts to certain applications.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, PayPal {{introduced}} an optional security key {{as an additional}} precaution against fraud. A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process. The account holder enters his or her login ID and password as normal, but is then prompted to enter a six-digit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holder's mobile phone. For convenience, the user may append the code generated by the hardware key {{to his or her}} password in the <b>login</b> <b>screen.</b> This way he or she is not prompted for it on another page. This method is required for some services, such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on iPhone.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{application}} spoofing is {{an attack}} where a malicious mobile application mimics the visual appearance of another one. If such an attack is successful, the integrity of what the user sees {{as well as the}} confidentiality of what she in-puts into the system can be violated by the adversary. A common example of mobile application spoofing is a phish-ing attack where the adversary tricks the user into revealing her password to a malicious application that resembles the legitimate one. In this work, we propose a novel approach for addressing mobile application spoofing attacks by leveraging the visual similarity of application screens. We use deception rate as a novel metric for measuring how many users would confuse a spoofing application for the genuine one. We conducted a large-scale online study where participants evaluated spoof-ing samples of popular mobile applications. We used the study results to design and implement a prototype spoof-ing detection system, tailored to the estimation of deception rate for mobile application <b>login</b> <b>screens.</b> 1...|$|R
5000|$|On April 7, each of {{the games}} in the Potato Sack {{received}} a second major update. Players found that by completing certain tasks in the game, they would be presented with <b>login</b> <b>screens</b> for the fictional Aperture Science corporation within the Steam interface. Other tasks and clues led to passwords {{that could be used}} to log into these Aperture Science screens. These provided players with compressed archives of pictures that consisted of Portal 2 artwork, including photographs from around Seattle (where Valve is based) embedded in their alpha channels. Each archive included a portion of a larger archive that was password-protected; the password was unveiled using the glyphs, cyphers, and letters from the first update. The larger archive gave further photographs of the Seattle area. When the locations of these points were mapped and connected per the puzzle's instructions, the map showed the word [...] "prelude". Furthermore, players that reached and logged into these screens received a potato icon for each accessed screen on their Steam profile.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedModern intrusion detection systems have become highly reliable in identifying a malicious user {{on a computer}} system. Their limitations, though, are increasing {{the need for an}} intelligent response to an intrusion. In contrast, intelligent software decoys provide autonomous software-based responses to identified intrusions. In this thesis, we explore conducting military deception, focusing on the use of software-driven simulations to respond to the actions of intruders. In particular, this thesis focuses on a model of a simple deceptive response that is intended to protect a search-type program from a buffer-overflow attack. During our study, we found that after identifying an attack attempt, simulating system saturation with processing delays worked well to deceive a prospective attacker. We also experimented with providing confusing reactions to an identified attack attempt, such as simulated network <b>login</b> <b>screens</b> and fake root-shells. The results were successful, simple reactions to intrusions that mimicked intended system interaction, and they proved to be adequate at implementing the deception principles we studied.

5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science <b>login</b> <b>screens</b> from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|R
50|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG.
