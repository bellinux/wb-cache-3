5|$|The <b>Latino</b> <b>community</b> {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both {{the media and the}} <b>Latino</b> <b>community.</b> Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E
5|$|During her childhood, Selena helped {{organizations}} such as Toys for Tots. She {{was active in the}} U.S. <b>Latino</b> <b>community,</b> visiting local schools to talk to students about the importance of education. At Fulmore Junior High School in Austin, she educated two hundred high school students about positive attitudes and setting life-goals in their adult lives. Selena urged children to stay in school, and that alcohol and drugs will lead them nowhere in life. She spent her free time helping her community. Selena performed in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the forming of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Following the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, Selena helped victims in Florida by performing at a Houston benefit concert.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the chattel {{slavery in}} the antebellum {{southern}} United States (which is predominantly non-Catholic except Louisiana, the Mobile area in Alabama, and the <b>Latino</b> <b>community),</b> where slaves were often considered less than human, the law in Latin American countries gave slaves legal rights. The Church also treated them as fully human {{with respect to the}} sacraments; for example, they could marry and even receive holy orders.|$|E
25|$|This book {{generated}} major controversy {{within the}} <b>Latino</b> <b>community</b> {{before it was}} even published because of an inflammatory article in the New York Post (Dec. 19, 2006, p.8) announcing its release.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Radio Bilingüe {{experienced}} {{a development that}} marked a major expansion for the organization: It launched Satélite Radio Bilingüe, which enabled satellite transmission of its programming throughout the United States.

40|$|Scholarship on <b>Latino</b> <b>communities</b> in the United States has yet {{to catch}} up with the rapid growth of this ethnic {{population}} in the country. Understanding the Latino urban experience and developing plans to better respond to both the needs of <b>Latino</b> <b>communities</b> and their integration within society is not only relevant, but also urgently necessary. Using the city of Los Angeles as a main lens, in addition to a general look at the urban Southwest, we contribute to the scholarship on the subject with a review of literature on <b>Latino</b> <b>communities.</b> We structure the review as an assessment of the various challenges and opportunities for urban Latinos in the pre-war, postwar, and contemporary city. Focusing on space, culture, economy, and governance, we chart the various roles both the private and public sectors play in meeting these challenges. Our reading of the literature shows that particular government actions in the economic and governance domains in the past had positive impacts on Latino integration, and we call for a similar effort today in addressing contemporary challenges. We conclude by suggesting that future planning scholarship on <b>Latino</b> <b>communities</b> engage the wider urban studies literature, focus on emerging forms of urbanization, and call on planners to sustain increased academic and practical interest in the topic...|$|R

25|$|The Day of the Dead {{has taken}} a {{political}} bent when used to mourn those who have died from the political violence.

25|$|Blackface {{performances}} are not unusual within the <b>Latino</b> <b>community.</b> A minstrel tradition exists {{throughout most of}} Latin America and Spain, and it has traveled to the United States. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational blackgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. A {{case in point is}} the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.|$|E

South Oklahoma City is generally more blue collar working class and significantly more industrial, having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants {{at the turn of}} the century, and is the center of the city's rapidly growing <b>Latino</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to a 2014 {{study by}} the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced {{religion}} in Los Angeles (65%). Perhaps owing to the fact of its founding by Franciscan friars of Roman Catholicism, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles leads the largest archdiocese in the country. Cardinal Roger Mahony oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in downtown Los Angeles. Construction of the cathedral marked a coming of age of the city's Catholic, heavily <b>Latino</b> <b>community.</b> There are numerous Catholic churches and parishes throughout Los Angeles.|$|E
