5000|$|In {{a survey}} of {{available}} literature, only a few publications relevant to the chemical composition of Thymus pannonicus were found, suggesting that a substantial dearth of information in this field still exists. According to Karuza-Stojaković et al., the principal constituents of T. pannonicus essential oil from southern parts of Vojvodina province (northern Serbia) were terpinyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, thymol, carvacrol and geranyl acetate (listed in order of descending quantity). Recent comprehensive studies of chemical variability in hydrodistilled essential oils of different wild growing and cultivated populations of T. pannonicus from Hungary, as well as supercritical fluid extracts of various Lamiaceae species, confirmed that high concentrations of both thymol and p-cymene are the main chemosystematic attributes of T. pannonicus essential oil,. Further research efforts of Pluhár Zs. et al. on the volatile oil composition of T. pannonicus from nineteen different localities of Hungary, confirmed a significant essential oil polymorphism in this plant species, as twelve different chemovarieties were determined, namely: thymol, thymol/p-cymene, thymol/p-cymene/γ-terpinene, thymol/p-cymene/neral, thymol/p-cymene/γ-terpinene/β-bisabolene, thymol/p-cymene/isoborneol/γ-terpinene, thymol/linalyl acetate/γ-terpinene/α-cubebene, p-cymene/geraniol/linalyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>linalyl</b> acetate/geranyl <b>acetate,</b> germacrene-D/β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide/α-cubebene/linalool, and germacrene-D/β-caryophyllene/farnesol.|$|R
40|$|In moths, the {{components}} of the female pheromone blend are detected in the male antennae by pheromone olfactory receptor neurons (Ph-ORNs) expressing narrowly tuned olfactory receptors. Responses to sex pheromones have generally been thought to be independent from the odorant background. However, interactions between pheromone components and plant volatiles have been reported at behavioral and detection levels. To document the mechanisms of such interactions, we analyzed Ph-ORN responses of Spodoptera littoralis to the main pheromone component, Z 9 E 11 - 14 :Ac, in the presence of 4 monoterpenes. To mimic natural contexts in which plant odors and pheromone emanate from different sources, the 2 stimuli were presented with different temporal patterns and from independent sources. Linalool reversibly reduced the firing response to Z 9 E 11 - 14 :Ac and produced an off effect. Geraniol and geranyl and <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetates</b> reduced the responses to Z 9 E 11 - 14 :Ac with a longer time course. Pulses of linalool over prolonged pheromone stimulation resulted in a discontinuous firing activity. Pulses of pheromone were better separated over a background of linalool, compared with odorless air. The data confirm that plant compounds may modulate the intensity and the temporal coding by Ph-ORNs of pheromone information. This modulation might positively affect mate location at high pheromone density especially nearby a pheromone source.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused in the {{identification}} and improvement of lipases for biotechnological application. The importance of lipases is increasing in several industries. However, the commercial use of lipases is still a drawback in {{the economics of the}} lipase-based industrial applications. There are many tools for improving and adapting the enzyme properties to the desired requirements of a process that could lead lipase catalysis through a cost-effective process. In this context, the main objective of this work was: “To characterize, express and to improve novel bacterial lipases for sustainable industrial processes”. The first activity done was to explore and to characterize a new esterase from P. barcinonensis. It was isolate from P. barcinonensis the gene corresponding to Est 23, and its cloning in a proper vector to perform expression and purification for biochemical characterization. Est 23 showed preference for mid-chain substrates and having maximum activity at 37 °C and pH 7. It also includes in silico analysis of the 3 D model structure and phylogeny. Moreover, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to assign Est 23 to one of the bacterial hydrolase families described by Arpingy and Jaeger. Est 23 could not be assigned to any bacterial hydrolases described till that moment, suggesting that Est 23 could be part of a new group of bacterial lipases. Because Est 23 displays a GGG(A) X-type putative oxyanion hole, widely described as a motif involved in tertiary alcohol resolution, the ability of Est 23 for conversion and resolution of tertiary alcohols was evaluated. However, no conversion was detected using the esters <b>linalyl</b> and terpinyl <b>acetate</b> alcohols as substrates. To improve LipR activity by protein engineering LipR was then desired. LipR was isolated from Rhodococcus sp. strain CR- 53 in a previous and showed an unusual fungal-like oxyanion-hole never found among bacterial lipases, close to the Y-type oxyanion hole described for Candida antartica lipase A (CalA), a lipase widely used in industry. In order to improve LipR activity on long-chain substrates, several enzyme-engineering approaches were done to change the amino acids constituting the rare oxyanion hole of LipR for further industrial application. These mutations also allowed studying the role of the amino acids forming the oxyanion hole of LipR. Hydrolytic activity over short, mid and long- chain substrates was assayed with the variants obtained. The LipR variant Asp 111 Gly produced a change on the chain- length- substrate preference of LipR, displaying a 5. 6 fold increase of activity on muf-oleate. This improvement of activity on longer chain length substrates makes of this LipR variant a very attractive candidate for testing activity on biodiesel synthesis, a process requiring activity on long-chain substrates. Nevertheless, LipR and LipR_YGS variant need a clear expression enhancement in order to apply them to transesterification reactions using oily feedstocks. The stabilization Pseudomonas lipases LipA, LipC and LipCmut was improved by immobilization in order to applied these enzymes in transesterification reactions. Therefore, a fast and economic immobilization procedure by adsorption was set up. Finally, the three immobilized lipase preparations and a commercial lipase were used to test alternative feedstocks for triglyceride transesterification. A total of four oils were tested: commercial triolein, degummed soybean oil, waste cooking oil, and Mucor circinelloides oil. Moreover, the characterization of the tested raw materials in terms of FFAs, tri, di and monoglyceride contents measure was also of interest. In a global analysis, a good increase of FAMEs percent was obtained with LipA, LipC and LipCmut immobilized on Accurel MP 1000. But better results were achieved when the reactions were catalyzed by Novozym® 435 commercial enzyme. Esta tesis se centra en la identificación y mejora de lipasas para aplicaciones biotecnológicas. El objetivo principal de este trabajo fue: "Caracterizar, expresar y mejorar las nuevas lipasas bacterianas para procesos industriales sostenibles". La primera actividad realizada fue explorar y caracterizar una nueva esterasa, Est 23, de P. barcinonensis. Se aisló de P. barcinonensis el gen correspondiente a Est 23 y su clonación en un vector adecuado para realizar la expresión y purificación para caracterización bioquímica. Además, se construyó un árbol filogenético para asignar Est 23 a una de las familias de hidrolasas bacterianas descritas por Arpingy y Jaeger, y debido a que Est 23 tiene un oxyanion-hole de tipo GGG (A) X, ampliamente descrito como motivo implicado en la resolución del alcohol terciario, se evaluó la capacidad de Est 23 en dichas reacciones. Luego se buscó mejorar la actividad sobre sustratos de cadena larga de la lipasa LipR de Rhodococcus sp. por ingeniería de proteínas. Diferentes enfoques de ingeniería enzimática se realizaron para cambiar los aminoácidos que forman parte del atípico oxyanion-hole de LipR. Estas mutaciones también permitieron estudiar el papel de los aminoácidos que forman este motivo. La actividad hidrolítica de las variantes obtenidas fue ensayada sobre sustratos de cadena corta, media y larga. La variante LipR Asp 111 Gly produjo un cambio en la preferencia de LipR de longitud de cadena. Sin embargo, LipR y LipR_YGS necesitan un aumento de expresión para aplicarlos a reacciones de transesterificación. La estabilización de tres lipasas de Pseudomonas, LipA, LipC y LipCmut, se mejoró por inmovilización con el fin de aplicar estas enzimas en las reacciones de transesterificación. Por lo tanto, se estableció un procedimiento de inmovilización por adsorción rápido y económico. Finalmente, se usaron las tres lipasa inmovilizadas y una lipasa comercial para probar materias primas alternativas para la transesterificación de triglicéridos. Se probaron un total de cuatro aceites: trioleína comercial, aceite de soja desgomado, aceite de cocina de desecho y aceite de Mucor circinelloides. Además se realizó la caracterización de las materias primas ensayadas en términos de la medida de los ácidos grasos, tri, di y monoglicéridos...|$|R

In this work, we evaluated individually the anti-inflammatory properties of (–) linalool, that is, the natural occurring enantiomer, and its racemate form, present in various amounts in distilled or extracted essential oils. Because in the linalool-containing essential oils, <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> is frequently present, we also examined the anti-inflammatory action of this monoterpene ester. Carrageenin-induced edema in rats {{was used as a}} model of inflammation. The experimental data indicate that both the pure enantiomer and its racemate induced, after systemic administration, a reduction of edema. Moreover, the pure enantiomer, at a dose of 25 mg/kg, elicited a delayed and more prolonged effect, while the racemate form induced a significant reduction of the edema only one hour after carrageenin administration. At higher doses, no differences were observed between the (–) enantiomer and the racemate; a further increase in the dose of both forms did not result in an increased effect at any time of observation. The effects of equi-molar doses of <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> on local edema were less relevant and more delayed than that of the corresponding alcohol. These finding suggest a typical pro-drug behavior of <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> The results obtained indicate that linalool and the corresponding acetate {{play a major role in}} the anti-inflammatory activity displayed by the essential oils containing them, and provide further evidence suggesting that linalool and linalyl acetate-producing species are potentially anti-inflammatory agents...|$|E

In particular the bergamot essential oil {{is described as a}} mixture of four components: limonene,linalool, <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and beta-caryophyllene. In the models regression parameters are calculated fromdata of binary subsystems, CO 2 – limonene, CO 2 – linalool and CO 2 -beta-caryophyllene, and CO 2 – linalylacetate. Therefore both of the models are predictive with regard to the bergamot oil and show quite agood agreement (especially the Peng Robinson one) with respect to the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-temperature}} antioxidative {{activity of}} some plant sterols {{has been noted}} by several research groups and later was attributed to an ethylidene structure present on the effective sterols. <b>Linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (LA, a monoterpene alcohol that contains the ethylidene group) when present {{at a level of}} 0. 04 % and undecylenic acid (contains a terminal secondary double bond system) at a level of 0. 5 to 2. 0 % reduced triglyceride oxidation in soybean oils heated at 180 C for up to 70 hr. There was a slight effect when LA was present at 0. 02 %. The high-temperature antioxidant activity of this compound with the ethylidene structure but without a sterol moiety strengthens the theory that the ethylidene group is responsible for the antioxidative activity;Lipid materials other than triglycerides also undergo oxidation. Among them, the oxidation of cholesterol results in some oxidation products, some of which {{have been shown to be}} cytotoxic and angiotoxic in animals and that are linked to causes of human atherosclerosis. In this study, the oxidation of cholesterol was monitored in lards heated at 180 C for 10 hr/day up to 240 hr. A method for identifying and quantifying the commonly found cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) was evaluated and modified for use in the experiments. Cholesterol and six other COPs were resolved, identified and quantified by slightly modifying a recently published method for measuring COPs;Finally, the effects of <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and polydimethyl siloxane (MS) on cholesterol and triglyceride oxidation were examined in lard with two levels of added cholesterol, heated at 180 C intermittently for up to 240 hr. The percentage retention of cholesterol and the formation of six COPs were followed over the heating period, with and without the added LA and MS. In addition, the percentage retention of fatty acids was monitored. There was little effect of <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> on cholesterol oxidation and only slight protection of linoleic acid. The MS at 1. 0 ppm protected lard containing two times the original amount of cholesterol, resulting in higher cholesterol, linoleate and linolenate retention. Recent reports on <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and radical-trapping antioxidants were summarized to help explain the action of these compounds as antioxidants...|$|E

The biovariability of Citrus bergamia grown wild in Calabria (Italy) was investigated {{as far as}} chemical markers (linalool, <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and bergapten) content and antioxidant and antifungal activities of the methanolic extracts. The average content in the markers presents slight variations with the altitude and more evident changes with the latitude of the areas of plant collection...|$|E
40|$|Bergamot (Citrus bergamia, Risso et Poiteau) {{cultivation}} {{started in}} Italy {{at the beginning}} of the 18 th century. Italian bergamot production is limited in a narrow strip of the Calabrian coast, along the Ionian and the Thyrrenian seas. Bergamot is cultivated for the essential oil representing an important raw material for cosmetic and food industry. Among non-volatile fraction components of the bergamot essential oil there are coumarins, whose fluorescence was widely investigated in the past. Because of their structural diversity and diverse occurrence, these oxygenated heterocyclic compounds have an important role in the identification of the quality and genuineness of the bergamot essential oil. This review reports spectrofluorometric properties of bergamot essential oil. From excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis of bergamot essential oil solutions in ethanol characteristic emissions of citropten, <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and that of chlorophills have been detected. One citropten emission has been used in quantitative determination while none of <b>linalyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Quantitative fluorometric determination of citropten gives the sum of both citropten and 7 -methoxy- 5 -geranyloxy-coumarin concentration...|$|E
