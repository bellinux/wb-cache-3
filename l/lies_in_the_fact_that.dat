5|$|Dundee United's {{traditional}} rivals are Dundee, {{with whom}} they compete in the Dundee derby. The fixture was lacking a competitive element {{for a number of}} years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both clubs' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.|$|E
5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|No {{small part}} of Furness's {{historical}} significance <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the young Louis Sullivan picked this office - then known as Furness & Hewitt - to work in {{for a short period}} after he left Ware's School in Boston. As Sullivan's Autobiography of an Idea testifies, the vitality and originality of Furness meant more to him than what he was taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or later at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E

25|$|The {{modified}} Thompson Tau test is {{a method}} used {{to determine if a}}n outlier exists in a data set. The strength of this method <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it takes into account a data set’s standard deviation, average and provides a statistically determined rejection zone; thus providing an objective method to determine if a data point is an outlier. Note: Although intuitively appealing, this method appears to be unpublished (it is not described in Thompson (1985)) and one should use it with caution.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefit of}} alpha–beta pruning <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{branches}} of the search tree can be eliminated. This way, the search time can {{be limited to the}} 'more promising' subtree, and a deeper search can be performed in the same time. Like its predecessor, it belongs to the branch and bound class of algorithms. The optimization reduces the effective depth to slightly more than half that of simple minimax if the nodes are evaluated in an optimal or near optimal order (best choice for side on move ordered first at each node).|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} stages of discovery, the {{archaeologist}} Giuseppe Atzori insistently pointed out to the authorities the failure to fence the site. Actually at the Center for Restoration and Conservation of Li Punti (Sassari) most of the sculptures are without head and the cause <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the site was unattended and was plundered for a long time. The looting was focused on the best parts of the sculptures, principally the head with the enigmatic eyes. Only later the area was purchased and excavation campaigns began.|$|E

25|$|Another {{apparent}} contradiction <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{the group}} velocity in anomalously dispersive media {{is higher than}} the speed of light. This was investigated by Arnold Sommerfeld (1907, 1914) and Léon Brillouin (1914). They {{came to the conclusion that}} in such cases the signal velocity is not equal to the group velocity, but to the front velocity which is never faster than the speed of light. Similarly, it is also argued that the apparent superluminal effects discovered by Günter Nimtz can be explained by a thorough consideration of the velocities involved.|$|E
25|$|Malfatti's {{importance}} <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she was {{the groundbreaking}} Brazilian painter, and furthermore an upper-class woman, who was exposed to global art's tendencies and {{who was able to}} bring these tendencies back to her Brazilian roots. In her search for her own artistic identity and her influence influenced by Modernist movements in Europe and America, her paintings accurately reflected the transformative twentieth century ideals. Although her art is never seen to transcend her initial breakthrough, that first impact was enough to impart a lasting legacy upon other Brazilian modernist painters as well as to herself.|$|E
25|$|Triangular {{movement}}: This is {{a movement}} tactic that allows a safe and quick shifting of the offensive flanks while maintaining control of the ball. In a triangular play the ball is passed between three players to form a triangle. The triangle is then shifted to a different position when a new player is added. Many triangles can be created with various combinations of players {{with the intention of}} slowly moving the ball forward and never really compromising possession. This tactic works well when trying to gain control in the midfield. However, it can also be used for pure attacking purposes. The effectiveness of this tactic <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> defenders are unable to quickly 'adapt' to the other attacker's style of play.|$|E

25|$|The Bagmati River which {{flows through}} Kathmandu is {{considered}} a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists, and many Hindu temples are {{on the banks of}} this river. The importance of the Bagmati also <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.|$|E
25|$|The MRHA, the Sedition Act, section 298A of the Penal Code and the ISA {{all share}} an {{underlying}} objective: to maintain public order. The greatest {{disparity between the}} MRHA and the other pieces of legislation <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the former provides for a much more benign resolution of issues. One commentator has said that {{there seems to be}} no apparent purpose for having a wide array of outcomes to choose from when dealing with the same mischief – religious disharmony. On the other hand, it might be argued that given a highly sensitive topic like religion, which incites deep feelings, an arsenal of options is vital so that an outcome best suiting the scenario can be tailored. Nevertheless, the MRHA, despite having the least severe consequences, has not yet been invoked.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E
50|$|The National Historic Landmark Iyatayet Site {{is located}} on the {{northwest}} shore of Cape Denbigh on Norton Bay.

Remnants of artifacts found here have further added to the relationship that existed with the cultures of the Paleolithic and Mesolithic ages.|$|R
50|$|To sum up, {{subjectivity}} {{becomes an}} important factor in evaluating a predisposition.

25|$|The English {{had little}} success in {{converting}} either the native elite or the Irish {{people to the}} Protestant religion. It is an enduring question, why the Protestant reformation failed to take hold amongst the Irish (amongst many) <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> brutal methods were used by crown authority to pacify the country and exploit its resources, which heightened resentment of English rule. An additional reason was a determined proselytising campaign carried out in Ireland by counter-reformation Catholic clergy, {{many of whom had}} been educated in seminaries on the continent. Irish Colleges had been established in many countries in Catholic Europe for the training of Irish Catholic priests and the education of the Irish Catholic gentry. Finally, the printing press, which had {{played a major role in}} disseminating Protestant ideas in Europe, came to Ireland very late.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The answer <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the investors {{do not have to}} invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take {{the rest of the year}} off investing.|$|E
25|$|Haughfoot was a hamlet, {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} a staging post for horses and carriages, in the Scottish Borders {{near the village}} of Stow. It was in this unlikely location that a Lodge was founded in 1702 by men who were mainly local landowners. The significance of this Lodge <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> none of its members were stonemasons, confirming that modern Freemasonry was fully evolved in Scotland before the appearance of centralised authority in the form of Grand Lodges. The Minute Book of the Lodge, which is extant, commences in 1702 and inside the front covers is the part which is identical to the last portion of the Edinburgh Register House and Airlie MSS. Although not complete (the missing part was almost certainly removed for reasons of secrecy) the Haughfoot fragment is sufficient to confirm that it was very likely to have been identical to the two previously mentioned MSS. The 'fragment' was probably retained because the Minute of the first meeting of the Lodge commences immediately after this portion of ritual on the same page.|$|E
