50|$|Market {{consolidation}} {{and expansion}} has permitted service providers to offer faster and <b>less</b> <b>expensives</b> services with typical speeds {{of up to}} 24 Mbit/s downstream (subject to ISP and line length). They can offer products at sometimes considerably lower prices, due to not necessarily having {{to conform to the}} same regulatory requirements as BT Wholesale: for example, 8 unbundled LLU pairs can deliver 10 Mbit/s over 3775 meters for half the price of a similar Fibre connection.|$|R

5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly more expensive than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power.

5|$|With {{the release}} of the Sega Saturn slated for 1995, Sega began to develop a stop-gap {{solution}} that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the Saturn, and would serve as a <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> entry into the 32-bit era.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} occurred among US naval planners in {{the early}} years of the 20th century over whether to have technically superior ships or many <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> ones, with President Theodore Roosevelt among those supporting the former and Admiral of the Navy George Dewey along with Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan supporting the latter approach.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2011 review, {{there have}} been few studies on the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well as rare but life-threatening allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} low-cost aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study shifted the focus from the F-5 to the <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E
5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} to be used in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E
25|$|The second method allows {{at least}} one {{mismatch}} between the two k-mer words.

He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as {{the water from the}} Grail washes it away.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 the Royal Navy {{commissioned}} six {{light aircraft}} carriers {{in an effort}} to counter the German and Japanese navies. The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized fleet aircraft carriers and the <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> but limited-capability escort carriers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, and so he turned to <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> vessels to {{modernize}} the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to the same basic design.|$|E

50|$|In models using large corpora and a {{high number}} of dimensions, the skip-gram model yields the highest overall accuracy, and {{consistently}} produces the highest accuracy on semantic relationships, as well as yielding the highest syntactic accuracy in most cases.

5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It glows reddish-orange in {{a vacuum}} {{discharge}} tube. Also, neon has the narrowest liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45°C to −245.95°C, or −415.21°F to −410.71°F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> refrigerant than helium.|$|E
5|$|Reed {{designed}} the first ship (HMVS Cerberus) {{at the request}} of the Colony of Victoria; the India Office then ordered another of the same design (HMS Magdala) as well as a <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> version (HMS Abyssinia). The four Cyclops-class ships, enlarged versions of Cerberus, were ordered in 1870 for local defence of English ports.|$|E
5|$|Several design {{proposals}} were submitted, all calling for heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, financial limitations dictated that smaller, <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> weaponry {{would be used}} instead. The final design therefore used the same 28cm(11in) double turret introduced {{for the last two}} s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E
50|$|UOWHFs {{are thought}} to be <b>less</b> {{computationally}} <b>expensive</b> than CRHFs, and are most often used for efficiency purposes in schemes where the choice of the hash function happens at some stage of execution, rather than beforehand.

5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|The {{upgraded}} intersection {{had been}} a part of the City of Marquette's master plan since 2003. MDOT engineers touted the constant-flowing nature of the design as a benefit to the new intersection, and city planners promoted the enhanced safety aspects of the project. Both parties stated the planned intersection was <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than a conventional stop light.|$|E

This superconductor is notable because the operating superconductivity temperature is above liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77.1K). Since liquid nitrogen is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than the liquid helium required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications would be less.|$|E
