5|$|In February 1989 {{one hundred}} {{construction}} workers were assembling temporary housing {{for themselves in}} Leninakan {{with a plan to}} start on the local population's housing {{by the end of the}} month, though schools and factories were also on the list of facilities to be rebuilt. Deputy chairman of a city building and architecture council said that updated building codes <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States were being drafted (along with a strict requirement that the new protocols be respected) and that the new buildings would be no taller than four stories and would be located away from areas with the highest seismic risk. Other officials decided that the town would be relocated several miles to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> police force, many in {{the medical}} {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E

25|$|The {{meaning of}} antifeminism has varied {{across time and}} cultures, and antifeminism attracts both men and women. Some women, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Women's National Anti-Suffrage League, campaigned against women's suffrage. Emma Goldman, for example, was widely {{considered}} antifeminist during her fight against suffragism in the US. Decades later, however, she was heralded as a founder of anarcha-feminism.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the team}} {{noticed that the}} system would often create false echoes during heavy rainstorms, and the {{potential}} for using this as a weather system was immediately seen. However, they were sure that shorter wavelengths <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X band being experimented with would have a greater interaction, and this was not considered further at the time.|$|E
25|$|Other motifs {{were drawn}} from {{contemporary}} life, sometimes with allegorical meaning, some sometimes purely decorative. Incidents important to a particular family might be recorded <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Camera degli Sposi that Mantegna painted for the Gonzaga family at Mantua. Increasingly, still lifes and decorative scenes from life were painted, such as the Concert by Lorenzo Costa of about 1490.|$|E
25|$|The basilican nave is wide, {{with narrow}} aisles. On each side, {{monolithic}} columns of grey oriental granite (except one, {{which is of}} cipolin marble) support eight pointed arches much stilted. The capitals of these (mainly Corinthian) are also of the classical period. There is no triforium, but a high clerestory with wide two-light windows, with simple tracery <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nave-aisles and throughout the church, which give sufficient light.|$|E

25|$|In 1850 {{more than}} half of the Irish were unskilled laborers. A large portion of the Saint Paul Police Department have been Irish since the 1850s. The Irish in Saint Paul, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern United States participated heavily in politics. Many sought {{government}} jobs such as policemen, due to the job security. As a result, the Irish's particularly visible role prompted complaints and allegations from other ethnic groups such as the Germans who wanted more representation.|$|E
25|$|The early JNF {{was active}} in {{afforestation}} and reclamation of land. By 1935, JNF had planted 1.7 million trees over a total area of 1,750 acres (7.08km²) and drained swamps, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hula Valley. Over fifty years, the JNF planted over 260 million trees largely in semi-arid, rocky, hilly terrain in which cultivation is not cost-effective {{and the risk of}} land degradation is high. While the Ministry of Agriculture is the official regulator of Israel's forests, the JNF is responsible for the implementation of forest management and afforestation.|$|E
25|$|BPD {{has evolved}} its crime {{fighting}} technology and techniques over the years, {{beginning with the}} introduction of call boxes in 1885. Other major technological upgrades include the introduction of the Bertillion system in 1896, police radio communications in 1933, a police laboratory in 1950, computerized booking procedures and 911 emergency systems in 1985, the first ever 311 non-emergency system and CCTV cameras (<b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom) in 1996, and the CitiStat system in 2000. The latter enables the police to concentrate its resources on areas with particular types or high rates of crime.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rotation}} matrix can {{be recovered}} using gradient methods <b>likes</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SIFT descriptor. As discussed with the Harris detector, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment matrix, [...] characterize the curvature {{and shape of}} the pixel intensities. That is, the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue indicates the direction of largest change and the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue defines the direction of least change. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2D case, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues define an ellipse. For an isotropic region, the region should be circular in shape and not elliptical. This is the case when the eigenvalues have the same magnitude. Thus a measure of the isotropy around a local region is defined as the following: ...|$|R
25|$|Symbolism {{continued}} to have a hold {{on the minds of}} Anglo-Saxon people into the Christian eras. The interiors of churches would have glowed with colour, and the walls of the halls were painted with decorative scenes from the imagination telling stories of monsters and heroes <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poem Beowulf. Although nothing much is left of the wall paintings, evidence of their pictorial art is found in Bibles and Psalters, in illuminated manuscripts. The poem, 'The Dream of the Rood', is an example how symbolism of trees was fused into Christian symbolism.|$|E
25|$|Novoecijano {{architecture}} {{is based on}} indigenous Filipino types, Spanish colonial types, American colonial types, and modernist types. In rural areas, the bahay kubo is still present, but has decreased significantly. Spanish and American colonial architecture, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Capital Region, have slowly been demolished one after the other, signaling a destruction of colonial heritage. Despite this, there are still colonial structures preserved and conserved such as town churches and some houses surrounding them. The current architectural trend in the province is moernist architecture, signaling an end to colonial architecture in the province.|$|E
