40|$|During {{the years}} 1984 – 1987 Lake Victoria in East Africa {{experienced}} what {{is probably the}} largest mass extinction of contemporary vertebrates. Within a decade about 200 endemic species of haplochromine cichlids disappeared. The extinctions {{that occurred in the}} 1980 s have been documented predominantly on species of offshore and sub-littoral waters in the Mwanza Gulf of southern Lake Victoria. Although the <b>littoral</b> <b>fauna</b> of southern Lake Victoria had not been examined in detail, their diversity seemed less affected by the changes in the ecosystem. We give results of the first comprehensive inventory of the littoral cichlid fauna in southern Lake Victoria and discuss its conservation status. We also report on new developments in the sub-littoral fauna after 1990. More than 50 littoral and 15 sub-littoral stations were sampled between the years 1991 to 1995. Of the littoral stations, 34 were sampled for the first time. One hundred sixty three species of haplochromines were collected. Of these, 102 species were previously unknown. About two thirds of them live in rocky areas that were sampled for the first time. Littoral rocky habitats harbored the highest diversity. Since 1990, however, 13 more species disappeared from established sampling stations in littoral habitats. Fishing practices, spreading of exotic fishes, water hyacinth, and eutrophication are considered important threats to the <b>littoral</b> <b>fauna.</b> Also in the upper sub-littoral the number of species declined further. On deeper sub-littoral mud bottoms individual and species numbers increased again, although they are nowhere close to those found before the Nile perch (Lates niloticus) upsurge.

Thermal constraints on the oxygen supply system in E. verrucosus, E. cyaneus and G. lacustris may shape the upper temperature limits to the thermal habitats of the species, {{in line with the}} theories of allometry of thermal tolerance and systemic to molecular hierarchy of thermal tolerance. Lethal concentrations of Cd were much lower for E. cyaneus and G. lacustris than for E. verrucosus. However, E. verrucosus showed metabolic depression when exposed to Cd concentrations far below lethal ones.

40|$|The Hydrachnidia are not {{the only}} aquatic mites, but they are the most {{successful}} group of mites found in freshwater. The mites form a considerable part of the lasiophil fauna. They inhabit al-most every aquatic habitat, and densities frequently exceed 200 mites/sq. metre. Water mites are frequently brightly coloured and sometimes relatively large (over 2 mm), making them more conspicuous than other aquatic mites, and thus exaggerating their already significant predomi-nance. However, there is in fact a tendency for all the species recorded from the lasion to be small; 49 percent are under 1 mm long, whereas in the <b>littoral</b> <b>fauna</b> as a whole only 29 percent are as small as this. Many water mites exhibit bright colour patterns, containing greens, blues, oranges or reds. Red predominates among species in the “primitive ” Hydrovolzioidea, Hydrachnoidea, Eylaoidea, and Hydryphantoidea, and often the term the red water mites is used to denote this ancestral stem. Fish and invertebrates will eat water mites, but the brightly coloured species are apparently dis-tasteful and predators learn to reject them.

A total of 3, 426 starfish were sampled in different habitats around the Falkland Islands at low tide using SCUBA diving. Sampling included measuring arm length, presence/absence of brooding and feeding; the prey was identified to the lowest taxa and measured if condition permitted. In a total of 48 broods, eggs were counted and embryonic stage assigned. This medium-sized species attains an arm length of 96 mm (85. 4 g). The size increased with depth and starfish carry out seasonal bathymetric migrations with smaller animals (10 m depth in winter. Egg laying occurs between March and July, and juvenile dispersal—mostly in October–November. Fecundity (52 – 363 eggs) and egg/offspring size increase with maternal size. Juvenile starfish are of ca. 2 mm arm length and grow to 9 – 11 mm in 1 year. Feeding intensity is at a maximum {{before and after the}} reproductive period.

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{location of the}} Azores, midway between Europe and America, poses problems relative to their colonization and the biogeographic affinity of the biota presently living there. In {{the way of the}} Gulf Stream, originating off American shores, the Azorean biota, marine and terrestrial alike is predominantly European. To explain this distributional paradigm the present study investigates the Neogene fossil record of Santa Maria, Azores in order to establish the biogeographical relationships of the Pleistocene to Recent <b>littoral</b> molluscan <b>fauna</b> of this archipelago. The bulk of the Azorean malacofauna, both in the Pleistocene (71. 3 %) and in Recent times (75. 6 %) is biogeographically related with the eastern Atlantic, and that the Pleistocene (Eemian) fossil fauna is basically the same as the Recent fauna, with a few losses of tropical species and of shallow water bivalves associated to fine sand substrates. It is hypothesized that during Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, short-duration events have occurred during which short-lived oceanic currents must have been established, especially during or shortly after glacial terminations. During these short-term events, the arrival of species to the Azores may have been increased and facilitated by temporary sea-surface currents that no longer exist now. Probable routes of dispersal to the archipelago of the Azores are also discussed, as well as the possible influence of the Pleistocene glaciations in the shallow water marine molluscs of these islands...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the {{response}} of lacustrine littoral chironomid communities to late glacial changes in limnological, environmental and climate conditions in the Mediterranean context. Late glacial chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages, organic petrography and geochemistry were analysed in a sediment core from the littoral zone of Lago dell'Accesa (Tuscany, Italy), where the lake-level fluctuations and the vegetation history have been previously reconstructed. Comparison of the chironomid stratigraphy to other proxies (pollen assemblages, organic petrography and geochemistry, lake-level) and regional climate reconstruction suggested the predominant influence of lake-level changes on the <b>littoral</b> chironomid <b>fauna.</b> The main lowering events {{that occurred during the}} Oldest and the Younger Dryas were followed by higher proportions of taxa typical of littoral habitats. A complementary study of organic matter suggested the indirect impact of lake-level on the chironomids through changes in humic status and habitat characteristics, such as the type of substrate and aquatic macrophyte development. Several chironomid taxa, such as Glyptotendipes, Microtendipes and Cricotopus type patens, were identified as possible indicators of low lake-level in the late glacial records. Nevertheless, this study suggested that parallel analyses of organic matter and chironomid assemblages may be needed to circumvent misinterpretation of littoral chironomid assemblage stratigraphy. There was a weak response of the chironomid assemblages to small lake-level lowerings that corresponded to the Older Dryas and Preboreal oscillations. A higher level of determination, e. g. to the species group level, may be necessary to increase the sensibility of the indicators to lake-level changes...|$|R

The sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Island group, {{consisting}} of Marion Island and Prince Edward Island (Fig. 1), was annexed by South Africa in 1947 - 1948 and subsequently declared a nature reserve. Isolated oceanic islands have always presented interesting opportunities for biological research {{on both the}} marine mammals and birds which use them for breeding purposes and the resident, often specially adapted, fauna and flora which colonise them. The ice-capped, windy and wet Marion and Prince Edward Islands are young volcanic islands, less than 300000 years old, and house a considerably less diverse biota than the much older Crozet and Kerguelen sub-Antarctic Archipelagos (Van Zinderen Bakker, 1971).

Moreover, the sandy beach of Sarso Island (Farasan Archipelago) is bordered landwards and underneath by solid limestone, preventing subsoil fresh water, if there is any, from penetrating into the beach region. The salinity of the interstitial water from Sarso beach lies a little above the salinity of the adjacent sea. The microfauna of Sarso beach is composed to a rather big proportion of such species that are known to be characteristical littoral subsoil water species, partially of world wide distribution. The ecological analysis of this fauna, i. e. the freeliving Nematodes, reveals the presence of two distinct associations: 1. the association of the low level subsoil region, close to the sea, with clear interstitial water, subject to regular exchange with the water of the adjcent sea. 2. the association of the high level subsoil region, 4 - 10 meter distant from the sea, with brownish water. Contrary to earlier results there is no distinction in salinity between the two associations, so it is not longer justified to apply the term brackish water fauna on the animals living in the association of the high level subsoil region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough sponges are {{important}} components of benthic ecosystems of the Caribbean Sea, their diversity remained poorly investigated in the Lesser Antilles. By organizing a training course in Martinique, we wanted both to promote taxonomy {{and to provide}} a first inventory of the sponge diversity on this island. The course was like a naturalist expedition, with a field laboratory and a classroom nearby. Early-career scientists and environmental managers were trained in sponge taxonomy. We gathered unpublished data and conducted an inventory at 13 coastal sites. We explored only shallow water habitats (0 - 30 m), such as mangroves, reefs or rocky bottoms and underwater caves. According to this study, the sponge fauna of Martinique is currently represented by a minimum of 191 species, 134 of which we could assign species names. One third of the remaining non-identified sponge species we consider to be new to science. Martinique appears very remarkable because of its <b>littoral</b> marine <b>fauna</b> harboring sponge aggregations with high biomass and species diversity dominating over coral species. In mangroves, sponges cover about 10 % of the surface of subtidal roots. Several submarine caves are true reservoirs of hidden and insufficiently described sponge diversity. Thanks to this new collaborative effort, the Eastern Caribbean has gained a significant increase of knowledge, with sponge diversity of this area potentially representing 40 % of the total in the Caribbean Sea. We thus demonstrated the importance of developing exploratory and educational research in areas historically devoid of biodiversity inventories and systematics studies. Finally, we believe in the necessity to consider not only the number of species but their distribution in space to evaluate their putative contribution to ecosystem services and our willingness to preserve them...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described here}} was performed during 1993 and 1994 {{in the context}} of studies on the recovery of Lake Orta from acidification after the liming conducted from May 1989 to June 1990. The causes of the pollution were due to the oxidation of ammonium sulphate discharged from a factory producing rayon by a cupro-ammoniacal method and to the loads of heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn) derived from plating factories. One year after liming, an increase in pH and a marked decrease in metal concentrations were observed, and as a consequence some qualitative and quantitative changes were observed in 1992 - 93 in the planctonic communities and in the <b>littoral</b> macrobenthic <b>fauna.</b> This paper presents qualitative and quantitative data on macrobenthos collected along a transect between the littoral and the maximal depth in the Buccione Basin, which was directly affected by the effluents of the rayon factory. The data revealed some quantitative repopulation of this community, especially along the littoral. Qualitatively, however, the macrobenthos was still quite poor, consisting essentially of Oligochaeta and Diptera Chironomidae. The former were rare and mainly represented by Naididae between 15 and 22 m, while the Tubificidae were well represented in the littoral and the profundal zones. As regards the Chironomidae, the genera Procladius and Chironomus gr. thummi extended as far as the maximum depth, while others, such as Ablabesmyia, Parakiefferiella bathophila and Dicrotendipes gr. nervosus were mostly distributed in the littoral layers. Among the other taxonomic groups only the Trichoptera and the Diptera Ceratopogonidae were quantitatively significant. However, many systematic entities typical of the less polluted Italian subalpine lakes are still absent. In fact, the colonisation of Lake Orta by macrobenthic organisms is still influenced by the increased concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment precipitated from the water column. The research included analysis of lake water and sediments chemistry to obtain information on the trophic level of the environment...|$|R
