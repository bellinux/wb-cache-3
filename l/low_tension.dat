25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of <b>low</b> <b>tension</b> and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E
25|$|The United States is the world's top {{exporter}} of cotton. Four {{out of the}} top five importers of U.S.-produced cotton are in North America; the principal destination is Honduras, with about 33% of the total, although this has been in decline slightly over recent years. The next most important importer is Mexico, with about 18%, a figure which has been broadly stable, and then the Dominican Republic, although exports have declined as a proportion of the total in recent years. China imported about 11% of U.S. cotton last year, which was a sharp increase over previous seasons, allowing it to overtake El Salvador, which has consistently imported about 8-9% of the total. Cotton exports to China grew from a value of $46 million in 2000 to more than $2 billion in 2010. In Japan, especially Texas cotton is very highly regarded as its strong fibers lend themselves perfectly to <b>low</b> <b>tension</b> weaving.|$|E

40|$|Moisture-tension {{curves of}} the conditioners hygromol and peatmoss {{indicated}} {{the loss of}} more than 90 % of their water at <b>low</b> <b>tensions,</b> particularly hygromol at 0. 1 atm. tension. The work (W) as calorie squired to remove the available moisture from peatmoss treated soils was at least 1. 6 times that of hygromol treated soil. But the work required to remove equal water content from both hygromol and peatmoss treated soils at <b>low</b> <b>tensions</b> were nearly the same, whereas at higher tensions, the work was higher for the hygromol than the peatmoss. The addition of the two conditioners to the sandy soil up to 30 % by volume did not appreciably increase the available moisture in absolute quantities.

50|$|Since {{a liquid}} {{with a high}} surface tension pulls more {{strongly}} on the surrounding liquid than one with a <b>low</b> surface <b>tension,</b> {{the presence of a}} gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of <b>low</b> surface <b>tension.</b> The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).|$|R

2500|$|Most {{chromosome}} {{movements in}} relation to spindle poles are associated to lengthening and shortening of kMTs. One {{of the most interesting}} features of kinetochores is their capacity to modify the state of their associated kMTs (around 20) from a depolymerization state at their (+) end to polymerization state. This allows the kinetochores from cells at prometaphase to show [...] "directional instability", changing between persistent phases of movement towards the pole (poleward) or inversed (anti-poleward), which are coupled with alternating states of kMTs depolymerization and polymerization, respectively. This kinetochore bi-stability seem {{to be part of a}} mechanism to align the chromosomes at the equator of the spindle without losing the mechanic connection between kinetochores and spindle poles. It is thought that kinetochore bi-stability is based upon the dynamic instability of the kMTs (+) end, and it is partially controlled by the tension present at the kinetochore. In mammalian cultured cells, a <b>low</b> <b>tension</b> at kinetochores promotes change towards kMTs depolymerization, and high tension promotes change towards kMTs polymerization.|$|E
2500|$|Highlining is slacklining at {{elevation}} {{above the}} ground or water. Many slackliners consider highlining to be the pinnacle of the sport. Highlines are commonly set up in locations {{that have been used}} or are still used for Tyrolean traverse. When rigging highlines, experienced slackers take measures to ensure that solid, redundant and equalized anchors are used to secure the line into position. Modern highline rigging typically entails a mainline of webbing, backup webbing, and either climbing rope or amsteel rope for redundancy. However, many highlines are rigged with a mainline and backup only, especially if the highline is <b>low</b> <b>tension</b> (less than [...] ), or rigged with high quality webbing like [...] or [...] It is also common to pad all areas of the rigging which might come in contact with abrasive surfaces. To ensure safety, most highliners wear a climbing harness or swami belt with a leash attached to the slackline itself.

50|$|Many {{professional}} stringers advise {{players to}} string racquets with the <b>lowest</b> <b>tension</b> possible while still {{being able to}} maintain control of the ball. Beginning players trying to find their tension should start {{in the middle of}} the recommended tension range and adjust the tension from there to meet their needs. The recommended tension is usually printed on the racquet. With a lower tension the racquet will have more power and less control; with a higher tension, it will have less power and more control.|$|R
50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the <b>lowest</b> <b>tension</b> that does not slip in high loads. Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|R
6000|$|The {{difference}} between the dry cold air of this elevation {{and that of the}} heated plains of India, is very great. During the driest winds of the Terai, in spring, the temperature is 80 degrees to 90 degrees, the tension of vapour is [...] .400 to [...] .500, with a dew-point 22 degrees below the temperature, and upwards of six grains of vapour are suspended in the cubic foot of air; a thick haze obscures the heavens, and clouds of dust rise high in the air; here on the other hand (probably owing to the rarity of the atmosphere and the <b>low</b> <b>tension</b> of its vapours), the drought is accompanied by perfect transparency, and the atmosphere is too attenuated to support the dust raised by the wind.|$|E

The great {{distinction}} of the electricities obtained {{from these two}} sources is the very high tension to which the small quantity obtained by aid of the machine may be raised, and the enormous quantity (371. 376.) in which that of comparatively <b>low</b> <b>tension,</b> supplied by the voltaic battery, may be procured; but as their actions, whether magnetical, chemical, or of any other nature, are essentially the same (360.), it appeared evident that we might reason from the former as to the manner of action of the latter; and it was, to me, a probable consequence, {{that the use of}} electricity of such intensity as that afforded by the machine, would, when applied to effect and elucidate electro-chemical decomposition, show some new conditions of that action, evolve new views of the internal arrangements and changes of the substances under decomposition, and perhaps give efficient powers over matter as yet undecomposed.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Surfactant {{proteins}} A, B, C and D complex with (phospho) lipids {{to produce}} surfactants which provide <b>low</b> interfacial <b>tensions.</b> It {{is likely that}} similar complexation occurs in the tear film and contributes to its <b>low</b> surface <b>tension.</b> Synthetic protein-phospholipid complexes, with styrene maleic anhydrides (SMAs) as the protein analogue, {{have been shown to}} have similarly <b>low</b> surface <b>tensions.</b> This study investigates the potential of modified SMAs and/or SMA-phospholipid complexes, which form under physiological conditions, to supplement natural tear film surfactants. Method: SMAs were modified to provide structural variants which can form complexes under varying conditions. Infrared spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance were used to confirm SMA structure. Interfacial behaviour of the SMA and SMA-phospholipid complexes was studied using Langmuir trough, du Nûoy ring and pulsating bubblemethods. Factors which affect SMA-phospholipid complex formation, such as temperature and pH, were also investigated. Results: Structural manipulation of SMAs allows control over complex formation, including under physiological conditions (e. g. partial SMAesterfication allowed complexation with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, at pH 7). The <b>low</b> surface <b>tensions</b> of the SMAs (42 mN/m for static (du Nûoy ring) and 34 mN/m for dynamic (Langmuir) techniques) demonstrate their surface activity at the air-aqueous interface. SMA-phospholipid complexes provide even lower surface tensions (~ 2 mN/m), approaching that of lung surfactant, as measured by the pulsating bubblemethod. Conclusions: Design of the molecular architecture of SMAs allows control over their surfactant properties. These SMAs could be used as novel tear films supplements, either alone to complex with native tear film phospholipids or delivered as synthetic protein-phospholipid complexes...|$|R
