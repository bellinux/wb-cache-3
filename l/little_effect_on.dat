5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} little {{and various other}} British craft involved in the operation had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the eventual outcome. The French response was disorganised and ineffectual, losing one frigate captured. Three others were almost destroyed, only escaping by cutting their anchor cables and fleeing into the coastal shoals where they ran aground. Although all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation had cost the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, although the exact totals are uncertain. Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with promotions and prize money.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E

5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Fausto {{steadily}} weakened {{throughout the}} following two days as it moved over progressively cooler waters. By July21, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm and a tropical depression the next day. Early on July23, the depression lacked deep convection and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The low persisted for another day before dissipating over open waters. Hurricane Fausto had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> land, despite passing close to the islands of Clarion and Socorro where high winds, reaching hurricane-force on Socorro, were recorded. Moderate rainfall from the outer bands of the storm amounted to 1.9in (50mm) in the Mexican state of Sinaloa.|$|E
