25|$|In the {{following}} years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied {{as a result}} of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own <b>local</b> <b>zone</b> was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country zoning failed to help, as the Riverina Football League proved {{to be one of the}} least profitable zones.|$|E

It allowed customers {{to use their}} 3 Branded CDMA mobile phone as a Home phone when at home. Calls made from their mobile were charged at rates {{similar to those of}} a Landline. Customers also received a [...] "Local Zone [...] " [...] number allowing them to be called on a Landline number whilst at home. Should the phone be out of the <b>Local</b> <b>zone,</b> Calls made to the landline number either diverted to the Mobile number at a small fee, or was directed to Voicemail on the mobile handset. These plans started at a very competitive price of $10.00 per month, and local calls from the <b>local</b> <b>Zone</b> to a local landline was charged at 20c per local call, making their service cheaper than those of Telstra or Optus. The Orange One network was not as vast as others, and so Orange made arrangements with Telstra to allow the services of Orange one devices to roam to the Telstra network On 1 February 2006, it was rebranded as 3 CDMA, and this network was closed as of 9 August 2006. 3 CDMA customers were offered special tariffs and incentives to continue as customers on the 3G network, all customers either moved over to 3's 3G network or to other network providers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There is a {{confused}} and contradictory {{literature on the}} role of small concentrations of niobium {{on the development of the}} so-called <b>local</b> brittle <b>zones</b> in steels. These zones consist of a mixture of martensite and austenite and hence, their formation should be predictable using modern microstructure calculation methods. Following an assessment of the most relevant literature, a mathematical model is presented which enables three quantities to be calculated, the fraction of martensite, the carbon concentration of the martensite, and its ability to influence toughness. Examples are presented for particular linepipe steels, and then the generic effect of alloying elements other than niobium, on the development of <b>local</b> <b>zones.</b> The <b>Local</b> Brittle <b>Zone</b> as an Entity <b>Local</b> brittle <b>zones</b> (LBZs) are small regions of hard, brittle phase that form in the heat affected zones (HAZs) of multipass welds [1]. They usually contain untempered martensite that can lead to scatter in toughness data when the test specimen samples a brittle zone [2]. Such scatter reduces confidence in design because of the existence of a few poor values which fall out of the desired range. Experimental data have been interpreted to conclude that the lower bound toughness values deteriorate as the volume fraction of martensite in the form of LBZs increases [3]. However, th...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to numerical simulation of two-phase, two-dimensional flows (sprays or two-phase jets), based {{on a combination of}} the full Lagrangian method for the dispersed phase and the mesh-free vortex blob method for the carrier phase, is suggested. The problem of calculation of all parameters in both phases (including particle concentration) is reduced to the solution of a high-order system of ordinary differential equations, describing transient processes in both carrier and dispersed phases. This allows one to study in detail <b>local</b> <b>zones</b> of particle accumulation in complex transient flows, including those with multiple intersections of particle trajectories and the formation of “folds” in the concentration field of the dispersed phase. The {{new approach}} is applied to modelling of the time evolution of a two-phase Lamb vortex and the development of an impulse two-phase jet. These examples involve the formation of <b>local</b> <b>zones</b> of particle accumulation and regions of multiple intersections of particle trajectories. The correct simulation of these flow features is expected to involve serious difficulties when the conventional Eulerian/Lagrangian methods, described in the literature, are used...|$|R

50|$|For {{historical}} reasons, the {{versions of}} Windows {{that do not}} support NTFS all keep time internally as <b>local</b> <b>zone</b> time, and therefore so do all file systems - other than NTFS - that are supported by current versions of Windows.

As a result, especially shortly {{after one of the}} days on which <b>local</b> <b>zone</b> time changes, users may observe that some files have timestamps that are incorrect by one hour. Due to the differences in implementation of DST in different jurisdictions, this can result in a potential timestamp error of up to 4 hours in any given 12 months.|$|E
