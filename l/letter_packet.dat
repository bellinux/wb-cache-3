6000|$|When a {{year had}} passed Alma was still writing to Gilbert the letters signed [...] "A. Williams." [...] She {{had ceased to}} fear being found out, and she took a strange {{pleasure}} in the correspondence for its own sake. At first she had been quakingly afraid of discovery. When she smuggled the letters addressed in Gilbert's handwriting to Miss Anna Williams out of the <b>letter</b> <b>packet</b> and hid them from Anna's eyes, she felt as guilty {{as if she were}} breaking all the laws of the land at once. To be sure, she knew {{that she would have to}} confess to Anna some day, when the latter repented and began to wish she had written to Gilbert, but that was a very different thing from premature disclosure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{postmark}} {{is often}} considered {{as an official}} confirmation that a cover (<b>letter,</b> <b>packet,</b> etc.) mailed item was mailed at a given location at a specific date. For example, {{the date of the}} postmark can be quite important. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service will still consider income tax returns as filed on time though it receives them late if they are postmarked on time, and this date (with, perhaps, other proofs of mailing), may have significance as regards legal filings and proofs of service (though in this case the date may viewed as [...] "on time" [...] if the date of the postmark is no more than one day after the date service is supposed to have been made). Entries into sweepstakes and contests, and juried art exhibitions, may likewise have a [...] "postmark deadline," [...] and in at least one case it might have significance regarding the date of class withdrawal.|$|E

He had {{not merely}} sent the piano; but {{had written a}} note to Mrs. Sedley, and asked {{permission}} {{to come and see}} her--and he had seen her, and Amelia too, yesterday, before he came down to Chatham; and, what is more, he had brought that farewell <b>letter</b> and <b>packet</b> which had so moved them.|$|R
60|$|To convey these {{from the}} chief office 176 extra vans were used, and 75 extra carts. As nearly {{as could be}} estimated, the number of extra <b>letters</b> and <b>packets</b> was not less than four millions.

60|$|The sheriff {{took the}} letter, but without turning {{his eyes on}} the writing, for he was {{examining}} the appearance of the other with astonishment. From the face of his cousin the gaze of Richard wandered to the table, which was covered with <b>letters,</b> <b>packets,</b> and newspapers; then to the apartment and all it contained. On the bed there was the impression that had been made by a human form, but the coverings were unmoved, and everything indicated that the occupant of the room had passed a sleepless night. The candles had burned to the sockets, and had evidently extinguished themselves in their own fragments Marmaduke had drawn his curtains, and opened both the shutters and the sashes, to admit the balmy air “ of a spring morning; but his pale cheek, his quivering lip, and his sunken eye presented altogether so very different an appearance from the usual calm, manly, and cheerful aspect of the Judge, that the sheriff grew each moment more and more bewildered with astonishment. At length Richard found time to cast {{his eyes on the}} direction of the letter, which he still held unopened, crumpling it in his hand.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This <b>letter</b> {{presents}} <b>packet</b> scheduling disciplines {{based on}} application utility functions and network traffic mea-surements. The disciplines support different classes of adaptive applications over the Internet, providing differentiation, fairness, and dynamic allocation of network resources. They {{are composed of}} a decision procedure, where a fairness criterion based on utility functions is used; and a measurement procedure, which considers the statistics involving packet arrivals and departures. The underlying algorithm is then applied to emulate the Proportional Differentiation Services, and is shown—via simulation—that its results outperform the best alternative algorithms published in the literature. Index Terms—Adaptive applications, fairness criteria, measure-ment-based procedures, scheduling, utility functions. I...|$|R

Separated from her staircase, all the week, by {{the length of}} iron road {{dividing}} Coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through James Harthouse, through the outsides of <b>letters</b> and <b>packets,</b> through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.

500|$|The Admiral {{isolated}} the ships {{from one another}} to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny. St Vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. When the stock of tobacco ran low the Admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds. When the postmaster in Lisbon detained the <b>letters</b> and <b>packets</b> arriving from England for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, Jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship [...] to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.|$|R
50|$|A {{registered}} envelope {{is a form}} of {{postal stationery}} consisting of a strong envelope with an imprinted stamp used for sending registered mail. The envelopes usually include a perpendicular blue cross and an R in a circle symbol, both internationally recognised symbols of registered mail. The imprinted stamp (often on the flap) shows the fee for the registration service, while a space is left for a postage stamp to be affixed to pay the postage fee. The envelopes are usually marked Registered Letter but that term strictly only relates to a normal <b>letter</b> or <b>packet</b> that has extra postage and markings applied so that it may travel under the registered mail service.|$|R

50|$|U.S. Special Delivery was {{a postal}} service paid for with {{additional}} postage for urgent <b>letters</b> and postal <b>packets</b> which are delivered {{in less time than}} by standard or first class mail service. Its meaning is different and separate from express mail delivery service. Essentially it meant that a postal packet was delivered from a post office to the addressee immediately once it arrived at the post office responsible for delivering it, rather than waiting for the next regular delivery to the addressee.|$|R

50|$|In England, {{the postal}} service, from 1660 General Post Office, had {{developed}} into a monopoly, affirmed by Oliver Cromwell in 1654, for the collection and carriage of letters between post towns, however, there was no delivery system until William Dockwra and his partner Robert Murray established the London Penny Post in 1680. They set up a local post that used a uniform rate of one old penny for delivery of <b>letters</b> and <b>packets</b> weighing up to one pound within the cities of Westminster and London {{as well as in}} Southwark. Several deliveries took place a day within the city, and items were also delivered to addresses up to ten miles outside London for an extra charge of one penny. In 1683 Dockwra was forced to surrender the Penny Post to the English Monarchy for circulating what were considered seditious newsletters sharply criticizing the Duke of York, {{who was in charge of}} and directly benefited from the General Post Office.|$|R

30|$|In an {{interactive}} TCP session, the user will enter a command such a Linux command “ls” by typing {{a list of}} letters (for example, l, s, etc.) and then execute the command on the server machine. The result responses from the remote sever will {{be a number of}} packets containing the output generated by executing the command. In general, the user machine will receive an Echo packet as a response whenever the user enters one letter on his machine as a command or a part of a command. If the command is a single <b>letter,</b> the <b>packet</b> is called a single-letter send or a single-letter echo, respectively. To this end, we only consider the single-letter send packets of the outgoing connection and the single-letter echo packets of the incoming connection. If the two connections of the sensor are a relayed stepping-stone pair, then the number of the send packets in the outgoing connection should be very close to the number of the echo packets in the incoming connection of the sensor.|$|R
50|$|A Free Frank was a mark {{applied by}} means of a hand-stamp to {{parliamentary}} mail in Britain to indicate that the mailed item did not require postage. The privilege of free franking was granted to four different classes: Members of Parliament; peers sitting in the House of Lords; office-holders, largely as stipulated by Acts of Parliament; and to archbishops and bishops sitting in the House of Lords. Requirement for free franking were that the mailed cover (<b>letter</b> or <b>packet)</b> had to be signed by the official sender. As a result, free franks were avidly sought during the first three decades of the nineteenth century for autograph collections. This was accomplished by cutting out the front panels of the envelope which carried the inscriptions which were required under the use of this privilege. These panels are referred to by collectors as free fronts.In 1840 as a result of various abuses and excesses that had plagued the British Post office for many years, Rowland Hill's reforms brought an end to the Free franking privilege in 1840 when he introduced the postage stamp to Britain.|$|R
