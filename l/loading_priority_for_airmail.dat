40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{proposed}} a new wavelength converter placement scheme called Adaptive First <b>Load</b> <b>Priority,</b> useful <b>for</b> designing and planning of optical networks with sparsepartial wavelength conversion architecture. The adaptive FLP {{is an extension}} of the FLP (First <b>Load</b> <b>Priority)</b> placement scheme proposed by authors in a previous work [11]. It was conceived with the aim of decreasing the number of WCRs (Wavelength Converter Router) used by FLP scheme. Initially, we provide a performance evaluation of FLP working in different scenarios [...] Comparing to others wavelength converter placement schemes proposed in the literature like MBPF [9], TOT [8], XC [5] and to partial wavelength conversion, our results show that FLP achieves better performance in all scenarios studied, very close to that one achieved with a full-complete wavelength conversion architecture. Thus, we introduce the Adaptive FLP scheme comparing its performance to XC and FLP schemes. Results achieve...|$|R

40|$|A {{problem in}} the field of {{district}} heating is the oil burners needed to provide power when a peak load occurs. One possible way of reducing the needed amount of oil is to reduce the power demand for space heating in the district-heating substations when the need for district heating water exceeds a certain limit. This can be done by use of a locally working controller function. In this Thesis the options concerning <b>load</b> <b>priority</b> are evaluated. To evaluate the potential for using controller functions concerning peak <b>load</b> <b>priority</b> an experiment was brought out in a chosen district-heating substation. The impact on the indoor thermal comfort during a heat reduction was also taken into account. With simulations and mathematical models the building and the indoor air cool down was evaluated. Also a survey was given to the residents to validate how the indoor thermal climate was affected during the experiment. Possible savings by using these kinds of functions were also accounted for. The result demonstrates that a simple controller function provides a possible way of reducing the power demand, but is not sufficiently reliable. This is mainly due to the used regulating parameter. With modifications or by adding additional regulating parameters such as water flow into the controller, the functionality can be improved. The result from the survey shows that during the experimental period the residents experienced a minor impact on the thermal comfort. Parameters, such as ventilation and heat losses also {{have a major impact on}} the building´s thermal inertia, especially at the lowest occurring outdoor temperatures. The simulations confirm the theory regarding the building heat capacity to prevent a negative impact on indoor thermal comfort. In addition, the indoor air temperature can initially decrease faster than the building framework, especially under the influence of ventilation. This must be taken into account when applying functions <b>for</b> <b>load</b> <b>priority.</b> Calculations indicate that the economical benefits by adapting functions <b>for</b> <b>load</b> <b>priority</b> are primarily <b>for</b> the heat-producer, due to reduced oil dependence and also other system aspects. The current ownership structure in Uppsala provides for a possible obstacle when it comes to expanded use of <b>load</b> <b>priority</b> functions. More incentives for the consumer are needed to provide for an increased usage of <b>load</b> <b>priority</b> functions in their district-heating substations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an analytical model that eval-uates the blocking probability of each service class in optical burst-switching networks. The model is applicable to systems with arbitrary burst length distributions and arbitrary-sized QoS header offsets. Thus, unlike previous models, it is {{applicable to the}} design and study of networks {{with a wide range}} of traffic characteristics, including systems in which higher classes are not necessarily isolated from lower classes and systems in which the conservation law does not necessarily hold. We derive explicit expressions for blocking probability both the cases of constant burst lengths and exponentially distributed burst lengths and verify the model’s accuracy through simulation. We show the model to be accurate for a number of different traffic <b>loads</b> and class <b>priorities.</b> <b>For</b> an OBS system with two classes and a 1 : 10 ratio of high-priority to low-priority traffic, our model is able to predict accurately the blocking probability for each class, whereas the predictions from a model that assumes isolation deviates by as much as an order of magnitude from the simulation results <b>for</b> the higher <b>priority</b> class.

40|$|The {{heat supply}} for Swedish multi-family {{residential}} buildings {{is becoming more}} complex, and today it is fairly common to combine district heating with a second heat source. The most common heat source to combine with district heating in Sweden is an exhaust air heat pump. On average, the exhaust air heat pump covers 31 % of the yearly heat load and is given full <b>load</b> <b>priority.</b> There is a missed potential in cost and CO 2 savings when one heat source is given full <b>load</b> <b>priority,</b> since marginal production costs and CO 2 emissions constantly vary in both the electrical grid and the district heating system. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate how buildings with several heat sources should be operated using hourly energy prices. Hourly heat and electricity prices for Gothenburg have been established for two years based on the marginal costs of heat and electricity generation. These prices have been used to evaluate the most common combinations of heat sources. Results show that the most common combination with an exhaust air heat pump with full <b>load</b> <b>priority</b> does not lower costs compared to the reference case with only district heating. However, having a control system that allows heat source shifting and gives <b>load</b> <b>priority</b> to the heat source with the lowest cost each hour can greatly reduce the heating cost, and systems with larger heat pumps show even greater potential for heat source shifting...|$|R
