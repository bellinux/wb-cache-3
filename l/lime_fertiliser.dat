The function of the canal was to import limestone from Wales to be burnt with coal, also imported, at inland kilns to make <b>lime</b> <b>fertiliser</b> which would greatly increase the fertility, and thus the value, of agricultural land.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how forest soil acidification {{is affected by}} edge proximity. We measured pH(KCl) and exchangeable K, Ca, Mg and Al concentrations of the mineral topsoil (0 - 30 cm) from the exposed edge to the interior (128 m from the edge) of three deciduous and four coniferous forest stands. From the front edge to {{the interior of the}} deciduous stands, the pH(KCl) values decreased at 0 - 5 cm soil depth (from 3. 07 to 2. 98) but increased at 5 - 10 cm (from 3. 26 to 3. 32) and 10 - 30 cm (from 3. 48 to 3. 75) depth. In the coniferous stands, pH(KCl) values declined from edge to interior at all soil depths, i. e. from 3. 10 to 2. 89, from 3. 26 to 3. 06 and from 3. 54 to 3. 31 at 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 30 cm, respectively. The concentrations of exchangeable cations decreased from edge to interior, with larger differences in the coniferous (of up to 265 %) than in the deciduous stands (up to 99 %). At forest edges, enhanced soil acidification due to higher potentially acidifying deposition could be counteracted in the upper mineral soil by higher base cation throughfall and litterfall, faster litter decomposition, higher soil organic matter content, lower nitrate leaching from the soil and/or <b>lime</b> <b>fertiliser</b> drift. Nonetheless, deeper in the soil of the deciduous stands, these buffer processes seem unable to counteract soil acidification due to potentially acidifying deposition at the edges. Edge effects on soil acidity are important since they can translate into effects on plant communities, soil biota, nitrogen cycling and carbon sequestration...|$|E

(Eds) Sponsorship: NERC / BBSRCThe linkages between plants and soil biota are both important and complex, involving {{both positive and negative}} feedbacks between soil organisms and their physical environment. An experiment was established in an upland grassland system to investigate the impact of addition of nitrogen and <b>lime</b> (NL) <b>fertiliser</b> on plant communities and the soil biota. The NL treatment increased above ground plant biomass and accelerated root returns to the soil, providing increased plant-derived energy for the soil food web. No changes were seen in fungal biomass, as indicated by PLFA, but bacterial biomass was reduced. However, the numbers of bacterial feeding and predatory nematodes increased in the NL treatment and may be masking the effects at the lower trophic levels, indicating top-down control mechanisms. Although the NL treatment changed nematode community structure, there was an overall depression in the abundance of nematodes. This decrease was likely to be related to soil moisture content, which was reduced significantly in the NL treatment by increased evapotranspiration due to the larger above ground biomass production.

40|$|Summary. A {{long-term}} {{experiment in}} north-eastern Victoria has been regularly monitored for wheat yield {{responses to a}} range of <b>lime</b> and <b>fertiliser</b> treatments, and the soil sampled for acidity attributes. Substantial grain yield increases have been consistently obtained over a period of 12 years with a single lime application. Lime applied at 2. 5 t/ha in 1980 was still providing yield increases of 24 % with an acid-tolerant wheat (Matong, 1992 season) and 79 % with an acid-sensitive wheat (Oxley, 1993 season) relative to no lime treatment. The 2 wheat cultivars responded differently to phosphorus fertiliser, with the acid-sensitive wheat less responsive to phosphorus fertiliser in the absence of lime. The use of a regular lime application applied as a fertiliser (125 kg lime/ha) with the wheat seed gave only a small grain yield increase (8 % Matong, 16 % Oxley), despite 1 t/ha of lime applied over the 12 -year period. Liming the soil at a rate of 2. 5 t/ha (1980) initially raised the soil pH by about 1. 0 unit and removed most soluble aluminium (0 – 10 cm). However, after 12 years of crop–pasture rotation after the initial 2. 5 t lime/ha treatment the soil pH had declined by 0. 7 of a pH unit and exchangeable aluminium was substantially increased, almost to levels prior to the initial application of lime. Given the continued yield responsiveness obtained following the initial application of lime, this practice, rather than regular applications of small amounts of lime, is recommended for wheat production on strongly acidic (pHw < 5. 5) soils in south-eastern Australia.

40|$|In the Brazilian savannah (Cerrado), {{soils are}} highly weathered, acidic, with low {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) levels, {{requiring}} additions of <b>lime</b> and <b>fertiliser</b> for agricultural use. In these soils, improving {{quantity and quality of}} SOM is pivotal for efficiency and sustainability gains in crop production. However, building SOM under tropical conditions is challenging due to the fast decomposition of organic material. Here we investigated if SOM levels under aerobic rice systems in the Cerrado could be enhanced through the addition of hardwood biochar, a by-product of bioenergy production rich in resilient, pyrogenic C (70 - 80 % of its weight). The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effect of hardwood biochar (char) rates combined with different rates of synthetic N on SOM over 4 growing seasons of aerobic rice after a single application of char to a sandy and a clay soil in the Cerrado. The SOM increased with 0. 07 % per Mg ha- 1 of char, at 0. 1 year after applying char to the sandy soil. In the clay soil, SOM increased with 0. 26 and 0. 23 % per Mg ha- 1 of char at 2. 5 and 3. 5 years after char application, respectively. The increase in SOM is likely to be related to the porosity of char, where SOM can be absorbed and physically protected. Residue added via crop rotation was likely to be the main source of organic material related to an increase in SOM in the clay soil over seasons, the opposite of what was observed in the sandy soil, where no extra source of organic matter, other than char, was added to soil after establishment of field trial. 201...|$|R
40|$|The amazing {{achievement}} of the 20 th century was that widely affordable food was produced for a four-fold increase in global population, but that agricultural land has stayed nearly constant since 1950. Production increases have been achieved with soil and soil input management (e. g., phosphorus <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>lime</b> for soil acidity, rhizobia with legumes, nitrogen fertiliser, rotations to break root diseases, irrigation, and ploughing management). Meanwhile new varieties have been selected on shoot phenotypes largely by eye in fields (e. g., canopy architecture, height, disease and abiotic tolerances based on leaves, and flowering time), combined with grain weight and quality destructive measures. Roots are not generally targeted by management or breeding despite their potential to increase water and fertiliser capture, harvest indices, and adaptations to land conservation and soil amendments, {{and despite the fact}} that the 21 st century population will see reductions in land, water and fertilisers available to food production. There are however notable examples where root phenotypes were directly selected in pre-breeding activities, and transferred to breeding programs, and these will be presented in this talk.

40|$|AbstractApplication of {{synthetic}} (N) fertiliser (such as urea) and incorporation of crop residues into soil result in nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Similarly, application of urea and lime {{to the soil}} results in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emanating from application {{of synthetic}} <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>lime</b> and crop residues retained in the field after harvest during field crop production in South Africa were calculated in this study. The objective was to establish GHG profiles of the field crops in South Africa that can inform national mitigation plans that are currently lacking details regarding the agriculture sector. The calculations used Agriculture and Land Use National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Software {{which is based on}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National GHG Inventory. GHG emissions were calculated and compared among different crop production and management practices. It is estimated that production of field crops resulted in a total of 5. 2 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq) emissions in South Africa in 2012. Application of synthetic fertiliser contributes the highest emissions with 57 % of national total crop CO 2 -eq emissions, followed by addition of lime (30 %) and crop residues retained in the field (13 %). Production of cereal crops accounts for 68 % of national total field crops’ GHG emissions followed by other field crops (14 %), legumes and oilseeds (11 %) and vegetables (7 %). Cultivations of maize, wheat and sugarcane result in highest commodity emissions. Highest GHGs per area planted were from the production of tomatoes with 1. 65 t of CO 2 -eqha− 1. These results show that mitigation plans of emissions from field crops in South Africa need to focus more on sustainable improvement of soil fertility, optimum application of synthetic N fertiliser and crop residues...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{of lettuce}} {{may be limited}} in acid soils by {{manganese}} toxicity which may be alleviated by applications of <b>lime,</b> phosphate <b>fertilisers,</b> iron and molybdenum. However few investigations have been undertaken to determine the biochemical effect of excess manganese in plants. The aim of this project was to demonstrate that manganese toxicity could reduce lettuce yield by inhibiting nitrate reductase activity. Manganese toxicity inhibited nitrate reductase activity in lettuce plants grown in an acid krasnozem soil. The yield of affected plants, which was {{significantly lower than the}} yield of control plants, was significantly correlated with the decrease in nitrate reductase activity. Associated with the decrease in nitrate reductase activity was an accumulation of nitrate in leaves and a decrease in the total nitrogen content (mgN/plant). Following applications of molybdenum foliar sprays there were significant increases in yield and nitrate reductase activity. The molybdenum content of plants increased in plants which had high tissue levels of manganese. The increase was probably due to the lower yield in these plants. It is not known how molybdenum reverses the manganese inhibition of nitrate reductase. Similar responses were observed in lettuce grown in nutrient solution. The Critical solution concentration of manganese,at which there was a decrease in yield and in nitrate reductase activity, was found to be 36 uM. Nitrate reductase activity of young and mature leaves was significantly correlated with leaf manganese levels. Plants grown in nitrate-nitrogen nutrient solutions were more susceptible to manganese toxicity than plants grown in ammonium nitrogen nutrient solutions. A study of the time-course of manganese inhibition of nitrate reductase in vivo (indicated that after a short lag period, manganese significantly decreased nitrate reductase activity. The half life for this decrease in enzyme activity was found to be 2. 5 hours. These results indicated that manganese was not inducing molybdenum deficiency and that manganese may have inhibited nitrate reductase by binding to the enzyme. Enzyme kinetic analysis of the manganese inhibition of nitrate reductase (in vitro) showed that manganese was a competitive inhibitor of nitrate reductase with respect to NADH and a non-competitive inhibitor of nitrate reductase with respect to nitrate. These results indicated that manganese was bound to the enzyme at or near the binding site for NADH. When manganese was added to the enzyme before NADH the degree of inhibition was greater than when the NADH was added to the enzyme before manganese. These results also indicated that manganese was interfering with the binding of NADH to the enzyme. EPR studies supported the results obtained with the kinetic analysis of the inhibition of nitrate reductase. Results of the EPR study showed that manganese was not bound by NADH but could be bound by the partially purified enzyme extract...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{properties}} that drive grassland {{production in the}} absence of mineral nitrogen applications and explanatory mechanisms thereof were sought in this study. Sixteen grassland farms varying in nitrogen inputs were selected in Counties Limerick and Clare, Ireland. Soil was sampled in 1995 and physical, chemical and biological properties analysed in the laboratory. Management data describing <b>lime</b> and <b>fertiliser</b> applications, grazing practices, soil disturbance, livestock and fodder production were obtained by interview. Grassland production for the year 1996 / 97 was measured as: stocking density; gross margin; and total energy required for livestock production, including maintenance, growth, offspring and milk and fodder sales, taking nongrassland feed energy into account. The botanical composition was determined in 1998. Data were not normally distributed therefore the research was conducted in an exploratory manner. Descriptive scatter graphs and statistics, bivariate nonparametric Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlation, multiple regression analyses, principle components analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were implemented. Four farms were in conversion to organic management, seven were organically managed and one was conventionally managed. Four farms had not had fertiliser applications. Microbial biomass, bacterial popUlations, and arginine ammonification activity that was interpreted as N-mineralisation and N-immobilisation activities in vitro, were not extreme in productive farms. Production measured as grassland energy correlated (P < 0. 05) with: fertiliser inputs and mechanical disturbance; soil pH; depth to bedrock; soil plant-available magnesium and calcium contents, influences of which were direct. Root mass and N-mineralisation in vitro correlated inversely (P < 0. 05) with production. Influential factors were highly correlated with each other (P < 0. 05). Each influential factor, ordinated with variables correlated to it, gave rise to a production-related gradient of farms in PCA. A suite of N -mineralisation in vitro and its related variables reliably indicated grassland farm production in ordination space. <b>Fertiliser</b> and <b>lime</b> applications, vegetation, grazing, soil depth and metabiosis influenced bacterial populations and activities. Root mass and N-mineralisation rates in vitro were least in disturbed and mineral nitrogen fertilised soils. N-mineralisation in vitro was greatest in extensive farms and N-immobilisation in vitro indicated carbon abundance in botanically diverse swards. Soil microbial biomass, bacterial populations and activities behaved individualistically along a possible succession in grazed grassland. Based on observations, and on allosteric and catabolite repression of amino acid use, it was hypothesised that 2 ̆ 7 available carbon, AC, is used before organic nitrogen, ON 2 ̆ 7 is ammonified. However, ammonification in vitro was uncorrelated with soil organic carbon or soil nitrogen contents or C:N ratio, because soil C and N analyses applied in the study may not have accounted for microbe-available resources. Soil organic carbon content was relatively high, but least in the conventional farm. In contrast to other studies in the literature, soil organic carbon content was not correlated with microbial biomass and arginine ammonification but may be above threshold values needed to facilitate biological function in the soils examined. Available forms of C and N ought to be considered as interdependent determinants of soil organic matter turnover rates subject to fertiliser use and grazing in grassland soils...|$|R

When combined with a re-vegetation scheme appropriate to the biogeographic area, a self-sustaining ecosystem can be established. Regulatory requirements for mine restoration typically require the use of topsoil, which is often in limited supply. However, overburden is commonly present in vast quantities and {{has the potential to be}} used as a restoration substrate with appropriate amendments. There are significant gaps in our understanding of factors relating to the use and amendment of overburden as a growing medium. The main objective of this study was to investigate and quantify the effects of inorganic and organic amendments and weathering on nutrient availability and plant growth in topsoil and overburden material obtained from the OceanaGold Globe Progress mine at Reefton, New Zealand. A series of glasshouse experiments were carried out on topsoil, fresh overburden and mullock (old waste rock) amended with biosolids, green manure, sawdust, <b>lime</b> and mineral <b>fertiliser</b> nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)). R esults demonstrated that 300 kg N ha⁻¹ was sufficient to overcome N deficiency in topsoil, while 100 kg P ha⁻¹ was required to overcome P deficiency. Addition of biosolids to topsoil and overburden increased plant biomass production, without increasing heavy metal concentrations. Amendment of overburden significantly affected weathering rates by accelerating the formation of secondary minerals. In particular, lupin green manure accelerated the formation of organic iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) organic complexes, resulting from the decomposition of the green manure and release of Fe from primary minerals. Results revealed that wineberry and red beech required 200 kg N ha⁻¹ for optimum growth. Overall, the findings of this research identified key parameters for effective utilisation of overburden as a restoration substrate. A sustainable restoration method for managing the topsoil and/or any overburden or waste rock material remaining at mine sites can be achieved by careful selection of organic amendments and allowing an initial weathering period...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of pasture to copper (Cu) fertilisers in most soils is very short-lived necessitating frequent applications of Cu fertilisers. The short-term response to Cu by plants {{is attributed to}} the ready adsorption of Cu by organic matter and other soil components. Cu distribution among these different fractions and the relative availability of these fractions for plant uptake, are fundamental {{to an understanding of}} the transformation of Cu in soil. As Cu has not been routinely analysed in the past, there is no standard soil test extractant in New Zealand. The use of single chemical extractions in routine soil analysis is a fast and simple way to evaluate the availability of soil nutrients to plants. Farmers require accurate information on the length of time that Cu applications remain fully effective in order to supply the Cu required for the grazing animal. Pasture provides the main source of Cu for grazing animals. There is a need to define the rates of change in the effectiveness of Cu fertiliser over the range of soil and climatic conditions encountered in New Zealand. The specific objectives of the study were: (i) to investigate the effect of soil components on the sorption and desorption of added and native Cu in soils; (ii) to examine the soil and fertiliser properties that influence the effectiveness of Cu topdressing in terms of increasing Cu uptake by pastures; (iii) to determine the transformation of Cu added through fertiliser applied to soils; (iv) to quantify the forms of Cu in soils using a sequential fractionation procedure; (v) to identify the forms of Cu in various soil test extractants and to assess the efficiency of these soil test extractants in predicting Cu uptake; (vi) to estimate the effects of N and P fertilisers on the uptake of native Cu by ryegrass; (vii) to examine at the residual effectiveness of two Cu source fertilisers as influenced by N <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>lime</b> and EDTA additions; and (viii) to evaluate the seasonal influence on the availability of native and added Cu to pasture. Copper sorption and desorption isotherms were determined for a number of soils (Manawatu, Tokomaru, Ramiha, Ngamoka and Mangamahu) before and after the removal of various soil components. A series of glasshouse and field trials were carried out using three Cu sources, five soils and four Cu levels. The dry matter yields of ryegrass and Cu concentration in the herbage were monitored over a number of harvests. The soil was collected from the glasshouse trial at various intervals and analysed for different fractions (exchangeable, organic, oxide and residual) and were extracted with various soil test extractants. Copper extracted from the soils was correlated with the Cu concentration in the herbage. A second glasshouse trial with two soils, four levels of nitrogen (N) and five levels of phosphate fertiliser was conducted. The dry matter (DM) yield and the Cu concentration in the ryegrass were measured. The effects of N <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>lime</b> and EDTA addition on the availability of residual Cu was investigated in a separate glasshouse trial. A series of field trials were conducted, in the same paddocks, to examine the effect of season on the uptake of Cu from two Cu sources. The differences in the chemical characteristics of the soils resulted in some variation in the sorption and desorption of Cu between the soils. Soil pH, organic carbon, iron and aluminium oxides play a major role in the sorption and desorption of Cu in soils. Organic matter and oxides are important in adsorption reactions, but differences exist in their relative importance. Increasing levels of Cu increased the Cu concentration in plants. Sources of Cu fertiliser have a significant effect on DM yield, and Cu concentration at all harvests. Soil pH, organic matter, CEC and clay content correlated with Cu concentration in plants. Cu uptake in grasses decreased with time after fertiliser application. Organic and oxide bound Cu contributed > 80 % of total Cu in all the soils. The organically bound Cu fraction was highest in soils with high levels of organic matter. Both the organically bound and the oxide bound fractions of Cu decreased with time after fertiliser application, indicating a possible decrease in the availability of Cu. Soil exchangeable, organic and oxide bound fractions of Cu were correlated with soil organic matter, CEC and clay content. Both the organic and oxide bound Cu were correlated with plant Cu uptake. The major forms of Cu extracted by the soil test reagents include organically bound, followed by oxide bound, residual and exchangeable forms. The ratios of different forms of Cu strongly suggest that Cu is residing mainly in the organic form and increases in this order: exchangeable Mehlich- 3 > Mehlich- 1 > 0. 02 M SrCl 2 > 0. 1 M HCl > 1. 0 M NH 4 NO 3 > 0. 01 MCaCl 2 > 0. 1 M NaNO 3 > 0. 01 M Ca(NO 3) 2. Increasing levels of both N and P fertilisers increased both the DM yield and the uptake of native Cu. Increasing levels of N increased both the DM yields and the Cu concentration in soils with residual Cu. The effect on Cu concentration persisted beyond the first cut only at the highest N addition. Increasing levels of lime increased the DM yield of pasture, but decreased the Cu concentration in pasture at the highest level of lime addition. Increasing levels of EDTA increased the Cu concentration in soils and thereby increased the Cu concentration in the pasture. The application of 1000 kg lime ha- 1 and 50 kg N ha- 1 was very effective in enhancing plant availability of residual Cu in soils, but EDTA increased the plant available Cu to toxic levels. The highest application rate of <b>lime</b> and N <b>fertiliser</b> decreased the exchangeable and free Cu in the Ngamoka soil, but EDTA showed the opposite effect. In the field experiment Cu levels have no significant effect on DM yield during all seasons. The field study shows differences in seasonal response to added Cu. Increasing levels of Cu increased the Cu concentration in pasture. Types of Cu fertiliser have a significant effect on Cu concentration. The differences in pasture growth and Cu concentrations in plants seasonally could be attributed to the differences in air and soil temperature, soil moisture content and solar radiation patterns within the trial period. Adsorption and desorption reactions are likely to be the major factors controlling the availability of Cu to plants. The major forms of Cu that can be extracted by soil test extractants are the organically bound, followed by oxide bound, residual and exchangeable forms. Organic and oxide bound Cu were the main sources of plant available Cu. The uptake of native Cu and residual Cu from soils showed that N and lime at 50 kg N ha- 1 and 1000 kg lime ha- 1 levels increased the Cu concentration, and EDTA also increased the plant available Cu to toxic levels. The effect of N, lime, and EDTA on the availability of residual Cu in ryegrass needs further investigation. Both the glasshouse and field trials indicate that Cu uptake is internally regulated by the growth of pasture and externally affected by the transformation of Cu in soils...|$|R
40|$|At the Martha Gold and Silver Mine in Waihi, New Zealand, land {{disturbed}} by mining operations {{is required to}} be revegetated. Areas include pit walls above the natural water level, {{the slopes of the}} dam impounding the tailings and the tailings surface. The research work reported in this thesis is concerned with revegetation of acid generating material situated on the pit walls, and tailings revegetation. Hydroseeding with grass species onto pit slopes comprising unoxidised pyritic rock material proved to be unsuccessful because of acid generation which caused the pH to drop as low as 2. 2 on the slope surface. Where calcite veins were present the pH was maintained at higher levels. It was found that a mixed species of hydroseeded grass grew successfully where the pH was 6. 0 or above. Clover began to show signs of stress when the pH dropped to 4. 5 and when the pH fell as low as 3. 6, all grass died. Boreholes at a diameter of 100 mm were drilled to a depth of 500 mm into the slope surface of pyritic rock material to provide planting holes for native species at 1. 5 m intervals. Toetoe, manuka, kanuka, flax and akeake all had acceptable survival rates over a ten month period. Coprosma kirkii was not successful and is not recommended for further plantings. Topsoil placed in the boreholes was found to have a beneficial effect on the overall plant survival rate, more so than the addition of <b>lime</b> or <b>fertiliser.</b> Although survival rates for native plants were acceptable over a ten month period, the objective of providing a vegetation cover that would improve the visual appearance of the slope was not achieved with 1. 5 m spacings between plants. In contrast to the unoxidised pit slope material, tailings were found to have few limitations to plant growth. In 1992, two separate tailings trials were established to investigate the use of native plants as an alternative land use to pasture and the use of compost as an amendment for pasture production and native plant growth. Within the first six months following sowing, pasture dry matter yields from tailings plots with a 50 mm layer of compost applied to the surface were not significantly different from yields from tailings plots without a compost amendment although clover production was visually greater on compost plots. For subsequent cuts, compost-amended plots gave significantly higher pasture dry matter yields than nil-compost plots. Yield differences after the first six months were considered to be due to the improved P status on compost-amended plots. Yields off nil-compost plots {{in the first year of}} the 1992 trial averaged 11, 000 kg DM/ha, compared to 9, 000 kg DM/ha obtained from an earlier trial on an older tailings deposit (Union Hill). Yields off the compost-amended plots in the 1992 trial averaged 14, 000 kg DM/ha, significantly higher than topsoil-amended plots in the Union Hill trial which yielded between 6, 000 and 7, 000 kg DM/ha in the first year. Yield differences between treatments of the two separate trials may have been due to differences in P status or rainfall. The survival rate for the native plants in the tailings trial (flax, cabbage tree, kanuka and Pittosporum tenufolium) was 100 %. The addition of compost caused significantly higher growth rates in the first six months but beyond six months no significant differences were observed. A rehabilitation predictive model was developed for tailings rehabilitation which investigated costs and returns over a fourteen year period based on five different rehabilitation scenarios. The scenarios included the use of clay covers, resurfacing with compost in the event of a topsoil shortage, and a comparison between pasture and native plant land uses. It was found that if a clay cap was required on the tailings surface, large quantities of material would be required. Relatively high costs were found to be associated with the need for a clay cap and compost. Rehabilitation with native plant species was found to be more expensive than rehabilitation to pasture, and if treatment of surface water derived from the tailings surface was required, there would be significant added costs. Maintenance costs for natives were also found to be high and where pasture provides some revenue, further trials are required to determine whether revenue from natives timber species is possible...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} perennial legumes {{for the low}} fertility regions of the New Zealand high country. The aim was to improve production of legume species in these regions. A six-year field experiment at the Lees Valley evaluated the production of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.), white clover (T. repens L.), and red clover (T. pratense L.). Low soil pH and phosphorus deficiency were addressed by <b>lime</b> and P <b>fertiliser</b> application, but lucerne persistence was low at this site. Caucasian clover was the most persistent legume with the highest sown species component (93 %) and yield (7. 8 t DM/ha) in last season. Lucerne yielded 4. 2 t DM/ha in Year 1, but this decreased to 2. 7 t DM/ha in Year 3, and 1. 0 t DM/ha in Year 6. Causes of these extreme responses were examined {{in a series of}} pot experiments. In the Lees Valley soil, 85 % of lucerne seedlings died, when no lime was applied (pH 5. 4, Al> 6. 0 mg/kg) compared with 40 % of Caucasian clover seedlings. The 2 t/ha lime application, increased lucerne seedling survival to 80 % (pH 6. 1, Al 5 mg/kg at Glenmore station, but not under moderate levels of Al (ca. 3 - 4 mg/kg soil) at Ashley Dene. Nodule persistence of lupin was a key factor for plant survival in the high Al soil. At Glenmore station, Russell lupin was successfully established into resident vegetation and yielded over 10 t DM/ha in Year 2. Its vigorous growth was supported by consistent nodulation (75 %), in the high aluminium content soil. This highlighted its potential to provide a nitrogen fixing perennial legume for environment that is unsuitable for lucerne. Caucasian clover establishment was low in both field experiments, but yielded 4 t DM/ha in Year 2 at Glenmore station. At Ashley Dene the nodulated lucerne plants produced 8. 0 t DM/ha, compared with 2. 0 t DM/ha in un-nodulated plants. The ¹⁵N natural abundance method showed ca. 70 % of the nitrogen in nodulated plants was derived from BNF. This meant 122 kg N/ha of inoculated lucerne was fixed within six months. Thus lucerne was highly reliant on nitrogen fixation in an N deficient soil. Surface applied lime rates > 4 t/ha, increased the top-soil pH from 5. 2 to 5. 8 and decreased exchangeable Al levels to less than 3 mg/kg in 0 - 75 mm of soil depth, in the Lees Valley and at Glenmore Station. However, toxic Al levels in deeper soil horizons and its variability compromised the efficiency of surface lime application to enable lucerne persistence at both sites. The measurable effects of lime were less obvious in 75 - 150 mm of soil depth. Similar changes in soil pH and Al levels were measured at Ashley Dene but only 2 t lime/ha was required. Combined results from the field and pot experiments suggested the main limiting for lucerne and Caucasian clover was nitrogen deficiency that should be provided from BNF in these low N and high Al soils. Therefore the fate of applied rhizobia inoculants, and the possibility of competition with any naturalized rhizobia strains inhabiting lucerne and Caucasian clover nodules was assessed. Eight naturalized strains of Sinorhizobium meliloti were identified from lucerne nodules grown in different high country regions. This was the first identification report of any naturalized S. meliloti occupying lucerne nodules in New Zealand. Soil pH and related Al levels affected the contribution of rhizobia strains to occupy lucerne nodules. At soil pH of 5. 5 (2. 8 mg Al/kg), 50 % of the recovered isolates were the commercial strain. This proportion decreased to 6 %, as the commercial genotype had been replaced by naturalized S. meliloti strains when the soil pH increased to 6. 7 (Al< 0. 3 mg/kg). Further studies are therefore required to evaluate competitive ability, nodulation and nitrogen fixation rate of these identified naturalized strains, compared with the commercial strain. In contrast for Caucasian clover, the applied commercial strain was the only identified Rhizobium leguminosarum from nodules, irrespective of sites. This indicated high specificity of Caucasian clover for rhizobia symbiont to nodulate the roots...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Agriculture {{contributes}} about 30 % of GDP growth in Cambodia and rice production {{is the most}} important agricultural activity. Eighty five percent of rice cultivation is conducted under rainfed lowland conditions, where the soils are typically infertile, sandy and acidic. Traditionally, after the rice crop is harvested the paddy fields are left fallow, {{due to a lack of}} irrigation and a lack of awareness of potential post-rice alternative cropping options. With the recent development and adoption of improved, photoperiod non-sensitive rice varieties, the opportunities for post-rice second cropping have increased. Among the second crop options are mungbean and peanut However, there remain significant production constraints to second cropping with legumes in the rainfed lowland rice environment, including infertile acidic soils, poor soil structure, and limited availability of water. To establish the ‘best-bet’ management options for mungbean and peanut cropping after rice in the rainfed lowland environment of Cambodia, this thesis examined a range of planting techniques, irrigation methods and irrigation frequency, and soil amendments (chemical <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>lime,</b> cow manure and mulch). The thesis reports the results from three field experiments and one glasshouse experiment which were conducted during the dry-season (November-March) in 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10. The experiments were conducted at the Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). It was hypothesised that : (i) the growth and grain yield of legumes would be improved by the use of single row raised beds; (ii) higher water use efficiency would potentially come from the use of double-row raised beds under conditions of infrequent water application; (iii) more frequent irrigation (every day, every 4 days) would result in higher total dry matter and higher grain yield, than with infrequent irrigation (every 8, 12 or 16 days); (iv) the incorporation of cow manure into the crop seedbed would improve total dry matter and grain yield; (v) the use of chemical fertilizer, mulches and lime will all potentially improve the growth and yield of grain legumes. The results of field studies in the 2008 - 09 dry-season indicated that there were significant effects of planting bed formation on root depth and plant height at flowering, and on pod number per plant and grains per pod at maturity; however, these effects did not result in significant differences in final grain yield (GY), which for mungbean averaged 254 kg/ha and for peanut, 431 kg/ha. The frequency of irrigation had a significant effect on the final grain yield of peanut but not for mungbean. The GY and total dry matter (TDM) of peanut was reduced by 37 and 25 %, respectively, when the irrigation frequency was reduced from every 4, 8 or 12 days, to every 16 days. The results of the first field experiment in the 2009 - 10 dry-season indicated that for mungbean the use of drip irrigation three times per week gave the lowest GY (212 kg/ha), while hand-watering every three days produced the highest GY (575 kg/ha). There was no difference between GY for the furrow irrigation treatments every week (449 kg/ha) or every two weeks (453 kg/ha). For peanut, both drip irrigation and furrow irrigation at an interval of once every two weeks resulted in significant reductions in final grain yield of 25 - 47 % and 26 %, respectively, when compared with frequent irrigation regimes. Although peanut biomass was not reduced with the use of drip irrigation, final GY was low on account of the peanut pegs not being able to penetrate the soil. When compost mix was applied to the seedbed, there was no beneficial impact on crop establishment or final GY of either mungbean or peanut, while it reduced TDM for both legumes in the furrow and drip irrigation treatments. For the drip irrigation treatment with compost mix application, average TDM and GY for mungbean were reduced by 48 % and 57 %, respectively, relative to the other irrigation treatments, while under the least frequent irrigation regime (once every 14 days) there was an average reduction of TDM by 18. 6 %. A glasshouse experiment conducted in the 2009 - 10 dry-season found that total dry matter and pod yield of mungbean and total dry matter of peanut of the treatments of omission of rice straw and chemical fertilizer was half of those in the all applied control, while the omission of compost mix and lime did not have any apparent effects on the growth and yield of either legume. A third experiment undertaken in the 2009 - 10 dry-season gave significantly higher mungbean grain yields (46 and 34 % higher) from furrow irrigation once per week and daily hand-watering, when compared with furrow irrigation once every two weeks. In addition, the water use efficiency in terms of TDM and GY for the furrow irrigation once per week and daily hand-watering, were significantly higher than furrow irrigation once every two weeks and hand watering three times per week. In summary, it was concluded that there was no difference in use of single row or double row raised beds in terms of the final grain yield of mungbean or peanut. However, the minimum irrigation frequency for optimising the yield of mungbean or peanut grown during the dry-season in the lowland environment needs to be at least once every week during the growing season. The incorporation of chemical fertilizer was the most important soil amendment for optimising growth and final grain yield for both legumes. The incorporation of lime only had a small effect due to the high initial soil pH. The potential value of the incorporation of compost mix remained inconclusive and probably requires further assessment to clarify the reasons for the apparent negative effect on crop growth recorded in this study. The incorporation of grain legumes into the rice-based cropping systems in the lowland rice environment of Cambodia, have the potential to significantly increase the income of smallholder farmer producers. While the GY of the legumes in these field experiments was relatively low (between 200 and 600 kg/ha), the gross value were often significantly better than that from rice. With an average peanut yield of 500 kg/ha the gross value was US$ 893 /ha, while for mungbean the return ranged from between US$ 300 and US$ 900 /ha, compared with US$ 595 /ha for a rice crop with an average yield of 2500 kg/ha. For mungbean, the use of raised beds prevents water-logging, while weekly furrow irrigation was found to be adequate to ensure reasonable final yields. Over the cropping season mungbean required a total water application of approximately 270 mm, while for peanuts the requirement was about 345 mm. Further research is needed on aspects of varietal performance and pest management for both mungbean and peanut in the lowland rice based cropping systems of Cambodia...|$|R
40|$|Fixed wing {{agricultural}} aircraft apply approximately 40 % of the fertiliser used in New Zealand, {{the majority of}} which is applied in hill country. The amount varies from approximately 600, 000 tonnes to 1. 2 million tonnes per annum. About 100 fixed wing aircraft of various types are engaged in agricultural operations {{throughout the country and}} the safety record has been of considerable concern; the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of New Zealand report that there are 12 serious accidents per 100, 000 flying hours which result in 4 deaths, almost 2 annually. Agricultural aviation stakeholders, including, the Department of Labour, Civil Aviation Authority, New Zealand Agricultural Aviation Association (NZAAA) and Federated Farmers are trying {{to reduce the number of}} incidents in the sector by establishing guidelines for airstrips, fertiliser storage facilities, their use and application from them. A large proportion of incidents have, as contributing factors, poor flowing product which cannot be jettisoned in time to avert an accident, collisions with obstructions near the airstrip (20 % of all accidents are aircraft hitting fences in proximity to the airstrip) and damage to aircraft due to an inappropriate surface, such as rutting. The New Zealand topdressing industry handles many products of which only a few are homogenous e. g. Urea and fresh Di-ammonium phosphate. The majority of spreading being undertaken involves products with large variations in particle size and moisture content producing particles from fine dust to concretions. These characteristics make it very difficult to achieve continuous flow and even spreading from an aircraft. There have been a disproportionate number of accidents and near misses in the New Zealand topdressing industry that have occurred whilst spreading agricultural limestone (lime). Lime has been identified as being particularly problematic and is being used as a focus for this study. Superphosphate, which is used as a flow standard in New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority rules, is used as a comparison in powder flow engineering experiments. This thesis is a prescribed project concerned with solving specific problems for industry mainly funded by the Fertiliser Manufacturers’ Research Association. Specific objectives/aims of the project: 1. Quantify the flow characteristic of products being spread and identify risks within the system, identifying risk materials and risk situations. 2. Develop a better understanding of material variability in terms of characterising the different deposits used around New Zealand and relating these differences to flow properties. 3. Develop a better understanding of the mechanisms creating the variability in flow properties that relate to production processes, transport and storage and finally loading and spreading with topdressing aircraft of the different limes used in New Zealand. 4. Quantify system performance in terms of economic and environmental impacts. 5. Identify suitable test methodologies that can be used within the industry to determine whether a product is fit for spreading and its flow characteristics. These would be dispatch tests at the <b>lime</b> quarry or <b>fertiliser</b> plant and a flowabiltiy test as the material is loaded onto the aircraft. 6. Identify design criteria that determine the performance of aircraft in relation to safety, flow control and spreading performance. Work with the interested parties to improve work quality and safety associated with agricultural aviation systems. Flow properties have been quantified using a shear testing regime and engineering design parameters established for mass flow have been calculated from interpreting the powder flow functions. However, as the material from each quarry has variations in particle size distributions caused by factors such as the moisture of the parent limestone, age of the crushing hammers and time being crushed; the results are only an instantaneous solution. All commonly used products except lime are free flowing and shear testing was undertaken on superphosphate samples as a comparison. All the limes tend to be on the cohesive – easy flow boundary. Limes from throughout New Zealand have been classified by mineralogy, have been analysed by thermal decomposition and have had impurities identified through X-ray diffraction. Although there were differences in the particle size distributions and loose and tapped bulk densities between the limes, helium pycnometry testing showed the limes to have similar particle densities. In order to achieve free flow conditions with these products they require modification. The simplest modification that proved effective was the removal of fine particles. This had the effect of reducing the particle size distribution which is important in reducing the packing density and cohesive strength. This was also achieved by only having particles within a narrow particle size range, by removing the fine particles the cohesive strength was reduced and the materials were free flowing. Although this can be done there is clearly a cost involved, the industry is already struggling with reduced demand and any increase in cost is likely to be unwelcome even though it could help to save pilots’ lives and improve the quality of spread achieved. This thesis considers three aspects of topdressing costs in order to estimate the actual costs of spreading <b>fertiliser</b> and <b>lime.</b> The questions posed are; what are the actual costs of operating the two main models of aircraft flown in New Zealand? What size of aircraft fleet is required to fulfil the spreading requirements? What are the on-farm infrastructure costs that also need to be considered in order to calculate the true costs of servicing the application of fertiliser to our hill country sector? Topdressing services mainly the sheep and beef sectors which contribute 22. 5 % of New Zealand’s agricultural output. Farm income in this sector is nearly $ 4 billion. Application of fertiliser is important to sector productivity and the possible collapse of the topdressing industry would have far reaching consequences for these farming sectors and New Zealand’s export earnings. The model finds that there is no financial return on capital invested in the industry. Therefore, the best returns are found by applying fertiliser from old aircraft with aged support vehicles all with little capital value. This is clearly unsustainable as even old aircraft require large injections of capital periodically to maintain airworthiness. As fertiliser prices have increased, application rates have fallen, which increases application cost per tonne applied. The agreed fixed price charging model is traditionally based on an application charge per tonne. It is likely that farmers perceive increased application charges per tonne as a price increase, whereas it is only compensating the applicator for the additional time of sowing at a lower rate. It is clear that although farmers buy fertiliser on a cost per tonne basis this is not the activity based cost driver for the aerial applicator. Converting the cost per hour aircraft cost driver, to a cost per tonne for charging farmers; is confusing as application charges alter by rate and product. The industry needs to alter its charging mechanism to a cost per aircraft flying hour activity based charging regime...|$|R
