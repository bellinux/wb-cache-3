It is a {{revised version of}} Costa and McCrae's (1978) NEO Personality Inventory. The NEO PI-R consists of 240 items. A shortened version, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), comprises 60 items (12 items per domain). Both the NEO PI-R and NEO-FFI have been updated over the years, with their <b>last</b> <b>updates</b> in 2010. While the NEO PI-R is still published, the NEO Personality Inventory-3 (NEO PI-3) is the 2010 revision of the NEO PI-R. The NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 (NEO-FFI-3) is the 2010 revision of the NEO-FFI. The revised inventories feature updated norms.|$|E

It was the 1,712 cc boxer from the 1.7 QV, fitted with Bosch 3.1 LE Jetronic {{electronic fuel injection}} and electronic ignition as well; it developed , slightly less than the carburetted version. In some countries it was also marketed in a catalytic converter-equipped variant. The 1.7 IE was distinguished from other models by the Quadrifoglio's side skirts, slate grey painted bumpers, and velour upholstery. At the same time all models got some cosmetic tweaks: the upper bar in the grille was now matched to body colour, there was Glen plaid cloth upholstery on base models, and Quadrifoglio Verdes sported red piping across the front end, where bumper and grille met.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{extended}} {{searches for}} exoplanets carried out over large {{samples of the}} stellar population raised new needs. A deep investigation in the nature and origin of the new planet population could be foreseen only on a well-characterized stellar population. LAM {{is part of the}} COROT exoplanet search and the SPHERE project. Two information systems have been implemented based on the SITools framework ([URL] Most of the databases include data with extra information processed at LAM: astrophysical quantities and statistical results, cross-identification algorithms, rotation curves. The goal of the databases from LAM is not only to provide data but valuable information on these data. While some data will soon be released to the community, we present the <b>last</b> <b>updates</b> of the EXODAT Information System including specific conesearch and free VO access to the community.

For this reason, it is necessary to complement traditional security solutions by adding soft security mechanisms, which take care of trust, in order to determine whether a web service and its provider are performing as they should. An extensible model for a trust evaluation system is presented for this purpose. It determines some parameters important in enterprise and Future Internet environments and it defines how to calculate the perceived trust by applying a three round algorithm with fuzzy logic. It exploits services semantics and it takes into account <b>last</b> <b>updates</b> about the service, consistency rules based on the semantic relationships between aspects and other specific calculations for each parameter. Semantics are used as well for sharing information with other platforms and federations for improving interoperability in distributed environments...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge to}} database researchers in mobile computing environments {{is to provide}} a data replication solution that maintains the consistency and improves the availability of replicated data. This paper addresses this problem for large scale mobile environments. Our solution represents a new binary hybrid replication strategy in terms of its components and approach. The new strategy encompasses two components: replication architecture to provide a solid infrastructure for improving data availability and a multi-agent based replication method to propagate recent updates between the components of the replication architecture in a manner that improves availability of <b>last</b> <b>updates</b> and achieves the consistency of data. The new strategy is a hybrid of both pessimistic and optimistic replication approaches in order to exploit the features of each. These features are supporting higher availability of recent updates and lower rate of inconsistencies as well as supporting the mobility of users. To model and analyze the stochastic behavior of the replicated system using our strategy, the research developed Stochastic Petri net (SPN) model. Then the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) is derived from the developed SPN and the Markov chain theory is used to obtain the steady state probabilities...|$|E
