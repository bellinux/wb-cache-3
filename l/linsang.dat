5000|$|There are {{two other}} species of <b>linsang,</b> the banded <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon <b>linsang),</b> and the spotted <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon pardicolor). These species belong to the Prionodontidae family and are {{therefore}} more closely related to the Felidae than the Viverridae [...]|$|E
50|$|The banded <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon <b>linsang)</b> is a <b>linsang,</b> a tree-dwelling {{carnivorous}} mammal of the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, {{and western}} Java.|$|E
50|$|The Asiatic <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon) is a genus {{comprising}} {{two species}} native to Southeast Asia: the banded <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon <b>linsang)</b> and the spotted <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon pardicolor). Prionodon is considered basal to the Feliformia {{and a sister}} taxon of the Felidae.|$|E
50|$|African <b>linsangs</b> {{are white}} or cream in color on their ventral side, while the dorsal sides have dark {{circular}} marks. Sometimes {{an individual can}} have a black thin stripe that runs from the nose {{to the root of}} the tail. Its tail holds 10 to 14 rings which differ in measurement. The soles of the <b>linsang's</b> feet are covered with hair.|$|R
50|$|Like all <b>linsangs,</b> African <b>linsangs</b> vary in colour, and {{resemble}} {{an elongated}} cat. They grow to {{a length of}} 33-43 cm (13-17 inches) for both sexes, excluding a banded tail that is {{almost as long as}} the body. They have slender bodies, relatively narrow heads, elongated muzzles, retractile claws, and dense, close fur. They weigh only 500-700 grams (1-1.5 lbs).|$|R
50|$|Felidae's closest {{relatives}} {{are thought to}} be the Asiatic <b>linsangs.</b> Together with the Viverridae, hyenas, mongooses, and Madagascar carnivores, they form the suborder Feliformia.|$|R
50|$|Leighton's <b>linsang</b> (Poiana leightoni), {{also known}} as the West African <b>linsang</b> and West African oyan, is a <b>linsang</b> species native to the Upper Guinean forests.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>linsang</b> (Poiana richardsonii), {{also called}} Central African oyan, is a <b>linsang</b> species native to Central Africa.|$|E
50|$|Leighton's <b>linsang</b> was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of African <b>linsang</b> Poiana richardsonii, {{but is now}} regarded as a separate species.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>linsangs</b> {{also known}} as oyans are two species {{classified}} in the mammalian subfamily Viverrinae, in the family Viverridae. There is one genus, Poiana.|$|R
50|$|Very {{little is}} known about this <b>linsang's</b> reproduction. It is {{believed}} that litters of 2-3 are born semiannually in a nest in burrows or hollow trees.|$|R
50|$|Family Prionodontidae (the Asiatic <b>linsangs)</b> has two extant {{species in}} one genus. They live in Southern-East Asia. All are {{arboreal}} hypercarnivorans. They are the closest living {{relatives of the}} family Felidae.|$|R
50|$|The spotted <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon pardicolor) is a <b>linsang</b> found {{throughout}} much of Southeast Asia. It is widely, though usually sparsely, recorded, and listed as Least Concern by IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>linsang</b> {{is largely}} arboreal.|$|E
50|$|The banded <b>linsang</b> is carnivorous. Its diet {{consists}} of squirrels, rats, birds, and lizards.|$|E
50|$|Some {{authorities}} {{are of the}} opinion that the subfamily Prionodontinae, which consists of two extant species of Asiatic <b>linsangs</b> in the genus Prionodon, should be regarded as a family in its own right.|$|R
50|$|Palaeogale is an extinct genus of {{carnivorous}} mammal {{known from}} the Late Eocene, Oligocene, and Early Miocene of North America, Europe, and Eastern Asia. A small carnivore often associated with the mustelids, Palaeogale might have been similar to living genets, civets, and <b>linsangs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The family Viverridae {{is made up}} of 35 species, {{including}} all of the genets, the binturong, most of the civets, and the four <b>linsangs.</b> Favoured habitats include woodland, savanna, mountains and, above all, tropical rainforest. In consequence, many are faced with severe loss of habitat. The following Viverridae are reported by the Department of National Parks to be living in the wild in Phitsanulok Province: ...|$|R
50|$|The banded <b>linsang</b> {{is around}} 74 cm long {{including}} the tail. It is a pale yellow with 5 dark bands. It has broad stripes on its neck and its tail consists of several dark bands {{with a dark}} tip. The banded <b>linsang</b> has very sharp retractable claws and razor sharp teeth. It is the rarest of the civets, and is sometimes called the tiger-civet.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the animals}} in the park, the {{following}} deserve mention: Asian elephant, deer, gaur, banteng, leopard, spotted <b>linsang,</b> pileated gibbon and tiger.|$|E
50|$|The banded <b>linsang</b> {{lives in}} Western Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, Western Java, and Thailand. It lives in {{tropical}} forests and spends {{the majority of}} its time in trees.|$|E
50|$|Chitwan is {{considered}} to have the highest population density of sloth bears with an estimated 200 to 250 individuals. Smooth-coated otters inhabit the numerous creeks and rivulets. Bengal foxes, spotted <b>linsangs</b> and honey badgers roam the jungle for prey. Striped hyenas prevail on the southern slopes of the Churia Hills. During a camera trapping survey in 2011, wild dogs were recorded in the southern and western parts of the park, as well as golden jackals, fishing cats, jungle cats, leopard cats, large and small Indian civets, Asian palm civets, crab-eating mongooses and yellow-throated martens.|$|R
50|$|The Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program (CPCP) is {{dedicated}} to the conservation of small carnivores (civets, <b>linsangs,</b> small cats, weasels, otters and badgers) and pangolins in Vietnam. The program was established in 1995 as a species specific program for the endangered Owston's civet and has since expanded to include all species of small carnivore. In 2006 the program also began focused conservation activities for Vietnam's two species of pangolin, the Chinese pangolin and the Sunda pangolin. All of these species are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade which is having a devastating impact on the wild populations of these species throughout South East Asia.|$|R
50|$|The {{ancestor}} of all Feliformia {{evolved from the}} Caniformia-Feliformia split. Nandinia, the African palm civet, {{seems to be the}} most primitive of all the feliforms and the very first to split from the others. The Asiatic <b>linsangs</b> of the genus Prionodon (traditionally placed in the Viverridae) form a family of their own, as some recent studies indicate that Prionodon is actually the closest living relative to the cats. The Nimravidae are sometimes seen as the most basal of all feliforms and the first to split from the others, but {{there is a possibility that}} Nimravidae might not even belong within the order, and therefore its position as a clade within Carnivora is currently unstable. Other studies indicate that the barbourofelids form a separate family, which is closely related to the true felids instead of being related to the nimravids. Recognizable nimravid fossils date from the late Eocene (37 mya), from the Chadronian White River Carnivora Formation at Flagstaff Rim, Wyoming. Nimravid diversity appears to have peaked about 28 mya. The hypercarnivorous (strictly meat-eating) nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 mya and felids did not arrive in North America until the early middle Miocene (16 mya).|$|R
50|$|Leighton's <b>linsang</b> {{is similar}} to the African <b>linsang,</b> It is a small, thin viverrid which has a body length {{measures}} between 30 to 38 cm long, the tail is 35 to 40 cm long, giving a total length of 65 to 78 cm, it weighs 500 to 700 g. The base colour of the pelage is yellowish brown on the back and whitish on the underparts. The back is patterned with irregular patches of dark colour with a dark band along the spine, although this can sometimes be interrupted.|$|E
50|$|The Viverrinae {{range in}} size from the African <b>linsang</b> with a body length of 33 cm and a weight of 650 g to the African civet at 84 cm and 18 kg.|$|E
5000|$|The name <b>linsang</b> is from Javanese <b>linsang</b> or wlinsang, {{which used}} to be wrongly {{translated}} as [...] "otter" [...] in English dictionaries. Linsangs are nocturnal, generally solitary tree dwellers. They are carnivorous, eating squirrels and other rodents, small birds, lizards and insects. Typical size is a little over 30 cm (1 foot), with a tail that more than doubles that length. Bodies are long, with short legs, giving a low appearance. Both species have yellowish bodies with black markings (stripes, blotches and spots), though the distribution and nature of the markings varies between the two species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superfamily}} Feloidea (or suborder Feliformia)- Felidae (cats), Prionodontidae (Asiatic <b>linsangs),</b> Herpestidae (mongooses), Hyaenidae (hyenas), Viverridae (civets), and Eupleridae (Malagasy carnivorans), {{as well as}} the extinct family Nimravidae (paleofelids) - {{often have}} spotted, rosetted or striped coats, and tend to be more brilliantly colored than their Canoidean counterparts. This is because these species tend to range in tropical habitats, although a few species do inhabit temperate and subarctic habitats. Many are arboreal or semiarboreal, and the majority are digitigrade. Diet tends to be more strictly carnivorous, especially in the family Felidae. They have fewer teeth and shorter skulls, with much more specialized carnassials meant for shearing meat. Feliformia claws are often retractile, or rarely, semiretractile. The terminal phalanx, with the claw attached, folds back in the forefoot into a sheath by the outer side of the middle phalanx of the digit, and is retained in this position when at rest by a strong elastic ligament. In the hindfoot, the terminal joint or phalanx is retracted on to the top, and not the side of the middle phalanx. Deep flexor muscles straighten the terminal phalanges, so the claws protrude from their sheaths, and the soft [...] "velvety" [...] paw becomes suddenly converted into a formidable weapon. The habitual retraction of the claws preserves their points from wear.|$|R
50|$|Leighton's <b>linsang</b> {{is found}} in the {{tropical}} forests of Liberia and the Ivory Coast, its occurrence in the Kounounkan forest in the south west of Guinea requires confirmation. It is an inhabitant of the canopy of tropical forests.|$|E
50|$|The spotted <b>linsang</b> is nocturnal and solitary. It uses hollows {{in trees}} as resting and denning sites. It hunts {{on the ground}} and in trees and feeds on rodents, frogs and snakes. It was also {{observed}} feeding on carcass.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the spotted <b>linsang</b> {{includes}} eastern Nepal, Sikkim, Assam and Bengal in India, Bhutan, northeastern Myanmar, northern Thailand, Laos, northern Vietnam, and western Sichuan, Yunnan Guizhou and southwestern Guangxi in southern China. It is uncommon to rare throughout this range.It is rarely observed in northern Bengal.|$|E
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} is home {{to several}} mammals, birds, snakes and fish species. Mammal species include leopard cat, spotted <b>linsang,</b> Asiatic wild dog, Malay treeshrew, common otter and slow loris. Birds include goosander, Himalayan pied kingfisher and great pied hornbill. Several poisonous snakes are found including the cobra, king cobra and banded krait.|$|E
50|$|Also in the civet {{family are}} the spotted <b>linsang</b> and binturong, {{which is also}} known as the bearcat. The binturong, which are common in Southeast Asia, is also found in {{southern}} Yunnan. The spotted linsang's range extends from Tibet to Guangdong. These two species, along with the large and small Indian civets, are Class II protected species.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>linsang</b> is {{endemic to}} Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo. It lives in lowland and montane forests.The species {{is said to}} live at {{elevations}} of 950 m in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and at 300 - 500 m in north-eastern Gabon.|$|E
50|$|Their flesh-shearing carnassial {{teeth are}} {{relatively}} undeveloped. Most viverrid species have a penis bone (a baculum). Viverrids {{range in size}} from the African <b>linsang</b> with a body length of 33 cm and a weight of 650 g to the African civet at 84 cm and 18 kg, although very large binturongs, which can weigh up to 25 kg, attain the greatest mass.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{based on}} 29 species of Carnivora, comprising 13 species of Viverrinae and three species representing Paradoxurus, Paguma and Hemigalinae, confirmed Pocock's {{assumption that the}} African <b>linsang</b> Poiana represents the sister-group of the genus Genetta. The placement of Prionodon as the sister-group of the family Felidae is strongly supported, and it was proposed that the Asiatic linsangs {{be placed in the}} monogeneric family Prionodontidae.|$|E
