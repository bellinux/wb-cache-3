50|$|Since the CIB is an {{accumulated}} {{light of}} individual sources {{there is always}} a somewhat different number of sources in different directions in the field of view of the observer. This cause a variation (fluctuation) in the total amount of observed incoming flux among the different line of sights. These fluctuations are traditionally described by the two dimensional autocorrelation function, or by the corresponding Fourier power spectrum. The detection of fluctuations is easier than the direct CIB measurements, since one does not need to determine the absolute photometric zero point - fluctuations can be derived from differential measurements. On the other hand, fluctuations do not provide an immediate information on the CIB brightness. The measured fluctuation amplitudes either has to be confronted with a CIB model that has a prediction for the fluctuation / absolute <b>level</b> <b>ratio,</b> or it has to be compared with integrated differential light levels of source counts at the same wavelength.|$|E

The specific antibody levels in the serum samples were expressed as micrograms of antibody protein per milliliter of serum. For RIA the polysaccharide was radiolabeled extrinsically with 125 I. Both native polysaccharide and polysaccharide labeled with 127 I were used in ELISA. Because these antigens gave similar results, {{it can be concluded}} that the introduction of tyramine and iodine by the labeling procedure did not alter the antigenic activity of the polysaccharide. The reproducibility of RIA was clearly better than that of ELISA. The antibody levels detected by the methods were equal, which means that ELISA can be used satisfactorily to measure antibodies to meningococcal group A polysaccharide quantitatively. Some discrepant results were found due to an underestimation of immunoglobulin M antibodies in ELISA. This was shown by a correlation test in which a weakly significant negative correlation was found between the immunoglobulin M antibody level/immunoglobulin G antibody <b>level</b> <b>ratio</b> and the RIA antibody level/ELISA antibody <b>level</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular {{calcification}} may be {{an important}} risk factor of cardiovascular disease in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The pathobiology of vascular calcification in CKD is complex and involves some factors including inflammation, oxidative stress and balancing of calcification regulators. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the interaction between 8 -isoprostane with calcification regulators such as matrix gla protein (MGP) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 2 with vascular calciication in CKD. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 63 subjects undergoing haemodialysis maintenance for more than 3 months. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was measured using a lateral abdominal X-ray for calcification in abdominal aorta, which is related to severity of calcific deposits at lumbar vertebral segment (L) 1 -L 4. Serum levels of 8 -isoprostane, MGP and BMP- 2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS: Results showed that 8 -isoprostane levels were correlated with BMP- 2 (r= 0. 266, p= 0. 018) and MGP levels (r= 0. 410, p≤ 0. 001). MGP/BMP- 2 <b>levels</b> <b>ratio</b> was correlated with AAC score (r= 0. 279, p= 0. 013). Subjects were then stratified into 3 groups based on AAC score: 0, 1 - 6 and ≥ 7. The highest mean of MGP levels was in AAC score 1 - 6 group, and the highest mean of 8 -isoprostane levels was in AAC score ≥ 7. In the group of AAC score 0, 8 -isoprostane levels were correlated with MGP levels (r= 0. 499, p= 0. 001) and MGP/BMP- 2 <b>levels</b> <b>ratio</b> (r= 0. 291, p= 0. 034). In AAC score 1 - 6 group, 8 -isoprostane levels were correlated with BMP- 2 (r= 0. 661, p= 0. 005) and MGP levels (r= 0. 569, p= 0. 017). In AAC score ≥ 7 group, MGP levels were positively correlated with AAC score (r= 0. 608, p= 0. 041). With multivariate logistic regression analyses, we identified that increased MGP/BMP- 2 <b>levels</b> <b>ratio</b> (OR= 12. 436; 95 % CI= 1. 595 - 96. 971) was an independent predictor in aortic calcification event. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that regulators of calcification including calcification inhibitor and promoter related to oxidative stress, were associated with vascular calcification in CKD. MGP levels were increased in the early of calcification and MGP/BMP- 2 <b>levels</b> <b>ratio</b> was a strong predictor for vascular calcification in CKD.

40|$|Abstract Background Leadership and {{staffing}} are recognised as important factors for quality of care. This study examines {{the effects of}} ward leaders' task- and relationship-oriented leadership styles, staffing <b>levels,</b> <b>ratio</b> of registered nurses and ratio of unlicensed staff on three independent measures of quality of care. Methods A cross-sectional survey of forty nursing home wards throughout Norway was used to collect the data. Five sources of data were utilised: self-report questionnaires to 444 employees, interviews with and questionnaires to 13 nursing home directors and 40 ward managers, telephone interviews with 378 relatives and 900 hours of field observations. Separate multi-level analyses were conducted for quality of care assessed by relatives, staff and field observations respectively. Results Task-oriented leadership style had a significant positive relationship {{with two of the}} three quality of care indexes. In contrast, relationship-oriented leadership style was not significantly related to any of the indexes. The lack of significant effect for relationship-oriented leadership style was due to a strong correlation between the two leadership styles (r = 0. 78). Staffing <b>levels</b> and <b>ratio</b> of registered nurses were not significantly related to any of the quality of care indexes. The ratio of unlicensed staff, however, showed a significant negative relationship to quality as assessed by relatives and field observations, but not to quality as assessed by staff. Conclusions Leaders in nursing homes should focus on active leadership and particularly task-oriented behaviour like structure, coordination, clarifying of staff roles and monitoring of operations to increase quality of care. Furthermore, nursing homes should minimize use of unlicensed staff and address factors related to high ratios of unlicensed staff, like low staff stability. The study indicates, however, that the relationship between staffing <b>levels,</b> <b>ratio</b> of registered nurses and quality of care is complex. Increasing staffing <b>levels</b> or the <b>ratio</b> of registered nurses alone is not likely sufficient for increasing quality of care. </p...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{cumulative}} approach proposes {{the use of}} debt <b>level</b> <b>ratio</b> as the dependent variable. In this case, tax proxies are adjusted in some way {{in order not to}} produce a spurious relationship with debt policy.

40|$|The {{merit of}} {{evolutionary}} algorithms (EA) to solve convex optimization problems is widely acknowledged. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization based waveform design framework {{is used to}} improve the features of radar pulses relying on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) structure. Our optimization techniques focus on finding optimal phase code sequences for the OFDM signal. Several optimality criteria are used since we consider two different radar processing solutions which call either for single or multiple-objective optimizations. When minimization of the so-called peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) single-objective is tackled, we compare our findings with existing methods and emphasize on the merit of our approach. In {{the scope of the}} two-objective optimization, we first address PMEPR and peak-to-sidelobe <b>level</b> <b>ratio</b> (PSLR) and show that our approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) provides design solutions with noticeable improvements as opposed to random sets of phase codes. We then look at another case of interest where the objective functions are two measures of the sidelobe level, namely PSLR and the integrated-sidelobe <b>level</b> <b>ratio</b> (ISLR) and propose to modify the NSGA-II to include a constrain on the PMEPR instead. In the last part, we illustrate via a case study how our encoding solution makes it possible to minimize the single objective PMEPR while enabling a target detection enhancement strategy, when the SNR metric would be chosen for the detection framework.
