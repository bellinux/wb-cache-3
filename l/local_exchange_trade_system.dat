40|$|In {{this paper}} a recent type {{of social and}} {{economic}} organization to appear in the United Kingdom [...] the <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> [...] is examined. From comparative research based on interviews with coordinators of six systems the motivation for involvement, the nature of the local money, and the relationship to business and state regulation are explored. The internal coherence of the systems and the relevance of the 'local' is assessed. Contextualized by debates on the nature of economics, where the notion of embeddedness of economic life in social relations is gaining ground, the concept of an active 're-embedding' is introduced in order to explore the significance of <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

It regulates the exchange {{of goods and services}} between the members of the cooperative. Examples for an investment system of complementary currency are the Automatic Social Financial Network (ASFN) and the international crowdsourcing and crowd-funding community Evolution RA whose members use their own complementary virtual currency 'Сyber-gold'. The introductory fee paid by the new association members is subsequently directed toward investments in a variety of commercial projects.|$|R

Wendell Berry may have coined the term [...] "economic secession." [...] He promoted his own version in his 1991 essay Conservation and Local Economy. John T. Kennedy used the term to refer to all human action that is forbidden by the State.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>System</b> (LETS) is {{comprised}} of local members that want to trade goods and services with other members in the group. These LETS use a unique local currency on which all trade is based upon. Those who are in LETS believe that they benefit both the members and the local community due to the organized nature of these LETS. The five core traits of a LETS include “cost of service, consent, disclosure, equivalence to the regional currency, and interest-free.” Member transactions through a LETS {{do not have to}} be solely monetary. A purchase can be repaid through a service performed for the other member involved in the transaction.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the film}} {{presents}} the filmmaker's understanding of modern money creation in a fractional-reserve banking system. New money enters the economy through the indebtedness of borrowers, thus not only obligating the public to the money-issuing private banks but also creating an endless and self-escalating debt that is to eventually outgrow all other forms of wealth generation. The film claims that this ever-increasing gravitation of money to banks is capable of impoverishing any nation. The film finishes by identifying some alternatives to modern banking, such as the nationalization of banks and payment of dividends to the public, establishing <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>systems,</b> or government printing of money.|$|R

5000|$|Reports vary {{about the}} number of {{complementary}} currency exchanges linked up in the network. One report in 2011 suggested that the network consisted of 100 linked exchanges which operated in 15 different countries; a second report counted the number of exchanges at approximately 300 in 30 different countries. One estimate was that there were 2,000 members in 2006 with a total of 6,700 members in 50 groups in eight countries. By 2011, the number of participants in the Cape Town Talent Exchange was estimated to be 4,000. A report in Time Magazine suggested that alternative forms of money are [...] "growing in popularity" [...] in places such as South Africa and elsewhere. Since 2003, when the system was initiated, there have been {{about two and a half}} million talents traded, which was about 500,000 South African rands, according to one estimate. One estimate suggested that the total value of <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> <b>trades</b> worldwide was one billion South African rands in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|Riegel left a great {{legacy of}} {{writings}} and correspondence. ...as he showed so clearly, freedom and prosperity are {{dependent upon the}} liberation of the exchange process from the dominance of political and banking interests, and he showed how private initiative and voluntary action could achieve it. Much of what he proposed and tried to implement in the 1930s and 40's has been reinvented in more recent times {{in the form of}} the mutual credit, LETS (<b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system),</b> and clearing circles that have been proliferating around the world. But there is yet something incomplete about these. Today's initiatives could benefit from the deeper understanding and structural proposals that Riegel shares with us in his works.|$|R
50|$|Collective {{efficacy}} and social capital {{are central to}} two very successful examples of civic-based, non-monetary economies: time banks and <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> (LETS). These work systems provide alternative forms of currency that are gained through {{time spent in the}} community through community gardening, recycling, repairing leaky faucets, babysitting, and other forms of work. These units of time can be used to ask other members of work systems to do jobs they need or may act as a forum in which special jobs or needs can be communicated and <b>traded.</b> These <b>systems</b> operate to a large degree outside of the monetary economy but do not negate the importance of a monetary economy or ask to a return to bartering systems.|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} {{of competition in}} currency provision have been discussed by many authors. 1 There is even a cor-poratist route for the progressive introduction of formal monetary competition. This consists of the estab-lishment of an independent banking regulator — Of-bank — with a private Bank of England contracted {{by the government to}} supply currency. 2 However, pressure on this structure is already foreseeable in the form of <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Systems</b> (Lets) and in the ex-tension by large retail chains of their “discount card” schemes both of which are outlined in this paper.

Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.|$|R

It was the outcome of contacts with the Christian Council for Monetary Justice and organising the Campaign for Interest-Free Money through weekly meetings at the Global Internet Cafe near Piccadilly, London. McNeill had started the first <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>System</b> in London in 1989 and organised Forum meetings mainly at the House of Lords, but also at the House of Commons {{under the auspices of}} Austin Mitchell MP.

50|$|A <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> (also <b>local</b> {{employment}} and <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> or local energy transfer system; abbreviated to LETS or LETSystem) is a locally initiated, democratically organised, not-for-profit community enterprise {{that provides a}} community information service and record transactions of members exchanging goods and services by using the currency of locally created LETS Credits. LETS networks use interest-free local credit so direct swaps {{do not need to}} be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other local currencies, no scrip is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered mutual credit systems.|$|R
