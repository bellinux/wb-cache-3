5|$|By 1902 {{the guns}} had {{together}} fired 219 rounds, {{though not all}} at full charge with the records showing only 125 effective full charges. The platforms and traverses were scrapped in 1937 but the gun barrels were uneconomic to cut up and were <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> One gun platform and its equipment was rebuilt in 1997 using money raised by Fort Glanville Historical Association volunteers working at the Australian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

5|$|Pevensey Castle was reoccupied between 1940 and 1945, {{during the}} Second World War, {{when it was}} garrisoned by units from the Home Guard, the British and Canadian armies and the United States Army Air Corps. Machine-gun posts were built into the Roman and Norman walls to control the flat land around Pevensey and guard against {{the threat of a}} German invasion. They were <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> after the war and can still be seen today. Pevensey is one of many norman castles built around the south of England.|$|E
5|$|Six {{tanks were}} used for each span and <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for three hours; the 18 tanks used in total allowed three spans to be tested simultaneously. At {{the end of the}} three hours the tanks were emptied and dragged along the deck to test further spans. The first six spans passed without problems, but under load the seventh span collapsed, {{bringing}} down the eighth and final span, leaving the pier head and pavilion standing.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with urgent needle decompression. This {{may be required}} before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> until a chest tube can be inserted. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E

The span will be {{replaced}} with a prebuilt bridge in a single weekend with minimal impact to Amtrak and MBTA service on the Corridor, with the old abutments <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> as retaining walls. The design contract was awarded in 2012, and a construction contract was to be awarded in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers {{notified}} the Pittsburgh Stadium Authority in December 2010 of {{their intention to}} add up to 4,000 seats to the lower {{southern end of the}} stadium. The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season. Seating was added in that section for the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, which had an attendance of 68,111. The temporary seating was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, with the AFC Championship game on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} with {{upgrading}} the Wakefield branch was {{the dimensions of}} George Leather's cast iron aqueduct over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry. Structural analysis showed that parts of the ironwork were overloaded, and so in 1981 a new concrete aqueduct was cast by John Laing Construction Ltd, on a site a little further upstream. The complete structure was then pushed into position by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation, after which the navigation was diverted over it, although the old aqueduct was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and can still be used.|$|E

5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} assumed {{ownership of}} the now-disused observatory building and was originally going to abandon it. Louis Beaufort Stewart, a lecturer in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, campaigned {{for it to be}} saved for the Department of Surveying and Geodesy. He eventually arranged for the building to be re-constructed on a more suitable site. Demolition work was carried out in 1907: the stones were simply <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> over the winter, and were used the following year to construct a re-arranged building just east of the main University College building (south of Hart House).|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, MDSHA {{discovered}} the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and aluminum girder structure. Because repairing the structure {{would have been}} extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately {{to the west of}} the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD32 on both sides of the bridge. The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> as a historic landmark after MD32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century it was rented by a farmer for storage. Because of its poor {{condition}} it was recommended for demolition in both 1896 and 1901. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a public appeal {{to raise money}} for repairs to which Jane Morris, Thomas Hardy and George Bernard Shaw contributed. As the funding for the restoration was no longer an issue the building was acquired, in 1911, by the National Trust who employed Ernest Barnsley of the Barnsley brothers, the Arts and Crafts movement master builders, to design and the work. It was carried out by Norman Jewson and William Weir. The work <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and strengthened earlier structures where possible but added new aspects including a stone buttress and a kitchen range.|$|E
5|$|Marmalade Boy was {{licensed}} for an English language {{release in}} North America by Tokyopop. The individual chapters were serialized by the company's manga anthology, Smile, from December 2001 through April 2002. Tokyopop released the first collected {{volume of the}} series on April 23, 2002 and released new volumes monthly until the final volume was released on August 5, 2003. It {{was one of the}} first manga series that Tokyopop released in the original Japanese orientation, in which the book is read from right to left, and with the original sound effects <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> Tokyopop's volumes of the series are out of print. Shueisha refused to renew the company's license of the series after becoming part-owner of rival publisher Viz Media.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers, linked across the central hall by a gallery. The east bedchamber is {{at the front of}} the house, and {{projects}} out into the street—this was a feature used to add space to houses, and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury and York. Some of the makers' marks of the original builders can still be seen on the timbers in the room. The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th-century appearance rather than the medieval, as the Victorian-era ceiling has been <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original, tiled with Cornish slate.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. The judge was appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, {{there was a}} more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{disagree}} {{on the number of}} Bosnian Croat and HV casualties. Their number is variously reported as 160 or 177 killed. The Bosnian Serbs and the JNA sustained losses of 85 killed and 154 taken prisoner of war. The JNA also captured 23 Bosnian Croat TO troops. The figures are reported to include 19 civilian deaths on each side. Even though the Serbian media initially reported that the villages of Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan had been torched and razed to the ground, the information proved to be incorrect—the settlements sustained relatively minor damage. Conversely, Croat- or Bosniak-inhabited villages were looted and torched. Zlosela suffered extensive damage—the village school was the only structure with a roof <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
