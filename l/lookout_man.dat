60|$|The Bonnyclabber's reactionary course had now {{brought her}} to the spot at which I had taken passage. Passengers and crew, {{fatigued}} by their somewhat awkward attempts to manifest their gratitude for our miraculous deliverance from the cloud-bank, were snoring peacefully in unconsidered attitudes about the deck, when the <b>lookout</b> <b>man,</b> perched on the supreme extremity of the mainmast, consuming a cold sausage, began an apparently preconcerted series of extraordinary and unimaginable noises. He coughed, sneezed, and barked simultaneously--bleated in one breath, and cackled in the next--sputteringly shrieked, and chatteringly squealed, with a bass of suffocated roars. There were desolutory vocal explosions, tapering off in long wails, half smothered in unintelligible small-talk. He whistled, wheezed, and trumpeted; began to sharp, thought better of it and flatted; neighed like a horse, and then thundered like a drum! Through it all he continued making incomprehensible signals with one hand while clutching his throat with the other. Presently he gave it up, and silently descended to the deck.|$|E
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} the <b>lookout</b> <b>men</b> on the hill reported a line of sails on the western horizon. Two wings were at first visible, which were gradually united as the topsails of those in the centre rose above the line of sea. As they arose it could be seen that the great fleet was sailing, {{in the form of a}} huge crescent, before a gentle wind. A hundred and fifty ships, large and small, were counted, as a few store ships bound for Flanders had joined the Armada for protection.|$|R
50|$|That evening, William Ward Burrows {{remained}} at anchor {{to the south}} of Johnston Island in an anchorage deemed safe from submarine attack. Comdr. Dierdorff posted full submarine <b>lookouts,</b> fully <b>manned</b> the bridge, and put the engine room on five minutes notice to get underway. Squally weather prevented his using a 40-foot motor launch as picket.|$|R
60|$|Round {{the curve}} of the estuary was coming a huge vessel. Her great yellow {{bowsprit}} and white-winged figure-head were jutting out from the cluster of palm trees, while high above them towered three immense masts with the tricolour flag floating superbly from the mizzen. Round she came, the deep-blue water creaming under her fore foot, until her long, curving, black side, her line of shining copper beneath and of snow-white hammocks above, and the thick clusters of men who peered over her bulwarks were all in full view. Her lower yards were slung, her ports triced up, and her guns run out all ready for action. Lying behind one of the promontories of the island, the <b>lookout</b> <b>men</b> of the Gloire upon the shore had seen the cul de sac into which the British frigate was headed, so that Captain de Milon had served the Leda as Captain Johnson had the Slapping Sal.|$|R
60|$|Then we {{laid out}} our bedding in the bows, among the {{sleeping}} Lascars, to catch any breeze that {{the pace of}} the ship might give us. The sea was like smoky oil, except where it turned to fire under our forefoot and whirled back into the dark in smears of dull flame. There was a thunderstorm some miles away: we could see the glimmer of the lightning. The ship's cow, distressed by the heat and the smell of the ape-beast in the cage, lowed unhappily {{from time to time in}} exactly the same key as the <b>lookout</b> <b>man</b> at the bows answered the hourly call from the bridge. The trampling tune of the engines was very distinct, and the jarring of the ash-lift, as it was tipped into the sea, hurt the procession of hushed noise. Hans lay down by my side and lighted a good-night cigar. This was naturally the beginning of conversation. He owned a voice as soothing as the wash of the sea, and stores of experiences as vast as the sea itself; for his business in life was to wander up and down the world, collecting orchids and wild beasts and ethnological specimens for German and American dealers. I watched the glowing end of his cigar wax and wane in the gloom, as the sentences rose and fell, till I was nearly asleep. The orangoutang, troubled by some dream of the forests of his freedom, began to yell like a soul in purgatory, and to wrench madly at the bars of the cage.|$|E

50|$|A Michigan Historic Marker commemorates the Two-Hearted Life-Saving Station {{built in}} 1876 {{at the river}} mouth. It was a simple two-story {{building}} with a small <b>lookout</b> tower <b>manned</b> by six to eight volunteer surfmen who conducted rescues of the Satellite (1879) and the Phineas S. Marsh (1896). The station, {{along with the rest}} of the United States Life-Saving Service, was integrated into the U.S. Coast Guard in 1915, decommissioned in the 1930s, and its structures were razed in 1944.|$|R

50|$|New Zealand's last whaling {{station was}} in Whekenui Bay in Tory Channel in the Marlborough Sounds. The high cliffs at the {{entrance}} of Tory Channel are ideal for land-based whale watching. During the migratory season for whales, the <b>lookout</b> is <b>manned</b> and whales passing Cook Strait are watched for research purposes. Most of the volunteers undertaking the work are ex-whalers. It is also the location where the first Southern right whale on main islands sighted since the end of whaling. Cetaceans can be seen in Waikawa, Picton, French Pass, and in Abel Tasman National Park as well.|$|R
50|$|The Copper Mountain Fire Lookout {{was built}} in 1934 {{in what was then}} the Glacier Ranger {{district}} of Mount Baker National Forest. The cabin-like wood frame lookout is a frame cabin with large windows on each side protected by an awning-style shutter. A shingled gable roof with prominent lightning rods covers the cabin. The lookout measures 14.25 ft by 14.25 ft square. During the winter of 1943 the <b>lookout</b> was <b>manned</b> by the Aircraft Warning Service, watching for enemy aircraft. It is one of three lookouts remaining in North Cascades National Park from the Forest Service administration.|$|R

50|$|The Wild Bunch was {{conceived}} following the Dalton Gang's botched train robbery in Adair, Oklahoma Territory, on July 15, 1892, during which two guards and two townspeople, both doctors, were wounded. One {{of the doctors}} died the next day. Bob Dalton told Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce {{that he no longer}} needed them. Doolin and his friends returned to their hideout in Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory. It was fortunate for the three, because on October 5, the Dalton Gang was wiped out in Coffeyville, Kansas. Grat and Bob Dalton, Dick Broadwell, and Bill Power were killed; however, Emmett Dalton survived the incident, despite receiving 23 gunshot wounds. Speculation is that Bill Doolin was in an alleyway as a <b>lookout</b> <b>man,</b> which leads some to say that Bill Doolin was in fact still a member of the Gang.|$|E
50|$|In September 1911, McCurdy and {{two other}} men robbed The Citizens Bank in Chautauqua, Kansas. After {{spending}} two hours breaking through the bank wall with a hammer, McCurdy placed a nitroglycerin charge around {{the door of the}} bank's outer vault. The blast blew the vault door through the bank destroying the interior, but did not damage the safe inside the vault. McCurdy then tried to blow the safe door open with nitroglycerin but the charge failed to ignite. After the <b>lookout</b> <b>man</b> got scared and ran off, McCurdy and his accomplices stole about $150 in coins that were in a tray outside the safe and fled. Later that night, the men hopped a train which took them to the Kansas border. They split up and McCurdy {{made his way to the}} ranch of a friend, Charlie Revard, near Bartlesville, Oklahoma. He stayed in a hayshed on the property for the next few weeks and drank heavily.|$|E

50|$|Kay {{is called}} to a meeting with Flood, and at Flood's apartment, she {{encounters}} some of his other associates: Roy, Flood's gopher and a slightly perverse, self-involved fitness enthusiast; and <b>lookout</b> <b>man</b> Harry, who has brought his slatternly girl friend, Doll, with him. Although Frank warned her against it, Kay tells Flood that she intends to leave after the heist, but insists {{that she is not}} involved with anyone else, and that Frank is loyal to him. After Flood and the others show up in San Felipe, Doll demands a cut of the robbery, prompting Flood to order Roy to kill her. Flood then explains to Harry that Doll split after he gave her some money. Flood goes over the final plans for the robbery, in which Zimmer is to create several explosions, including one at the high school as well as one at the electric power plant (thus disabling the bank vault's alarm system).|$|E
50|$|Haicke Petrus Marinus Janssen {{was born}} in 1885 in Kampen, Netherlands. He was a {{bookkeeper}} in Amsterdam {{before he became a}} sailor. In 1913, he was working on the Belgian Red Star Line’s SS Kroonland as a <b>lookout</b> <b>man</b> when she came to the rescue of the Uranium Steamship Company’s SS Volturno after that ship caught fire in the Atlantic Ocean. The United States and United Kingdom awarded him and other seamen involved a medal for rescuing the Volturno’s passengers and crew. On 12 May 1915 Janssen left Rotterdam for Hull. He arrived there the next day and stayed for a week before travelling south to London and further on to Southampton on the pretext of being a travelling cigar salesman. In Southampton, he stayed in the Crown Hotel from 24 to 28 May and sent five telegrams to the firm Dierks & Co. in The Hague. Not long after, Janssen was arrested by Scotland Yard detectives on suspicion of espionage on behalf of Germany. Dierks & co. was already known to MI5 to be a front company of the German secret service.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} several threats, D'Or was {{fatally shot}} {{four times and}} killed by Billy Alexander for US $2,000 at 8:55 p.m. on Friday, March 15, 1991. At {{the time he was}} standing outside his office close to the intersection of Northeast Second Avenue and 59th Street in Little Haiti, in Miami, Florida. Police later found a death list with D'Or's name on it, as well as two other prominent Haitian journalists.Billy Alexander, a Haitian American, was convicted of killing D'Or. It was alleged that Alexander, born ca. 1970, was contracted to kill D'Or for his opposition to Louis Thermitus, a local record store owner, who D'Or had accused of {{being a member of the}} Tonton Macoute and of supporting the regime that had ousted Haiti's elected President Aristide. At the time of his arraignment and later his conviction for the murder of D'Or and Jean-Claude Olivier, another radio journalist, Alexander was serving a life sentence for killing Alcee Lissitte during an unrelated incident of robbery. The <b>lookout</b> <b>man</b> for the contract killing, Glossy Bruce Joseph, was arrested in May 1991 and later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in 1993. Hitler Fleurinord was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and accused of being the driver. Thermitus was never implicated or charged in the murders.|$|E
