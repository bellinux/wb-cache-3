5|$|A medical {{program was}} {{established}} at Los Alamos under Captain James F. Nolan of the United States Army Medical Corps. Initially, a small five-bed infirmary was established for civilians, and a three-bed infirmary for military personnel. More serious cases were {{handled by the}} Army's Bruns General Hospital in Santa Fe, but this was soon regarded as unsatisfactory due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> due to the long trip, and security risks. Nolan recommended that the infirmaries be consolidated and expanded into a 60-bed hospital. A 54-bed hospital was opened in 1944, staffed by Army personnel. A dentist arrived in March 1944. A Veterinary Corps officer, Captain J. Stevenson, had already been assigned {{to look after the}} guard dogs.|$|E
5|$|At 09:50 on 23 August, a U.S. PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (based at Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands) {{initially}} sighted Tanaka's convoy. By late afternoon, with no further sightings of Japanese ships, two aircraft strike forces from Saratoga and Henderson Field took off {{to attack the}} convoy. However, Tanaka, knowing that an attack would be forthcoming following the PBY sighting, reversed course once he had departed the area, and eluded the strike aircraft. After Tanaka reported to his superiors his <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike, the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August. By 18:23 on 23 August, with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of {{their presence in the}} area, Fletcher detached Wasp (which was getting low on fuel) and the rest of TF18 for the two-day trip south toward Efate Island to refuel. Thus, Wasp and her escorting warships missed the upcoming battle.|$|E

500|$|Robert Hues {{was born}} in 1553 at Little Hereford in Herefordshire, England. In 1571, {{at the age of}} 18 years, he entered Brasenose College, University of Oxford. English {{antiquarian}} Anthony à Wood (1632–1695) wrote that when Hues arrived at Oxford he was [...] "only a poor scholar or servitor... he continued for some time a very sober and serious servant... but being sensible of the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> which he sustained there by constant attendance, he transferred himself to St Mary's Hall". Hues graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree on 12 July 1578, having shown marked skill in Greek. He later gave advice to the dramatist and poet George Chapman for his 1616 English translation of Homer, and Chapman referred to him as his [...] "learned and valuable friend". According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, there is unsubstantiated evidence that after completing his degree Hues was held in the Tower of London, though no reason is given for this, then went abroad after his release. It is possible he travelled to Continental Europe.|$|E

500|$|On 10 March 2015, weekly {{newspaper}} Respekt published more {{details of the}} police engagement. By chance, an emergency motorized police unit, which usually serve as immediate reinforcement to police officers in the field, was conducting exercises not far from Uherský Brod. The unit arrived within twenty minutes of the first emergency call. Heavily armed and well trained, their officer in charge gave order to immediately engage the perpetrator. Within a minute, the local police station chief arrived and ordered them to stand down, began securing the perimeter, gathering information, and preparing an engagement plan. Meanwhile, [...] called the emergency line 158 and mentioned he had five unharmed hostages and was demanding the presence of TV Prima. The officer in charge ordered the policemen to stand down {{just as they were}} about to enter the building in order to start negotiating. At that time, he could not have been aware of the status of victims inside. Fifteen minutes later, the Zlín region police chief arrived. In total, the command over the operation was passed between five people within the initial 40 minutes. The fact that the police rules allow passing of command during engagement had been condemned a week earlier by Member of Parliament Stanislav Huml, who pointed out to the Czech firemen's rules, according to which the first person in charge at the place of engagement remains in charge even if a general happens to come to join an operation afterwards. He noted that the passing of command requires briefing which not only leads to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but often also to subsequent mistakes.|$|E
