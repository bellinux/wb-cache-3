No. 46245 was the first, in December 1957; a further fifteen examples followed between May and November 1958. The style of <b>lining</b> varied: the first six repaints into maroon (including No. 46245) were lined out in the LMS style; the last ten received the BR style of <b>lining</b> as used on the standard green livery; No. 46247, originally lined in the LMS style, was given the BR style in July 1959; and by November 1961 those with the BR <b>lining</b> were repainted to match No. 46245.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with {{a black and white}} striped <b>lining</b> on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, the black and white colours were also revived, with a gold <b>lining</b> also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black <b>lining</b> with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.|$|E

5|$|In 1938 {{the second}} five {{locomotives}} of the class, Nos. 6225–6229 (named after Duchesses) were also built in streamlined form {{at an average}} cost of £11,323 each. They were painted in the same shade of crimson lake which had already been applied to the Princess Royal class; the same style of horizontal <b>lining</b> {{that had been a}} feature of the first five locomotives was continued, but in gilt. Although the crimson lake matched the standard LMS rolling stock, there was no attempt to apply the gilt <b>lining</b> along the sides of these coaches. A prototype trainset was built with such <b>lining</b> for exhibition in America, but it was never put into service due to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Several {{variations}} of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid malachite green liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow <b>lining,</b> some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War, {{members of the class}} under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green, with yellow/black <b>lining,</b> and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos.782 and 800, Sir Brian and Sir Persant) did not receive this livery.|$|E

5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style <b>lining.</b> The <b>lining</b> comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E

5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells <b>lining</b> the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells <b>lining</b> the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
