5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC <b>line</b> <b>input</b> to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC <b>line</b> <b>input.</b> When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

40|$|Mark de Berg Jit Bose David Bremner William Evans Lata Narayanan 1 Introduction Suppose {{the only}} access {{we have to}} an {{arrangement}} of n <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> is to "probe" the arrangement with horizontal lines. A probe returns the set of probe points which are the intersections of the probe's horizontal line (the probe <b>line)</b> with all <b>input</b> <b>lines.</b> We assume {{that none of the}} <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> is horizontal, so a probe <b>line</b> intersects every <b>input</b> <b>line.</b> Our goal is to reconstruct the set of <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> using a small number of probes. Aoki, Imai, Imai, and Rappaport [1] observed that if one is allowed to place the probe lines after seeing the results of previous probes, then the number of probes required is at most three. This paper addresses the problem of fixed probes; in our setting the locations of the probes must be chosen before the input is examined. We show that for each natural number n there is a set of n + 1 probe lines that will serve to determine any arrangement of n <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> and that [...] ...|$|R

The impedance of a <b>line</b> <b>input</b> is typically around 10 kΩ. When driven by a line output's usual low impedance of 100 to 600 ohms, this forms a [...] "bridging" [...] connection in which most of the voltage generated by the source (the output) is dropped across the load (the input), and minimal current flows due to the load's relatively high impedance.|$|E
