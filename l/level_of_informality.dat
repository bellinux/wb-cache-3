In particular, it is noticeable that working in an informal employment relationship is often not temporary. The degree <b>of</b> persistence <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> {{in the labor market}} might be due to different sources: structural state dependence due to past informality experiences and spurious state dependence due to time-invariant unobserved individual effects, which can alter the propensity of being in the informal sector independently from actual informality experiences. The purpose of our paper is to study the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> using a genuine panel data set in the Ukrainian labor market. By estimating a dynamic panel data probit model with endogenous initial conditions, we find a highly significant degree of persistence due to previous informality experiences.

40|$|Abstract: Economic {{growth and}} {{development}} depends {{to a large extent}} on a fair marketplace, whereby all firms play by the same rules. Effective rule of law and strong regulatory enforcement regimes make this possible in most developed countries. Emerging markets are much less successful in regulating firms, leading to extensive informal economies replete with unregulated firms. These unregulated firms undercut the market by evading the costs associated with legitimate firm operations, skirting taxation and discouraging investment in the formal marketplace. Many emerging market governments have responded to this problem with formalization programs aimed at incentivizing the movement of informal firms into the formal economy. In this paper, we assess a recent and comprehensive formalization program to evaluate its strategy and success. We conclude that an incentivization program like this one, aimed at reducing the costs of doing business, misses the underlying structural deficiencies that lead to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>informality.</b> We recommend a more nuanced approach that addresses productivity before attempting to formalize micro-enterprises...|$|R

30|$|In the {{tradition}} of discrete choice models (Keane and Wolpin 1997), I develop a dynamic behavioral model which captures the individual decision to work either in the formal or the informal sector under {{the characteristics of the}} pension scheme. The individual has to decide whether to work in the formal or informal sector or remain unemployed. This decision depends on the current wage applicable in each sector, the earning paths, and the main institutional characteristics of the pension scheme. Labor supply behavior in the context <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> has been analyzed in some recent papers for the Chilean case (Todd and Velez-Grajales 2008; Attanasio et al. 2011; Otero 2013; Joubert 2015). These papers assess the behavior of individuals or households among the covered and uncovered sectors 2, when changing the rules of the pension system or shaping a pension design. Another contribution of this paper is the kind of dataset used in the analysis: instead of using administrative records, I use survey data. This allows me to work with a direct definition <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> and for the specific case <b>of</b> Argentina where <b>informality</b> is a critical problem. The definition that I use {{is directly related to the}} pension benefit, which I prefer because in developing countries, having a contract does not directly mean having a wide range of benefits. Besides, Argentina presents higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> than Chile, which is one of the main obstacles the model can deal with. Finally, I will only consider salaried male workers to avoid fertility-related decisions in the model.|$|R

Land ownership issues {{are the most}} common rea-son for not registering. Follow-up surveys 15 to 31 months later show higher mean profits, but largely in a few firms that grew rapidly.

The predominant source of financing for social insurance comes from “deductions” from payrolls. These deductions are typically categorized as either “taxes” or “contributions,” but they share the characteristics of both. Any analysis of how best to finance social insurance must thus start from an analysis of social insurance pricing: a decomposition of the insurance component (the true contribution) from the pure tax component (the true tax). Only then can an informed discussion about reforming financing mechanisms proceed.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of the {{introduction}} of unemployment compensation (UC) in countries characterized by pervasive informality. We provide a simple framework to analyze the impact of UC on the allocation of workers between formal and informal activities, as well as the allocation of workers between sectors featuring different incentives to go informal. We show that a reasonable amount of UC may reduce informality, while larger amounts of UC induce large disincentives to go formal because of the level of taxation involved. We also argue that the financing of UC should be part and parcel of a well- conceived UC system. We show that UC finance based on payroll taxes is likely to entail an excess <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> resulting from cross-subsidies between heterogenous sectors. The introduction of a simple layoff tax meant to finance the UC system is then shown to reduce informality, hence highlighting how a well-designed financing scheme may be used as a supplementary instrument to curb informality...|$|E
30|$|An {{issue that}} must {{be kept in mind}} is that the {{exercises}} reported here assume no further changes in the tax and transfer policy. In the model, the household decision to allocate labor to formal or informal activities depends crucially on the tax and transfer scheme. For example, an increase in non-contributory transfers to informal workers may have a sizable effect in the reallocation from formal to informal labor. Recent work by Antón et al. (2012) and Alonso-Ortiz and Leal (2013) shows that both the size and distribution of government transfers between formal and informal workers may {{have a significant effect on}} informality. In this regard, if the Colombian fiscal reform is aimed at increasing labor formality, it is important to guarantee that the scheme of taxes and transfers in the near future will be “dynamically consistent”. Otherwise, a fiscal reform that is accompanied by an increase in transfers to informal workers in the medium term might end up taking the economy back to its pre-reform <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>informality.</b>|$|R
30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the participation path {{of workers in}} the formal and informal sectors throughout {{their lives and their}} pension eligibilities, as well as how the social security scheme can change the aforementioned participation path. High <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> have impacts on the benefits that workers receive, especially their pension benefits. I use Argentinean panel data from 1995 to 2008 to construct a structural discrete choice model which estimates the population’s labor path and their pension eligibilities. I find evidence that low-educated workers have difficulties to obtain a pension by the age of 65 and even by age 70. Policy experiments show that if the parameters are fixed as in the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model, there is a slight reduction in the years worked in the formal sector and the percentage of workers who obtain a Full pension. If the pension requirements (minimum age and years contributing) are stricter, there is an increase in the years spent in the formal sector but it is not sufficient to achieve the benchmark <b>level</b> <b>of</b> pension coverage. If the requirements are looser, there is a reduction in {{the amount of time spent}} in formality to contribute up to the new threshold.|$|R

However, {{a large part of the}} city – the informal sector – performs much worse. This paper assesses the state <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> in Addis Ababa based on a broad definition, considering informal businesses, employment, housing, land services. We conclude that all households take part in informality as consumers and/or producers, with very high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> in employment, services, land and housing. Informal businesses contribute 26 % of urban employment, with relatively low and decreasing value added per person. The informal sector comprises those in exclusionary informality – where the poor resort to informality as a last resort – and those in voluntary informality – where businesses and households opt for informality based on a cost-benefit analysis. Most informality in Addis Ababa is exclusionary. The small group of businesses and households that are voluntary experience both benefits and costs. With most informality being exclusionary, formalization will not free up hidden reserves and boost the economy. As informal businesses offer services that the government can not deliver, we discuss incorporating informality into the fabric of the city. Instead of ignoring or controlling informality, formal institutions can work with informal land speculators and businesses – whom have proven to be successful – in offering services and infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|In Serbia the {{inactivity}} {{rate of the}} working-age population is close to 40 %, {{among the highest in}} Europe. The country also faces a high informal employment rate of 24 %. Previous research has argued that high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>informality</b> and inactivity are mostly due to a high effective tax wedge at low wage levels caused by a minimum base for calculation of social security contributions (SSC), sudden withdrawal of means-tested benefits once formal income is earned, and low progressivity of income tax. This paper evaluates the impact of the minimum SSC base reform scenarios on labour supply and employment formalization using tax and benefit micro-simulation models together with the structural discrete choice labour supply model based on the Survey on Income and Living Conditions Data. Although we do not find positive employment effects of the reform, it would be premature to deduce that abolishment of the minimum SSC base is not needed. At this stage in our research, until alternative labour-supply modelling is applied, with both sector and hours of work choice alternatives, it is only safe to conclude that the proposed reform will not significantly contribute to the transformation of informal full-time to formal full-time jobs...|$|R
