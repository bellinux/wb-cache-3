5000|$|The 1892 Winchester caliber [...]44-40 carbine with a {{standard}} 20-inch barrel used {{on the set of}} The Rifleman appeared with two different types of levers. The backwards, round-D-style loop was used in the early episodes. Sometimes the rifle McCain uses has a saddle ring (the purpose of this ring is to allow the rider to tie the gun with a lanyard, to secure it in the scabbard). The <b>lever</b> <b>style</b> later changed to a flatter lever (instead of the large loop) with no saddle ring. McCain fires 12 shots from his rifle during the opening credits: seven shots in the first close-up and five more as the camera switches to another view. The blank cartridges are shorter than standard cartridges, so the magazine will hold more of the blanks. The soundtrack contained a dubbed 13th shot, to allow the firing to end with a section of the theme music. The rifle was chambered for the [...]44/40 W.C.F. (Winchester Center Fire) cartridge, which was used in both revolvers and rifles. He could supposedly fire off his first round in three-tenths of a second, which certainly helped in a showdown.|$|E
50|$|London Underground {{railways}} used miniature power <b>lever</b> frames; initially <b>Style</b> 'B' was used. Later on, Style 'N' was introduced. This is a {{mechanically locked}} {{version of the}} Style 'L' frame. Style 'M', 'M2' and 'V' were also used.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s the Newmarket Railway Social Hall {{and many}} other railway {{buildings}} were demolished. By 1995 {{all that was left}} of Newmarket's railway heritage was the Fine Station, closed in 1983 and its signal box still manned, and one of the last in New Zealand to utilise the old <b>style</b> <b>lever</b> frame. The old workshop buildings on Middleton Road were demolished in that year. By the 21st century little remained of Newmarket's railway heritage other than the station, the signal box, a few items of preserved rolling stock and the Railway Lodge No 196.|$|R
50|$|Rowsley South: unused at present. Cabin was {{originally}} located at , it {{was moved to}} the up platform at Darley Dale initially but unused for many years. Eventually it was moved to Rowsley in January 2014, whereafter restoration began, it be used to control the loco shed sidings and yard exits as a shunt frame using a unique now in the UK though still widely used in Europe -wire driven point operation using the ex Barrow Hill sidings turnover <b>style</b> <b>lever</b> frame and point operating gear which has now been installed at Rowsley awaiting the cabin to be erected.|$|R
5000|$|SPAS-12 models feature two safeties: (i) a <b>lever</b> <b>style</b> or {{push button}} style safety, and (ii) a [...] "quick {{employment}} safety". Lever safeties were recalled by Franchi and were replaced through the importer American Arms {{in the early}} 1990s. There {{are two types of}} push-button safeties. The earliest version would release the hammer on safe up to 1/4in. of travel when the trigger was depressed; this would cause a lockup of the action that would require the user to relock the bolt assembly to the rear to reset the hammer and then reload the chamber. The later version installed a detent and machined hole in the trigger group frame to prevent an action lock; the detent would prevent the hammer from engaging when the trigger was depressed and would prevent an action lock from occurring. The quick employment safety, which is {{on the left side of}} the trigger guard, disconnects the trigger when put into safe mode. The quick employment safety can be disengaged with the trigger finger when ready to fire and is intended for competition or tactical use. A third safety type, a pistol grip safety similar to the later-developed SPAS-15, is known to have been developed by Franchi for the SPAS-12, however the pistol grip safety was not offered for sale to the general public.|$|E
5000|$|The Society {{operates}} miniature steam locomotives {{which represent}} prototype engines of NSW and other states. One {{can also see}} {{a variety of other}} prototype locomotives. The locomotives work hard hauling 6 car trains with up to 30 persons. A 10 lever mechanical ex-New South Wales Railways ground frame operates elevated swing stub points and lower quadrant signals on the elevated railway and a [...] 48 miniature (Westinghouse <b>style)</b> <b>lever</b> frame operates the ground level railway's motor points and colour light signals. Members practice their model engineering in the creation of miniature steam locomotives, truly representative of the prototype.|$|R
50|$|The current {{length of}} the track is around 1/4 of a mile and the journey time is 3.5 minutes. There are 4 steam locos, 2 petrol {{hydraulic}} and 1 battery electric belonging to the company which are in regular use. The site comprises a station with canopy and booking office, bridge, engine shed, tunnel, turntable, signal box (with ex London Underground westinghouse 'B' <b>style</b> <b>lever</b> frame from Hyde Park Corner), steaming bays, level crossing, water tower and workshop. Colour light signals and electro-pneumatic points operate every time the railway operates and {{are in the process}} of being computerised so that the system can be used without a human signaller required. A manual override function is included.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews recent policy {{initiatives}} in England {{to achieve the}} closer integration of health and social care. This has been a policy goal of successive UK governments for over 40 years but overall progress has been patchy and limited. The coalition government has a new national framework for integrated care and variety of new {{policy initiatives}} including the ‘pioneer’ programme, {{the introduction of a}} new pooled budget – the ‘Better Care Fund’ – and a new programme of personal commissioning. Further change is likely as the NHS begins to develop new models of care delivery. There are significant tensions between these very different policy <b>levers</b> and <b>styles</b> of implementation. It is too early to assess their combined impact. Expectations that integration will achieve substantial financial savings are not supported by evidence. Local effort alone will be insufficient to overcome the fundamental differences in entitlement, funding and delivery between the NHS and the social care system. With a national election set to take place in May 2015, all political parties are committed to the integration of health and social care but clear evidence about the best means to achieve it is likely to remain as elusive as ever...|$|R
50|$|The patent {{describes}} Burt's machine {{as having}} a set of typeface characters that were arranged on the under side {{of a set of}} parts that had a lever pivoted to swing vertically and horizontally. The desired typeface character is brought to the printing point by moving this lever horizontally to a position over the same character in the index, and the impression on the paper is made by then depressing the <b>lever.</b> Different <b>styles</b> of typeface characters could be used. They were arranged in two rows on a lever. The rows of typeface characters could be shifted on the lever to bring either one to the printing point. The paper was carried in an endless band that traveled crosswise of the machine and the band was moved for letter space by the impression lever every time the lever is depressed to print. The line space was made by shifting the frame carrying the printing mechanism toward the front or rear of the machine, with the paper remaining stationary. Ink-pads were located at each side of the impression point, and all the typeface characters, except the one in the printing position, were inked every time the impression lever was depressed. Upper and lower case typeface letters could be used. A dial was provided that indicated the length of paper (inches) which had passed the printing point in printing each line. The operator knew the width of the paper being used each time. There was a stop printing indicator for end of the line.|$|R
