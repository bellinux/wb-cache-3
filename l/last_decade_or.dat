Historic solvent and default firm data are collected and labeled appropriately. Statistical and neural network models are then “trained ” to fit these data. A major problem is the imbalance of data, i. e. much more solvent data than default data. We propose a auto-associative neural network(AANN) that learns the identity mapping of input. By training the network with only solvent data, we built a bankruptcy predictor with better accuracies than conventional 2 -class neural network based predicto...|$|R

25|$|The Kunbis, {{along with}} the Teli and the Mali, {{play a major role}} in the {{politics}} of the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra. The three groups compose 50% of the electorate and are known to influence election outcomes. The Kunbis, being landlords, hold the upper-hand in the politics of the region and can decide the outcome of at least 22 seats, since they are dominant in every village of the region. The Kunbis, who are known to have a more tolerant attitude and are more secular than the Telis, prefer the Congress Party. As a result, the Party has held a dominant position in the region for several decades. However, in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so, Congress has ignored the Kunbis and other parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party; Shiv Sena responded by giving more opportunities to Kunbi candidates in elections.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} {{separation}} from the female caregiver has profound effects is one with considerable resonance outside the conventional study of child development.

500|$|However, in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so {{this view}} has been challenged. For example, Bennett claims that Mary Shelley's works reveal a {{consistent}} commitment to Romantic idealism and political reform and Jane Blumberg's study of Shelley's early novels argues that her career cannot be easily divided into radical and conservative halves. She contends that [...] "Shelley {{was never a}} passionate radical like {{her husband and her}} later lifestyle was not abruptly assumed nor was it a betrayal. She was in fact challenging the political and literary influences of her circle in her first work." [...] In this reading, Shelley's early works are interpreted as a challenge to Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley's radicalism. Victor Frankenstein's [...] "thoughtless rejection of family", for example, is seen as evidence of Shelley's constant concern for the domestic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} {{interpolation}} by using conditionally positive definite function provides optimal error bounds when the basis function φ {{is smooth and}} the approximant f is in a certain native space Fφ. The space Fφ, however, is very small for the case where φ is smooth. Hence, in this study, {{we are interested in}} the approximation power of interpolation to mollifications of functions in Sobolev space. Specifically, it turns out that interpolation to mollifications provides spectral error bounds depending only on the smoothness of the functions f. In the <b>last</b> <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> so, there has been considerable progress concerning the scattered data approximation problem in two or more dimensions. In particular, the methods of radial basis function approximation are becoming increasingly popular. Usually, the starting point of the approximation proces...|$|R

These other books referred to, written, let us say, from thirty or forty years to a century or two ago, amuse us in a way their poor dead authors never intended. Most amusing are the dead ones who take themselves seriously, whose books are pulpits quaintly carved and decorated with precious stones and silken canopies in which they stand and preach to or at their contemporaries.|$|E
6000|$|That, of course, is {{an extreme}} case. It assumes a {{particularly}} bad mother and a particularly ill-chosen nurse, and what is probably only a transitory phase of sexual debasement.

The effective contrast must not take us too far. We must remember that all women do not possess the passion for nursing, and that some of those who are defective in this direction may be, for all that, women of exceptional gifts and capacity, and fully capable of offspring. Civilization is based on the organized subdivision of labour, and, as the able lady who writes as [...] "L'amie Inconnue" [...] in the County Gentleman has pointed out in a very helpful criticism of the original version of this paper, it is as absurd to require every woman to be a nursery mother as it is, to require every man to till the soil.

60|$|The {{explanation}} of these proposals involves an anticipatory {{glance at the}} local administration of a Modern Utopia. To anyone who has watched the development of technical science during the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so, {{there will be no}} shock in the idea that a general consolidation of a great number of common public services over areas of considerable size is now not only practicable, but very desirable. In a little while heating and lighting and the supply of power for domestic and industrial purposes and for urban and inter-urban communications will all be managed electrically from common generating stations. And the trend of political and social speculation points decidedly to the conclusion that so soon as it passes out of the experimental stage, the supply of electrical energy, just like drainage and the supply of water, will fall to the local authority. Moreover, the local authority will be the universal landowner. Upon that point so extreme an individualist as Herbert Spencer was in agreement with the Socialist. In Utopia we conclude that, whatever other types of property may exist, all natural sources of force, and indeed all strictly natural products, coal, water power, and the like, are inalienably vested in the local authorities (which, in order to secure the maximum of convenience and administrative efficiency, will probably control areas as large sometimes as half England), they will generate electricity by water power, by combustion, by wind or tide or whatever other natural force is available, and this electricity will be devoted, some of it to the authority's lighting and other public works, some of it, as a subsidy, to the World-State authority which controls the high roads, the great railways, the inns and other apparatus of world communication, and the rest will pass on to private individuals or to distributing companies at a uniform fixed rate for private lighting and heating, for machinery and industrial applications of all sorts. Such an arrangement of affairs will necessarily involve a vast amount of book-keeping between the various authorities, the World-State government and the customers, and this book-keeping will naturally be done most conveniently in units of physical energy.|$|E
