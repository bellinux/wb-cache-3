Buckley, to celebrate Mass, alleging that his liturgies fostered a cult-like following. Critics {{of the decision}} expressed regret at the <b>loss</b> of variety <b>in</b> <b>styles</b> of liturgical worship at USF caused by the campus minister's ruling. Some described Buckley's liturgical approach as more [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "solemn." ...|$|R
50|$|Eno's success spawned many {{competitors}} in both Great Britain and the United States, including Abbey's Effervescent Salts, Dunn's Fruit Salt, Slaven's California Fruit Salt, and Dr. Edison Obesity Fruit Salts, for which in 1897 performer Alice J. Shaw {{became one of}} the earliest celebrity spokespersons for a weight <b>loss</b> product. <b>In</b> the <b>style</b> of patent medicines and quackery, they were advertised hyperbolically for an enormous range of diseases and ailments, only some of which they could ameliorate (e.g. indigestion). The range spanned from cholera to gout, rheumatism, colds, fevers, biliousness, indigestion, diarrhea, pimples, and headaches.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{establish}} whether strong reactions such as ‘Oskar would never say that!’ and ‘That’s just plain wrong!’ to the official Dutch translation of the novel Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (Foer, 2005) could {{be caused by a}} <b>loss</b> of <b>style</b> <b>in</b> the translation. In order to measure the retention of <b>style</b> <b>in</b> the translation, a translation quality assessment tool that focusses solely on style was needed. However, such a tool did not exist. Instead it was opted to adapt a translation method that prioritises style. Such a method was found in Bovelander’s 2015 style-centred translation approach. The Bovelander method includes a thorough stylistic analysis followed by the selection of translation procedures that should be used to retain style (a greenlist) as well as a listing of procedures that should be avoided because they would cause a loss of style (a blacklist). These procedures are pivotal in the adapted Bovelander method: a comparative reading of the source text and target text that reveals which procedures were used during the translation process. If blacklisted procedures occur considerably more often than greenlisted procedures, then there is a loss of style. The adapted Bovelander method suggested a severe <b>loss</b> of <b>style</b> <b>in</b> the Dutch translation of Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (Foer, 2005), which might indeed explain the strong reactions to the translation voiced by a number of translation students...|$|R
40|$|Asian noodle {{products}} are a staple food in many countries, representing the end-use of approximately one eighth of all wheat produced globally. Relatively {{little has been}} published on the contribution of Asian noodles to dietary intakes of essential nutrients including the B group vitamins. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study has been to investigate the factors influencing the retention of riboflavin in these products. The three most common styles of Asian noodles (white salted, yellow alkaline and instant) have been prepared under controlled laboratory conditions and riboflavin contents measured at each stage of processing. The stability varied markedly between the different styles with losses occurring at each step. Declines ranging from 27 % to 38 % of the initial riboflavin levels were found in fortified noodles prior to cooking. During boiling at the optimum temperature, further decreases occurred resulting <b>in</b> overall <b>losses</b> of 52 - 74 % of the amounts incorporated into the various formulations. The presence of alkaline salts as ingredients appeared to be the primary factor influencing the extent of <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> the three <b>styles.</b> White salted and instant Asian noodles are effective vehicles for enhancing dietary intakes of riboflavin...|$|R

The Bears' success continued into 1950 as they began the new decade <b>in</b> <b>style</b> by finishing 9–3, which was good enough to earn them a tie for the Western Division with the Los Angeles Rams and play in the Conference Playoff against them. However, the Bears were unable to slow down the high-powered Ram offense <b>in</b> a 24–14 <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles as the Rams advanced to the NFL Championship Game.|$|R
40|$|Boris Johnson won the {{election}} for Mayor of London in 2008 with a manifesto based on pragmatic populism. This style contrasts significantly {{with that of the}} previous Mayor, Ken Livingstone. The switch <b>in</b> <b>style</b> raises for us {{the question of whether the}} new pragmatism has meant a <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> strategic planning and leadership for London. We will examine this question by comparing the London Plans produced by Mayors Livingstone and Johnson, focusing specifically on sustainability. Our contention is that under Livingstone a positive step was taken to remedying these former problems and but that there is a danger that under Johnson this step has been transformed into a shuffle...|$|R

Tipsarević ended the season at a career-high ranking of no. 9, just behind Mardy Fish.|$|R

50|$|Attenuation (loss) {{per unit}} length, in {{decibels}} per meter. This {{is dependent on}} the <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the dielectric material filling the cable, and resistive <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> the center conductor and outer shield. These losses are frequency dependent, the losses becoming higher as the frequency increases. Skin effect <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> the conductors can be reduced by increasing the diameter of the cable. A cable with twice the diameter will have half the skin effect resistance. Ignoring dielectric and other losses, the larger cable would halve the dB/meter <b>loss.</b> <b>In</b> designing a system, engineers consider not only the <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the cable but also the <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the connectors.|$|R
