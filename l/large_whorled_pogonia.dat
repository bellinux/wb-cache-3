50|$|Isotria verticillata, {{commonly}} known as the <b>large</b> <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia</b> and purple fiveleaf orchid, is an orchid species native to eastern North America.|$|E
5000|$|Isotria medeoloides, {{commonly}} known as small <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia</b> or little five leaves, is a terrestrial orchid found in temperate Eastern North America.|$|R
50|$|Bauneg Beg Mountain is {{the only}} {{mountain}} in southern Maine {{that does not have}} a radio tower on it. It is home to the small <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia</b> (Isotria medeoloides), one of the rarest orchids in the Eastern United States as well as the rare swamp saxifrage (Saxifraga pensylvanica) and Blanding's turtle (Emys blandingii).|$|R
40|$|HABIT: Creeping, {{perennial}} subterranean rhizome with herbaceous stems 0. 5 - 3 dm. high; flowering May-July; fruiting July-October. SIMILAR SPECIES: Cornus canadensis is not {{similar to}} any other member of the genus in Ohio. However, in a vegetative state its clusters of whorled leaves might be confused with non-flowering material of Indian Cucumber, (Medeola virginiana), or <b>Whorled</b> <b>Pogonia</b> (Isotria verticillata) ...|$|R
5000|$|Virtually {{the entire}} 3000 acre Crow's Nest Peninsula is forested with mature stands of mixed hardwoods. In {{the words of}} Gary Fleming, Natural Heritage Program ecologist, [...] "Overall, Crow's Nest {{supports}} one of the finest—if not the finest—upland hardwood forests remaining in the Virginia Coastal Plain." [...] Surveys documented two state-listed species and the potential habitat for two other federal listed species and several state-listed species. Several Stafford County records for plants and two state-listed endangered plant species were found, including ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) in rich ravines and river bulrush (Scirpus fluviatilis) in adjacent tidal marshes. Suitable habitat was found for small <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia</b> (Isotria medeoloides), although it does not grow there.|$|R
50|$|The Pocumtuck Range hosts a {{combination}} of microclimate ecosystems unusual to the region. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend {{to be similar to}} the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby Berkshires, containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest ecosystem types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of cliffs make ideal raptor habitat, and the range is an important seasonal raptor migration corridor. Thirty-seven species of fern {{can be found on the}} range, making it one of the richest ecosystems of fern diversity in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The range also supports extensive populations of <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia,</b> a plant on the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency's watch list.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} deciduous, {{opposite}} (or <b>whorled),</b> <b>large,</b> heart shaped, 20-30 cm long and 15-20 cm broad, {{pointed at the}} tip and softly hairy beneath. The leaves generally do not color in autumn before falling, instead, they either fall abruptly after the first hard freeze, or turn a slightly yellow-brown before dropping off. The catalpa tree is the last tree to grow leaves in the spring. The winter twigs of northern catalpa are like those of few other trees, having sunken leaf scars that resemble suction cups. Their whorled arrangement (three scars per node) around the twigs is another diagnostic.|$|R
50|$|Sagittaria latifolia is a variably sized (2 to 20 {{meters in}} length) {{perennial}} growing in colonies that can cover {{large amounts of}} ground. The roots are white and thin, producing white tubers covered with a purplish skin a good distance (0.3 to 1 m long, 0.15 to 0.6 meter deep) from the mother plant. It is green and white. The plant produces rosette of leaves and an inflorescence on a long rigid scape. The leaves are extremely variable, from very thin at 1 to 2 cm to wedge shaped like those of Sagittaria cuneata. Spongy and solid, the leaves have parallel venation meeting {{in the middle and}} the extremities. The inflorescence is a raceme composed of <b>large</b> flowers <b>whorled</b> by threes. Usually divided into female flowers on the lower part and male on the upper, although dioecious individuals are also found. Three round, white petals and three very short curved, dark green sepals. Male flowers are easily distinguished from female due to the dissimilarity between the 25 to 50 yellow stamens of the male and the sphere of green carpels of the female ones.|$|R
60|$|The races I have chiefly {{examined}} are English, most of {{whom were}} of the upper and middle classes; the others chiefly from London board schools; Welsh, from the purest Welsh-speaking districts of South Wales; Jews from the large London schools, and Negroes from the territories of the Royal Niger Company. I have also a collection of Basque prints taken at Cambo, some twenty miles inland from Biarritz, which, although small, is large enough to warrant a provisional conclusion. As a first and only an approximately correct description, the English, Welsh, Jews, Negroes, and Basques, may all be spoken of as identical in the character of their finger prints; the same familiar patterns appearing in all of them with much the same degrees of frequency, the differences between groups of different races being not larger than those that occasionally occur between groups of the same race. The Jews have, however, a decidedly <b>larger</b> proportion of <b>Whorled</b> patterns than other races, and I should have been tempted to make an assertion about a peculiarity in the Negroes, had not one of their groups differed greatly from the rest. The task of examination has been laborious thus far, but it would be much more so to arrive with correctness at a second and closer approximation to the truth. It is doubtful at present whether it is worth while to pursue the subject, except {{in the case of the}} Hill tribes of India and a few other peculiarly diverse races, for the chance of discovering some characteristic and perhaps a more monkey-like pattern.|$|R
