40|$|Ventilation is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} treatment of cardiogenic and increased permeability pulmonary edema. The effects of ventilation on the computed tomography (CT) density distribution of pulmonary edema are unclear. We hypothesized that ventilation might open up previously collapsed alveoli with consequent reduced lung density, and that some movement of the alveolar edema fluid might also occur from the alveoli to the interstitium. To address this problem, pulmonary edema was induced in 16 supine dogs by airways instillation of a protein solution similar to serum in each <b>lower</b> lung <b>lobe</b> through a double lumen tracheal tube. The dogs were ventilated only on the left side for 1 min (n = 4), 30 min (n = 6) or 60 min (n = 6). The <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and imaged in a CT scanner. Representative regions of interest (ROI) were chosen and tissue sections from corresponding regions were taken for extravascular lung water (Qwl/dQl) and regional blood measurements, and for histology to grade interstitial and alveolar edema. There was a significant (P $<$ 0. 05) fall in the CT density of the left <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> compared with the right <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> in the groups ventilated 30 and 60 min, but no differences in Qwl/dQl or blood content.

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{slightly}} smaller and shorter-based than the second, and neither has spines. The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear {{tip of the}} pectoral fins, while the second originates above {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short and rounded. The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well-developed notch near the tip, and a barely present <b>lower</b> <b>lobe.</b> The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines.

5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the <b>lower</b> <b>lobe</b> is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins.

5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the <b>lower</b> <b>lobe</b> is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Portuguese dogfish {{is thick}} and {{cylindrical}} except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates over {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well-developed <b>lower</b> <b>lobe</b> and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central concavity, superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings. In 1997, a partially albino individual, with a pale body but normal eyes, was caught in the northeastern Atlantic. This represented the first documented case of albinism in a deep-sea shark.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUNDâ€”Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by subpleural fibrosis that progresses to involve {{all areas of}} the lung. The expression of transforming growth factor-Î² 1 (TGF-Î² 1), a potent regulator of connective tissue synthesis, is increased in lung sections of patients with IPF. TGF-Î² 1 is generally released in a biologically latent form (L-TGF-Î² 1). Before being biologically active, TGF-Î² must be converted to its active form and interact with both TGF-Î² receptors type I and II (TÎ²R-I and TÎ²R-II). TGF-Î² latency binding protein 1 (LTBP- 1), which facilitates the release and activation of L-TGF-Î² 1, is also important in the biology of TGF-Î² 1. â€¨METHODSâ€”Open lung biopsy samples from patients with IPF and normal controls were examined to localise TÎ²R-I, TÎ²R-II, and LTBP- 1. Alveolar macrophages (AM) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were examined using the CCL- 64 bioassay to determine if TGF-Î² is present in its active form in the lungs of patients with IPF. â€¨RESULTSâ€”Immunoreactive L-TGF-Î² 1 was present in all lung cells of patients with IPF except for fibroblasts in the subepithelial regions of honeycomb cysts. LTBP- 1 was detected primarily in AM and epithelial cells lining honeycomb cysts in areas of advanced IPF. In normal lungs LTBP- 1 immunoreactivity was observed in a few AM. AM from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> of patients with IPF secreted 1. 6 (0. 6) fmol and 4. 1 (1. 9) fmol active TGF-Î², respectively, while AM from the <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> of control patients secreted no active TGF-Î² (pâ©½ 0. 01 for TGF-Î² in the conditioned media from AM obtained from the <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> of IPF patients v normal controls). The difference in percentage active TGF-Î² secreted by AM from the <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> of patients with IPF and the <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> of control patients was significant (pâ©½ 0. 01), but the difference between the total TGF-Î² secreted from these lobes was not significant. The difference in active TGF-Î² in conditioned media of AM from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> of patients with IPF was also not statistically significant. BAL fluid from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> of patients with IPF contained 0. 7 (0. 2) fmol and 2. 9 (1. 2) fmol active TGF-Î², respectively (pâ©½ 0. 03). The percentage of active TGF-Î² in the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lobes</b> was 17. 6 (1. 0) % and 78. 4 (1. 6) %, respectively (pâ©½ 0. 03). In contrast, BAL fluid from control patients contained small amounts of L-TGF-Î². Using immunostaining, both TÎ²R-I and TÎ²R-II were present on all cells of normal lungs but TÎ²R-I was markedly reduced in most cells in areas of honeycomb cysts except for interstitial myofibroblasts in lungs of patients with IPF. TGF-Î² 1 inhibits epithelial cell proliferation and a lack of TÎ²R-I expression by epithelial cells lining honeycomb cysts would facilitate repair of the alveoli by epithelial cell proliferation. However, the presence of both TÎ²Rs on fibroblasts is likely to result in a response to TGF-Î² 1 for synthesis of connective tissue proteins. Our findings show that biologically active TGF-Î² 1 is only present in the lungs of patients with IPF. In addition, the effects of TGF-Î² 1 on cells may be further regulated by the expression of TÎ²Rs. â€¨CONCLUSIONâ€”Activation of L-TGF-Î² 1 and the differential expression of TÎ²Rs may be important in the pathogenesis of remodelling and fibrosis in IPF. ...|$|R
