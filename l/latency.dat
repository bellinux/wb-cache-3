40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that obstacle avoidance reactions during gait have very short <b>latencies.</b> This raises the question whether the cortex can be involved, as it is in voluntary reactions. In this study, <b>latencies</b> of obstacle avoidance (OA) reactions were determined and related to <b>latencies</b> of voluntary stride modifications and simple reaction times (SRT) of hand and foot. Twenty-five healthy young adults participated in this study. While they were walking on the treadmill, an obstacle suddenly fell in front of their left leg. The first reaction to the obstacle was the moment at which the differentiated acceleration curve of the foot deviated from the control signal. <b>Latencies</b> of OA reactions were 122 ms (SD 14 ms) on average. Two very different avoidance reactions (lengthening and shortening of the stride) were noticed, but there was no avoidance strategy effect on OA <b>latencies.</b> OA <b>latencies</b> were significantly shorter as compared to <b>latencies</b> of voluntary stride modifications and simple reaction times of hand and foot. The short OA <b>latencies</b> could not only be explained from the dynamic nature of the task.

40|$|Background. Emotional Stroop tasks {{have shown}} {{attention}} biases of clinical populations towards stimuli {{related to their}} condition. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a neuropsychiatric condition with social and communication deficits, repetitive behaviours and narrow interests. Social deficits are particularly striking, including difficulties in understanding others. Method. We investigated colour-naming <b>latencies</b> of adults with and without AS to name colours of pictures containing angry facial expressions, neutral expressions or non-social objects. We tested three hypotheses: whether (1) controls show longer colour-naming <b>latencies</b> for angry versus neutral facial expressions with male actors, (2) people with AS show differential <b>latencies</b> across picture types, and (3) differential response <b>latencies</b> persist when photographs contain females. Results. Controls had longer <b>latencies</b> to pictures of male faces with angry compared to neutral expressions. The AS group did not show longer <b>latencies</b> to angry versus neutral expressions in male faces, instead showing slower <b>latencies</b> to pictures containing any facial expression compared to objects. When pictures contained females, controls no longer showed longer <b>latencies</b> for angry versus neutral expressions. However, the AS group still showed longer <b>latencies</b> to all facial picture types, compared to objects, providing further evidence that faces produce interference effects for this clinical group. Conclusions. The pictorial emotional Stroop paradigm reveals normal attention biases towards threatening emotional faces. The AS group showed Stroop interference effects to all facial stimuli regardless of expression or sex, suggesting that faces cause disproportionate interference in AS...|$|R

The literature has shown that response time <b>latencies</b> affect the mean outputs of parameter estimates derived from models of discrete choice. In this paper, we add further insight into the influences response time <b>latencies</b> have on such models by modelling latent response information associated with the variance of random parameter distributions through parameterisation of variance heterogeneity (or heteroskedasticity). We demonstrate that response time <b>latencies</b> influence not only the means of random parameter distributions, but also the variances, and that failure to account for both may result in incorrect model inferences being drawn.

Surface electromyography measured activation and deactivation <b>latencies</b> of knee flexor and extensor muscles during a ballistic knee flexion task, consistency of <b>latencies</b> across repetitions, and close coupling between agonist and antagonist muscle <b>latencies.</b> We measured Fugl-Meyer (FM) coordination and the functional gait measure, six minute walk test (6 MWT). For stroke subjects, there were significant delays of muscle activation and deactivation, abnormal inconsistency, and abnormal decoupled agonist and antagonist activations.

Participants of 25 - 35, 50 - 59, 60 - 69 and above 70 years of age were given a picture naming task. To uncover subtle naming difficulties, correct naming <b>latencies</b> were analyzed, in addition to accuracy. Moreover, {{in order to control}} whether the expected slower naming <b>latencies</b> could be due to a general slowing affecting all cognitive tasks, participants were also given an odd/even judgment task to assess cognitive processing speed. In participants in their 50 s, we found subtle naming difficulties revealed by longer naming <b>latencies,</b> unaccompanied by any decrease in naming accuracy. The age-related naming disadvantage increased with age with the onset of naming errors. Thus, in adults in their 60 s and their 70 s, the results showed both a decrease in accuracy and an increase in correct naming <b>latencies.</b> Moreover, the increase in naming <b>latencies</b> remained significant even after controlling for odd/even judgment <b>latencies,</b> suggesting a degradation specific to the picture naming task. We assumed that these slower <b>latencies</b> may result from a language-specific impairment. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Simple {{reaction}} time (SRT), the minimal {{time needed to}} respond to a stimulus, is a basic measure of processing speed. SRTs were first measured by Francis Galton in the 19 th century who reported visual SRT <b>latencies</b> below 190 ms in young subjects. However, recent large-scale studies have reported substantially increased SRT <b>latencies</b> that differ markedly in different laboratories, in part due to timing delays introduced by computer hardware and software used for SRT measurement. We developed a calibrated and temporally-precise SRT paradigm to analyze the factors that influence SRT <b>latencies</b> in a paradigm where visual stimuli were presented to the left or right hemifield at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Experiment 1 examined a community sample of 1469 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 65. Mean SRT <b>latencies</b> were short (231 ms, 213 ms when corrected for hardware delays) and increased significantly with age (0. 55 ms/year), but were unaffected by sex or education. As in previous studies, SRTs were prolonged at shorter SOAs and were slightly faster for stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the responding hand. Stimulus detection time (SDT) was estimated by subtracting movement-initiation time, measured in a speeded finger-tapping test, from SRTs. SDT <b>latencies</b> averaged 131 ms and were unaffected by age. Experiment 2 tested 189 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 82 years in a different laboratory using a larger range of SOAs. Both SRTs and SDTs were slightly prolonged (by 7 ms). SRT <b>latencies</b> increased with age while SDT <b>latencies</b> did not. Precise computer-based measurements of SRT <b>latencies</b> show that processing speed is as fast in contemporary populations as in those from the Victorian era and that age-related increases in SRT <b>latencies</b> are due primarily to slowed motor output...|$|R
