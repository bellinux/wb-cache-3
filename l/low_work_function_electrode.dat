40|$|International audienceFor {{efficient}} organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells, a <b>low</b> <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>electrode</b> {{is necessary}} to enhance the built-in voltage of the active layer, thereby improving the overall efficiency. Calcium is often {{used for this purpose}} in the laboratory; however, its development on a larger scale is impaired by its high reactivity with oxygen and water and the resulting low stability of solar cells under operation. The influence of a novel interlayer, lanthanum hexaboride (LaB 6), on the electronic properties of OPV is studied in this work. Similarly to calcium, when LaB 6 is used as an interlayer, it enhances the built-in voltage in the device, leading to a higher fill factor (FF) and optimal open circuit voltage (Voc). As a result, optimized LaB 6 -based devices present significantly improved power conversion efficiencies. More importantly, while calcium/aluminum (Ca/Al) and aluminum (Al) cathodes lose their capacity to enhance the internal electrical field during thermal aging, the LaB 6 /aluminum (LaB 6 /Al) electrode remains stable.

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of evaporated vitreous selenium layers {{have been studied}} using both the injection and volume-generation of additional charge carriers. The current-voltage characteristics of specimens between 2 and 31 mum thick were investigated and the results analysed {{in terms of the}} Rose-Lampert theory. Ohmic contacts of tellurium or platinum were formed on newly prepared specimens by the prolonged application of a moderately high electric field, but this was not found possible with a <b>low</b> <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>electrode</b> such as magnesium. The detailed analysis of the results indicates the existence of a volume distribution of hole traps of density 9 x 1013 cm.;- 3; 0. 79 eVabove the valence band. The comparative shallowness of the characteristics at higher voltages suggests that this level forms part of a distribution of states increasing in density towards the valence band. It is shown that the model of an exponential trap distribution is consistent with the experimental results and also leads to an explanation of the unusual optical properties of vitreous selenium. Measurements of the transient response of carriers generated by pulses of light or high energy electrons show the traps in the 0. 79 eV level have a release time of about 50 seconds at room temperature and a capture cross-section for holes of 8 x 10.;- 16 cm 2. The lifetime of voltage injectedholes with respect to these centres is about 10 ? seconds. On the basis of the electrical results, both the absorption and photoconductive edges have been calculated {{as a function of the}} photon energy and it has been possible to account for the marked energy difference between the two.

The absorber layers of the investigated solar cells consist of the low band gap conjugated polymer poly[[9 -(1 -octylnonyl) - 9 H-carbazole- 2, 7 -diyl]- 2, 5 -thiophenediyl- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole- 4, 7 -diyl- 2, 5 -thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT) and copper indium sulfide (CIS) nanocrystals. These are prepared directly in the polymer matrix via an in situ approach using copper and indium xanthates, which are converted to CIS nanocrystals by mild thermal annealing.

The first results chapter {{describes a}} low cost, robust Cu | Al bilayer window <b>electrode</b> that simultaneously <b>functions</b> as the <b>low</b> <b>work</b> <b>function</b> electron-extracting <b>electrode</b> and as a sink for oxygen/water molecules in OPVs. When the electrode is exposed to air, an ultra-thin oxide layer forms at its surface without any increase in surface roughness, and the sheet resistance of the electrode actually decreases. However, this electrode has the disadvantage of a lower far-field transparency than ITO glass. The second results chapter describes how the transparency of ultra-thin Cu films can be increased to a level comparable to that of ITO glass across most of the spectrum over which OPVs harvest light using an overlayer of tungsten sub-oxide (WO 3 -x) which is spontaneously doped with Cu, increasing both its refractive index and electrical conductivity. Unfortunately these electrodes are not air stable. The third results chapter describes how the developments described in the previous two chapters might be integrated to realise an electrode that is both air-stable and highly transparent. The final results chapter describes a very different approach to coupling light into an OPV based on a Cu electrode with a dense array of sub-optical wavelength apertures. These electrodes absorb light strongly, concentrating it as surface plasmon excitations. It is shown that this trapped light can be absorbed by the light harvesting organic semiconductor in organic photovoltaics so that electrodes with very low far-field transparency can perform as well as more transparent electrodes...|$|R

In order to achieve high efficiencies and longer life-times, proper matching of the electronic energy levels of the different materials is needed. The aim of the research presented in this thesis has been to explore different routes to optimize interface energetics and gain deeper knowledge of the mechanisms that govern charge transport over the interface. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) is a method well suited to study both interactions between different materials taking place at surfaces as well as interface energetics. One way to achieve proper matching of interfaces energy levels is by adding a dipole layer. In the three first papers presented in the thesis, the method of adding a monolayer of small organic molecules to change the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> of the surface is investigated.

The development of a novel substrate electrode based on an Al | Cu bilayer capped with an ultra-thin Al layer is initially shown. This electrode offers the rare combination of high reflectivity, a very <b>low</b> <b>work</b> <b>function</b> of ~ 3. 2 eV, and high stability towards oxidation. Photoelectron spectroscopy studies shows that an Al capping layer of ~ 1 nm in thickness is sufficient to block oxidation of the underlying Cu, which is remarkable given that the self-limiting oxide thickness for bulk Al is ≥ 2 nm. This promising substrate electrode is used to elucidate a new design rule for top-illuminated bulk-heterojunction OPVs. It is shown that for OPVs utilising high performance donor-type organic semiconductors in conjunction with a <b>low</b> <b>work</b> <b>function</b> electron extracting <b>electrode,</b> a barrier to hole-extraction spontaneously forms at the donor | electron-extracting electrode interface, blocking unwanted hole-extraction and negating the need for a hole-blocking layer, which simplifies the device architecture.

A novel organo-molybdenum oxide bronze is also developed which combines the function of wide band-gap interlayer for efficient hole-extraction with the role of a metal electrode seed layer, enabling the fabrication of highly transparent, low-sheet-resistance silver window electrodes for top-illuminated OPVs.
