40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Social Work)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. South Africa {{is one of}} the {{countries}} with the fastest growing incidences of HIV/AIDS in the world. The infection rate is worst among sexually active adolescents and young adults and a situation is faced where {{one out of every four}} adolescents will be infected by 2005. The emphasis in South Africa's HIV/AIDS strategies is on prevention, which is absolutely essential. In the meanwhile, an estimated 4. 2 million people are already infected and are in need of support and counselling. Most of these people are younger than 45 years, leaving our country with our most productive members of society living with an epidemic for which there is no cure at the moment. Limited social work support programmes are available to address the psycho-social needs of young adults living with HIV/AIDS. This research study was undertaken with the purpose of developing an intervention programme to supply in the need for social support programmes for persons living with HIV/AIDS. The study was undertaken in two phases, the needs assessment phase and the programme development and evaluation phase and included the following two aims: - To determine the psycho-social needs of young adults living with HIV/AIDS - To develop and evaluate a social group work programme for young adults living with HIV/AIDS where life maps are used as technique. The first aim was achieved by the survey procedure to determine the psycho-social needs of young adults living with the disease. The population consisted of a group of 45 young adults living with HIV/AIDS in the Koppies and Bloemfontein geographical areas. The needs assessment was done by means of a questionnaire and a standardized measuring instrument, Hudson's General Contentment Scale (GCS). As far as the second aim was concerned, a social group work programme was developed where life maps as technique was applied. This technique is fairly unknown in social work and has the potential to be a helpful tool in social work practice. The life maps technique consists of seven existential questions, including theoretical principles that originate from the self actualization theory of Maslow, the existential theory of Frankl, the reality theory of Glasser and the gestalt theory of Perls. Life maps could be linked to similar techniques, including life stories, life scripts and magazine photo collages. The suggested group work programme was developed and implemented to a group of young adults living with HIVIAIDS. The true experiment was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme. The General Contentment Scale was used for pre and post testing. The data collected from this study was mainly qualitative and was processed by following Tesch's approach. The most important conclusions that could be drawn from this study included a need among young adults living with HIV/AIDS to have a meaningful life; the seven questions asked by the <b>life</b> <b>map</b> technique supplied answers to some existential questions of the young adult living with HIV/AIDS; the <b>life</b> <b>map</b> technique could be applied effectively in social group work; and the general contentment of the experimental group increased after application of the programme, while the control group's general contentment stayed more or less the same. The latter indicated that the social group work programme that was developed, had an influence on the general contentment of a group of young adults living with HIV/AIDS. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|The {{organization}} of the cytoskeleton has been studied during mouse differentiation in cells of the myenteric neuronal lineage. The entire gut was examined starting from day 12. 5 of embryonic life (E 12. 5) until birth (P 0). Immunocytochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of five of the most represented neurofilaments proteins (the low, NF-L, medium, NF-M, and heavy, NF-H, molecular weight subunits, alpha-internexin and peripherin) and {{of two of the}} microtubule-associated proteins (MAPI and MAP 2 a+ 2 b). In parallel, the appearance in the differentiating myenteric neurons of filamentous and microtubular structures and their intracytoplasmatic distribution were observed under the electron microscope. A differential immunohistochemical expression of the structural proteins was found. Immature cells expressed alpha-internexin, peripherin, NF-M and MAP 1 by day E 12. 5; alpha-internexin expression was strong in these cells, but gradually decreased with age and was practically absent in adulthood. Conversely, the expression of the other three proteins increased with cell differentiation and was still present in adulthood. NF-L and NF-H expression appeared later, by day E 16. 5, and was weak for the entire pre- and postnatal <b>life.</b> <b>MAP</b> 2 a+ 2 b was never expressed. Under the electron microscope, at day E 12. 5 the cytoskeleton was already organized in filamentous and microtubular structures. At this age neurofilaments were few and mainly located in the cell processes, and microtubules were numerous and mainly assembled in the neuritic growth cones, together with synaptic vesicles. With ageing, neurofilaments and microtubules were ubiquitous in the neuron. Data obtained demonstrate that cytoskeletal proteins gradually accumulate in the cells of the neuronal lineage in parallel with the {{organization of}} the cytoskeletal structures, which in turn mediate important neural events by the earliest stages of murine embryonic life, including growth of nerve processes and initiation of axonal transport...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{methods to}} improve storage life of purple passionfruit (Passiflora edulis Sims) and tamarillo (Cyphomandra betacea (Cav.) Sendt). For passionfruit, {{the main problem}} for export and storage is shrivelling whereas for tamarillo {{the quality of the}} stem is a key factor in export standards. Eating quality of passionfruit was best {{described}} by the titratable acidity (TA) and the soluble solids content (SSC) with the optimal eating flavour found at an SSC/TA ratio between 10 - 11. Wax coating, ethylene scavenging, and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) were assessed as tools to improve storage <b>life.</b> <b>MAP</b> with varying oxygen transmission rates (OTR at 5 °C; 854, 1437, 2347 and 3089 ml m- 2 day- 1) were compared to the standard packaging in a cardboard box during storage at the commercial temperature of 8 °C. Fruit quality was measured after 20, 28, and 42 days of storage with and without seven days of shelf life at 20 °C in the same packaging as during storage. Waxing did not improve the quality of the fruit. MAP prevented shrivelling but in the packaging with lower OTR (854 - 1437 ml m- 2 day- 1) unacceptable external defects developed. Fruit quality in the packaging with the higher OTR (2347 - 3089 ml m- 2 day- 1) was similar except for the development of off-flavours in the packaging with an OTR of 2347 ml m- 2 day- 1 during shelf life possibly due to the high ethylene accumulation since the addition of an ethylene scavenger in a second trial eliminated the off-flavour development. The highest OTR MAP is the best option for long term storage. The second highest OTR MAP could be used providing an ethylene scavenger is added. To extend the storage life of tamarillo, two MAP options (OTR at 5 °C; 1437 and 3089 ml m- 2 day- 1) were compared to the standard packaging in a cardboard box with polyliner as well as the effect of adding clove oil releasing sachets. All fruit were stored at 4 °C for 56 days and fruit and stem quality was measured fortnightly with and without three days of shelf life at 20 °C. MAP delayed the development of stem yellowing, which was related to chlorophyll degradation, but did not improve fruit quality and increased stem blackening and bleeding in the locule, especially when clove oil was added. Blackening was related to polyphenol oxidase activity and was aggravated by clove oil or by injury (e. g. disruption of cellular membranes) due to lower O 2, higher CO 2 and higher ethylene concentrations. Thus, for the two films tested, MAP with or without the addition of clove oil offered no advantages over conventional air storage...|$|E
40|$|With modern culture {{moving towards}} {{convenience}} {{in terms of}} fresh produce, especially with meat products, science needs to constantly evolve to serve these customer needs. These needs however can sometimes be implemented too hastily without the proper assessment done for factors such as food safety. One such improvement {{is the use of}} modified atmosphere packaged minced meat. This form allows the minced meat to be kept for much longer than normal without freezing the product, providing the fast pasted consumer both the convenience of having fresh, unfrozen meat as well as an added shelf <b>life.</b> <b>MAP</b> works by disrupting the atmosphere within these packages, retarding the growth of the spoilage micro-organisms, thus causing them to require a longer time span to reach spoilage numbers. The problem however arises that although most of these techniques are tried and trusted on the products’ spoilage organisms, it does not take into consideration the effect MAP and the altered spoilage organism communities would have on a pathogen that might be present on the products. This study thus aimed to assess the effect of both factors on Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (phase 1) and Staphylococcus aureus (phase 2) in minced meat kept at 5 °C as well as trying to identify the major affecting factors. The two subject organisms were each inoculated into 2 different types of MAP packs and a non-atmosphere modified PVC overlaid minced meat sample at two differing concentrations of 105 and 102 to also assess the impact of high andlow initial pathogen presence. These packs were then analysed over a time period of 16 days to track the changing minced meat environment. APC, Pseudomonads, LAB and Enterobacteriaceae counts were all investigated along with the pathogenic counts. Apart from colony enumeration, the colour of the minced meat samples were also taken to determine the effect that these parameters have on the appearance of the product, as colour is often the first sensorial characteristic that determines the purchase of fresh meat products. pH was determined to ascertain the environmental changes occurring in the product and whether groups such as the LAB would change the environment to better suit their needs. Finally the atmospheric makeup was also measured to determine the effect of the MAP system and the change occurring in a closed system that could be attributed to the growth and respiration of the bacterial communities present. Apart from the main aim of the study, two additional studies were performed that arose during the planning and analyses of the two primary phases. Firstly the use of a quarter versus a full plate enumeration was studied to determine its accuracy as well as possibility of use in full studies to aid enumeration and decrease time and financial input. Here a direct comparison was done between the two techniques after which they were compared and assessed in their functionality for both homogenous and heterogeneous community enumeration on selective and non-selective media. The other secondary study focussed on the use of new technology for both the enumeration and tracking of genetically modified organisms in a variety of different environments. Here a bioluminescent imaging system was used on a genetically modified strain of E. coli to track its spread through minced meat, packaged either in a MAP or PVC overlaid pack, over 48 hours in an accelerated shelf life study. Enumeration of said organism was also undertaken whereby the intensity of emitted light would correspond to a defined count, enabling rapid enumeration of samples, whether overgrown or not.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to use life mapping during the intervention period {{in order to enhance}} the self-knowledge of the children in their mid-childhood years, in a children’s home. In order to reach this goal, the life mapping- and the gestalt play- therapeutic processes had been combined with, art and creativity included in the process. The study is quantitative and a standardised measuring instrument had been used for the pre-test and posttest, according to the single-system design. The hypothesis was tested by way of statistical analysis, by comparing data obtained from the pre-test and posttest. The child in a children’s home does not always know who he/she is. Because of possible trauma experienced before admission to the children’s home, self-knowledge could not be developed from within or from input obtained out of the social environment. Sometimes, a child in a children’s home, does not know why he/she was admitted. It is necessary for the child to know where he/she came from, where he/she is at present and where is he/she is going. The framework of life mapping integrates these concepts. By compiling a <b>life</b> <b>map,</b> a child obtains self-knowledge. When he/she had formed a perception of who and what he/she is and what he/she wants to achieve, the child can start working on self-fulfillment. With self-knowledge and a good perception of his/her life, the child develops a self concept, which usually contains an element of self-evaluation. The child can start leading an own life, make own choices, take responsibility for his/her own life and becomes independent, notwithstanding the circumstances of origin. The purpose is to bring back balance and a sense of self into the life of the child, which are also the purposes emphasised by both life mapping and gestalt play therapy. The literature study includes both the behaviour and emotions of the child in a children’s home. The influence on the life of the child had been investigated. Objective one was to build on the knowledge base on life mapping and gestalt play therapy processes. The processes were compared and integrated in this study. Life mapping as a concept, is known since the early 20 th century, but was not applied in therapy, often. The developmental phase of a child in mid-childhood, in a children’s home had been studied. The developmental tasks in the mid-childhood are varied and is a progression of tasks from the previous phases. The synthesis, according to Erikson, during this phase, is capability. Industry versus inferiority could be seen as the “crisis” of this developmental phase. The child starts having the concept of the true self, versus the ideal self and he/she compares him/herself with others. Objective two was intervention by way of life mapping, together with the gestalt principles. This proved to have been very successful with observing the research results. Aspects of the whole life of every respondent had been included into the life maps. The fact that the life had been looked at in totality is in accordance with the gestalt concept of gestalt therapy. The respondents started owning their own personality traits and began to experiencing their uniqueness. It was thus enhancement of self-knowledge that took place. All the objectives of the study had been reached. The study resulted in an 80 percent significant change in the average self-knowledge of the respondents.

This dissertation examines the recurrence of viral performances of Blackness in viral videos online, film, and photography/images. I argue that viral performances make products that reinscribe stereotypical notions of Blackness while also generating paths of alterity—which contradict the normalized clichés and provide desirable possibilities for Black performance. Viral Bodies forges a new dialogue between visual and aural technologies, performance, and larger historic discourses that script Black bodies as visually (and sonically) deviant subjects.

To demonstrate the value of working with these reconceptualizations, examples of becoming will be explored through research with visually impaired young people.

40|$|While the United Kingdom’s {{emerging}} {{brand of}} Third Way Urban Policy (TWUP) often associates {{itself with a}} kind of anarchic vision of self-regulating and self-reproducing local communities, it can in fact {{be thought of as a}} thinly veiled moral crusade against vulnerable residents living in deprived neighborhoods.
