6000|$|The biographical {{circumstances}} will not, of course, be forgotten. The life of Dickens {{had been}} a curious one. Brought {{up in a family}} just poor enough to be painfully conscious of its prosperity and its respectability, he had been suddenly flung by a financial calamity into a social condition far below his own. For men on that exact edge of the educated class such a transition is really tragic. A duke may become a navvy for a joke, but a clerk cannot become a navvy for a joke. Dickens's parents went to a debtors' prison; Dickens himself went to a far more unpleasant place. The debtors' prison had about it at least that element of amiable compromise and kindly decay which belonged (and belongs still) to all the official institutions of England. But Dickens was doomed to see the very blackest aspect of nineteenth-century England, something far blacker than any mere bad government. He went not to a prison but to a factory. In the musty traditionalism of the Marshalsea old John Dickens could easily remain optimistic. In the ferocious efficiency of the modern factory young Charles Dickens narrowly escaped being a pessimist. He did escape this danger; finally he even escaped the factory itself. His next step in life was, if possible, even more eccentric. He was sent to school; he was sent off like an innocent little boy in Eton collars to learn the rudiments of Latin grammar, without any reference {{to the fact that he}} had already taken his part in the horrible competition and actuality of the age of manufactures. It was like giving a sacked bank manager a satchel and sending him to a dame's school. Nor was the third stage of this career unconnected with the oddity of the others. On leaving the school he was made a clerk in a lawyer's office, as if henceforward this child of ridiculous changes was to settle down into a silent assistant for a quiet solicitor. It was exactly at this moment that his fundamental rebellion began to seethe; it seethed more against the quiet finality of his legal occupation than it had seethed against the squalor and slavery of his days of poverty. There must have been in his mind, I think, a dim feeling: [...] "Did all my dark crises mean only this; was I crucified only that I might become a solicitor's clerk?" [...] Whatever be the truth about this conjecture there can be no question about the facts themselves. It was about this time that he began to burst and bubble over, to insist upon his own intellect, to claim a career. It was about this time that he put together a <b>loose</b> <b>pile</b> of papers, satires on institutions, pictures of private persons, fairy tales of the vulgarity of his world, odds and ends such as come out of the facility and the fierce vanity of youth. It was about this time at any rate that he decided to publish them, and gave them the name of Sketches by Boz.|$|E

Detecting {{the presence of}} rough-haired golden moles is {{made all the more}} difficult by their preference for areas with sandy soils and dense vegetation, normally close to water sources.5 They have a preference for the use of dry ground on the fringes of marshes or damp veils.9 Possibly for the ease of excavating invertebrates such as worms.

Roberts (1951) thought solitary moles lived in chambers within their burrow systems from which they emerge only after rain.

If suddenly alarmed when out of the burrows they quickly return to their shelter. In captivity, Roberts (1951) noted that, irrespective of the direction in which they faced, when they were disturbed their reactions were so rapid and the location of the burrow entrance apparently so well known that it was difficult to follow them as they sought refuge within it.38 ...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} embryo’s first organ is the notochord, a stiffening rod later {{replaced by}} the backbone. Cells fated to become notochord rearrange extensively as the cells of their array converge upon the midline and extend anteriorly. Simultaneously, the interfaces between presumptive somite and presumptive notochord extend. Convergent-extension (CE) theory suggests that coordinated lateral to medial cell migration within the presumptive notochord is a driving force of elongation and involution and perhaps of involution. Large explants of presumptive notochord will elongate, but smaller ones will not, raising {{the possibility of a}} contributing interaction with the adjacent presumptive somite. Somite-notochord spreading (SNS) theory proposes that these two populations rearrange to increase their cell-to-cell contact with one another, thereby increasing the length of the interface between them. If so, destroying the cells of the midline (presumptive notochord) but leaving the notochord-somite boundaries intact should not inhibit SNS elongation. However, reducing the number of presumptive notochord cells contributing to CE could reduce the force available for elongation and perhaps its range of success as well. As a test, the central presumptive notochord cells of thirty-two early (stage 10) gastrulae were scratched out with a needle. Seven of those embryos dissociated into <b>loose</b> <b>piles</b> of dying cells. The twenty-five survivors elongated well.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the two-dimensional collapse of piles of granular materials, a problem analogous to the classical dam break problem in hydraulics. This study is intended to aid in the development of constitutive equations and modeling procedures that can be applied to predict various flows involving high concentration liquid-particle mixtures. We consider the granular collapse as a test problem and attempt to validate our modeling by comparing our predictions with previously published granular collapse experiments. The time-dependent evolution of the collapsing granular piles is calculated by making use of COMSOL, a commercial finite element code that is designed to handle a wide variety of Multiphysics problems. We begin by considering the collapse of a rectangular block of dry granular material and calculate the temporal evolution of the free surface by making use of the Level Set method. Good agreement is found between these predictions and the laboratory experiments of Balmforth and Kerswell (2005). The collapse of granular material submerged in a water is then investigated using a Mixture Model approach. The experiments of Rondon et al. (2011) revealed drastically different collapse periods depending upon whether the initial pile was in a loose or a dense, compacted state. The simple Mixture Model approach gave reasonably good predictions of the Rondon et al. (2011) experiments for the case of initially <b>loose</b> <b>piles</b> that collapsed in about a second, but it was unsuccessful in simulating the collapse of the initially dense piles that were observed by Rondon et al.
