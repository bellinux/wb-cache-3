40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies have}} {{cast doubt on}} the {{effectiveness}} and efficiency of school based dental screening programmes in improving dental attendance or improving dental health. In 2002 the National <b>Dental</b> <b>Inspection</b> Programme was introduced in Scotland which categorises children by their dental health and informs parents of the findings via a personalised letter home and encourages dental registration. In addition, epidemiological data for local and national planning purposes is collected. This replaced an earlier school screening system in Lothian where a generic letter urging registration was sent to children who were identified as not being registered with a dentist. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare dental registrations rates among unregistered children in these two school inspection systems with a system where letters were sent home but no <b>dental</b> <b>inspection</b> was carried out. Methods The study was designed as a single blinded, cluster randomised, controlled trial involving 12, 765 12 – 13 -year-old children attending all 65 state Secondary schools in Lothian and Fife during the academic year 2003 / 4. After stratifying for school size and range of social deprivation, schools were randomly allocated to one of four groups: 1. 'Traditional' inspection, letter to unregistered children only, 2. Letter sent home to unregistered children only, no <b>inspection,</b> 3. National <b>Dental</b> <b>Inspection</b> Programme, letter to all children, 4. Control group in which the children were neither inspected nor sent a letter. Dental Registration status was compared at baseline and 3 months post inspection. Results The registration levels in both the 'Traditional' screening and the NDIP inspection groups rose 3 months post inspection (14 % and 15. 8 % respectively) but were not significantly different from one another or the control group which rose by 15. 8 % (p > 0. 05). The group who were sent a letter home but were not inspected also has a rise in registration levels of 18. 1 % which was not significantly different from either of the groups who were inspected or the control group (p > 0. 05). The only significant predictors of registration were previous registration (p Conclusion Neither of the two <b>dental</b> <b>inspection</b> methods nor a letter home to unregistered children resulted in a significant rise in registration rates in 12 – 13 -year-olds compared to a control group of children who received no intervention. </p...|$|R
50|$|As Toronto's Medical Officer of Health (1910-29) Hastings crusaded to make Toronto {{the first}} city in Canada to pasteurize milk.
