The analytical phase is worked out {{on the basis of}} a seven-degree-of-freedom system combining elastic deflections of the rotor blades, rotor shaft, pylon, and fuselage. The calculated coupled frequencies are first compared with calculated uncoupled frequencies to show the general effects of coupling and then with measured coupled frequencies to determine the extent to which the coupled frequencies can be calculated. The coupled mode shapes are also calculated and were observed visually with stroboscopic lights during the tests. A comparison of the coupled and uncoupled natural frequencies shows that significant differences exist between these frequencies for some of the modes. Good agreement is obtained between the measured and calculated values for the coupled natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results show that the coupled natural frequencies and mode shapes can be determined by the analytical procedure presented herein with sufficient accuracy if the mass and stiffness distributions of the various components of the helicopter are known...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} assumptions, goals, methods, {{results and}} conclusions related to fuel tank arrangement of a flying wing passenger airplane configuration. A short overview of various fuel tank systems {{in use today}} {{of different types of}} aircraft is treated {{as a starting point for}} designing a fuel tank system to be used on very large passenger airplanes. These systems may be used to move fuel around the aircraft to keep the centre of gravity within acceptable limits, to maintain pitch and lateral balance and stability. With increasing aircraft speed, the centre of lift moves aft, and for trimming the elevator or trimmer must be used thereby increasing aircraft drag. To avoid this, the centre of gravity can be shifted by pumping fuel from forward to aft tanks. The lesson learnt from this is applied to minimise trim drag by moving the fuel along the airplane. Such a task can be done within coming days if we know the minimum drag versus CG position and weight value. The main part of the paper is devoted to wing bending moment distribution. A number of arrangements of fuel in airplane tanks are investigated and a scenario of refuelling - minimising the root bending moments - is presented. These results were obtained under the assumption that aircraft is in long range flight (14 hours), CL is constant and equal to 0. 279, Specific Fuel Consumption is also constant and that overall fuel consumption is equal to 20 tons per 1 hour. It was found that the average stress level in wing structure is lower if refuelling starts from fuel tanks located closer to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry.</b> It can influence the rate of fatigue...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetic Imaging {{problems}} involve {{development of}} an algorithm for estimation of complex permittivities of a N-cell body from the knowledge of scattered electric fields at N receiver locations, incident electric fields at N-cell centroid locations, cell sizes, cell locations and receiver locations. In this algorithm, {{it is necessary to}} invert a scattering matrix, which relates polarization current inside the body to scattered electric fields outside the body. To allow for a large number of cells, it is necessary to reduce matrix formation and inversion time. This is achieved by block diagonalization of the scattering matrix using standard point symmetry groups vh CD 22, and hC 1. For three <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry,</b> two <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> and one <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry,</b> it is necessary to use groups vh CD 22, and hC 1, respectively.

Due to n) 3 or 2 or 1 (=n <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> which depend on the configuration of the imaging problem regarding cell locations, cell sizes, receiver locations and transmitter location, it is possible to block diagonalize the scattering matrix. In this paper, block diagonalized matrix is derived for one <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> which can be generalized to two or three <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry.</b> Because <b>of</b> block diagonalization, it is observed {{that it is necessary to}} consider n 2 matrices of nn NN 2 / 32 / 3 × instead of one NN 33 × scattering matrix.
