After fruitless investigations at Mill House, where she finds an undeveloped canister of film, Anne discovers that Kilmorden Castle {{is the name of}} a ship sailing on 17 January 1922 from Southampton to Cape Town. She books passage on it. On board the ship, Anne meets Suzanne Blair, Colonel Race, and Sir Eustace Pedler himself. In addition to his normal secretary, Guy Pagett, he has employed a man who goes by the name of Harry Rayburn.

40|$|Abstract — Steganography {{is the art}} or {{practice}} of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file. In steganography, there is a technique in which the <b>least</b> significant <b>bit</b> is modified to hide the secret message, known as the <b>least</b> significant <b>bit</b> (LSB) steganography. <b>Least</b> significant <b>bit</b> matching images are still not well detected, especially, at low embedding rate. In this paper, we have improved the <b>least</b> significant <b>bit</b> steganalyzers by analyzing and manipulating the features of some existing <b>least</b> significant <b>bit</b> matching steganalysis techniques. This paper explains the LSB Embedding technique with lifting based DWT schemes by using Micro blaze Processor implemented in a FPGA using System C coding...|$|R

40|$|I {{would like}} to take this {{opportunity}} to thank my supervisor, Dr Ron Poet, for his time and assistance. The objective of this project was to implement several different steganography algorithms with an aim to provide a basis for comparison in terms of effectiveness and hiding capacity. Effectiveness of the algorithms was measured by user evaluations determining at which point alteration to the images became apparent. The algorithms implemented were the <b>least</b> significant <b>bit,</b> two <b>least</b> significant <b>bits,</b> four <b>least</b> significant <b>bits</b> and the Bit Plane Complexity Segmentation (BPCS) algorithms. The most noteworthy algorithm implemented was the BPCS algorithm as devised by Kawaguchi et al (1998). This dissertation also discusses the implementation of this algorithm, which was not covered in the papers written by the authors of the technique. The outcome of the project showed that the two lower capacity algorithms (<b>least</b> significant <b>bit</b> and two <b>least</b> significant <b>bits)</b> were highly effective. The four <b>least</b> significant <b>bits</b> algorithm, when tested to the maximum capacity was ineffective. The claim made by Kawaguchi et a...|$|R

500|$|While Voxs Siddharth Naidu {{thought of}} the film as {{politically}} radical and emotionally raw, Aseem Chhabra called it the <b>least</b> <b>bit</b> political in another editorial for Rediff.com. Freelance journalist Steven Borowiec agreed with the latter idea, writing that [...] "the social context of same sex love in India remains mostly off-screen". Writing for ThinkProgress Ford made note {{of the fact that}} although the socio-political backdrop, [...] "is never explicitly mentioned, it’s alluded to throughout". Addressing the same issue, Saria said that although Loev is not a political film, the act of making it was a political one. He said, [...] "hat started out as an intellectual act of protest quickly became something else. Love."

[...] Alternative Press awarded the album {{four out of five}} stars, adding that [...] "the disc's bread and butter is Auf Der Maur's smoking riffs." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V.

In his review for the BBC, Matt Wicks described the album as [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "like the Pumpkins in their prime" [...] and compared Auf der Maur to other female contemporaries such as Shirley Manson and PJ Harvey. Blender gave a majorly positive review, awarding the album three out of five stars, but criticized Auf der Maur's vocals, stating: [...] "buffeted by big guitars, her thin, untrained voice occasionally sounds listless." ...|$|E

[...] Keyes added that, despite Cyrus' charisma, it was evident the show and the dual-persona arrangement (considering {{that there were no}} major divergences between them) was an evident strategy to extend marketing and receive more profits. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle believed Cyrus was a fair singer and commented, [...] "It was relatively wholesome, musically tolerable and certainly had plenty of production value. Some adults may have walked away wondering what the big fuss was about, but none of the kids looked the <b>least</b> <b>bit</b> disappointed." [...] Jane Stevenson of the Canadian Online Explorer noted the differences between Hannah Montana and Cyrus, stating that Cyrus was the [...] "marginally tougher cookie of the two singers" [...] and that audiences received two concerts for the price of one.

[...] It also stated that the Hannah Montana set was more satisfying due to the quality of the songs and more energy. Geoff Edgers of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "Of course, most of the mainly tweener fans in the arena weren't splitting [...] musical hairs.

A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them.

500|$|Romantic {{notions of}} the 1920s as a more {{innocent}} period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In {{addition to being a}} Kafkaesque drama about the search for a missing child, the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong {{and the way in which}} powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. [...] " [...] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption," [...] he said, [...] "It's happened even in recent years... so it was nice to comment [...] by going back to real events in 1928." [...] Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as [...] "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a [...] "golden age" [...] in the city. In Changeling, this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed [...] "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: [...] "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the <b>least</b> <b>bit</b> of mercy to a criminal." [...] It compares police excess to the vigilantism of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, as the department's [...] "Gun Squad" [...] carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.|$|E
