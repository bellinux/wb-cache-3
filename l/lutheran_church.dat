5|$|Hebron Church (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Great Capon Church, Hebron <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church,</b> and Hebron Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church)</b> is a mid-19th-century <b>Lutheran</b> <b>church</b> in Intermont, Hampshire County, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. Hebron Church {{was founded in}} 1786 by German settlers in the Cacapon River Valley, making it the first <b>Lutheran</b> <b>church</b> west of the Shenandoah Valley. The congregation worshiped in a log church, which initially served both Lutheran and Reformed denominations. Its congregation was originally German-speaking; the church's documents and religious services were in German until 1821, when records and sermons transitioned to English.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> (also {{known as}} the Cross Church at Danebod) was {{dedicated}} Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to {{the arms of the}} cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting walls and ceiling, porthole windows as in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling, Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest <b>Lutheran</b> <b>church</b> in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> in America (ELCA). Danebod <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> remains a part of the ELCA still today.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent {{church of the}} General Council from 18671918.

This event, while marking a watershed of unity among American Lutherans, also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium. The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> in America (which continues to be an active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E

5|$|Although Henry {{has never}} been officially canonized, he has been {{referred}} to as a saint since as early as 1296 according to a papal document of the time, and continues to be called as such today as well. On the basis of the traditional accounts of Henry's death, his recognition as saint took place prior to the founding of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and the official canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. Henry is currently commemorated on January 19 on the calendar of commemorations of the Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> in America and the Evangelical <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Church</b> in Canada. January 19 is also Henry's name day in Sweden and Finland.
