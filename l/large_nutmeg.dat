They {{are small and}} hard in the strawberry, raspberry, currant, etc., and are readily swallowed among the copious pulp. In the grape they are hard and bitter; in the rose (hip) disagreeably hairy; in the orange tribe very bitter; and all these have a smooth, glutinous exterior which facilitates their being swallowed. When the seeds are larger and are eatable, they are enclosed in an excessively hard and thick covering, as in the various kinds of [...] "stone" [...] fruit (plums, peaches, etc.), or in a very tough core, as in the apple. In the nutmeg of the Eastern Archipelago we have a curious adaptation to a single group of birds. The fruit is yellow, somewhat like an oval peach, but firm and hardly eatable. This splits open and shows the glossy black covering of the seed or nutmeg, over which spreads the bright scarlet arillus or [...] "mace," [...] an adventitious growth of no use to the plant except to attract attention. Large fruit pigeons pluck out this seed and swallow it entire {{for the sake of}} the mace, while the <b>large</b> <b>nutmeg</b> passes through their bodies and germinates; and this has led to the wide distribution of wild nutmegs over New Guinea and the surrounding islands.|$|E

50|$|In low doses, nutmeg {{produces}} no noticeable physiological or neurological response, but in <b>large</b> doses, raw <b>nutmeg</b> has psychoactive effects {{deriving from}} anticholinergic-like hallucinogenic mechanisms attributed to myristicin and elemicin. Myristicin, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and psychoactive substance, can induce convulsions, palpitations, nausea, eventual dehydration, and generalized body pain. For these reasons in some countries, whole or ground nutmeg may have import restrictions except in spice mixtures containing less than 20 percent nutmeg.|$|R

40|$|History {{has shown}} that Indonesia is the {{greatest}} producer of nutmeg since XV century. In fact, about 60 % of the world supply of nutmeg is produce in Indonesia, where nutmegs are commonly used as both spices and food. Beside, a few {{use it as an}} oil and balsam. In other counties, nutmeg is used as material for trimiristin production, which is a main substance of myristic acid and alcohol in cosmetic industry. Data have shown that Indonesian's export of nutmeg to USA is rally high, especially for the nutmeg's production. The price of trimiristin is relatively high when synthesized from myristic acid and alcohol. Therefore, the development of new techniques for the isolaton of timiristin from nutmeg may decrease the production costs. Furthermore, trimiristin production can be hugely increased, due to the <b>large</b> quantity of <b>nutmeg</b> produced in Indonesia.   Keywords: Nutmeg, Development, Myristic Acid, Myristic Alcohol</p...|$|R
50|$|When the {{bubonic plague}} raged in London in 1665, Hodges {{remained}} in residence, and attended all who sought his advice.

He rose early, and took a dose of anti-pestilential electuary as <b>large</b> as a <b>nutmeg.</b> After transacting his household affairs he entered his consulting room. Crowds of patients were always waiting, and for three hours he examined them and prescribed, finding some who were already ill, and others only affected by fear. When he had seen all he breakfasted, and visited patients at their houses. On entering a house he had a disinfectant burnt on hot coals, and if hot or out of breath rested till at his ease, then put a lozenge {{in his mouth and}} proceeded to examine the patient.|$|R

Those plants are now, I understand, to be offered to public sale, which will, I presume, answer the views of Government equally well with purchasing them on the Company's account, as it matters not by whom, so that they are propagated on the island. — About six hundred nutmeg plants belonging to the Company are now in a very thriving way, but the clove plant appears to be difficult to rear, there being not above half a dozen alive of those sent here by the Company's botanist." [...] The Surprise was a British brig that arrived a few days earlier from the Moluccas with five slaves sent over by the Resident at Banda, R. T. Townsend, to look after those nutmeg plants at Penang.|$|R
