60|$|There was now, however, no {{rush to get}} on shore,--such as Rollo {{had always}} been {{accustomed}} to witness on board an American steamer on her arrival,--but every thing was quiet and still. By and by a plank was laid. Then the passengers were called upon to get out their tickets. Then they began to walk over the plank, each one giving up his <b>landing</b> <b>ticket</b> as he passed.|$|E
50|$|Grand Island National Recreation Area {{is served}} during summer months by a tourist ferry and island tour bus. The ferry ride, {{which is less}} than 1 mi long, {{shuttles}} between a dock on M-28, northwest of Munising, and Grand Island's Williams <b>Landing.</b> <b>Ticket</b> fees and an admission fee to the island are charged. During the summer months, the ferry makes several trips to the island each day.|$|E

40|$|Eco-labelled seafood is an {{important}} tool to promote sustainable development in fisheries. A price premium on eco-labelled seafood signals a return on investment in sustainable fishing methods, providing an incentive for fishers to adopt such methods. This paper investigates whether Swedish fishermen gained a price premium from participating in the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) -certified Swedish Eastern Baltic cod fishery in the period 2011 - 2012. Using a detailed dataset of <b>landing</b> <b>tickets</b> and log books, we apply a panel data methodology to estimate the MSC price premium. We cannot find reliable evidence that the consumer level premium for MCS cod is actually passed back to the producers in this case...|$|R
30|$|A queue {{is formed}} when either there is {{positive}} service time or {{there are no}} sufficient servers for the arriving customers. Queuing systems in which an arriving customer finds the server busy and waiting positions (if any) occupied leaves the service area but repeats his demand after some random time are called retrial queues. Between trials, customer {{is said to be}} in an orbit. Retrial queues {{play an important role in}} communication and computer networks. Other applications include stacked aircraft waiting to <b>land,</b> <b>ticket</b> reservation for trains and flights and queues of retail shoppers who may leave a long waiting line hoping to return later when the line may be shorter. For detailed discussion on retrial queues, one may refer to the monograph by Falin and Templeton (1997) and the bibliography by Artalejo (2010).|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study the causes of weak {{agricultural}} base in China, the income gap between urban and rural residents, agriculture and the obvious insufficiency in agriculture, rural areas and farmers, we analyze focal and difficult points in the simultaneous development between Chinese industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization and seek for ways and strategies to promote the modernization of agriculture process. This study takes Qijiang district of Chongqing as an example, from five aspects to discuss the ways and strategies of advancing the process of agricultural modernization; they are {{the development of the}} profitable agriculture, the reform of rural property rights, management rights and <b>land</b> <b>ticket,</b> rural circulation and financing, government investment and support and the improvement of the production and living conditions in rural areas. We hope these can accelerate the construction of agricultural modernization, promote sustained and rapid growth in farmers' income, constantly improve the production and living conditions in rural areas and promote the simultaneous development of industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization...|$|R

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Fishing {{is risky}} business. Managers and Fishermen {{therefore}} care {{not only about}} the average income, but also about its variation. In spite of its importance, {{little is known about the}} observed risk exposure of fishing firms and its determinants. We have obtained complete <b>landing</b> <b>tickets</b> data for a significant share of Norwegian fishing vessels over the past 5 - 10 years from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. The dataset contains information on where and when the fish was caught and landed, equipment used, prices obtained, quality, etc. Our paper uses this panel to (1) describe the distribution and the trends in the boat-specific risk exposure of Norwegian fishing firms (measured as the Conditional-Value-at-Risk, CVaR), and to (2) explain what characterizes differences in risk exposure while controlling for fixed effects such as the skipper’s risk aversion. Based on this, we then seek to uncover behavioral responses and institutional constrains that determine the trade-off between risk and revenue on an annual basis...|$|R

40|$|The Director s {{colloquium}} {{series was}} established primarily {{to provide a}} mechanism to bring high profile individuals to the Center to present new and innovative ideas to the entire Ames staff. More focused lecture series are arranged by specific divisions or departments. Before the year 1999, {{there is only a}} fragmentary record of who spoke in this series. Announcements to the staff were sent via <b>land</b> mail, and <b>tickets</b> were required to attend the colloquium. In 1999, the notification to attend colloquia became electronic and the entire resident staff was invited to attend. The centerwide announcement archive established in this timeframe created a lasting record of the Director s colloquia. The "Office of the Chief Scientist" at Ames had the responsibility for administering the colloquium series. When I became Chief Scientist on June 29, 1998, the program was not being used extensively and this continued to be the case through the years 1999 - 2002 of Harry McDonald s tenure as Director (see graph below). During Scott Hubbard s tenure as Director (September 19, 2002 - February 15, 2006), the Director's colloquium series was used exclusively for high profile speakers from outside Ames whom he selected, such as lab directors from other research organizations around the Bay Area. During Pete Worden s tenure as Ames Director (May 4, 2006 -present) the colloquium series gained far greater use. First, I had greater discretion to select speakers for the colloquium series. Secondly, beginning in 2007, we established a 10 -week Director's Colloquium Summer Series focused on enriching the experience of our many summer interns, and giving our top researchers within Ames Research Center an opportunity to present their work to the Center. The summer program has received rave reviews. This compendium contains a compilation of one-page descriptions (title, abstract and speaker biographies) for all of the 171 colloquia presented from the beginning of 1999 to October of 2012. The list of speakers includes four Nobel Laureates, six astronauts, three current or former Ames Center Directors, as well as many CEOs and other lab directors. Other featured speakers include famous mountain climbers, historians, movie stars, and former FBI agents and directors. Finally, the list includes world-class scientists and engineers representing a wide range of disciplines. It has been my privilege to host almost all of the colloquia presented in this compendium...|$|R
