The study used an 8 × 5 incomplete Latin Square design with eight mature wether sheep and five 21 -day periods. Tannin additions reduced in vivo apparent digestibilities of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom) compared with the untreated control silage (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Purpose: Cyclophilin 40 (CyP 40) is an {{estrogen}} receptor-associated protein {{which appears}} to modify receptor function. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the extent of allelic <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> the CyP 40 locus in a panel of breast carcinomas using a newly characterized microsatellite marker located upstream of the CyP 40 gene and then to correlate this with <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> chromosomal sites for cancer-associated genes. Methods: Allelic <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> CyP 40 was determined from patients 2 ̆ 7 matched tumor and normal breast tissue using Genescan 672 software analysis of fluorescently labeled, PAGE-separated PCR products incorporating the marker. For each patient, allelic <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> CyP 40 was then assessed and compared with <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> markers for various cancer-associated genes. Results: Allelic loss was detected in 30...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ensilage is {{a simple}} and {{low-cost}} strategy to enable long term preservation and environmentally friendly utilization of agricultural by-products, such as straws and distiller's grains (DG) for ruminants. Effect of mixing different proportions of DG and rice straw (i. e. 0, 10, 20 or 30 % of DG) with or without 5 % molasses addition on fermentation and chemical variables of silages was evaluated. The study was conducted as a randomized blocks design in a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement, with three replications, using laboratory silos of 1 L capacity (n= 24). Despite a significant interaction (P< 0. 01) between DG and molasses addition was observed for most variables, in general the increased addition of DG linearly decreased the pH value, acetic acid (AA), butyric acid (BA) and ammonia N concentration (P< 0. 01), and increased the lactic acid (LA) concentration (P< 0. 01). Exception was the propionic acid concentration which linearly decreased without molasses addition and linearly increased with molasses addition at increased proportion of DG (P< 0. 01). In both silages with or without molasses the addition of DG increased the dry matter, water soluble carbohydrates and crude protein (P< 0. 01), and decreased the NDF content (P< 0. 01). Based on the perspective of maximum utilization of rice straw, the mixture of 10 % of DG associated to 5 % molasses <b>at</b> <b>ensilage</b> process is recommended...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel integration {{options for}} passive inductor which include: motor-shaped rotational and motor-shaped rotor-less inductor for {{high speed motor}} drive system. The novel options have been designed and their performance is compared with the conventional EE core inductor using finite element analysis. It is observed {{that there is a}} significant reduction in total <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> fundamental frequency along with substantial reduction in the AC copper <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> 10, 15 and 20 kHz switching frequencies, when the proposed integrated options are utilized. For the motor-shaped rotational inductor, the total <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> fundamental frequency and AC copper <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> different switching frequencies are reduced by 26. 1 % and 73. 8 % (at different switching frequencies) respectively. There is a reduction in overall volume by 3. 6 %, but this comes with 11. 7 % increase in weight. For the motor-shaped rotor-less inductor, the total <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> fundamental frequency and AC copper <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> different switching frequencies are reduced by 10. 4 % and 73. 8 % (at different switching frequencies) respectively. There is a reduction in overall volume by 3. 6 % but this comes with 6. 1 % increase in weight. The proposed designs can share the cooling system of the motor thus, eliminating the requirement of separate cooling system...|$|R
