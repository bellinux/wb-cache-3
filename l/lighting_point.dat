From this point of view are analyzed the possibility to control the surface polymerization of acrylic acid (AA) on the poly-sulfone (PS) hollow fiber through UV illumination. Was found the UV band where the integral flux variation with the power supply is more sensitive, allowing the control of photo-polymerization layer size trough power illumination and speed of PS hollow fiber in the AA solution.

40|$|Before {{dealing with}} the {{question}} of lighting short tunnels, it is necessary define what is meant by a tunnel and when it should be called 'short'. Confined to motorized road traffic the following is the most apt definition of a tunnel: every form of roofing-over a road section, irrespective of it length. From the <b>lighting</b> <b>point</b> of view, there is even no objection to applying this definition to a telephone wire stretched across a road and tore to regard it as a tunnel of 1 mm in length. For it will be been that very short tunnels need no lighting at all. It is less simple to define what a 'short' tunnel is. But it is necessary to distinguish very clearly between short and long tunnels. First because such a distinction is already made in normal parlance and in the second place because short tunnels are usually regarded {{as part of a larger}} project.

40|$|Old {{drivers and}} old road users in general, have high injury and {{fatality}} rates in road traffic. Furthermore, {{the proportion of}} old road users and old drivers will increase rapidly during the coming decades. Night travel has proven most difficult for old persons. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze this situation from the vehicle <b>lighting</b> <b>point</b> of view in order to propose vehicle lighting improvements that could be of special benefit to old road users. A literature review of current knowledge concerning age, visual performance, and accident involvement was carried out. This was followed by an analysis of the present vehicle lighting problems. Based on the results from these analyses, a number of proposals for improvements were presented. The main proposals concerning illumination systems are as follows: more illumination to increase visibility in spite of higher glare, wider illumination to improve road guidance, a softer cut-off to decrease aiming sensitivity, and keeping headlights clean and correctly aimed. The main proposals concerning signaling and marking lights are the following: two intensity levels (for day and night), small, high-mounted turn signals, and higher light-source reliability. Mandatory daytime running lights are proposed. Interior lighting should be improved in a number of aspects. All of these proposed improvements should be beneficial not only for old drivers, but also for other drivers. Finally, the visibility and safety effects are estimated, research needs are pointed out, and technical and economic problems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Place for {{excellence}} for hearing, {{but also for}} seeing, as indicated from the Greek etymologic origin "théatron", "place where to see", the ancient theatre presents today two sides: an architectural one, as archaeological site, and an artistic one, as place of entertainment. This double cultural heritage often generates conflict {{in the manner of}} use, so in ancient theatres the conservation rules have sometimes to collide with the intense (and often inappropriate) use during the summer theatrical season. This article presents a research conducted on the Greek theatre of Syracuse {{from the point of view}} of acoustic and lighting comfort. A parametric study realized through technical software (Odeon ® version 10. 1 and Relux ® 2012) has been conducted by adding in the theatre different scenic elements to evaluate their influence on passive acoustics and solar radiation. From the acoustic point of view, the comparison between the condition with and without the scenery allows to establish guidelines for the scenic design, with the purpose of preserving and improving the original acoustic apparatus. The results have been evaluated on the base of measurements realized on-site, that allowed a calibration of model of the theatre in empty conditions. From the <b>lighting</b> <b>point</b> of view, the daylight analysis during the hours of daytime use of the theater defined potential elements of discomfort for the viewer, due to glare or high contrasts of luminance between scenery and sky: through an integrated approach of acoustic and lighting design it has been possible to solve those problem...|$|E

40|$|The Dutch Ministry of Transport is {{considering}} {{the application of}} dynamic road marking (DRM) on motorways. DRM consists of a row of light sources (usually LEDs) built in the road surface. TNO Human Factors performed a psychophysical experiment to determine the necessary DRM luminous intensity for achieving adequate perception {{as a function of}} the light environment (time of day) and the geometry (distance between <b>light</b> <b>points,</b> orientation). The results provide a basis for the photometrical specifications of DRM. An experimental DRM was installed on an asphalt road surface on a closed terrain. At a viewing distance of about 100 m subjects had to adjust the luminous intensity of the DRM according to various perception criteria. The luminance of the road surface varied between 0. 01 cd/m 2 (night) and 5000 cd/m 2 (sunny day). The DRM was oriented at a horizontal angle of 2. 86 degrees with the viewing direction, similar to a traditional road marking at a motorway exit. The distance between <b>light</b> <b>points</b> varied 1 and 7 m. In order to establish the photometrical specifications for DRM the experimental results were combined with standard reflection properties of road surfaces, statistical data on daylight and other literature data. We derive a model that describes the required light intensity of DRM as a function of road luminance, <b>light</b> <b>point</b> distance, and perception criterion. For night- time road luminances (L 100 cd/m 2) the required light intensity is proportional to L 0. 812. Differences between the perception criteria at daytime are smaller than at night-time. In daytime the maximum light intensity is a factor of 4. 3 higher than the minimum light intensity; in night-time this factor is 14. The required luminous intensity of the individual <b>light</b> <b>points</b> increases with the (observed) <b>light</b> <b>point</b> distance, according to an asymptotic function. The minimum and maximum luminous intensities of the individual <b>light</b> <b>points</b> {{as a function of the}} road luminance can be calculated with the model. These intensity limits depend on the distance between the <b>light</b> <b>points</b> and on the orientation of the DRM. Calculation of the maximum required luminous intensity is based on road luminances of 4000 cd/m 2 (95 -percentile value) and 16000 cd/m 2 (opposing sun). For a 2. 86 degrees slanted DRM at a distance of 100 m, a mutual <b>light</b> <b>point</b> distance of 6 m and an opposing sun, the luminous intensity of the <b>light</b> <b>points</b> should be at least 100 cd. For a mutual <b>light</b> <b>point</b> distance of 1 m, the minimum value is 37 cd. The results of this study will be used by the Dutch Ministry of Transport for establishing a program of requirements for DRM...|$|R
