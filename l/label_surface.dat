When used directly to <b>label</b> <b>surface</b> immunoglobulin, and indirectly to label alloantigens and concanavalin A receptors, hybrid antibodies induced similar displacement of all surface components from a uniform distribution into “patches” and “caps” at 37 °. One hybrid antibody preparation, antimouse immunoglobulin/anti-ferritin, contained negligible amounts of bivalent anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody, {{and was therefore}} “monovalent” for the antimouse immunoglobulin specificity. This observation suggests that factors other than multivalent crosslinking are responsible for hybrid antibody-induced redistribution of cell-surface components. Cap formation induced by hybrid antibody was enhanced markedly by attachment of the visual marker, either ferritin or southern bean mosaic virus, at 37 °. At - 5 °, hybrid antibody does not displace uniformly distributed H- 2 b alloantigen-alloantibody complexes, but patches of label develop when ferritin attaches to the hybrid antibody.

The fluorescence of bound fluorescamine on cells at the permissive temperature (35 degrees) was found to be about 1 / 3 that of cells cultured at the nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees). During development of the transformed phenotype, i. e., after transfer of the cells from 41 degrees to 35 degrees, the decrease in surface fluorescence was observed to be an early event occurring within the first 4 - 8 hr after temperature shift. This alteration took place on a time scale similar to that of changes in 2 -deoxyglucose transport and an increased rate of DNA synthesis, but before any major morphological changes. The change was related to cell transformation rather than to growth differences of the cells at the two temperatures. Further, it was found that fluorescamine was not monitoring the loss of LETS glycoprotein from the surface or the loss of any other surface components that could be detected by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of surface proteins.

40|$|Surface {{proteins}} are key actors of {{the complex}} interactions between bacteria (pathogens, commensals or symbionts) and their host. In beneficial (probiotic) bacteria, they participate in competition with pathogens, adhesion to the host cells, and immunomodulation. We investigated such proteins in the beneficial bacterium Propionibacterium freudenreichii, consumed both in Swiss-type cheeses and probiotic preparations. P. freudenreichii genome was sequenced and annotated, the localization of the encoded proteins was predicted using SurfG+. A combination of 3 biochemical methods confirmed surface exposure of P. freudenreichii proteins: shedding, shaving and labelling. Shedding consisted in the extraction of cell-wall associated proteins using guanidine, followed by trypsinolysis of the extracted proteins. Shaving consisted in enzymatic hydrolysis of surface protruding proteins which were accessible to trypsin in situ on live bacteria. For labeling, an NHS-ester-cyanine was added to live bacteria in order to <b>label</b> <b>surface</b> proteins, prior to 2 -D electrophoresis and detection of fluorescent protein spots. For the 3 methods, the resulting tryptic peptides were identified by NanoLC-MS/MS on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer This combination of methods allowed identification of surface layer type-proteins, lipoproteins, proteins associated to the cell wall, to the membrane, or predicted to be secreted, as well as moonlighting proteins predicted to be cytoplasmic. Some of these proteins are known to participate in adhesion and in the modulation of the immune response by probiotics.

The M cell is usually found within the follicle associated epithelium (FAE) above organized collections of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which are found within close proximity of the epithelial layer. This project is focused on characterizing the M cells present in the mucosal tissues of the hamster. Our initial studies are using FAE from intestinal Peyer's patches but our longer term goal {{is to use the}} markers we develop to look for M cells in the hamster conjunctiva. A panel of 10 biotinylated lectins was incubated with excised Peyer's patches in vitro for 10 min at 4 °C to allow labeling of surface glycoconjugates. Following extensive rinsing, the samples were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and embedded in butyl-methyl-methacrylate resin. Semi-thin 0. 5 µm cross-sections of follicles were prepared and stained with streptavidin-Alexa 488. Fluorescence microscopy was then used to identify lectins which selectively labeled cells within the FAE. The N-acetylgalactosamine binding lectin SBA and the sialyllactose binding lectin MAL-I were identified as labeling non-overlapping subsets of cells in the FAE and therefore chosen for further characterization.

40|$|VGP {{is a major}} cell-surface {{glycoprotein}} {{present in}} vegetative cells of Myxococcus xanthus. Serological assays indicated that this protein was released from cells and accumulated in the medium during development, i. e., aggregation, fruiting body formation, and myxosporulation. Cells'induced to form spores {{in the absence of}} aggregation retained VGP, indicating that loss of VGP was associated with developmental aggregation rather than myxosporulation. Anti-VGP antibodies inhibited vegetative cell gliding, suggesting the protein may also be required for motility. Cells of Myxococcus xanthus, a gram-negative bacterium with gliding motility, maintain close contact to form cohe-sive swarms that enable 'the population to produce high concentrations of extracellular enzymes that efficiently de-grade polymeric nutrients (24). Motility is controlled by two multigene systems; the A system controls single cell motil-ity, and ' the S system regulates gliding of groups of cells (8 - 10). When deprived of nutrients, cells glide to aggregation centers forming fruiting bodies within which tens of thou-sands of slender cells differentiate into spherical, thick-walled, resistant myxospores (23, 28). During this develop-mental process (2, 3) the composition of surface (6, 7, 17) and membrane (12, 22) proteins changes dramatically, not only in amounts, but also in the appearance or disappearance of proteins.

40|$|Our {{contribution}} {{in this work}} is a new measure of similarity between surface points based on a spin-image surface representation that allows efficient identification of corresponding points between two surfaces. We represent a molecular surface {{as a collection of}} two-dimensional (2 D) spin images associated to Connolly’s points [1]. Given a surface point P with normal n, its associated spin image is a 2 D histogram of the positions of neighboring points of P, with respect to a reference frame formed by P and its tangent plane [2]. It is a local description, invariant to rigid transformations, of the shape of a 3 D object. We have developed a matching procedure that consists of 1) establishing point correspondences between two surfaces based on the correlation between their associated spin images and 2) grouping the corresponding points into similar surface patches, that are likely to correspond to active sites of the two proteins [3]. Here we introduce new spin image descriptors that speed up the matching process considerably and are robust enough to guarantee good quality of the results. Furthermore, as we will see, they are useful in the second step of matching in identifying surface cavities, that occur at the binding site of receptor-ligand complexes. We <b>label</b> <b>surface</b> points as blocked or open depending on the shape of their spin images. A surface point P with normal n is labeled open if n does not intersect the surface at any other point lying above the tangent plane T at P perpendicular to n, otherwise is blocked.

Briefly, the profile of a spin image at point P is a one-dimensional (1 D) array of elements corresponding to the image columns, where each element counts the number of contiguous 0 -pixels in that column starting at the image boundary until the first non 0 -pixel (see Figure 1).

40|$|Most {{cancerous}} {{tumors are}} detected at a late-stage {{because of the}} lack of suitable diagnostic methods to ensure an early and specific diagnosis. Therefore, there is a crucial need to establish new and rapid method that allows the early detection of neoplasia in the sera of tumor patients, which could offer the possibility to heal them faster and to increase their chances of survival. It is also of high interest to discover potential biomarkers that determine the type and stage of the tumor disease prior to invasive operations. Glycome changes during development, differentiation and disease are increasingly recognized as biomarkers that are specific for many types of diseases such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. Borderline ovarian cancer In this study, the serum N-glycosylation pattern of BOT patients was analyzed to find out, whether it was possible to differentiate between ovarian- and BOT patients at the serum level. At first, the IgG glycome was measured using tryptic glycopeptides, purified from serum using protein A. Six statistically significant glycopeptide structures were detected by MALDI-TOF-MS using SPSS analyses. The best specificity and sensitivity could be achieved with the combination of the common used biomarker CA- 125 and the six different structures. With this combination, it was possible to classifiy all BOT samples as ill but it was not possible to distinguish between OvCa and BOT samples. In the next step, the N-glycome of total serum from OvCa, BOT and age-matched healthy controls were analyzed. N-glycans were selectively released with the enzyme PNGase F from human blood sera, isolated and subsequently measured by MALDI-TOF-MS. In order to detect all N-glycan structures including those with negatively charged sialic acid units, N-glycans were previously derivatized with methyl iodide. This derivatization reaction enables a measurement in positive ionization mode of all N-glycan structures. Their structures were confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS fragmentation analysis. The working group has already developed a serum biomarker named GLYCOV for OvCa. GLYCOV values were determined for BOT samples but they failed to discriminate BOT from healthy controls. A new value, GLYCOV_B, was calculated from the statistical differences observed between BOT and healthy control samples. With the new calculated value, all BOTsamples were classified as borderline and none of them were classified as healthy. The principal component analysis makes clear that both disease cohorts differ from each other. Such a classification has not been previously described in the literature. Colon cancer Further, the N-glycosylation profile from sera of colon cancer patients was examined to identify potential glycan-based biomarkers. This type of neoplasia is among the world's third leading cause of death. Survival chances increase with early detection by more than 90 %. Therefore, robust serum biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity would be very helpful. After enzymatic release, N-glycans were purified, derivatized via permethylation and measured by MALDI-TOF-MS. Seven statistically significant structures were identified by SPSS analyses and their structures were confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Two monofucosylated biantennary structures were down-regulated whereas two difucosylated mono- and diantennary structures and three sialylated monofucosylated structures were upregulated. A so-called GlycoColon value was generated from the seven significant structures, which was compared with CEA, the current biomarker for colorectal cancer. Both, specificity and sensitivity of GlycoColon values, were better than of CEA. In addition, when both biomarkers were combined together, the sensitivity reached 92 % and the specificity 96 %. In-gel N-glycan analysis To establish a rapid and efficient method to release and analyze minute amounts of N-glycans, the detection of in-gel digested N-glycans by MALDI-TOF was improved for model proteins by the addition of OGP, a non-ionic detergent, and by measurements on an Anchorchip target using D-arabinosazone as the matrix. Three different model proteins (RNase B, AGP and Fetuin) were digested in SDS-PAGE gels in the presence or absence of OGP. With this optimization, a limit of detection as low as 10 pmol of the model glycoprotein could be achieved. The addition of OGP enables an improved release and extraction of N-glycans from proteins stacked within the gel as the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra show structures with higher signal intensities. Glycan microarrays for serum-based diagnostics The microarray technology that enables faster and more efficient analysis is increasingly used for establishing novel diagnostic applications. In parallel, it has become a wide¬spread glycomics tool to unravel biological questions. In this study, N-glycans were isolated from human sources and subsequently labeled. The optimum <b>label,</b> <b>surface</b> and binding protocols were selected using glucose oligomers as model substances. It could be shown that, instead of the usual label 2 AB, DAP glucose oligomers were binding to the surface of the slide much more efficiently. Thereafter, sera from OvCa patients and age-matched healthy controls were investigated with the microarray technology. High mannose N-glycans and complex-type N-glycanstructures (Hex 6 HexNAc 5 Neu 5 Ac 3 - 2 AB (m/z 3764. 6) and Hex 5 Hex-NAc 4 Neu 5 Gc 2 - 2 AB (m/z 3014. 6)) were isolated by HPLC fractionation. Slides were coated with glycans, serum was put on the slides and finally a secondary fluorescent antibody directed against immunoglobulins was applied. The resulting fluorescent signals were measured using a fluorescence scanner. The signal intensities of the high-mannose N-glycans and Hex 5 HexNAc 4 Neu 5 Gc 2 - 2 AB were significantly stronger on OvCa arrays than on healthy control arrays. In summary, anti-high-mannose and anti-NeuGc autoantibodies are potential serum biomarkers for OvCa...|$|E
30|$|In summary, the LAPREP method we {{developed}} for the specific <b>labeling</b> of cell <b>surface</b> proteins offers several advantages over antibody-based labeling methods, namely the greater specificity and much smaller size of FKBP-fused fluorescent proteins compared with antibodies. This method also has several advantages over currently employed chemical-based labeling techniques, such as SNAP-tag and CLIP-tag. First, LAPREP has a high specificity for the <b>labeling</b> of <b>surface</b> proteins, even at high concentrations of FKBP-fused fluorescent proteins, whereas chemical dye-based labeling methods exhibit increased nonspecific binding at increased dye concentrations. Second, the low background fluorescence of the unreacted tag allows this method {{to be used for}} dynamic labeling without a washing step (Fig.  1). Third, the labeling rate is very fast, which allows high labeling efficiency and is useful for labeling proteins that cycle very rapidly between the intracellular compartments and the PM. Finally, the method is flexible and easy to use for the fluorescent labeling of multiple proteins or for pulse-chase labeling. The high specificity and affinity of FKBP-FP-AP 21967 for FRB (T 2098 L) make it easy to wash away unbound FKBP-FP within several seconds and to exchange one fluorescent protein to another. The diversity and various properties of FPs will make this method extremely useful for pulse-chase and/or multicolor labeling. However, every coin has its two sides. LAPREP has a high specificity for <b>labeling</b> <b>surface</b> proteins, but it is different from permeable chemical dyes. LAPREP cannot be used to label the intracellular proteins because the purified FP-conjugated FKBP cannot cross membrane, so it has the limit for labeling cytoplasmic proteins in live cells.|$|R

The radioactive derivative 125 IFC permits an analysis of the proteins that are responsible for most of the binding. Additionally, 125 IFC-labeled sperm are capable of fertilizing eggs, as assessed by autoradiography. That IFC <b>labels</b> the <b>surface</b> of the sperm was inferred from the following: (a) the <b>labeling</b> of the <b>surfaces</b> of other cells by fluorescein isothiocyanate and its derivatives; (b) the agglutination of labeled sperm by antibodies directed against IFC; (c) the use of peroxidase-dependent immunocytochemical reaction using anti-IFC antibodies, with analysis by electron microscopy; and (d) extraction of labeled sea urchin sperm with Triton X- 100 under conditions that preferentially solubilize the plasma membrane. The antiserum directed against IFC was used to isolate the <b>labeled</b> <b>surface</b> components from Triton X- 100 extracts of whole sperm, by immunoprecipitation, with Staphylococcus-A protein serving as a coprecipitant. The results support previous data showing that the sperm surface is a heterogeneous mosaic of restricted domains, one notable zone being the midpiece, where common molecular properties may be shared by sperm with distinctly different morphologies. In addition, IFC-mediated covalent alteration of specific cell surface proteins may be used to label, to identify, and, with the use of anti-IFC antibodies, to isolate such proteins from other cellular constituents...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of Caenorhabditis elegans mutants that show ectopic surface lectin binding (Srf mutants) was analyzed {{to determine the}} biochemical basis for this phenotype. This analysis involved selective removal or <b>labeling</b> of <b>surface</b> components, specific <b>labeling</b> of <b>surface</b> glycans, and fractionation of total protein with subsequent detection of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binding proteins. Wild-type and mutant nematodes showed no differences in their profiles of extractable surface glycoproteins or total WGA-binding proteins, suggesting that the ectopic lectin binding does not result from the novel expression of surface glycans. Instead, these results support a model in which ectopic lectin binding results from an unmasking of glycosylated components present in the insoluble cuticle matrix of wild-type animals. To explain the multiple internal defects found in some surface mutants, we propose that these mutants have a basic defect in protein processing. This defect would interfere with {{the expression of the}} postulated masking protein(s), as well as other proteins required for normal development...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} here a technique, "label-fracture," {{that allows}} the observation {{of the distribution of}} a cytochemical label on a cell <b>surface.</b> Cell <b>surfaces</b> <b>labeled</b> with an electron-dense marker (colloidal gold) are freeze-fractured and the fracture faces are replicated by plantinum/carbon evaporation. The exoplasmic halves of the membrane, apparently stabilized by the deposition of the Pt/C replica, are washed in distilled water. The new method reveals the surface distribution of the label coincident with the Pt/C replica of the exoplasmic fracture face. Initial applications indicate high resolution (less than or equal to 15 nm) and exceedingly low background. "Label-fracture" provides extensive views of the distribution of the <b>label</b> on membrane <b>surfaces</b> while preserving cell shape and relating to the freeze-fracture morphology of exoplasmic fracture faces. The regionalization of wheat germ agglutinin receptors on the plasma membranes of boar sperm cells is illustrated. The method and the interpretation of its results are straightforward. Label-fracture is appropriate for routine use as a <b>surface</b> <b>labeling</b> technique...|$|R
40|$|USING the rat b-cell RIN- 5 AH insulinoma line as a {{means for}} {{studying}} insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), it is shown that interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) induces b-cell damage initiated by early apoptotic signals. This action is demonstrated by DNA fragmentation, as assessed by specific BrdU <b>labeling,</b> <b>surface</b> expression of Fas and nitric oxide (NO) production. In addition, the interplay between NO and Fas is shown, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirms apoptosis by revealing the degree and type of cellular damage which, in the case of IL- 1 a, can be reversed by an inhibitor to NO synthesis. Apoptosis is also reconfirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by observing condensed nuclear chromatin after IL- 1 exposure. Thus, treatment of insulinoma cells with IL- 1 a and IL- 1 b seems to initiate a number of signals, including PKC activation as published previously, that ultimately lead to b-cell destruction. Each IL- 1 isoform, however, definitely follows a different pathway of action...|$|R
