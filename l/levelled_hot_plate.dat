40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore the effects of {{neonatal}} pain and pain relief on adulthood pain sensitivity. We hypothesized that exposure to early life pain, as induced by a surgical procedure, would cause decreased sensitivity in the developing pain systems, and that administration of analgesics would provide some attenuation of those effects. Adulthood behavioral assays included were measurement of ethanol preference, as well as <b>hot</b> <b>plate,</b> tail flick, and abdominal constriction tests. In support of our initial predictions, we found that in the tail flick and abdominal constriction tests, neonatal pain lessened adult responsiveness to a painful stimulus, except when morphine acted to restore pain sensitivity to its base <b>level.</b> In the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> condition this effect was only true for males, whereas for females morphine had no protective effect. Future research should focus on isolating the mechanisms of these observed differences...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} energy costs {{and the need for}} global reduction of CO 2 emissions, the development of superinsulation materials for the construction sector allows the design of low-energy buildings. Since still being in an experimental or at early-commercial stage, R&D of these materials focused on its final application is required, to accelerate access to the market for renovation of the building stock where space is a critical metric. In this paper, the experimental assessment of the thermal performance of a novel ambient pressure dried silica aerogel based composite is presented. In order to provide assessments at both, material and system <b>levels,</b> stress-strain tests, <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> measurements, as well as full scale tests under realistic boundary conditions were conducted.

40|$|The {{effect of}} aging (oxidation) of {{aluminum}} <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> in ambient air at 550 oC {{and the surface}} roughness of <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> was studied to investigate the correlation between <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> emissivity and wafer temperature at low temperatures (200 – 500 oC). Four different types of wafers (i. e. p- Si, p++ Si, GaAs and quartz) and <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> with three different surface conditions were tested. As aging time elapsed, the emissivity gradually increased and approached specific saturated values depending on its surface roughness. The <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> with rougher surface resulted in a larger emissivity value than a plate with smoother surface. There was good correlation between the emissivity of the aluminum <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> and wafer temperature. Wafer temperature increased with higher emissivity due to the higher radiative heat transfer between the <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> and the wafer. No significant correlation between wafer temperature and wafer type was observed.

40|$|The current {{paradigm}} for the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> pain test is problematic in several ways. It uses very limited behavioral criteria to define pain; traditionally, the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> pain test measures rats 2 ̆ 7 latencies to performing a specified behavior (hind paw mouthing or jumping) when {{placed on a}} warm surface. Also, the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> test yields significant results for only certain analgesics. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an analgesic effect in humans. They do not, however, affect <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> latencies in rats, unlike opioid analgesics, such as morphine. This study was intended {{to develop a new}} {{paradigm for}} using the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> to determine the effectiveness of different analgesics. This study had two main components; first, an inventory of morphine and saline treated rats 2 ̆ 7 behavior on the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> was compiled. Videotaped sessions of rats being placed on the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> were used to operationally define several behaviors not commonly employed in <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> analysis. Then the frequencies of these behaviors were determined from the tapes and used to develop a paradigm intended to yield significant results for rats treated with NSAIDs. In the second component of this study, rats treated with ibuprofen, an NSAID, were subjected to the new paradigm. These rats displayed certain behaviors at a significantly different frequency than control rats suggesting that there are in fact behavioral changes on the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> in response to NSAIDs, and they are detectable with the new paradigm...|$|R

The alkali metal is boiled in an oven {{that is designed to}} direct a beam of alkaline metal vapour onto the <b>hot</b> <b>plate.</b> A high value of the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> work function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the alkaline metal to overcome, thus making the ionisation process more efficient. Sometimes barium is used instead of an alkaline metal due to its excellent spectroscopic properties. The fractional ionization of a Q-machine plasma can approach unity, which can be orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by the Saha ionization equation. The Q-machine's nonequilibrium plasmais a primary example of epicatalysis.|$|R
