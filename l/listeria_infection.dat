40|$|Abstract: Foodborne {{listeriosis}} is a {{rare and}} very dangerous disease which is caused by Listeria monocytogenes. This bacterium {{is found in the}} nature in very high population, but can cause disease only in certain groups of people. Listeriosis usually happens after consumption of unpasteurized dairy products especially soft and unripe cheeses and ready to eat meat products like hot dog by susceptible people. In general, pregnant women, infants, elderly people and immuno deficient patients are susceptible to this disease. Listeria monocytogenes is able to produce septicemia, meningitis and abortion in human. The important characteristic of this bacterium is its ability to live inside the cells of immune system and by this way, it is able to distribute through body easily. In order to prevent listeriosis, susceptible people should avoid eating unpasteurized dairy products and ready to eat meats.
