25|$|Proposition 13 disproportionately affects coastal {{metropolitan}} areas, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, where {{housing prices}} are higher, relative to inland communities with <b>lower</b> <b>housing</b> prices. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, more research would show whether benefits of Proposition 13 outweigh the redistribution of tax base and overall cost in lost tax revenue.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, Netanyahu's {{government}} {{approved a}} two-year budget that would see agricultural reforms and lowering of import duties to reduce food prices, {{deregulation of the}} approval process in construction to <b>lower</b> <b>housing</b> costs and speed up infrastructure building, and reforms in the financial sector to boost competition and lower fees for financial services. In the end, the government was forced to compromise by removing some key agricultural reforms.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the South has {{had lower}} {{percentages}} {{of high school}} graduates, <b>lower</b> <b>housing</b> values, lower household incomes, and lower cost of living {{than the rest of}} the United States. These factors, combined with the fact that Southerners have continued to maintain strong loyalty to family ties, has led some sociologists to label white Southerners an ethnic or quasi-ethnic group, though this interpretation has been subject to criticism on the grounds that proponents of the view do not satisfactorily indicate how Southerners meet the criteria of ethnicity.|$|E
5000|$|In 40 of the 49 {{bicameral}} state legislatures, the <b>lower</b> <b>house</b> {{is called}} the [...] "House of Representatives".

2500|$|The Governor {{also had}} some measure {{of control over the}} <b>Lower</b> <b>House</b> in the late seventeenth century.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, West New York, Weehawken, Union City and North Bergen {{came to be}} dubbed collectively as [...] "NoHu", a North Hudson haven for local {{performing}} and fine artists, {{many of whom are}} immigrants from Latin America and other countries, in part due to <b>lower</b> <b>housing</b> costs compared to those in nearby art havens such as Hoboken, Jersey City and Manhattan.|$|E
2500|$|Although traffic between Denmark and Sweden {{increased}} by 61 {{percent in the}} first year after the bridge opened, traffic levels were not as high as expected, perhaps due to high tolls. However, since 2005, traffic levels have increased rapidly. [...] This may be due to Danes buying homes in Sweden to take advantage of <b>lower</b> <b>housing</b> prices in Malmö and commuting to work in Denmark. In 2012, to cross by car cost DKK 310, SEK 375 or €43, with discounts of up to 75% available to regular users. In 2007, almost 25million people travelled over the Øresund Bridge: 15.2million by car and bus and 9.6million by train. By 2009, the figure had risen to 35.6million by car, coach or train.|$|E

The Union City area is a major training ground for actors in the county. In September 2008, Union City held its first annual month-long Art Month, which originated with the September 2006 [...] "Celebrate Art" [...] show at St. John's Episcopal Church. Art Month includes events such as the Union City Arts and Crafts Festival, held the second week of every September. Group shows are also arranged by organizations such as La Ola, a group formed to help unite local artists, and Federación Mercantil, which provides support to artists in the form of bank loan assistance and help avoiding foreclosure, and puts on an annual show of work by Spanish-American painters. Another is the Union City Artists Collective, founded in 2007 by a group of artists and public officials that includes painter/sculptor Amado Mora, who was named Union City's first Art Curator, responsible for the Union City Art Gallery at City Hall. Locations in which artists reside or have put on tours or shows include the Yardley Building, a former Yardley of London soap factory on Palisade Avenue that overlooks Hoboken, and the old R.H. Simon Silk Mill on 39th Street, which has been dubbed the [...] "Union Hill Arts Building". The Park Performing Arts Center is also a popular arts venue in the city, as it houses Hudson Theatre Works, a theatre company founded in 2011. It was also the first venue for the Park Players, an acting troupe founded in the early 1980s by local teacher Joseph Conklin, and formerly hosted the NoHu Visions show, and the annual two-day Multi-Arts Festival until 2010, when the latter moved to Union City High School, which houses the Union City Performing Arts Center.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> {{each have}} four floors, but are much {{narrower}} with each level having only four rooms. Each level {{also has its}} own kitchen, but these are much smaller than in the Upper <b>Houses.</b> The <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> do have far larger and better fitted common rooms {{that are similar to}} the ones the Upper Houses had before the renovations. The rooms in the <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> are also considered more luxurious with hardwood floors and large sizes. Rooms in the <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> are more expensive, however. Until 2003 the <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> were restricted to upper year students but with the double cohort of graduates from Ontario schools many of the rooms were transformed into doubles and now hold first years.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Lower</b> <b>House</b> was {{the domain}} of Mister Monday.

50|$|At introduction, SMAG {{was less}} than the minimum wage, in {{consideration}} of factors specific {{to the existence of}} rural life of the time (<b>lower</b> <b>housing</b> costs, direct access to food, etc.).

2500|$|In 1689, the {{transfer}} of Maryland from a proprietary colony to a royal colony temporarily quieted the disputes between the <b>Lower</b> <b>House</b> and the Governor and Council.

The first General Assembly under Royal Authority, in 1692, passed 85 acts in a single session. The <b>Lower</b> <b>House</b> immediately acted to remove the Governor's influence over the election of delegates. Now, elected delegates could attend the session {{without the need for}} a special writ from the Governor. At the same time, standing or continuing committees were established. These eliminated the <b>Lower</b> <b>House's</b> reliance on ad hoc committees and created the first modern legislature in Maryland.

50|$|A parliament's <b>lower</b> <b>house</b> {{is usually}} {{composed}} {{of at least}} 100 members, in countries with populations of over 3 million.
