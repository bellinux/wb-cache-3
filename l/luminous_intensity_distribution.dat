The simultaneous use of these two detectors may engender incorrect measurement results, due to their difference in dynamic range. In this paper, near-field and far-field based <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> measurements of two luminaires are presented, in order to exemplify the problem. Results demonstrate that the distributions obtained from near-field measurements may deviate from the correct intensity distribution, by an amount of up to 16 % of the total luminous flux of the luminaire.

40|$|Most {{lighting}} manufacturers {{represent the}} angular {{distribution of the}} flux of their light sources by a far-field representation, also known as <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> (LID.) For spatially extended sources however, the inverse square law is only valid beyond the limiting photometric distance. By consequence, this distribution {{does not allow for}} accurate illuminances to be determined in the near-field region of the source. This problem is even more pronounced for arrays of LEDs with focusing optics creating narrow beams. We gathered a ray-file of several LED arrays using a near-field luminance goniophotometer. This paper reports on measurements and simulations using ray-tracing. It shows that a far-field representation cannot be used to calculate illuminance values in the near-field. In contrast, a near-field representation allows the calculation of accurate illuminance values at any target point, irrespective of the distance to the source and its <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

These devices need to produce sufficient <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> to be visible without creating glare to drivers. Published standards for the photometric performance of warning beacons do not address their performance in conditions of reduced visibility such as fog.

Simulations of visibility of hazards under varying conditions of fog density, forward vehicle lighting, warning beacon <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity,</b> and <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> were performed to assess their impacts on visual performance by drivers. Each of these factors can influence the ability of drivers to detect and identify workers and hazards along the roadway in work zones.

40|$|In {{lighting}} {{calculations and}} simulations, the emission {{of a light}} source is conventionally modelled using the far-field intensity, also termed <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> (LID). Previous {{studies have indicated that}} the traditional limiting photometric distance, to reach far field conditions, is not always easy to determine. The “limiting photometric distance”, also called the “photometric limiting distance” of a light source is the “shortest distance between the reference plane of a light source and the effective reference plane of a photometer, for a given acceptable error considering the photometric inverse square law” (ISO/CIE 19476 : 2014, 2014). This distance is dependent {{on the size of the}} light source, the <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> (beam angle), the spatial luminance distribution and the predetermined acceptable measurement error. In this paper the problems are analysed in detail for a disk-shaped light source, a linear light strip and a “worst case scenario” using two small (point) sources separated by a certain distance. The limiting photometric distance is investigated using different measures of error - not only for the main illumination direction but also at different angles of emission. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of a}} ray file {{to model}} the optical {{characteristics}} of a light source is a well-known and popular method to achieve accurate results when simulating <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distributions</b> of luminaires, especially if the source is interacting with optical components at a close distance. However, lighting industry {{becomes more and more}} interested in the spatial luminance distribution of the luminaire itself. Luminance maps offer a tool to predict the degree of discomfort glare early in the design process, especially when developing fixtures using small and intense LED light sources. The generation of luminance maps is commonly based on the reverse ray tracing technique, requiring one or more surfaces to be defined as light sources. However, ray files can not be considered as surface sources, but as a collection of ray data that model the near field of a light source. Despite the fact that ray files are constructed from experimental data they do not explicitly contain the geometry of the light source. This excludes the use of reverse ray tracing. For this reason the implementation of brute force forward ray tracing to obtain luminance maps was investigated. To be able to compare the results of both techniques an inhomogeneous surface source was defined. Luminance maps were then generated using both the brute force ray tracing approach and the conventional reverse ray tracing approach. A good agreement was obtained. A reduction in simulation time was achieved by parallel ray tracing computation and digital enhancement techniques. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A new roadway {{lighting}} {{demonstration project}} was initiated in late 2010, which was planned {{in conjunction with}} other upgrades to NE Cully Boulevard, a residential collector road in the northeast area of Portland, OR. With the NE Cully Boulevard project, the Portland Bureau of Transportation hoped to demonstrate different light source technologies and different luminaires side-by-side. This report documents the initial performance of six different newly installed luminaires, including three LED products, one induction product, one ceramic metal halide product, and one high-pressure sodium (HPS) product that represented the baseline solution. It includes reported, calculated, and measured performance; evaluates the economic feasibility of each of the alternative luminaires; and documents user feedback collected from a group of local Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) members that toured the site. This report does not contain any long-term performance evaluations or laboratory measurements of luminaire performance. Although not all of the installed products performed equally, the alternative luminaires generally offered higher efficacy, more appropriate <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distributions,</b> and favorable color quality when compared to the baseline HPS luminaire. However, some products did not provide sufficient illumination to all areas—vehicular drive lanes, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks—or would likely fail to meet design criteria {{over the life of the}} installation due to expected depreciation in lumen output. While the overall performance of the alternative luminaires was generally better than the baseline HPS luminaire, cost remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Based on the cost of the small quantity of luminaires purchased for this demonstration, the shortest calculated payback period for one of the alternative luminaire types was 17. 3 years. The luminaire prices were notably higher than typical prices for currently available luminaires purchased in larger quantities. At prices that are more typical, the payback would be less than 10 years. In addition to the demonstration luminaires, a networked control system was installed for additional evaluation and demonstration purposes. The capability of control system to measure luminaire input power was explored in this study.
