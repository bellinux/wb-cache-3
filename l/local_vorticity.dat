We find that an out-of-plane magnetized tip already results in distinguished SP-STM contrasts for the different skyrmionic structures corresponding to their symmetries. Our work also establishes an understanding of the relationship between in-plane SP-STM contrasts and skyrmionic topologies through an investigation of the variation of the in-plane angle between the spins along the perimeter of the structures, which can be characterized by the <b>local</b> <b>vorticity</b> or linear density of the winding number. For spin structures exhibiting a uniform sign of the <b>local</b> <b>vorticity</b> throughout the whole skyrmionic area, we demonstrate that (i) $|Q|$ can be determined from a single SP-STM image taken by any in-plane magnetized tip, and (ii) an in-plane tip magnetization rotation provides the sign of $Q$ independently of the sign of the effective spin polarization in the tunnel junction. We also discuss cases where the <b>local</b> <b>vorticity</b> is changing sign.

The airfoil, pivoting at {{one-third of the}} chord, oscillates periodically near the static {{stalling angle of attack}} (AOA) at high reduced-frequency. The phase-triggering and modified phase-averaged techniques are employed to reconstruct the pseudo instantaneous velocity field over the airfoil. During the down stroke cycle, the leading-edge separation vortex is growing and the vortex near the trailing edge begins to shed into the wake. During the upstroke cycle, the leading-edge separation vortex is matured and moves downstream, and the counter clockwise vortex is forming near the trailing edge. Convection speeds and wavelength of the unsteady vortex structure over the airfoil equal to that of the counter clockwise vortex shed into the wake. This kind of vortex structure is termed as "synchronized shedding" type. The wavelength of unsteady vortex structure over the airfoil is significantly different from that at low reduced-frequency. Consistent convection speeds of the leading-edge separation vortex are acquired from the spatial-temporal variations of local circulation and <b>local</b> surface <b>vorticity</b> generation, and equals that predicted from flow visualization. Spatial-temporal variations of the <b>local</b> surface <b>vorticity</b> generation clearly reveal the formation and passage of the leading-edge separation vortex only in the region where the flow does not separate completely from the surface. Significant amounts of the surface vorticity are generated within the leading-edge region of the airfoil during the upstroke cycle. Only negligible amount of surface vorticity is produced within the region of complete flow separation. During the down stroke cycle, the surface vorticity generation is mild along the airfoil surface, except the leading-edge region where a small scale leading-edge separation vortex is forming and growing.

Corrections of PV were guided by METEOSAT- 7 water vapour observations and restricted to the upper troposphere, mainly altering the topography of the dynamical tropopause.

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{accumulated}} evidence in favour of Miles’s mathematical theory of wave generation by wind, the author has thought it desirable to translate the theory into {{the form of a}} physical argument, which goes as follows. Travelling water waves in a wind produce, to a first approximation, airflow undulations with pressures least over crests and greatest over troughs. Hence, just above the ‘critical height ’ where the airflow component in the direction of propagation equals the wave velocity, air after slowly overtaking a crest is turned back by the higher pressure near the trough, moves down to a lower level and back towards the crest. Similarly, behind crests, an upward movement at the critical height occurs. Quantitatively, the vertical velocity v is such that the ‘vortex force’-pwv (where p is density and w vorticity) balances the sinusoidal pressure gradient. Furthermore, since in turbulent boundary layers vorticity decreases with height, any downflow produces a <b>local</b> <b>vorticity</b> defect, and upflow a <b>local</b> <b>vorticity</b> excess, and hence the vortex force varies about a negative mean a t the critical height (although at other levels, where air moves sinusoidally, with vertical displacement and velocity 90 ” out of phase, the mean vortex force is zero). The negative total mean force extracts wind energy, and transfers it to the wave, enabling it to grow exponentially. For pressure gradients adequate to initiate substantial energy transfer, the critical height must be fairly small compared with the wavelength, and waves can grow whenever their velocity and direction satisfies this condition, a conclusion supported by measurements (Longuet-Higgins 1962) of the directional spectrum of wind-generated waves. 1...|$|E

With increasing energy and the reach of QGP the low viscosity of the plasma became apparent and this brought a new revolution in the fluid dynamical studies. The high energy and low viscosity made it possible to observe fluctuations up to high multipolarity flow harmonics. This is an obvious, direct proof of the low viscosity of QGP. Many aspects of these fluctuations are under intensive study today. The low viscosity opened ways to observe special fluid dynamical turbulent phenomena.

We consider different types of circular barotropic vortices in a linearly stratified shallow layer confined with rigid lids. For the simplest case of the Rankine vortex we develop an asymptotic analytic dispersion relation and a marginal stability criterion, which compares well with numerical results. This is a further generalization to the well-known generalized Rayleigh criterion, which is only valid for non-dissipative and non-stratified eddies. Unlike the Rayleigh criterion, it predicts that intense anticyclones may be stable even with a core region of negative absolute vorticity, and that the dissipation and stratification work together to stabilize the flow. Numerical analysis reveals that the stability diagrams for various types of vortices are almost identical in the Rossby, Burger and Ekman parameter space. This allows extension of our analytical solutions for the Rankine vortex {{to a wide variety}} of vortices.
