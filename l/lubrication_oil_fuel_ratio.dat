This work was done with procedure similar with {{the first part of the}} work. Convertion of waste <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> into <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> was done using hydrocracking process with catalyst of combination of chromium and activated natural zeolith (Cr/ZAA). Controlled variables used for this researh were the type of waste <b>oil</b> (<b>lubrication</b> <b>oil),</b> feed volume (40 ml), temperature (500 °C), and hydrogen gas rate (20 ml/sec). The weight ratio of the catalyst and waste oil feed was varied at 1 / 8, 1 / 4, 1 / 3, 1 / 2, and 2 / 3. The parameters used to analyse the results were the amount of hydrocracking product, percentage of cracking fraction (gasoline, kerosene and solar) in the product and the heating value of the product. Analytic works were carried out with GC for cracking fraction and bomb calorimeter for heating value of the produced <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b> Results showed that the amount of hydrocracking product decreases with the increase of catalyst ratio. Increasing catalyst ratio increases gasoline fraction lineary, decreases kerosene and solar fractions. The heating value of the product lineary increases with catalyst ratio. Best catalyst ratio for this work was 1 / 8 to get maximum amount of product (13. 16 ml for 40 ml feed), and 2 / 3 to get maximum gasoline fraction (56. 70 %), and highest heating value (44. 92 kJ/gr) ...|$|R

40|$|PM in {{diesel exhaust}} {{has been given}} much {{attention}} due to its adverse effect on both climate and health. As the PM emission levels are tightened, the portion of particles originating from the <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> is likely to increase. In this study, exhausts from a biodiesel-fueled Euro 5 engine were examined {{to determine how much}} of the carbonaceous particles that originated from the <b>fuel</b> and the <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively. A combination of three methods was used to determine the PM origin: chain length analysis of the hydrocarbons, determination of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), and the concentration of 14 C found in the exhausts. It was found that the standard method for measuring hydrocarbons in PM on a filter (chain length analysis) only accounted for 63 % of the OC, meaning that it did not account for all non-soot carbon in the exhausts. Comparing the chain length method to the 14 C-based method showed that the non-extractable organic carbon originated both from the <b>oil</b> and <b>fuel.</b> Elemental carbon (EC), also known as soot, was found to originate mainly from the fuel. However, excessive amounts of oil in the engine cylinders increased the relative contribution from the oil as well as the absolute emissions of EC.
