40|$|The {{present report}} summarises the catch details {{of some of}} the commercially {{important}} fishes landed by the trawlers operating from Rameswaram during the years 1980 and 1981. The silverbellies, formed the major group, indicating the availability of silverbellies in large quantities throughout the year, followed by Elasmobranchs and Penaeid prawns in the landings. Quarterrwise landings <b>of</b> <b>trawlnets</b> and monthwise landings of prawns and other groups were portrayed...|$|R
40|$|The bag <b>of</b> a <b>trawlnet</b> is {{considered}} as an elliptical cone, its wings as merely forward extensions of this cone. The {{dimensions of the}} cone are derived from the measured wingend spread and the headline height (gape) of the net and from its specification drawings. From these operational and constructional dimensions the mean angle of attack of the netting panels and the mean setting angle of the meshes are derived. All operational dimensions change with towing speed. Formulae are then given which with further inputs of twine diameter bar length and developed area of each netting panel allow {{an estimate of the}} drag area of the netting cone. The codend {{in the form of a}} tube, the net appendages and the ground friction are eachconsidered separately. Thus a total drag area is derived; multiplication by the hydrodynamic pressure and addition of the friction give the total geometrically derived drag <b>of</b> the <b>trawlnet.</b> This is compared with the measured drag over a range of speeds for 3 very different bottom drawls and two substantially different midwater trawls. Examples of the comparisons are presented. The method provides a means of predicting change <b>of</b> <b>trawlnet</b> drag with change of shape...|$|R
50|$|Au bord d'une source (Beside a Spring) is a virtuoso piano showpiece by Franz Liszt; {{it is the}} 4th <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{the first}} suite of Années de Pèlerinage (Years of Pilgrimage).There are three {{separate}} versions of Au bord d'une source. The first version appears in Liszt's set Album d'une voyageur (1834-1838), and the second in the first suite of Liszt's Années de pèlerinage (1836-1855). The last version is almost identical to the second, except for the final nine bars, which were added by Liszt as a coda for his Italian piano student Giovanni Sgambati, {{who was also a}} composer; this <b>lengthened</b> the <b>piece</b> by about 30 seconds. The coda was written in 1863.|$|R
