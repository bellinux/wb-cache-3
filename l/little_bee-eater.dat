50|$|This is an {{abundant}} and tame bird, familiar throughout its range. There have been {{estimated to be}} between 60-80 million <b>little</b> <b>bee-eaters.</b> It breeds in open country with bushes, preferably near water. Just as the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which {{are caught in the}} air by sorties from an open perch. This species often hunts from low perches, maybe only a metre or less high. Before eating its meal, a bee-eater removes the sting by repeatedly hitting the insect on a hard surface.|$|R

50|$|The sexes {{are alike}} in the cinnamon-chested bee-eater. It has the head, upper parts and tail bright green, the chin and throat are yellow and {{outlined}} in black, {{with a white}} extension to the side, while the breast is cinnamon-brown, darkening towards the belly. When perched, the stance is upright with the tail pointing downward. The tail is blackish with an orange base and white tip when seen from the front, while from the back it is mainly green, with black edges visible when it is flared. This bird can be distinguished from the somewhat similar <b>little</b> <b>bee-eater</b> by its larger size, darker colouring, white cheek patches and the upland habitat where it is found.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shape of}} eggs varies {{considerably}} across bird species, ranging from near-spherical (such {{as those of}} the <b>little</b> <b>bee-eater)</b> to highly [...] or conical (such {{as those of the}} common murre) with the familiar shape of the chicken egg lying in between. Early scientific investigators of egg shape [...] suggested that the oval shape of eggs was caused by the egg being forced through the oviduct by peristalsis. In this often-repeated [...] but incorrect theory of egg shape formation, the contraction and relaxation of the muscles which push the egg down the oviduct cause the spherical egg membrane to distort slightly into an ovoid shape, with the blunt end caudal (i.e. furthest down the oviduct and closest to the cloaca). The calcification of the egg in the shell gland/uterus then fixes it in this shape, and the egg is laid with the blunt end appearing first (for a diagram showing the different sections of the bird oviduct, see here). However, this theory has been refuted by studies of egg shell formation in a number of bird species using techniques such as X-ray photography [...] which have demonstrated that egg shape is determined in the oviduct isthmus (before shell calcification) with the pointed end caudal (furthest down the oviduct). These observations cannot be explained by peristalsis. It has been proposed [...] that the egg acquires its shape (with the pointed egg caudal) as it is forced through the narrow isthmus, but this assertion has not been thoroughly verified.|$|E

50|$|It {{lies on the}} {{passageway}} of many migratory birds such as harriers. These birds pass through this area during September. Birds commonly seen in the sanctuary are harriers, eastern imperial eagle, tawny eagle, short-toed eagle, sparrow, and <b>little</b> green <b>bee-eaters,</b> black ibis and demoiselle cranes, which stay till March. Skylarks, crested larks, ring doves, and brown doves are seen throughout the year.Desert fox and desert cat can also be spotted along with typical avifauna such as partridge and sand grouse.|$|R
50|$|The green {{bee-eater}} (Merops orientalis) (sometimes <b>little</b> green <b>bee-eater)</b> is a near passerine {{bird in the}} bee-eater family. It is resident but prone to seasonal movements and is found widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal and the Gambia to Ethiopia, the Nile valley, western Arabia and Asia through India to Vietnam. They are mainly insect eaters and they are found in grassland, thin scrub and forest often quite far from water. Several regional plumage variations are known and several subspecies have been named.|$|R

25|$|A {{study on}} the <b>little</b> green <b>bee-eater</b> {{suggests}} that these birds {{may be able to}} see {{from the point of view}} of a predator. The brown-necked raven has been observed hunting lizards in complex cooperation with other ravens, demonstrating an apparent understanding of prey behavior. The California scrub jay hides caches of food and will later re-hide food if it was watched by another bird the first time, but only if the bird hiding the food has itself stolen food before from a cache. Such an ability to see from the point of view of another individual had previously been attributed only to the great apes and sometimes elephants. Such abilities form the basis for empathy.|$|R
40|$|I {{report on}} the social and {{breeding}} biology of four bee-eater species in Thailand. <b>Little</b> Green <b>Bee-eaters</b> (Merops orientalis) breed cooperatively in clusters of overlapping territories. Cooperative breeding units have one to two helpers that join the breeding pair only after incubation has begun. Nests rarely are left unguarded due to threats of predation and possible intraspecific brood parasitism. Males also guard their mates against extrapair copulations. The Blue-tailed Bee-eater (M Philippinus) breeds cooperatively and has a complex social system, with evidence suggestive of intraspecific brood parasitism and extrapair copulation. I provide evidence that the Bay-headed Bee-eater (M Leschenaulti) breeds cooperatively and report observations of noncooperative breeding at one nest in the Blue-bearded Bee-eater (Nyctyornis athertoni) ...|$|R
5|$|Many {{other species}} and {{subspecies}} {{have been removed}} over the years: Cetti's warbler (in 1976); long-tailed skua (in 1979); common crane and ring-billed gull (in 1987); surf scoter, <b>little</b> egret, European <b>bee-eater,</b> Pallas's warbler and woodchat shrike (in 1990); green-winged teal (in 1992); ring-necked duck, greater short-toed lark and little bunting (in 1993); white-tailed eagle and Kumlien's gull (in 1998); American wigeon, black-crowned night heron and rose-coloured starling (in 2001); and black brant (in 2005).|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{breeding}} (CB) {{is found}} in a wide diversity of avian lineages and can be explained at several levels of analysis. After a brief introduction to the theory explaining CB, I take an historical approach to examine CB evolution in the bee-eaters (Family Meropidae). Parsimony analyses of plumage color and shape characters yielded a number of phylogenetic hypotheses. The best supported phylogenies are six fully resolved trees from three analyses and a strict consensus tree from another analysis. These trees are {{used to examine the}} possible patterns of evolution in CB and how transition correspond to transitions in other ecological and behavioral traits. Bee-eaters were also studied in Thailand. <b>Little</b> green <b>bee-eaters,</b> Merops orientalis, breed cooperatively and predation pressure may be high in this species. Blue-tailed bee-eaters, M. philippinus, breed cooperatively in dense colonies and show signs of potential extra-pair copulation and intraspecific brood parasitism. Observations of the bay-headed bee-eater, M. leschenaulti, and the blue-bearded bee-eater, Nyctyornis athertoni, document CB in the former and support non-CB designation for the latter. Cooperative breeding is either primitive in bee-eaters or evolved early in the family. Reversals to non-CB occurred in one to three lineages. Transitions in breeding systems are not generally correlated with the transitions in nesting requirements, habitat utilization, migratory behavior, or diet. Evidence suggests correlated evolution between CB and both foraging mode (weak evidence) and social systems (stronger support). This study does not support any single hypothesis for the adaptive basis of CB across the family. Social system evolutionary patterns do suggest the importance of kin selection in several lineages. Lack of change in breeding systems, given diverse ecological and behavioral circumstances, means either cooperative breeding is malleable (selectively advantageous in a variety of ecological conditions) or represents phylogenetic inertia. A final analysis demonstrates that phylogenetic confidence indices fail to express the degree to which characters in a matrix are non-conflicting and congruent (for a given level of noise) and show only limited abilities to distinguish among probabilities of analyses making type II errors...|$|R
50|$|Like {{other species}} in the genus, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat insects, especially bees, wasps and ants, which {{are caught in the}} air by sorties from an open perch. Before swallowing prey, a bee-eater removes stings and breaks the exoskeleton of the prey by repeatedly thrashing it on the perch. Migration is not known but they make seasonal movements in response to rainfall. These birds are somewhat sluggish in the mornings and may be found huddled next to each other on wires sometimes with their bills tucked in their backs well after sunrise. They sand-bathe more frequently than other bee-eater species and will sometimes bathe in water by dipping into water in flight. They are usually seen in small groups and often roost communally in large numbers (200-300). The birds move excitedly at the roost site and call loudly, often explosively dispersing before settling back to the roost tree.The <b>little</b> green <b>bee-eater</b> is also becoming common in urban and sub-urban neighborhoods, and has been observed perching on television antennae, only to launch into a brief, zig-zag flight formation to catch an insect, then return to the same perch and consume the meal. This behaviour is generally observed between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00am, and after 4:00pm.The breeding season is from March to June. Unlike many bee-eaters, these are often solitary nesters, making a tunnel in a sandy bank. The breeding pairs are often joined by helpers. They nest in hollows in vertical mud banks. The nest tunnel that they construct can run as much as 5 feet long and the 3-5 eggs are laid on the bare ground in the cavity {{at the end of the}} tunnel. The eggs are very spherical and glossy white. Clutch size varies with rainfall and insect food density. Both sexes incubate. The eggs hatch asynchronously with an incubation period of about 14 days and the chicks grow fledge in 3 to 4 weeks and in the fledging stage show a reduction in body weight.|$|R
