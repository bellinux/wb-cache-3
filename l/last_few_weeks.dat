5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.|$|E
5|$|According to Maple's account, in the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of Pickingill's life, when he {{had become}} very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and in the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near {{the end of his life}} Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E

5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was still unable to make an impression {{on the walls of}} Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French for the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war until news arrived of the ceasefire that accompanied the provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, volunteers from the Maltese Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars. The Maltese detachment returned to Malta in April 1802.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{performances}} in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season, but the batting-friendly pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first Championship title. Consistency was also key for Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by {{one point in the}} NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season with Lewes, Wormull was used {{in a number of}} {{different}} positions, but in 2007–08, he usually played in central midfield, and felt that the continuity helped his performance. He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup, and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round, to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running. Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title, though an injured ankle meant he missed the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He {{developed}} dementia, {{and became}} completely blind and increasingly deaf. He {{was incapable of}} knowing or understanding either that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life was unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38pm on 29 January 1820, six days {{after the death of}} his fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him. George III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|Dickov debuted for Blackburn Rovers as a half-time {{substitute}} against West Bromwich Albion on 14 August 2004. He scored {{his first}} {{goal for the}} club in the following match, a 3–2 defeat to Southampton. Dickov {{was involved in the}} majority of matches in the 2004–05 season, until a knee injury caused him to miss the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season. He finished the season with ten league goals. In 2005–06, Dickov found it hard to retain a regular place in the side, with manager Mark Hughes having signed forwards Craig Bellamy and Shefki Kuqi during the summer. A red card against West Ham United caused him to miss most of the first month of the season. He had a run of first team games in the autumn but starting appearances became fewer as the season progressed. He left the club in the summer of 2006 following the expiry of his contract.|$|E
5|$|In June 1918, Whittle {{was posted}} to the 2nd Army Central School for a five-week stint. Returning to the 12th Battalion in mid-July, Whittle {{was wounded in}} action for the third time; {{suffering}} shrapnel wounds to his right elbow, he {{was admitted to the}} 3rd Australian Field Ambulance on 25 July. Evacuated to England, he was admitted to the Central Military Hospital, Eastbourne, before transferring to the 3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital, Dartford, two weeks later. During this time, Billy Hughes, as Prime Minister of Australia, invited several of Australia's Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive; Whittle was among a group of ten who accepted the offer. The party embarked aboard HMAT Medic on 24 August, bound for Melbourne. Arriving seven weeks later, Whittle returned to Tasmania and assisted with recruiting on the island during the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war. Following the Armistice, he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 15 December 1918.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 Serong {{served as}} General Staff Officer 2 with the {{combined}} 6th and 7th Divisions on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, {{where they were}} resting and retraining prior to conducting further operations. In early 1944 he instructed on the staff course at Cabarlah. That August, he moved to Aitape {{to prepare for the}} deployment of the 6th Division. He was later attached to American forces for the landing on Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies in mid-September 1944. In the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war, Serong was mentioned in despatches for his actions fighting the Japanese at Wewak, whilst serving with the infantry in the 35th Battalion. During an incident on 21 July 1945, he commanded a force of three platoons and native police on a patrol to destroy a Japanese ammunition dump. Although serving more time in training roles than in combat, during the war Serong had made important contacts with whom he would later work in future postings, including Colonel Reg Pollard, who went on to become Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and Colonel Charles Spry, later the Director of Military Intelligence and the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).|$|E
5|$|Redknapp's time at West Ham was {{notable for}} the {{turnover}} of players {{during his tenure}} and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16 million, despite the £18 million sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United. Some were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright. Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu; Davor Šuker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; Christian Bassila, who cost £720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football; Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to £4.4 million but made only three starts for the club; Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre; and Marco Boogers, a player often quoted {{as one of the}} biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the season's end.|$|E
