5|$|The state legislature, {{with the}} governor's support, cut {{spending}} by $1.6billion, including $700million in reductions in state aid to cities and towns. The cuts {{also included a}} $140million reduction in state funding for higher education, which led state-run colleges and universities to increase fees by 63percent over four years. Romney sought additional cuts in his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> governor by vetoing nearly 250items in the state budget; a heavily Democratic legislature overrode all the vetoes.|$|E
5|$|All in all, Auerbach coached nine {{championship}} teams {{directly and}} mentored 4 players—Russell, Sharman, Heinsohn and K.C. Jones—who {{would go on}} to win an additional 7 NBA championships as coaches (two each for Russell, Heinsohn and Jones, all with the Celtics, and one for Sharman with the Lakers). Ten players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, Sam Jones and Bailey Howell. Although Don Nelson played for Auerbach only during his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> coach, his influence was profound: Nelson would later join Auerbach as one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Sharman and Heinsohn would become two of only four people to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. Few, if any, coaches can match Auerbach's record of wins and successful mentorship of his players.|$|E

25|$|There {{are areas}} {{of his life}} and daily routine that Keats does not describe. He {{mentions}} little about his childhood or his financial straits and is seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is a total absence of any reference to his parents. In his <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>as</b> his health deteriorated, his concerns often gave way to despair and morbid obsessions. The publications of letters to Fanny Brawne in 1870 focused on this period and emphasised this tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.|$|E

Widely expected to take over as starting QB, he struggled on the field and ultimately never got that position. The Seahawks held onto McGwire until 1995, then traded him to the Dolphins.|$|E
