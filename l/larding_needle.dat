6000|$|But my dear {{to relate}} to you in detail {{the way in which}} they multiplied {{fourteen}} sticks of firewood by two bits of ginger and a <b>larding</b> <b>needle,</b> or divided pretty well everything else there was on the table by the heater of the Italian iron and a chamber candlestick, and got a lemon over, would make my head spin round and round and round as it did at the time. So I says [...] "if you'll excuse my addressing the chair Professor Jackman I think the period of the lecture has now arrived when it becomes necessary that I should take a good hug of this young scholar." [...] Upon which Jemmy calls out from his station on the chair, [...] "Gran oo open oor arms and me'll make a 'pring into 'em." [...] So I opened my arms to him as I had opened my sorrowful heart when his poor young mother lay a dying, and he had his jump and we had a good long hug together and the Major prouder than any peacock says to me behind his hand, [...] "You need not let him know it Madam" [...] (which I certainly need not for the Major was quite audible) [...] "but he is a boy!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The needle used is a <b>larding</b> <b>needle</b> (also [...] "barding needle" [...] or lardoir). There are {{two basic}} kinds of <b>larding</b> <b>needle,</b> hollow and U-shaped. Hollow larding needles are about 5 mm in {{diameter}} {{with some sort of}} teeth or hook to keep the lard strip attached; they are passed completely through the meat. U-shaped larding needles, often called by the French name lardoir, are long needles with a [...] "U" [...] cross-section. Four larding needles, accompanied by two crossed turning spits, are found in the coat of arms of the Confrérie de la Chaîne des Rôtisseurs, a French gastronomic society.|$|E

In {{addition to the}} fat being blended with the traditional Rinderbraten spice, typically the same spices would {{be used in the}} brining solution and run through the meat using specially prepared <b>larding</b> <b>needles,</b> leading to a much more heavily spiced preparation than the German version. Because of this, most Nashville families omitted the sprinkling of cinnamon over the cooked meat.|$|R

Cut your pork into long thin strips and, with a <b>needle,</b> <b>lard</b> each tenderloin. Melt the butter in the water, add the seasoning and the cracker crumbs, combining all thoroughly. Now fill each pocket in the tenderloin with this stuffing. Place the tenderloins--'" ...|$|R
