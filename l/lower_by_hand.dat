This construction keeps the posts stable without needing bracing. The roof is typically thatched and lightly framed to limit the weight. The posts often have holes to place pins at various levels as the height of hay pile changes. The roof is raised and <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> More modern versions may have cables on winches on each post so the roof is easier to move.|$|R
500|$|Water is {{diverted}} {{from the river}} by Warleigh Weir, about [...] upstream.

50|$|To {{back its}} {{image as a}} {{technically}} advanced car for the 1980s, the Mark VII was equipped with {{a long list of}} standard equipment. A fully digital dashboard featured an onboard trip computer and message center; automatic climate control was also standard. Other standard features included four-wheel air suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, power seats, an AM/FM stereo, and power windows, locks, and mirrors. All Mark VIIs featured a power deck-lid release (through an interior mounted button) and electric pull-down, in which the trunk lid was partially <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> and then automatically pulled down about an inch by a motor mounted inside the trunk latch. All models were now installed with Ford's Keyless Entry System, and an automatic dimming high-beam module. This worked via a sensor located adjacent to the rear-view mirror, and sensitivity could be adjusted by a dial located on the dashboard.|$|R

25|$|The {{lifeboats}} {{were intended}} to be launched from davits supplied by the Welin Davit & Engineering Company of London. All lifeboats but the collapsibles were slung from the davits, ready to be launched. The davits were of a highly efficient double-acting quadrant design, capable of being slung inboard (hanging over the deck) as well as outboard (hanging over the side) to pick up additional lifeboats. The davits aboard Titanic were capable of accommodating 64 lifeboats, though only 16 were actually fitted to them. The collapsibles were also intended to be launched via the davits. Each davit was doubled up, supporting the forward arm of one boat and the after arm of the next one along. A bitt and sheave was located at the keel of each davit to facilitate the lowering of boats, and the falls could be taken across the deck so {{that a number of}} men could work simultaneously on each boat and davit. They had to be <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> ideally <b>by</b> a team of between eight and ten men. Despite Titanic having a number of electric winches, they could only have been used to winch the lifeboats back out of the water.|$|R
40|$|Samples were {{collected}} from Carmarthen Bay (South-west Wales), using a Van Veen sediment grab, <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> from the ship Ocean Defender, which is owned and run by the charity Earthkind. The survey was conducted from 17 - 24 May 1997. Petroleum hydrocarbons were extracted by Soxhlet extraction, separated by column chromatography and then analysed for biomarkers by GC-MS and GC-MS-SIM. Among {{the various types of}} biomarkers, the steranes and triterpanes were considered to be the best choice. Biomarkers (triterpanes and steranes) are present in rather low concentrations, but because of their complex structures they have a high "information" content. m/z 191, 217 and 218 ions have been used for identification purposes. 17 α(H), 18 α(H), 21 β(H) - 28, 30 -bisnorhopane is found in the majority of North Sea crude oils and therefore acts as a good indicator for Sea Empress crude oil (SECO). Sample 92 (Linney Head) has ratios that are very similar to SECO, however the amount of petroleum hydrocarbons found in the sediment was very low, 30 µg gˉ¹. The values for petroleum hydrocarbons range between 3. 0 - 223 µg gˉ¹. The relative abundance ratios of several pairs of triterpane and sterane compounds, especially the ratio of C 30 hopane/C 29 hopane that are displayed as major peaks in the m/z 191 ion chromatograms, are independent of weathering effects and are unambiguously used for identifying the SECO...|$|R
50|$|The {{auditorium}} is graced {{by a large}} crystal chandelier, {{which measures}} 16 ft in diameter, 50 ft in circumference and weighs 5000 lb. When installed, the chandelier contained 240 gas jets; it was wired for electricity in 1900 and in 1957 was rewired and fitted with an electric-powered winch, allowing it to be lowered more easily. It previously required 12 people working four-hours to <b>lower</b> it <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Atop the proscenium is a bas-relief bust of Mozart. Seated on the cornice above are the figures of Poetry, on the left, and Music, on the right.

Bailly and the ceiling murals of allegorical figures were completed by Karl Hermann Schmolze.|$|R
5000|$|The first LCT Mark 1 was {{launched}} by Hawthorn Leslie in November 1940. It was an all-welded 372-ton steel-hulled vessel that drew only 3 ft {{of water at}} the bow. A 12 ft wide hinged ramp enabled tanks to exit directly onto the beaches, while a second steel door behind the ramp sealed the bow area from the tank deck. On both sides, watertight bulwark coamings contained storage compartments, which added to the buoyancy provided by the double bottom under the tank deck. Within the double bottom were ballast and fuel tanks, which allowed the fore and aft trim to be adjusted for beaching. At the rear was a small bridge, beneath which were two [...] Hall-Scott petrol engines, an auxiliary generator, batteries and pumps. The hull tanks contained enough fuel {{for a range of}} [...] Aft of the engine room were quarters for ten crewmen with galley and storage. Behind the bridge was a wardroom for two officers, and mounts for port and starboard 2-pounder pom-pom machine guns. Key to the LCT's operation was the large stern-mounted kedge anchor which was dropped while inbound to the beach. This anchor stopped the LCT from slewing or broaching, and, with its powerful winch, enabled the craft to pull itself off the beach once the cargo was unloaded. The bow ramp was initially raised and <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> cranks, but in later versions a powered winch was installed. In each subsequent model, despite the size differences, the basic arrangement of power ramp, long tank well and aft steering station was retained.|$|R

5000|$|Water is {{diverted}} {{from the river}} by Warleigh Weir, about 200 yd upstream. The water flows to the pumping station down a 30 ft wide leat, which is crossed by a single segmental arch bridge with a central keystone. The water passes over depressing sluices which can be raised or <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> cranking, and then powers a breastshot water wheel. The 24 ft wide wheel is in two sections each 12 ft wide and 17 ft in diameter with a 9 in gap between them. The wheel has 48 wooden [...] "starts", supporting 96 float boards {{each of which is}} 13 in by 1 in by 12 ft and made of Iroko. The breastshot wheel is vertically mounted, and falling water strikes the blades. Breastshot wheels are less efficient than overshot wheels, more efficient than undershot wheels, and are not backshot.At full power the wheel uses 2 tons (2 tonnes) of water per second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives a flexible coupling to a pit wheel with a diameter of 16 ft, which has 408 hand-fitted wooden teeth that mesh with a 5 ft cast iron gear, increasing the speed to 16 rpm. From there, cranks drive vertical connecting rods that transfer the energy to two 18 ft long cast iron rocking beams made by Boulton and Watt. Each rocking beam drives an 18 in diameter lift pump, which also takes its supply from the mill leat. Each pump stroke raises 50 imperial gallons (230 litres) of water to the canal via 150 ft of 19 in diameter cast iron pipe.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{original}} frescoing is still visible, except for the ceiling, where {{the replacement of the}} chandelier in 1930 also involved repair work on the ceiling frescoes. The first chandelier was remarkable, with 14,000 hand-cut French prisms catching the light of 260 gas burners, ignited by a single traveling gas jet. In October 1923, it was converted to electric, and later replaced by the chandelier which hangs there today. The rest of the lighting was converted in 1929, following an accident in December 1928, when a ballerina's headdress was ignited by a gas lamp in her dressing room. Consequently, the fire marshal ordered the conversion from gas to electric as a safety precaution. The new frescoes, made in 1930, outlined the rim of the ceiling and exhibited the popular Art Deco styling of the late 1920s in the lettering, featuring the names of great classical composers such as J. S. Bach and Haydn. The chandelier has not been modernized, and still must be raised and <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> a <b>hand</b> crank.|$|R
50|$|A flower {{car is a}} type {{of vehicle}} used in the funeral industry, used to carry flowers for the burial service, or {{sometimes}} to carry the coffin under a bed of flowers. Built on the same commercial chassis as a hearse, the flower car has half-height rear bodywork on the rear similar to a pickup truck bed. The bed contains a liner to hold the flowers, normally built of stainless steel to resist rust. Some flower cars have a raised, flat tonneau cover across the bed at the top, upon which the flowers sit; the center portion sometimes is designed to raise and <b>lower,</b> hydraulically or <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> If the flower car is designed to carry a casket, it will be stored under the tonneau cover in the space beneath, behind the opening rear gate.|$|R

50|$|Pitch is {{controlled}} through {{the combination of}} the following factors: speed of propulsion of air through the instrument (controlled by the player's lungs and thoracic diaphragm); diameter and tension of lip aperture (controlled by the player's lip muscles—the embouchure) in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern French horn, the operation of valves <b>by</b> the left <b>hand,</b> which route the air into extra sections of tubing. Most horns have lever-operated rotary valves, but some, especially older horns, use piston valves (similar to a trumpet's) and the Vienna horn uses double-piston valves, or pumpenvalves. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound, in concert situations, in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet. A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural harmonics of the instrument (similar to a bugle). Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of any note can easily be raised or <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> adjusting the <b>hand</b> position in the bell.|$|R

40|$|The laser Doppler {{flow meter}} and the 133 -Xenon washout {{techniques}} of measuring cutaneous blood flow were compared {{for measuring the}} vasoconstrictor response of the hand during orthostatic maneuvres. Important discrepancies were detected for the two methods. When the <b>hand</b> was <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> 40 cm a 40 % decrease in blood flow was detected by the 133 -Xenon method, while a 60 % decrease was seen by the laser Doppler technique. <b>Lowering</b> the <b>hand</b> <b>by</b> 50 cm {{resulted in no further}} blood flow decrease when using the 133 -Xenon method, but an 80 % blood flow decrease was recorded with the laser Doppler method. A marked decrease in blood flow was recorded by the laser Doppler technique in hands that were sympathectomized or a hand that was subjected to a nerve blocade, strategies which should eliminate the orthostatic vasoconstrictor response of superficial cutaneous vessels. The 133 -Xenon technique did not detect any blood flow changes in hands without sympathetic tone. We found the laser Doppler flowmetry technique unsatisfactory for measurement of blood flow changes that occur in nutritional vessels as this method measures total skin blood flow including non-capillary vessels...|$|R

2500|$|A {{potential}} drawback of a DA/SA {{weapon is}} that the shooter must master two different trigger pulls: the longer, heavier DA first pull and the shorter, lighter subsequent SA pulls. The difference between these trigger pulls can affect {{the accuracy of the}} crucial first few shots in an emergency situation. Although there is little need for a safety on a DA/SA handgun when carrying it loaded with the hammer down, after the first shots are fired, the hammer will be cocked and the chamber loaded. Thus, most DA/SA guns either feature a conventional safety that prevents the hammer from dropping, or a [...] "decocker" [...] - a lever that safely drops the hammer (i.e. decocks the gun) without fear of the gun firing. The latter is the more popular because, without a decocker, the user is forced to <b>lower</b> the hammer <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> onto a loaded chamber, with all of the attendant safety risks that involves, in order to return the gun to double-action mode. Revolvers almost never feature safeties, since they are traditionally carried un-cocked, and the hammer requires the user to physically cock it, unlike a DA/SA gun, which cocks itself every time the slide is cycled.|$|R

40|$|Existence {{of molten}} {{peridotite}} {{in the early}} history of the Earth has long been the subject of debate and conjecture. Interest in the physical properties stems from a number of sources but was re-focussed {{in the wake of the}} proposal for the existence of a ¸Smagma ocean ¡T in the evolution of the moon, the Earth and other terrestrial planets. The application of phase equilibrium, buoyancy, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic constraints on the behaviour of molten mantle all rely on adequate characterisation ofthe properties of molten peridotite, largely lacking to date. The viscosity in particular, has received too little attention. A big experimental effort has been provided to obtain the dependence on temperature (T) of viscosity at ambient pressure (P) for the natural peridotite collected at Balmuccia, Italy. High-T measurements were performed by using concentric cylinder (CC). The high-T viscometry was started at 1600 _C and proceeded at 10 _C intervals, separated by cooling stages at 5 _C/min, each one held for 1 hour. No measurements were possible below 1570 _C, because crystallization had occurred. All standard attempts to obtain a homogeneous glass failed. A new technique was therefore used. Small 1 - 2 mm chips were hung in Pt loops suspended from a long Pt wire and the loops <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> into the high-T viscosity furnace until the chips fused into a bead of liquid held in the loop by surface tension. These samples were then left to quench and placed aside to be used in the splat-quenching device (SQD) (which allows quench rates on the order of 10 exp 4 _C/s) to finallyobtain a supercooled liquids by squeezing and rapidly quenching a falling liquid drop, through a joint action of a complex photoelectric-driven electromagnetic device. Electron microprobe analysis revealed that only a few vol% of the obtained glasses crystallized in isochemical crystals, whereas the homogeneity of the glassy matrix composition was found to be excellent. As the amount of glass obtained was too small to be used in the micropenetration technique we used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to derive the viscosity at low-T. DSC allowed us to unequivocally determine glass transition temperatures (Tg) for cooling/heating rates of 20, 15, 10, 8 and 5 K/min, as the peak of the Cp curves. At this point we used a recent method developed by [1] that, on the basis of the equivalence of the shear stress and the enthalpic relaxation time, allow to predict the low-T viscosity. The combined results obtained by using the different techniques above mentioned were fit by VFT equation with the high-T limiting value (viscosity value at infinite temperature) being fixed at a value of 10 exp- 4. 31 Pas [2]. A comparison between the data obtained here with the recent model from [3] (calibrated with melts as basic as basanite), have shown that in the range 900 to 1600 _C, the viscosity calculated according to [3] is very similar to those measured or calculated by the VFT fit, if A = - 4. 31; the discrepancy becoming significant at T< 900 _C. The very low T dependence of viscosity at superliquidus conditions obtained from the fitting here, indicates that at putative temperatures of the core-mantle boundary, near 5000 _C, the viscosity will decrease up to 10 exp- 3. 5 Pa s.

Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects (10 males and 20 females; all aged 20 – 30 years) with complete set of natural upper and lower anterior teeth were selected for this study after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. The upper and lower alginate impressions were taken and die stone models were obtained from each impression; overlays were produced from the biting surfaces of six upper and six <b>lower</b> anterior teeth <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> tracing from study casts, hand tracing from wax impressions of the bite surface, radiopaque wax impression method, and xerographic method.

The methods of wax impression were better for producing overlay of tooth away from the occlusal plane. Conclusions: Various techniques are used in bite mark analysis and the choice of technique depends largely on personal preference. No single technique {{has been shown to}} be better than the others and very little research has been carried out to compare different methods.

40|$|Neuroblastoma is a {{pediatric}} tumor that {{is thought to}} arise from autonomic precursors in the neural crest. Mutations in the PHOX 2 B gene have been observed in familial and sporadic forms of neuroblastoma and represent the first defined genetic predisposition for neuroblastoma. Here, we address the mechanisms that may underlie this predisposition, comparing the function of wild-type and mutant Phox 2 b proteins ectopically expressed in proliferating, embryonic sympathetic neurons. Phox 2 b displays a strong antiproliferative effect, which is lost in all Phox 2 b neuroblastoma variants analyzed. In contrast, an increase in sympathetic neuron proliferation is elicited by Phox 2 b variants with mutations in the homeodomain when endogenous Phox 2 b levels are <b>lowered</b> <b>by</b> siRNA-mediated knockdown to mimic the situation of heterozygous PHOX 2 B mutations in neuroblastoma.
