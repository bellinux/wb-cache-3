30|$|These are {{specifically}} recommended {{for treatment of}} obese children with Blount’s disease. A number of experimental animal studies have been published {{on the use of}} the tension band plating technique. In one animal study, rabbit hind limbs were allocated to either <b>lateral</b> <b>stapling,</b> lateral tension band plating, sham surgery or no surgery. Staple migration was observed after 2  weeks of treatment. No results from the histological analysis were reported apart from the growth plate appearing disturbed between the staple legs. Interestingly, staple hemiepiphysiodesis produced a larger valgus deformity when compared to the tension band plating technique. A similar result was observed in another study on rabbits but better grasp in bone was reported for the implants used for tension band plating. In their histological analysis, cellular disorganisation was reported around implants in 9 preparations from a total of 34 femurs. No differences were found between implant types and implant related injuries to the growth plate were not observed. Two porcine animal studies compared stapling with tension band plating in paired setups similar to the study presented were also reported [19, 20]. Medial hemiepiphysiodesis induced a varus deformity using both techniques but the angulation created was larger using the tension band plating technique. Signs of early loosening of staples as well as failure of implanted staples were reported. No histological analysis was included in these studies. A recent study investigated the effect of screw length on the rate of creation of the deformity but found no difference between short and long screws. However, guided growth using the tension band plating technique was found to be more efficient overall than staples [21].|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize localized density effects on some common fasteners’ holding capacities in wood-based panels. Oriented strand board (OSB) of three different thicknesses, medium density fiberboard (MDF), and particle board (PB) were tested for screw and staple withdrawal from face and edge, head pull-through, and for screw lateral resistance. The fastener holding capacities were correlated with localized density of the panels. Test results indicated that in the OSB panels, density variation had a significant effect on the screw withdrawal, head pull-through, and lateral resistances, but the effects were less evident for the staple withdrawal and head pull-through. For PB, density variation had a significant effect on the screw withdrawal and head pull-through resistances, but the effects were less pronounced for screw <b>lateral</b> resistance, <b>staple</b> withdrawal and head pull-through. For MDF, no significant correlations were found; this could be attributed to the low density variation in these panels. The data will be used for the optimization of furniture frames, and to provide recommendations to the panel industry on the use of the fasteners with their products.
