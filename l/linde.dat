5|$|After {{returning}} from military service, <b>Linde</b> joined the Greenville Spinners, the Chicago White Sox minor league affiliate of the Sally League. He tried {{out for the}} Milwaukee Brewers, {{but was unable to}} make the team, and as a result was sent to Greenville to gain experience. <b>Linde</b> pitched in 29 games for the Spinners. In those 29 games, he had ten wins, eight losses, a 3.50 ERA, and 121 innings pitched. After the conclusion of the season, in early November, <b>Linde</b> was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the rule 5 draft.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1950 season, <b>Linde</b> signed a new {{contract}} with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, <b>Linde</b> won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, <b>Linde</b> became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won all of last year. He finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, <b>Linde</b> remained part of the core starting rotation of the past couple years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included one against the Angels in which <b>Linde</b> kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, <b>Linde</b> started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, <b>Linde</b> won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, <b>Linde</b> pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA.|$|E

5|$|Uranium used {{to produce}} the first atom bombs from 1942 to 1948 was {{processed}} by <b>Linde</b> Air Products in nearby Tonawanda, and in 1944, the Manhattan Engineer District began using the LOOW site for the storage and transshipment of radioactive residues and wastes created through the processing of uranium ore at <b>Linde.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Linde</b> {{attended}} {{high school}} at Beaver Dam High School in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. While there, he played basketball as well as baseball, and {{was part of the}} state champion Beaver Dam High School basketball team in 1937. After graduating, he played amateur baseball in Wisconsin for several years. In a state amateur baseball tournament in 1941, <b>Linde,</b> representing the Beaver Dam Beavers, pitched a one-hitter to help lead his team to a 9–1 win over the representatives from Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. <b>Linde</b> attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison on and off between 1939 and 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, <b>Linde</b> pitched for the Oklahoma City Indians, the Indians {{minor league}} affiliate of the Texas League.

50|$|During {{this time}} Mark Knopfler was also {{involved}} with composing the music score for David Puttnam's 1983 film Local Hero, in which <b>Lindes</b> also performed {{on some of}} the cues. It was at this point that he discovered a passion for composing film soundtracks. <b>Lindes</b> toured with Dire Straits for their 1983 world tour and was present on the live album Alchemy Live, double album of excerpts from concerts at the Hammersmith Odeon in July 1983 which was released in early 1984. In early 1985, while Dire Straits were recording tracks for their Brothers In Arms album, <b>Lindes</b> left Dire Straits to compose film soundtracks full-time.|$|R
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Wisconsin, <b>Linde</b> first played professionally with the Green Bay Bluejays.

5|$|Shemanski Fountain, {{also known}} as Rebecca at the Well, is an outdoor {{fountain}} with a bronze sculpture, located in the South Park Blocks of downtown Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The sandstone fountain was designed in 1925, completed in 1926, and named after Joseph Shemanski, a Polish immigrant and businessman who {{gave it to the}} city. Carl L. <b>Linde</b> designed the trefoil, which features a statue designed by Oliver Laurence Barrett. The sculpture, which was added to the fountain in 1928, depicts the biblical personage Rebecca. Shemanski Fountain includes two drinking platforms with three basins each, with one platform intended for use by dogs.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von <b>Linde</b> found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E
5|$|Agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and Archer Fordham (David Wilson Barnes) {{refuse to}} let Marston {{return to his}} family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down Dutch van der <b>Linde</b> (Benjamin Byron Davis), the leader of Marston's former gang. Marston learns that Dutch has been forming his own gang, and joins Ross, Fordham {{and a group of}} U.S. {{soldiers}} in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, Marston chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter commits suicide by backing off the cliff and falling to his death. Marston is released from his deal with Ross and returns to his ranch where his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack (Josh Blaylock) are waiting. Marston devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. He is then suddenly forced to repel a surprise attack from a combined force of soldiers, lawmen and government agents led by Ross. Marston is able to fend off several waves of attackers and get his family to safety but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men, and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.|$|E
25|$|In December 1981, Guth read a {{paper from}} Moscow {{physicist}} Andrei <b>Linde</b> {{saying that the}} whole universe is within just one bubble, so nothing is destroyed by wall collisions. This conclusion was made using a Higgs field with an energy graph that was originally proposed by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg. Guth discussed this with <b>Linde,</b> who had independently been working on bubble inflation, but without considering the flatness problem. <b>Linde</b> and Guth eventually exchanged papers on the subject.|$|E

25|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it a valuable tool in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the <b>Linde</b> technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the <b>Linde</b> cycle. For this reason, simple <b>Linde</b> cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the Joule–Thomson effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E
