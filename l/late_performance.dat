Rather than the song itself, the exceptionally slick and memorable stage presentation and choreography of Marie N and her backers, combined with the advantageous <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> draw, is largely credited for the victory. When voting started the contest quickly turned into a two-horse race between Latvia and Malta with voting always very tight between the two. Malta held a marginal lead over the first half before Latvia gradually edged ahead, finally claiming victory with 176 points to Malta's 164. [...] "I Wanna" [...] picked up maximum 12s from Estonia, Germany, Israel, Lithuania and Spain, with only Romania failing to award the song any points at all.

40|$|The ALPSTONE Project defines {{means to}} predict a {{parallel}} program's performance. After a short overview of ALPSTONE, we explain the modeling method and sketch the software environment {{used for this}} purpose. 1 Introduction Because it is time-consuming to write parallel programs, <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> analysis is inacceptable due to the costs of a possible redesign. Thus, when developing parallel programs, {{it is necessary to}} analyze program performance very early in the engineering process. Preferrably, one gives a specification of the problem, gets a performance prediction and either redesigns the algorithm or programs all details. To minimize development efforts, several projects (cf. [1]) at the Basel Parallel Processing Lab have been developed with the focus on skeleton oriented programming. A common base defining the vocabulary, called BACS 1, has been developed and enhanced for the ALPSTONE Project. The methodology and tools used in ALPSTONE define a road map that guides a programme [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{systemic}} inflammatory reaction (SIR) {{is assumed}} {{to be one of the}} factors that causes cerebral dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the SIR and postoperative cognitive performance at 5 days and 3 months. Methods. One hundred patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were studied. Inflammatory markers and markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis were determined at several time points during and after the operation. Correlation analysis between maximum levels of the different markers and early and <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> was performed. Results. No overall association was found between the maximum levels of the inflammatory markers and early and late function. Conclusions. Notwithstanding limitations of statistical power established markers of systemic inflammatory reaction showed no relationship with outcome at 5 -day or 3 -month follow-up in this subset of patients.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that preverbal communication skills underpin development of spoken language. This historical review outlines {{the establishment of}} a quantitative methodology for assessing preverbal communication skills in children with hearing aids and cochlear implants. The method is shown to be reliable and free from observer bias. The review also summarises findings from a series of cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies utilising the methodology. Profoundly deaf young children, either with cochlear implants or successful users of hearing aids, show similar patterns of preverbal communication development that contrast with those of unsuccessful hearing-aid users. Preverbal measures obtained 12 months after implantation are predictive of <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> on speech perception tasks. Moreover, there is a significant association between the preverbal measure of ‘autonomy’ obtained before implantation and later speech perception performance. This latter finding has important theoretical implications for understanding of language development and suggests that intervention that promotes autonomy in adult–child interaction may lead to improved outcomes. Such intervention could be commenced as soon as deafness is discovered...|$|E
40|$|The European Central Bank (ECB) has {{received}} a lot of criticism for its too little, too <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> to ease market pressures during the economic crisis. At the same time, the ECB and the Federal Reserve (FED) have managed the new economic realities that have emerged in the international context differently. Despite the criticisms, the European Central Bank is the European Union institution that has assumed more control due to the new model of economic governance of the EU. Why did the Federal Reserve act so nimbly and quickly to calm the markets, while the ECB was so cautious in managing monetary policy? The aim {{of this paper is to}} perform a comparative analysis of the management of interest rates and other monetary policy measures undertaken by the Central Bank and the Federal Reserve during the economic crisis, as well as to understand the changes in the context of the ECB and the emergence of its authority within the European Union’s economic governance model since 2011. Thus, in order to carry out a scrupulous exposition, we will also limit the time frame of this study to the 2007 - 2014 period...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between the impact of raising the thermostatic temperature {{and the impact of}} prolonging the thermostatic time on the performance of steam-cured concrete containing a large portion of fly ash (FA) or ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) by analysing the form removal strength, chemically combined water content, reaction degree, strength development, chloride permeability, and volume stability. For the materials and test conditions reported in this study, raising the thermostatic temperature is more favourable for concrete containing FA, as indicated by the significantly higher form removal strength and the higher growth of reaction degree of FA compared with prolonging the thermostatic time. With an increase in the thermostatic temperature, the hydration degree of a binder containing FA or GGBS initially increases and subsequently decreases. Although concrete containing FA can obtain satisfactory form removal strength with steam curing at 80 °C, the late strength development of concrete containing FA is slow for the same curing conditions. The effect of the <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> of resistance to chloride ion permeability improved by FA is better than the effect improved by GGBS. The risk of destroying the structure of concrete containing a large portion of FA or GGBS due to delayed ettringite formation (DEF) is minimal when specimens were steam-cured at 80 °C...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest on using Component-Base System (CBS) to develop Applications. These parts are glued together to compose an application. Since the approach supports reusability, these parts might be reused into countless systems. CBS provides efficiency, reliability and reduces the need for maintenance. However, performance {{is a major problem}} with this kind of applications. It believed that, the failure of performance means a financial loss, increased expenses of hardware, higher cost of software development, and harder than that, the loss of relationships with consumers. However, one important solution for that is the avoidance of <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> evaluation. A prediction approach supported with a reasoning framework is a best solution to overcome the problem. In this paper, we investigate and identify problems on software performance prediction in context of CBS. Then we present the result of a comparative evaluation based on selected criteria for three approaches to software performance evaluation namely measurement approach, model-based approach, and mixed approach. The result from the comparative shows that mixed approach is the best method to be used as means to develop the proposed framework. The proposed framework is aiming at enabling developers to efficiently predict and evaluate software performance during development lifecycle. The details of the comparative study are presented as well as the outline of our proposed framework...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two parts}} of the design process that can benefit from reduced, {{miniature}} benchmarks that behave like longer-running applications during simulation: 1) the early design phase before an implementation exists, and 2) the later design phases when cycle-accurate functional models exist. In the early design phase, many hundreds or thousands of potential design tradeoffs must be evaluated rapidly at a high-level. In the later design phases, design changes are costly to undo, so potential changes need to be accurately evaluated using a performance model that has been validated against a functional model. Applications typically run too long to be executed completely for either early design tradeoffs or <b>late</b> <b>performance</b> model validation. In this paper, we explore the potential for automatically synthesizing reduced miniature benchmarks from the execution characteristics of actual applications. We discuss the advantages and challenges of automatic synthesis and present evidence that miniature benchmarks can reproduce the machine behavior of much longer running applications. We present one approach to benchmark synthesis and show that IPC and many average characteristics of the executing synthetic benchmarks {{are similar to those of}} the applications that the synthetic benchmarks are derived from. We also show that an early design task like identifying performance trends due to design changes can be carried out while still reducing runtimes significantly. The synthetic benchmarks converge to results rapidly, enabling performance model validation. 1...|$|E
