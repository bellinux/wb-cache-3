5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a <b>low</b> <b>fire</b> while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.prionotes {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups. It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively <b>low</b> <b>fire</b> mortality rates, and because it is only weakly serotinous: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of pottery {{allowed for the}} creation of fireproof cooking vessels in a variety of shapes and sizes. Coating the earthenware with some type of plant gum, and later glazes, converted the porous container into a waterproof vessel. The earthenware cookware could then be suspended over a fire through use of a tripod or other apparatus, or even be placed directly into a <b>low</b> <b>fire</b> or coal bed {{as in the case of}} the pipkin. Ceramics conduct heat poorly, however, so ceramic pots must cook over relatively low heats and over long periods of time. However, most ceramic pots will crack if used on the stovetop, and are only intended for the oven.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quadratic}} integrate-and-fire (QIF) {{model was}} created by Latham et al. in 2000 to explore the many questions related to networks of neurons with <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> rates.

3000|$|..., we proved in Section 3 {{that there}} are two steady states. With our {{simulations}} we can conjecture that the steady state with larger firing rate is unstable. However the stationary solution with <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> rate is locally asymptotically stable. We illustrate this situation in the bottom left subplot in Figure 4. Starting with a firing rate close to the high stationary firing value, the solution tends to the <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> stationary value.|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectrophysiological {{recordings}} in cortex in vivo {{have revealed}} a rich variety of dynamical regimes ranging from irregular asynchronous states to {{a diversity of}} synchronized states, depending on species, anesthesia, and external stimulation. The average population firing rate in these states is typically low. We study analytically and numerically a network of sparsely connected excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons in the inhibition-dominated, <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> rate regime. For sufficiently high values of the external input, the network exhibits an asynchronous <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> frequency state (L). Depending on synaptic time constants, we show that two scenarios may occur when external inputs are decreased: (1) the L state can destabilize through a Hopf bifucation as the external input is decreased, leading to synchronized oscillations spanning d δ to β frequencies; (2) the network can reach a bistable region, between the <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> frequency network state (L) and a quiescent one (Q). Adding an adaptation current to excitatory neurons leads to spontaneous alternations between L and Q states, similar to experimental observations on UP and DOWN states alternations...|$|R

2500|$|Like plants, animals {{display a}} range of {{abilities}} to cope with fire, but they differ from plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although birds are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit {{from being able to}} take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some birds are potentially responsible for intentional fire propagation to flush out prey. [...] Mammals are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. Amphibians and reptiles may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud. Some arthropods also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril. Microbial organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but {{are more likely to be}} able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A <b>low</b> <b>fire</b> intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire. The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover. Certain species of fungi, such as Cylindrocarpon destructans appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Metepec is the state’s main pottery center, with a {{production}} {{that stands out}} for its variety and artistry, which has evolved slowly since the colonial period. Although part of the Toluca metropolitan area, {{the center of this}} municipality maintains its small town atmosphere, with handcrafts filling stores and street stalls on the streets near the San Juan Bautista parish church. [...] The municipality is home to over 300 artisans and 270 families dedicated {{in one way or another}} to this industry, which is its main economic activity. Most of the pottery produced is common glazed wares for everyday use such as large pots, plates and casseroles, often with a blue, green or yellow glaze. However, the municipality is better known for its decorative pieces, generally unglazed and painted tempuras in bright and contrasting colors. These include items such as nativity scene pieces, figures of horses, sun plaques (hung on the outside of houses) and mermaids, but the most notable decorative piece is called the “tree of life.” These look like candelabras which lack places to put candles. Traditionally these were made as allegories for the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and these continue to be made. [...] More recently, trees with other themes have appeared including Day of the Dead, pottery making and more. [...] These are <b>low</b> <b>fire</b> pieces, and most are small, no more than thirty cm in height, but monumental versions are made as well such as the one that is in the collection of the Vatican museums. Most are also painted in bright colors such as magenta, red, blue, yellow, green, orange and purple but some are left unpainted. In 2009, the Metepec style has been legally protected from imitations by denominación de origen.|$|E
40|$|Despite unique well {{characterized}} neuronal properties, such as extensive electrical coupling and <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> rates, {{the role}} of the inferior olive (IO), which {{is the source of the}} climbing fiber inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells, is still controversial. We propose that the IO stochastically recodes the high-frequency information carried by its synaptic inputs into stochastic, low-rate spikes in its climbing fiber output. Computer simulations of realistic IO networks showed that moderate electrical coupling produced chaotic firing, which maximized the input-output mutual information.

40|$|Firing rate is an {{important}} means of encoding information in the nervous system. To reliably encode {{a wide range of}} signals, neurons need to achieve a broad range of firing frequencies and to move smoothly between <b>low</b> and high <b>firing</b> rates. This can be achieved with specific ionic currents, such as A-type potassium currents, which can linearize the frequency-input current curve. By applying recently developed mathematical tools to a number of biophysical neuron models, we show how currents that are classically thought to permit <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> rates can paradoxically cause a jump to a high minimum firing rate when expressed at higher levels. Consequently, achieving and maintaining a <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> rate is surprisingly difficult and fragile in a biological context. This difficulty can be overcome via interactions between multiple currents, implying a need for ion channel degeneracy in the tuning of neuronal properties. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{record the}} {{possible}} effect of acute {{deep brain stimulation}} (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPI) on the neuronal activity of the ventralis oralis anterior (VOA) nucleus of the thalamus. METHODS: Under general propofol anaesthesia, extracelullar single unit recordings were performed in VOA of a post-anoxic dystonic patient previously implanted with GPI located electrodes for chronic DBS. RESULTS: Neurons recorded in the VOA could be classified in two cell subpopulations: a high firing rate (16. 5 Hz) and low burst index (BI; 15. 6) type and a <b>low</b> <b>firing</b> rate (5. 5 Hz) and high BI (35. 6) type. GPI electrical stimulation reduced the frequency and increased the BI of the high firing rate cells while leaving the other cell type unchanged.
