A relative of one of the victims questioned why Alvarez did not simply <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tracks if it was really a suicide attempt.|$|E

25|$|As {{the fire}} raged outside the mine, the heat caused {{the cold air}} in the tunnel to rush out, {{replacing}} it with hot air and smoke. Pulaski ordered the men to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of the mine where there was still some breathable air. As the fire closed in around the tunnel entrance, timber beams {{at the mouth of}} the tunnel began to burn. Pulaski carried water in his hat from pools on the mine floor to the entrance, trying to douse the flames. In the process, he was badly burned. Eventually, Pulaski fell unconscious, as did all his men.|$|E

25|$|After {{the release}} of the group's first album in 1973, they were banned from {{competing}} in the isicathamiya competitions because of their ability to win many of the competitions. They were, however, welcome to perform for the audience. Following this, the group started performing for their own audiences in shows that were specially made and, soon afterwards, the group began touring around South Africa in their own concerts, but due to the Apartheid system in use, they were often stopped by police guards; on some of these occasions they were even made to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground whilst being searched.

25|$|LTTE had {{executed}} {{prisoners of}} war {{on a number of}} occasions, in spite of the declaration in 1988, that it would abide by the Geneva Conventions. One such incident was the mass murder of 600 unarmed Sri Lankan Police officers in 1990, in Eastern Province, after they surrendered to the LTTE on the request of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Police officers were promised safe conduct and subsequent release; they were instead taken to the jungle, blindfolded, and had their hands tied behind their backs, before being made to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground to be subsequently shot. In 1993, LTTE killed 200 Sri Lanka Army soldiers, captured in the naval base at Pooneryn, during the Battle of Pooneryn.|$|E

Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death.

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor.

500|$|There is a {{story about}} a dragon man from the village of Pečenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, [...] "I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me," [...] before he lay down and fell asleep. A man who swung the scythe, however, {{inadvertently}} grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood. A dragon from the village of Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a scythe blade or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, [...] "How tired I am!" [...] This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds.|$|E

[...] She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings. [...] She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a hotel, meeting Brooks only for lunch. [...] Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. [...] She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry."

2500|$|All {{occupants}} of the ground floor were seriously injured. In the first-floor corridor, some occupants decided to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground {{to show that they}} offered no resistance. Nonetheless, police beat them and kicked them when they arrived. Soon, there were police officers on all four floors of the building, kicking and battering prone occupants. In one corridor, police ordered a group of young men and women to kneel, so that they could batter them around the head and shoulders more easily. Here, Daniel Albrecht, a 21-year-old cello student from Berlin, had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery to stop bleeding in his brain. The police also used humiliation to cow the {{occupants of}} the school. An officer who stood spread-legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman, grabbed his groin and thrust it into her face.

2500|$|Gill then {{entered the}} school {{and made his way}} to the cafeteria, almost {{directly}} ahead of the school entrance.

He then raised his weapon and ordered the remaining students to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. He continued shooting at students until confronted by two police officers who had been visiting the school at the time regarding an unrelated incident. The police officers entered after hearing the gunfire, and rushed to the cafeteria. Additional police officers surrounded the campus. Confronted by police officers in the school cafeteria, Gill briefly took two more people hostage. He was shot in the arm by police officer Denis Côté and then committed suicide via a gunshot wound to the head at 12:48 EDT. The police officers attempted to resuscitate him, but failed. At 1:30p.m., police officers dragged his body outside the building, covered it with a yellow bag, then continued the evacuation and the search for possible accomplices. [...] Authorities concluded the attack was premeditated, after a short suicide note was found on Gill's body during the autopsy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman can}} lie {{on her back}} with her hips {{on the edge of}} a {{platform}} such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or [...] restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the butterfly position, adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced clitoral stimulation, and the woman may need direct clitoral fingering, either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> woman.|$|E
