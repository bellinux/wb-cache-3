It was a squalid ruin, a graceless desolation, which not even the pitying twilight could soften. The stumps showed their hideous mutilation everywhere; the brush had been burned, and the fires had scorched and blackened the <b>lean</b> <b>soil</b> of the hill-slope and blasted it with sterility. A few weak saplings, withered by the flames, drooped and straggled about; it would be a century before the forces of nature could repair the waste.|$|E

50|$|In {{cultivation}} {{it grows}} from 4-8 inches high, {{and up to}} 1 foot in its native habitat. The plant is a soft pale gray-green color, giving off a pungent odor when brushed, and is covered with short erect hairs. The narrow leaves are deeply divided, with linear segments. The violet flowers grow in whorls of 6-8, and are held in a tiny calyx covered in long white hairs. In cold climates it is treated as an annual, freely reseeding itself, with seeds overwintering even in sub-freezing climates. It adapts itself to small spaces in between other plants, preferring full sun, <b>lean</b> <b>soil,</b> moderate irrigation, and good drainage.|$|E

He was intent on making a living in easier fashion than {{scratching}} it from the <b>lean</b> <b>soil</b> of the mountainside. Among his immediate relatives were nineteen people, defective from birth – blind, deaf, feeble-minded. Abraham Epworth Rounds ran true to the family form. His vision was so defective that he had been given a few years of schooling at the Tennessee School for the Blind. In Louisville, at first, he made a precarious living for himself and his wife (his second spouse) by working at odd jobs, chiefly on the road, and by periodical fits of labor in the woodyard of the Associated Charities, in exchange for which evidence of his good intent, the family rent and grocery bills were paid. Before long, mutual fits of temper provided the basis of a divorce between himself and his wife...|$|E

30|$|Standing volume {{data from}} 17, 448 sites 2 {{containing}} natural and planted Scots pine forests, {{ranging in age}} from 10 up to 70  years, were used to develop a mathematical model for stand growth. From these data, mean values of stock, growing stock increment and growth class in 10 -year cycles were determined. Data for Scots pine growing under four different growth conditions on soddy podzolic soil: dry and fresh <b>lean</b> sandy <b>soil</b> (А 1 and А 2, respectively); fresh sandy loam (10 – 15  % clay) soil (В 2); and fresh clay loam (20 – 40  % loam) soil (С 2) were used for the analysis (These growth conditions exist in all the forests studied), Table  2. The seven forest areas were chosen because pine forests are an important component of them, and those forests have large areas of planted pine forests. The forests were chosen in accordance with forest growth conditions which were common for the boreal forests. Mensuration characteristics (volume, growing stock increment) of the studied samples of Scots pine at these seven forest areas were determined using the standard Russian methods (Chernykh et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|CONSUMERS SENSORY EVALUATION OF MELON SWEETNESS AND QUALITY Agulheiro Santos, A. C, Rato, A. E., Laranjo, M. and Gonçalves, C. Departamento de Fitotecnia, Escola de Ciências e Tecnologia, Instituto de Ciências Agrárias e Ambientais Mediterrânicas (ICAAM), Instituto de Investigação e Formação Avançada (IIFA), Universidade de Évora, Polo da Mitra, Ap. 94, 7002 - 554 Évora, Portugal. ABSTRACT The {{sensory quality}} of fruits {{is made of}} a range of {{attributes}} like sweetness, acidity, aroma, firmness, color. Taste perception and perception threshold of these attributes are variable according to the psychological and cultural development of individuals. To better understand the quality evaluation of melon by consumers, consumers were invited to taste melon samples, in supermarkets in Évora (South region), Lisbon (Central region) and Vila Nova de Gaia (North region). The present work explored the importance given by consumers to sweetness in order to classify the overall quality of melon. Furthermore, the relationship of the chemical evaluation of Total Soluble Solids (TSS) with sweetness of melon was studied. Fruits from the variety Melão branco picked randomly from those that were exposed for sale in supermarkets were used for analysis. Fruits were chinned along the equatorial zone and only {{the central part of the}} fruit, opposite to the part that <b>leaned</b> on the <b>soil,</b> was used to obtain homogeneous samples. Consumers were invited to taste four small pieces of each fruit, previously referenced with a code number, and answer a questionnaire with two questions related to sweetness and overall quality. Each question had five possible levels, identified from “Nothing sweet”, to “Extremely sweet”, in one case, and from “Poor” to “Excellent” in the other. Simultaneously, the values of TSS (measured in ºBrix) for each melon used in the study were evaluated by refractometry. This sensory analysis allowed us to point out the following findings: first of all, there is good agreement between the results obtained to classify “Sweetness” and “Overall Quality” (Cohen’s Kappa= 53. 1 %, p< 0. 001), which means, for example, that fruits with excellent quality are in general extremely sweet. Moreover, fruits with less than 9. 6 °Brix are considered of poor quality and nothing sweet, whereas fruits with values between 10 °Brix and 12 °Brix are considered good in terms of overall quality. It seems that the thresholds for the stimulus/intensity of sweetness lied between 10 °Brix to 14 °Brix for this melon variety.
