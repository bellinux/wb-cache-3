It is shown that, {{assuming}} a maximum permissible rms tolerance of 6 x 10 to the - 6 th in, the single arch mirror weighs about 50 percent of an equivalent solid mirror up to {{a diameter of}} 24 in. The single arch is relatively simple to construct and uses a simple center support. Where a better figure is required, or for larger sizes, the double arch is superior in performance to the single arch. The weight of the double arch will vary from about 50 to under 40 percent of an equivalent conventional mirror as the diameter is increased from 20 to 144 in.

40|$|The {{major sources}} causing {{deterioration}} of optical quality in extremely large optical telescopes are misadjustments of the <b>mirrors,</b> deformations of <b>monolithic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> and misalignments of segments in segmented mirrors. For active optics corrections, all three errors, which can partially compensate each other, are measured simultaneously. It is therefore {{of interest to}} understand {{the similarities and differences}} between the three corresponding types of modes which describe these errors. The first two types are best represented by Zernike polynomials and elastic modes respectively, both of them being continuous and smooth functions. The segment misaligment modes, which are derived by singular value decomposition, are by their nature not smooth and in general discontinuous. However, for mirrors with a large number of segments, the lowest modes become effectively both smooth and continuous. This paper derives analytical expressions for these modes, using differential operators and their adjoints, for the limit case of infinitesimally small segments. For segmented mirrors with approximately 1000 segments, it is shown that these modes agree well with the corresponding lowest singular value decomposition modes. Furthermore, the analytical expressions reveal the nature of the segment misalignment modes and allow for a detailed comparison with the elastic modes of <b>monolithic</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Some mathematical features emerge as identical in the two cases.

To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, a parametric ANSYS model that calculates the mode shapes, natural frequencies, and disturbance response of such a mirror, as well as of the equivalent <b>monolithic</b> <b>mirror,</b> has been developed. This model constructs a mirror using rings of hexagonal segments that are either connected continuously along the edges (to form a monolith) or at discrete locations corresponding to the mechanism locations (to form a segmented mirror).

The results of a set of parameter studies suggest that such mechanisms can be used to create a 15 -m segmented mirror that behaves similarly to a monolith, although fully predicting the segmented mirror performance would require incorporating measured mechanism properties into the model.
