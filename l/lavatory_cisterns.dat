Mr and Mrs Irwin were tenants from July 1966. The common parts were vandalised, the lifts did not work, the stair lights failed, the chute was blocked, <b>lavatory</b> <b>cisterns</b> blocked and overflowed. The tenants, {{conducting}} a [...] "rent strike", {{refused to pay}} rent. In an action by the council to eject them, they counterclaimed that the council was in breach of a duty to keep the common parts of the estates in decent repair.|$|E

The idea for creating Salter's duck came about from his studies on a <b>lavatory</b> <b>cistern</b> while at Edinburgh University. He invented Salter's duck in 1974 and attempted to make it the main device of choice for the Wave Energy program in the United Kingdom. A prototype attempt to use the device was constructed in 1976 off Dores Beach. It was to be used to [...] "provide some 20 kw of power". It was modified slightly from the original design and Coventry University, which helped with the design, went on to utilize a separate type that was called the Sea Clam.|$|R
