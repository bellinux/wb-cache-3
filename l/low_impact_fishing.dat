40|$|Trawling {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its introduction in the 17 th century. In 1882 the Fishery Board for Scotland was established and assigned powers to ban beam and otter trawling where {{necessary to protect}} traditional static gear fisheries. Under these powers, {{large parts of the}} inshore waters off the east and west coasts of Scotland were closed to trawling. The Firth of Clyde remained closed until 1962. More recently, in April 2015 solicitors acting for Greenpeace obtained High Court permission for a judicial review of Defra’s alleged failure to adjust its policy on allocating annual landing quotas to reflect reforms to the CFP. It is claimed the reforms stipulate that greater preference should be given to sustainable <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> <b>fishing</b> methods at the expense of high-impact methods such as trawling. In Scotland, the exclusion of trawling activity from a network of marine protected areas established in July 2015 has also been highly controversial. There is no doubt that some trawl gears can be extremely destructive of fragile habitats and slowly regenerating fauna such as coral. Over expanses of mud or sand, however, it has been claimed that trawling may be a positive factor, akin to ploughing the fields in terrestrial agriculture, and enhancing the productivity of the ecosystem. There have been many scientific studies, both in the field and using mathematical modelling, of the impact of trawling on the seabed. Similarly, we know very well that harvesting of fish and shellfish, whether using trawling or static gear, has consequences for marine food webs. However, there have been few, if any, scientific studies which have put these two aspects of trawling together and then compared the seabed impacts of trawling with the consequences of harvesting. In this project we used a mathematical model to compare and contrast the whole ecosystem effects of harvesting fish and shellfish with the consequences of other aspects of trawling activity, especially the ploughing of seabed habitats. The model is not detailed to the level of individual species or exact locations. Rather it gives results at the level of a whole regional sea area, such as the North Sea or the whole of the west of Scotland. The project had three main components. First, was the extension of an existing mathematical model of a marine ecosystem to include explicit representation of the ploughing effects that different gears have on seabed habitats. Second, an analysis of a large international data set on activity, landings and catches by different fishing gears in northwest European waters, and the mapping of these onto different seabed habitats to generate inputs to the model. Finally, we carried out a series of sensitivity experiments with the model. These experiments investigated the whole ecosystem effects of seabed ploughing by different gears, using food web indicators relevant to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and compared them with the impact of one scenario for implementing a landing obligation, and the potential impacts of a reduction in overall fishing activity. For the North Sea, the results show that even if all ploughing effects were eliminated, the effects on the whole ecosystem would be equivalent to only a 1 % or less change in overall harvesting rate of fish and shellfish. This is a very small effect compared to the changes in effective harvesting rate implied by the improvements in gear selectivity required to achieve the landing obligation. For the west of Scotland region, the model showed that the food web was more sensitive to the effects of ploughing by fishing gears than in the North Sea, but the effect was still small compared to the consequences of activity reduction overall. The greater sensitivity of the west of Scotland to seabed ploughing arose because the disturbance rate of muddy sediments was around 5 -times higher than in the North Sea, almost entirely due to the activities of TR 2 Nephrops trawling. Despite our conclusion that the regional scale food web effects of seabed ploughing are small compared to the primary consequences of harvesting fish, {{this is not to say}} that there are no effects on regional biodiversity, or significant effects at local scales on specific habitats or vulnerable species. In particular the study identifies the TR 2 gear fleet as being responsible for the majority of ecosystem-wide consequences of seabed ploughing. This gear has a particularly high ploughing rate and its activity is focussed on muddy sediments where the nutrient chemistry processes are more vulnerable to ploughing than in sandy and coarser sediments...|$|E

The <b>fishing</b> <b>impact</b> is much higher in areas of less than 40 m depth within 11 km of the Cape Palos marine reserve. The impact also depends {{on the state of}} the sea and the kind of habitat. Deep-sea habitats associated with hard substrata and sandy beds show the highest impact, and sublittoral muds and habitats associated with circa littoral rocks with moderate energy show the <b>lowest</b> <b>impact.</b> The <b>fishing</b> <b>impact</b> changes throughout the moon cycle, showing different day-scale patterns associated with different habitats and different species compositions. Finally, we show that the global optimization of the regression trees can be essential to find some important patterns and that these trees are a useful tool for determining which areas are considered to be more important in terms of protection, taking into account specifically the vulnerability of the local populations...|$|R
40|$|Every winter, young-of-the-year herring and sprat {{migrate to}} North Sea {{estuaries}} {{and become the}} dominant member of the estuarine fish assemblage, both by numbers and by biomass. These winter migrations have been related to abiotic factors (temperature and salinity), estuarine productivity and the reduced predation pressure in turbid brackish water areas. During estuarine residency, herring and sprat mainly feed on calanoid copepods. We have estimated the food consumption of zooplankton (g C m - 3 day - 1) by herring and sprat which overwinter in the Scheldt estuary using two models of feeding in fish: a bioenergetic model based on physiological parameters and a model based on the change in stomach contents over time. To assess the <b>impact</b> of <b>fish</b> on the copepod biomass of the brackish part of the estuary, we have developed a simple copepod biomass model and included food consumption by fish as a biomass sink. In general, the consumption of zooplankton by fish is too low to represent {{a major source of}} copepod mortality. The <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> of <b>fish</b> predation may be a function of the low fish biomass in spring at a time when copepod production increases...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionTo {{reduce the}} {{unwanted}} by-catch in shrimp trawling, alternative stimulation {{techniques such as}} electricity, which selectively invokes a reaction in shrimp, might be used. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of such electric pulses in sea fish. Materials and MethodsPlaice (n = 21), sole (n = 22), dragonet (n = 21), pogge (n = 21), codfish (n = 20), armed bullhead (n = 14) and fivebeard rockling (n = 8) were exposed to electric pulses (60 V, 0. 5 milliseconds, 5 Hz) for 10 sec. Behaviour and mortality were recorded. All fish were killed and subjected to necropsy examination 24 h after exposure. Control animals consisted of equal numbers of the same species not exposed to electric pulses. ResultsAll fish survived the experiment. In almost all exposed fish, minor and brief fright reactions were observed. In general, gross and microscopical abnormalities were rarely present in exposed and control fish. In one control and two electrical-exposed plaice, small multifocal cutaneous haemorrhages were observed. In one electrical-exposed sole, a small focal interstitial haemorrhage in the muscle was present. ConclusionAlternative techniques such as electric pulses for catching shrimp could be promising, since this appears to have <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> on <b>fish,</b> at least under experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of length-weight {{relationships}} for commercially exploited fish is {{an important}} tool for assessing and managing of fish stocks. However, analyses of length-weight relationship fisheries data typically do not consider the inherent differences in length-weight relationships for fish caught from different habitats, seasons, or years, and this can affect the utility of these data for developing condition indices or calculating fisheries biomass. Here, we investigated length-weight relationships for ribbonfish Trichiurus lepturus {{in the waters of}} the Arabian Sea off Oman collected during three periods (2001 - 02, 2007 - 08, and 2014 - 15) and showed that a multivariate modelling approach that considers the areas and seasons in which ribbonfish were caught improved estimation of length-weight relationships. We used the outputs of these models to explore spatio-temporal variations in condition indices and relative weights among ribbonfish, revealing fish of 85 - 125 cm were in the best overall condition. We also found that condition differed according to where and when fish were caught, with condition lowest during spring and pre-south-west monsoon periods and highest during and after the south-west monsoons. We interpret these differences to be a consequence of variability in temperature and food availability. Based on our findings, we suggest fishing during seasons that have the <b>lowest</b> <b>impact</b> on <b>fish</b> condition and which are commercially most viable; such fishery management would enhance fisheries conservation and economic revenue in the region...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, occurrences of summertime upwelling-driven low {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) events, or hypoxia, have increased along the northeast Pacific coast. If hypoxic events are severe enough to cause marine species mortality, the areas affected are often called “dead zones. ” In 2002 and again in 2006, the events were lethal, resulting in mass invertebrate and fish kills. Many organisms are impacted by these events, but less mobile juvenile fishes and crabs are potentially more vulnerable to {{the long-term effects of}} these stressful conditions than adults. Little is known about how <b>low</b> DO <b>impacts</b> coastal <b>fishes</b> and invertebrates, especially during the juvenile phase. Nursery habitats in the nearshore open-coast and enclosed estuaries may be differentially affected by hypoxia by prevailing summertime oceanographic conditions. Both ecosystems are critical for the early development of many ecologically and commercially important species.

We asked i) does moderate impact exercise result in a greater gain in BMC than <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> exercise, ii) what are the loading characteristics associated with a moderate and <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> exercise program and does this differ from non-structured play?, and iii) does loading history affect the osteogenic response to a moderate or <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> program? METHODS Sixty-eight pre- and early-pubertal girls (aged 8. 9 +/- 0. 2 yrs) were randomized {{to take part in}} a moderate or <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> exercise program 3 times/wk for 8. 5 mnths. The number and type of loads associated with the exercise classes and non-structured play (recess) were assessed from video footage. The magnitude of load was assessed using a pedar in-sole mobile system. Hours of moderate and high impact organized sport were assessed from a physical activity questionnaire. RESULTS The moderate and <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> exercise programs consisted of - 400 impacts per class, but the jumping, hopping and dynamic activities performed during the moderate impact program produced forces ranging from 2 to 4 times body weight (BW) compared to - 1 BW for the <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> program. Moderate impact exercise resulted in a 2. 7 % greater gain in BMC at the tibia compared to the <b>low</b> <b>impact</b> exercise. The moderate impact exercise program consisted of fewer <b>low</b> <b>impacts</b> (1 - 2 BW) and a higher number of moderate impacts (2 - 4 BW) compared to those typically performed during non-structured play.

40|$|Alien {{species can}} change the {{recipient}} environment in various ways, {{and some of them}} cause considerable damage. Understanding such impacts is crucial to direct management actions. This study addresses the following questions: Is it possible to quantify impact across higher taxa in a comparative manner? Do impacts differ between taxonomic groups? How are environmental and socio-economic impacts related? Can impacts be predicted based on those in other regions?To address these questions, we reviewed literature describing the impacts of 300 species from five major taxonomic groups: mammals, birds, fish, terrestrial arthropods and plants. To make very diverse impact measures comparable, we used the semi-quantitative generic impact scoring system (GISS) which describes environmental and socio-economic impacts using twelve categories. In each category, scores range from zero (no impact known or detectable) to five (the highest possible impact). Using the same scoring system for taxa as diverse as invertebrates, vertebrates and plants, we found that overall, alien mammals in Europe have the highest <b>impact,</b> while <b>fish</b> have the lowest. Terrestrial arthropods were found to have the <b>lowest</b> environmental <b>impact,</b> while <b>fish</b> had relatively <b>low</b> socio-economic <b>impact.</b> Overall, the magnitude of environmental and socio-economic impacts of individual alien species is highly correlated. However, at the species level, major deviations are found. For mammals and birds, the impacts in invaded ranges outside of Europe are broadly similar to those recorded for alien species within Europe, indicating that a consideration of the known impacts of a species in other regions can be generally useful when predicting the impacts of an alien species. However, {{it should be noted that}} this pattern is not consistent across all mammal and bird orders, and thus, such information should be considered with caution. Synthesis and applications. Comparing the impacts of alien species across taxa is necessary for prioritizing management efforts and effective allocation of resources. By applying the generic impact scoring system (GISS) to five major taxonomic groups, we provide the basis for a semi-quantitative cross-taxa listing process (e. g. ‘black lists’ or 100 -worst-lists). If more data are collated from different geographical regions and habitats using standard GISS protocols, risk assessments for alien species based on rigorous measures of impact could be improved by taking into account local variation, and context dependence of impacts. This would also allow studies at lower taxonomic levels, and within-taxon analyses of functional groups and guilds...|$|R

A total of 12 benthopelagic fish species (five chondrichthyes and seven osteichthyes) were identified. The blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) was the most often observed fish species. The depth of 787 m represents a new depth record for this fish in the Adriatic Sea. Groups of up to 40 individuals of P. bogaraveo were attracted to the bait and were shown in single frames. The individuals were observed both exploring the area and feeding actively on the bait. The European conger (Conger conger) was recorded at each deployment. Clear scavenger behaviour was also observed in this teleost fish and in the shark Etmopterus spinax. The shark species Centrophorus granulosus and Hexanchus griseus, which are considered ‘vulnerable’ on the published IUCN Mediterranean Regional Red List, were also recorded but, although attracted by the bait, they were never seen feeding on it.
