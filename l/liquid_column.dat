500|$|The Comcast Center is {{the tallest}} {{building}} built in America outside of New York City or Chicago since 1993. The [...] Comcast Center has 58 floors, of which 56 are occupiable. The {{structure of the}} Comcast Center comprises a central concrete core with steel-framed floors. The building's exterior features a glass curtain wall made of lightly tinted, non-reflective low-emissivity glass. The tower tapers inward towards the top and features two cutouts {{near the top of}} the building on the north and south sides. To prevent the tower from swaying too much in the wind, the Comcast Center contains a [...] double-chambered concrete tuned <b>liquid</b> <b>column</b> damper, the largest such damper in North America. Receiving a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating in April 2009, the Comcast Center is the tallest LEED building in Philadelphia. The building was designed to use 40 percent less water than a typical office building, and the plaza was designed to reduce heat-island effect from the pavement by 70 percent. Reducing air conditioning and lighting costs, the low-emissivity glass curtain wall blocks 60 percent of heat while allowing 70 percent of the Sun's light inside.|$|E
2500|$|In 1646, Blaise Pascal {{along with}} Pierre Petit, had {{repeated}} and perfected Torricelli's experiment after {{hearing about it}} from Marin Mersenne, who himself had been shown the experiment by Torricelli {{toward the end of}} 1644. Pascal further devised an experiment to test the Aristotelian proposition that it was vapors from the liquid that filled the space in a barometer. His experiment compared water with wine, and since the latter was considered more [...] "spiritous", the Aristotelians expected the wine to stand lower (since more vapors would mean more pushing down on the <b>liquid</b> <b>column).</b> Pascal performed the experiment publicly, inviting the Aristotelians to predict the outcome beforehand. The Aristotelians predicted the wine would stand lower. It did not.|$|E
50|$|A common {{apparatus}} used {{to demonstrate}} the first phenomenon is the capillary tube. When {{the lower end of}} a vertical glass tube is placed in a liquid, such as water, a concave meniscus forms. Adhesion occurs between the fluid and the solid inner wall pulling the <b>liquid</b> <b>column</b> up until there is a sufficient mass of liquid for gravitational forces to overcome these intermolecular forces. The contact length (around the edge) between the top of the <b>liquid</b> <b>column</b> and the tube is proportional to the radius of the tube, while the weight of the <b>liquid</b> <b>column</b> is proportional to the square of the tube's radius. So, a narrow tube will draw a <b>liquid</b> <b>column</b> higher than a wider tube will, given that the inner water molecules cohere sufficiently to the outer ones.|$|E

The temperatures in the <b>liquid</b> <b>columns</b> vary considerably with respect to position for pure conduction, free convection, and nucleate boiling cases using one-dimensional (1 D) thermal resistance networks. In the thermal resistance networks the solutions are not sensitive {{to the type of}} condensing and boiling heat transfer coefficients used. However, these networks are limited and give no indication of velocity distributions occurring within the liquor. To alleviate this issue, two-dimensional (2 D) axisymmetric and three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the test rigs have been performed. The axisymmetric conditions of the 2 D simulations produce unphysical solutions; however, the full 3 D simulations do not exhibit these behaviors. There is reasonable agreement for the predicted temperatures, heat fluxes, and heat transfer coefficients when comparing the boiling case of the 1 D thermal resistance networks and the CFD simulations...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, four {{commercial}} ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>columns</b> (SLB-IL 59, SLB-IL 76, SLB-IL 82 and SLB-IL 100) for gas chromatography have been comprehensively evaluated {{in terms of}} efficiency, polarity and solvation properties. Grob tests and McReynolds constants showed {{that they were all}} high-efficiency columns of high polarity, but with low inertness to compounds with hydrogen bonding capabilities. The solvation parameter model was used to characterize the solvation interactions of the four columns in the 80 - 160. °C temperature range. Results revealed that all the ionic liquids studied can be considered moderately hydrogen-bond acid and highly cohesive stationary phases, on which the dominant contributions to retention were the dipolar-type and hydrogen-bond base interactions, while π- π and n- π interactions were barely significant. The SLB-IL 59 column provided the best separation of homologs, while the SLB-IL 76 and SLB-IL 100 columns had the most basic and the most acidic phases, respectively. A principal component analysis for the commonly used stationary phases in capillary GC showed that these commercial ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>columns</b> fill an empty area of the available selectivity space, which clearly enhances the separation capacity of this technique. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} summarized, {{concerned}} with the statics of <b>liquid</b> <b>columns</b> in capillary tubes under non-standard conditions. Three configurations are considered: 1. inclined capillary tubes; 2. capillary effect in the horizontal branch of an L-shaped tube; 3. capillary columns in a vertical tube. The effect of inclination on capillary rise (1.) had already been explored in [1] using water in glass-tubes, and {{it was found that}} the vertical rise progressively reduces for increasing the tube inclination. This behavior is now confirmed for n-Hexadecane (C 16 H 34). For L-shaped capillaries (2.), the length of the horizontal branch of the tube occupied by the liquid is detected, as a function of the elevation of the branch itself over the feeding pool. The statics of suspended <b>liquid</b> <b>columns</b> (3.) is investigated for two configurations, namely: i. freely suspended columns, and, ii. edge-ending columns. In the latter case, the evaporation transient is also tracked. Even if the experimental basis is limited, the results are sufficient to highlight some of the peculiar features of the statics of capillary columns under the above conditions. In particular, it is shown that the contact angle hysteresis plays a fundamental role in all the cases considered...|$|R

In the LICOR experiment cylindrical <b>liquid</b> <b>columns</b> made of silicon oil (viscosity 9 cSt and 5 cSt) 30 mm in diameter and 49. 1, 47. 7, and 39. 7 mm in length were generated between coaxial circular disks. The columns were excited to vibrations by oscillating one of the disks sinusoidally (amplitude 1 mm or 0. 5 mm). A frequency ramp ranging from 0. 1 Hz to 5 Hz {{at a rate of}} 90 s/Hz was applied. During the experiment the outer shape of the column was observed by a CCD camera. Approximately 25000 video images were digitized and the diameters of the column in each image were determined at roughly 400 axial positions. The intensity of the vibrations as depending on the excitation frequency and the resonance frequencies were evaluated. The Fourier coefficients of the otuer shape of the columns were calculated to yield the resonance frequency by a second method. As third method for measuring the resonance frequencies tiny vibrations of the column excited by #mu#g disturbances were evaluated.
