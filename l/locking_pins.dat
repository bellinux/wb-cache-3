The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|E
25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side.

40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>lock</b> block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is installed, an apertured-end portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the locking pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|E
50|$|The Cam Profile Switching (CPS) {{system uses}} a tri-lobe {{camshaft}} to switch between two different cam profiles. One cam profile provides low valve lift, {{while the other}} cam profile has a high valve lift. The low valve lift cam profile is used at low to mid engine speeds to maintain idling quality and reduce emissions, while the high lift cam profile is used when the engine is spinning at mid to high engine speeds improve peak horsepower and torque. Unlike the other similar variable valve timing systems such as the Honda VTEC, the Toyota VVT-i and the Mitsubishi MIVEC which use rocker arm <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing, the CPS system uses direct-acting tappets with <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing and lift profile.|$|E
5000|$|Monolock Hinge: The {{purpose of}} this design {{is to create a}} lower profile receiver. The system {{integrates}} the hinge and locking system. The MonoLock Hinge pivots on significantly more surface area than guns with conventional low profile receivers. Rectangular <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> provide additional strength while a wear-in relief feature allows for wear without hindering lock-up.|$|E
40|$|A {{multifunction}} <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> is fabricated from a semi-flexible or elastic material. The <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> is {{also designed}} {{to function as}} a seal. The pin section serves especially to temporarily close up a threaded recess such as a drill hole. The deformable plastics pin effects a seal against the thread in the drill hole as the pin is screwed into the hole. USE - Multifunction blocking pin for use especially to temporarily close up and protect holes otherwise exposed to galvanic process. ADVANTAGE - Single-use pin is automatically inserted and provides low-cost system for protecting especially threaded components...|$|R

5000|$|The server itself {{might have}} <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> {{on the sides}} that just drop into slots on the {{extended}} rail assembly, {{in a manner similar}} to a removable kitchen drawer. This permits very easy server installation and removal since there is no need for the server to be held in midair while someone fastens each rail to the sides of the server with screws.|$|E
50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old <b>lock</b> <b>pins</b> with new <b>lock</b> <b>pins.</b> <b>Locks</b> are usually re keyed to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin sits flush with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the <b>lock</b> has 5 <b>pins.</b> Different brand <b>locks</b> each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them. Many manufacturers offer product specific manuals. Information disclosed in manufacturer manuals is often otherwise difficult to find, as is locksmith material in general.|$|R

50|$|The {{legs are}} then locked {{in place with}} <b>locking</b> <b>pins.</b> The {{carriage}} is lowered via the hydraulic jack so that the legs touch the ground; integral stakes are then hammered into the ground. At this point, the gun is ready for direct fire using the OP4 direct fire sight, or can be orientated and have its position fixed via the aiming circles for subsequent indirect fire using the Pantel sight.|$|E
50|$|The car {{was based}} on the XB Falcon 500 Hardtop and {{featured}} a 302 in³ (4.9 L) Cleveland V8, and some specific options including the GS Rally Pack which featured full dash instrumentation, a 3-spoke steering wheel, vented bonnet (hood) with <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> and 12-slot steel road wheels. A separate item featured on all John Goss Special hardtops were the cosmetic side body vents that were also a feature of contemporary Falcon GT hardtops.|$|E
50|$|During the {{investigation}} of the near-crash of Flight 96, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found that the DC-10's cargo door design was dangerously flawed. The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found {{that it was possible to}} close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. When the door blew out at altitude, the sudden decompression created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse. The collapse of the cabin floor severely damaged some of the vital flight control wires and hydraulic lines routed through the floor beams, which left the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Safe {{cracking}} {{is opening}} a safe without a combination or key. There are many methods to safe cracking ranging from brute force methods to guessing the combination. The easiest method {{that can be}} used on many safes is [...] "safe bouncing", which involves hitting the safe on top; this may cause the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> to budge, opening the safe.|$|R
50|$|At {{the summit}} on the {{northern}} side there is a concrete roofed bunker (now semi-collapsed), excavated into the rocky outcrop, in association with a pit with circular concrete base and an embedded metal cylinder stood vertical. The metal cylinder has a handle and <b>locking</b> <b>pin.</b> This device {{is thought to be}} associated with a fixed machine gun. The pit is semi-ringed with excavated earth/rock.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has {{experienced}} numerous {{problems in the}} past, due partly to its age, but mainly due to the increasing numbers of heavy goods vehicles and heavily laden farm vehicles which ignore the weight limit on the bridge. Issues have included the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> falling out of place, cracks forming in the supporting structure, and jamming of the swing mechanism, which has caused heavy traffic delays and tailbacks.|$|R
50|$|Name tags may be {{attached}} to garments with adhesive or worn {{with the assistance of}} a magnet or pin. Plastic or metal name tags can {{be attached}} to various backings used to attach to the clothing of the wearer. There are many types of name tag backings, including magnetic backings, <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> swivel clips, military clutch pins, alligator clips, and cell phone attachments. Magnetic backings, because they do not puncture clothing with pins, have recently become more popular for name tags. Some name tags are worn around the neck using a lanyard or necklace.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} features of the '71-'73 Mustangs is the optional (standard on Boss 351) NACA (NASA) hood design with dual scoops. Though available as a visual, non-functional item, they could be made fully functional on models ordered with the Ram Air option, which included vacuum controlled 'flaps' inside each scoop, and a fiberglass under-hood 'plenum' that directed cool, outside air through a modified, rubber-ringed air filter housing and into the carburetor. The ram-air option included a two-tone hood paint treatment in either 'matte black' or 'argent' (matte silver), coordinated to the base color of the Mach 1 and its decals and striping. In addition, all Ram Air-equipped Mustangs of this generation came equipped with twist-style, chrome-plated hood <b>locking</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E
50|$|When digging at a rock face, the {{operator}} simultaneously raises and extends the dipper stick {{to fill the}} bucket with material. When the bucket is full, the shovel is rotated to load a railway car or motor truck. The <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> on the bucket flap is released and the load drops away. The operator lowers the dipper stick, the bucket mouth self-closes, the pin relocks automatically and the process repeats.|$|R
50|$|A {{disc lock}} is a {{portable}} security device for motorcycles and scooters. Disc-locks use {{the holes in}} a motorcycle's or scooter's brake disc. A <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> passes {{through the hole in}} the brake disc and locks to the other side of the lock, using either a pushdown-and-click locking mechanism or a more robust double-locking mechanism. When in place, the disc-lock discourages theft by blocking the vehicle from being moved in either forward or reverse direction.|$|R
50|$|The lift span {{was left}} in situ for some years {{but in the end}} it too was demolished. Today the only {{reminders}} of the bridge are the eastern foot of the lifting section which is still in place, and the preserved <b>locking</b> <b>pin.</b> One of the pontoons was sunk at Alonnah, and remains in use as a public jetty. Another piece is sunk in Ralphs Bay, in about 40 feet of water.|$|R
5000|$|The control sticks {{are located}} {{conventionally}} {{in front of}} each seat. The standard throttle arrangement is one panel-mounted centre throttle, but a second throttle located {{on the left side of}} the panel is optional, allowing the left-seat pilot to fly with either hand on the throttle or stick. The wings are strut-braced with a single spar and are made from fibreglass and foam with a 15.5% CAGI.R3 airfoil. The wing has a span of 31 [...]5 feet and an area of 127.4 sq ft, which gives it a wing loading of 9.5 lbs/sq ft at gross weight. The aircraft has removable wings, with single <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> and quick-disconnect controls which can be easily hooked up and inspected from inside the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|Tatra {{differentials}} are {{a unique}} design that uses two opposing {{spiral bevel gears}} {{instead of the usual}} single set. The differential gears are part of the input drive shaft rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> that can force the differential gears to rotate together, “locking” the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the input drive shaft goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.|$|E
50|$|Following the Windsor {{accident}} investigation, the NTSB {{made several}} recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design {{to make it}} impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor so that, in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems. Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no airworthiness directive was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a gentlemen's agreement between the heads of the FAA, John H. Shaffer, and McDonnell Douglas, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.|$|E
40|$|An artificial, {{manually}} positionable {{elbow joint}} {{for use in}} an upper extremity, above-elbow, prosthetic is described. The prosthesis provides a locking feature that is easily controlled by the wearer. The instant elbow joint is very strong and durable enough to withstand the repeated heavy loadings encountered by a wearer who works in an industrial, construction, farming, or similar environment. The elbow joint of {{the present invention comprises}} a turntable, a frame, a forearm, and a locking assembly. The frame generally includes a housing for the locking assembly and two protruding ears. The forearm includes an elongated beam having a cup-shaped cylindrical member at one end and a locking wheel having a plurality of holes along a circular arc on its other end with a central bore for pivotal attachment to the protruding ears of the frame. The locking assembly includes a collar having a central opening with a plurality of internal grooves, a plurality of internal cam members each having a chamfered surface at one end and a V-shaped slot at its other end; an elongated <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> having a crown wheel with cam surfaces and locking lugs secured thereto; two coiled compression springs; and a flexible filament attached to one end of the elongated <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> and extending from the locking assembly for extending and retracting the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> into the holes in the locking wheel to permit selective adjustment of the forearm relative to the frame. In use, the turntable is affixed to the upper arm part of the prosthetic in the conventional manner, and the cup-shaped cylindrical member {{on one end of the}} forearm is affixed to the forearm piece of the prosthetic in the conventional manner. The elbow joint is easily adjusted and locked between maximum flex and extended positions...|$|R
