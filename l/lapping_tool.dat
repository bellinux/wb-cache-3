A brittle-ductile {{transition}} lapping {{mechanism is}} {{proposed for the}} mechanical lapping of ultra-precision diamond cutting tools, and then the critical depths of cut for brittle-ductile transition in different orientations and on different planes are deduced in theory.

40|$|Abstract. Lapping of plane {{surfaces}} is {{the technology}} which allows achieving high surface quality. Kinematics of lapping has {{the main effect}} on the flatness of active plane of the <b>lapping</b> <b>tools</b> {{as well as on}} the quality and flatness of the machined surface. Lapping machines can be used for grinding without the chuck-related problems as encountered in conventional surface grinding. The configuration of a conventional single-disk lapping machine was modified and the rotational velocity of a workpiece holder can be precisely controlled by a stepper motor. Two types of tools were used for experiments on a modified machine. The first tool was equipped with grinding inserts made of resin and synthetic diamond micrograins (grit size 3 / 2 µm). In the second stage of experiments the single-layer electroplated diamond tool (D 107 – grit size 106 / 90 µm) was applied. Ceramic workpieces (Al 2 O 3) were machined on the modified single-disc lapping machine with the use of both tools and with additional loose abrasive. Experimental results of removal rates, technological parameters and kinematical analysis are the subject of the presented paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} a new lapping ellipsoid method, {{which combines}} high-speed lapping technology with solid abrasives and <b>lapping</b> <b>tool</b> bending method. In this method, a bending moment is acted on <b>lapping</b> <b>tool</b> with solid abrasives, {{which makes it}} bend to form a shape on its working surface, {{which is the same}} as generant of workpiece shape. This kind tool is used in forming lapping on a high speed lapping machine. With the development of science and technology, the requirements for optics systems become higher and higher, e. g. good quality of imaging, little loss light energy, small size and light weight etc. It is difficult to reach above requirements by using traditional sphere lens/mirrors in optics systems. Aspheric optics elements can be used to solve these problems. In optics systems, by using aspheric optics elements, the number of optics elements can be reduced, the system structure can be simplified, the weight and size of the system can be reduced, light energy loss can be reduced too, imaging errors can be avoided and imaging quality can be improved. Ellipsoid is a kind of surface being used widely within all kinds of aspheric surfaces. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce a method of lapping this kind of surface at high speed. 1.

40|$|Most genome {{assemblers}} construct point estimates, {{choosing a}} genome sequence from among many alternative hypotheses that {{are supported by}} the data. We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to sequence assembly that instead generates distributions of assem-bly hypotheses with posterior probabilities, providing an explicit statistical framework for evaluating alternative hypotheses and assessing assembly uncertainty. We implement this approach in a prototype assembler and illustrate its application to the bacteriophage ΦX 174. Most current methods for de novo genome assembly generate point estimates of the genome sequence without explicit statistical information about confidence in this particular estimate, or its support relative to other alternative assemblies supported by the same sequence data 1. Recently, several probabilistic approaches have been proposed to quantify assembly certainty and address these limitations. The Computing Genome Assembly Likelihood (CGAL) tool approximates the likelihood of an assembly given the sequence reads and a generative model learned from the data 2; the Log Average Probability (<b>LAP)</b> <b>tool</b> approximates the likelihood under a similar model of sequence read generation 3; and the Assembly Likelihood Evaluation (ALE) framework uses an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the posterior probability of a particular assembly (or 1 a...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid the {{stochastic}} damage of micro cleavage on cutting edge, a brittle-ductile transition lapping mechanism is proposed for the mechanical lapping of single crystal diamond cutting tools to direct the <b>tools</b> <b>lapping.</b> As expected, the critical depths of cut for brittle-ductile transition in different orientations and on different crystal planes are calculated. According to the theoretical results, the actual dynamic depth of cut is controlled within the critical depth of cut, which ensures that the <b>tool</b> <b>lapping</b> is carried out in ductile regime and the changes of cutting edge radius characterize with some specific time laws in lapping. Therefore, the time series and nonlinear least square methods are used to analyze the changing laws of cutting edge radius. As a result, a coupled model to build a bridge between the cutting edge radius changes and lapping time is developed. In terms of this developed model, a required cutting edge radius restricts a <b>tool’s</b> <b>lapping</b> time. Above all, the cutting edge radius is known in advance and has no needs measuring. So the production efficiency of diamond cutting tools is improved and its production cost is reduced accordingly...|$|R

Ultrasonic vibration was given to a resin <b>lapping</b> <b>tool</b> which was formed around the middle part of a vibration rod. To expand the lapping area, a relative spiral motion was newly applied in this experiment between the resin tool and the metal mold. The effects of the mesh number(# 1500, # 3000, # 8000) of WA abrasive in slurry and the normal lapping force(1 N, 2 N, 3 N, 4 N, 5 N) onto the characteristics of surface roughness and lapping uniformity were elucidated.

40|$|The {{process of}} lapping has been long {{considered}} an art {{due to the}} tremendous amount of variability and subjectivity involved. The quality of lapping differs from operator to operator {{and the results are}} highly inconsistent. The material removal rate, surface finish, and flatness all depend on the proper control of lapping parameters such as lapping pressure, lapping speed of rotation, lap ring material, weight and size, abrasive size and type, workpiece material and hardness. To attain the desired outcomes, it is imperative to select proper values for the lapping control parameters. Moving the art of lapping into a science and quantifying the results can solve many of the above problems. In this research, a portable mechanical <b>lapping</b> <b>tool</b> was designed and tested along with manual lapping. Lapping processes were studied by conducting designed experiments, literature search, and consulting experts. The results from the experiments were explored in detail using various statistical techniques to explain the relationships among potential parameters and to see the possibility of lapping model development. A preliminary intelligent computerized lapping system (advisory system) was also developed as a framework for future work. Representative qualitative models and rules for lapping were proposed based on lapping literature and lapping experts' knowledge. However, {{it was found that the}} domain knowledge obtained from different sources was often clouded by imprecision and uncertainty, and the available data of manufacturing problems were frequently imprecise and incomplete. To overcome this problem, fuzzy logic concepts were applied in developing a protocol for the knowledge-based system.

40|$|The use of high-strength, {{lightweight}} composites for {{the fixture}} is the novel {{feature of this}} innovation. The main advantage is the light weight and high stiffness-to-mass ratio relative to aluminum. Meter-class optics require support during the grinding/polishing process with large tools. The use of aluminum as a polishing fixture is standard, with pitch providing a compliant layer to allow support without deformation. Unfortunately, with meter-scale optics, a meter-scale fixture weighs over 120 lb (. 55 kg) and may distort the optics being fabricated by loading the mirror and/or tool used in fabrication. The use of composite structures that are lightweight yet stiff allows standard techniques to be used while providing for a decrease in fixture weight by almost 70 percent. Mounts classically used to support large mirrors during fabrication are especially heavy and difficult to handle. The mount must be especially stiff to avoid deformation during the optical fabrication process, where a very large and heavy lap often can distort the mount and optic being fabricated. If the optic is placed {{on top of the}} <b>lapping</b> <b>tool,</b> the weight of the optic and the fixture can distort the lap. Fixtures to support the mirror during fabrication are often very large plates of aluminum, often 2 in. (. 5 cm) or more in thickness and weight upwards of 150 lb (68 kg). With the addition of a backing material such as pitch and the mirror itself, the assembly can often weigh over 250 lb (. 113 kg) for a meter-class optic. This innovation is the use of a lightweight graphite panel with an aluminum honeycomb core for use as the polishing fixture. These materials have been used in the aerospace industry as structural members due to their light weight and high stiffness. The grinding polishing fixture consists of the graphite composite panel, fittings, and fixtures to allow interface to the polishing machine, and introduction of pitch buttons to support the optic under fabrication. In its operation, the grinding polishing fixture acts as a reaction structure to the polishing tool. It must be stiff enough to avoid imparting a distorted shape to the optic under fabrication and light enough to avoid self-deflection. The fixture must also withstand significant tangential loads from the polishing machine during operations...|$|E

Therefore, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy was used to probe surface and subsurface impurities via the detection of aluminum.

In-depth measurements verify the presence of aluminum atoms in the bulk until a depth of several tens of microns for the edge region. In addition, atomic force microscopic measurements show that the surface roughness is larger in the center region compared to the edge.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{semi-automatic}} building extraction {{together with a}} concept for storing building models alongside with terrain data in a topographical information system (TIS) is presented. A user interface based on Constructive Solid Geometry is combined with an internal data structure completely based on boundary representation. Each building can be de-composed into a set of simple primitives which are reconstructed individually. After selecting a primitive from a data base of common building shapes, the primitive parameters can be modified by interactive measurement in digital images {{in order to provide}} approximate values for automatic fine measurement. In all phases, the properties of the boundary models are directly connected to parameter estimation: the parameters of the building primitives are determined in a hybrid adjustment of camera co-ordinates and fictitious observations of points being situated on building faces. Automatic fine measurement is an application of a general framework for object surface reconstruction using hierarchical feature based object space matching. The integration of object space into the matching process is achieved by the new modelling technique. The management of both building and terrain data in a TIS is based on a unique principle. Meta data are managed in a relational data base, whereas the actual data are treated as binary large objects.
