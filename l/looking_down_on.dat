5|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the square from above.|$|E

All {{during this time}} the enemy was <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the U.S. positions from Hill 192, and kept the U.S. units covered with continual harassing mortar, artillery, and long range machine gun fire.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that the design of the tomb {{monument}} itself, which was made almost a decade later, was by Jerôme's own hand. The monument is placed in an architectural frame of black and white marble and depicts Mary and Christ <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the effigy of the Bishop reclining on a sarcophagus. The portrait of the Bishop in the monument is particularly fine although some have compared it unfavourably with the earlier bust of the Bishop.|$|E

The Mogao Caves near Dunhuang in Gansu province, the Longmen Grottoes near Luoyang in Henan and the Yungang Grottoes near Datong in Shanxi are the most renowned examples from the Northern, Sui and Tang Dynasties.

The latter works its way around Lingmell to Wast Water through a {{spectacular}} ravine, one of the most impressive in the Lake District.

Broad Crag is a small top with its principal face on the west and the smaller Green Crag <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Little Narrowcove. From Broad Crag, the ridge turns briefly east across Ill Crag Col and onto the shapely pyramidal summit of Ill Crag.

25|$|Foster {{turned his}} attention, while the packinghouse {{campaign}} was still underway, to another project: organizing steel workers. The problems here {{were even more}} complex: {{in addition to the}} history of defeated strikes and the deep ethnic divisions within the workforce, the steel mills were also divided by differences in skills, with the higher paid native-born skilled workers often <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> their immigrant coworkers, who were often unskilled or semiskilled. Foster proposed a similar strategy, but on a much larger scale: a national campaign, led by a union council of all the craft unions and the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Tin and Steel Workers, that would organize all of basic steel simultaneously. Fitzpatrick agreed to put his name on the project and sent Foster as the CFL's delegate to the AFL's 1918 convention to present the plan.|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece {{measures}} 375 x 260cm {{when the}} shutters are closed. The upper panels contain lunettes showing prophets and Sibyls <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the annunciation; the lower tier shows the donors {{on the far}} left and right panels flanked by saints. The exterior panels are executed with relative sparseness in comparison to the often fantastical colour and abundance of the interior scenes. Their settings are earthly, pared down and relatively simple. Yet there is the same striking use of illusionism which also characterises the inner panels; {{this is especially true of}} the faux stone grisaille statues of the saints. Lighting is used to great effect to create the impression of depth; van Eyck handles the fall of light and casting of shadow to make the viewer feel as if the pictorial space is influenced or lit by light entering from the chapel in which he stands.|$|E

Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris. The German and Soviet pavilion sites were opposite each other.

According to later writer James Neff, [...] "When local government did not function, the Press struck with editorial might, {{even if it meant}} using a sledgehammer to crush a gnat.
