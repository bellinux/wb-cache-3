She also recorded songs for advertising the Happy fragrance by Clinique and deodorant Secret of the company Procter & Gamble.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

500|$|Garbage {{decided to}} take a hiatus in 2005, {{following}} the troubled production of their fourth studio album Bleed <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> cutting short the album's promotional tour.

Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever.

500|$|MTV {{said that}} [...] "Miles Away", the third single from the album, {{was the most}} deceptively simple track because {{although}} it appeared straightforward on the surface, {{it had a lot}} of technical tricks underneath it. The song departs from the dance theme of the album and deals with the difficulties of long-distance relationships. [...] "Miles Away" [...] is a melancholy electronic ballad, which, according to Madonna is autobiographical, and is inspired by her then husband Guy Ritchie. The relationship themed lyrics continue in the next track [...] "She's Not Me", which talks about Madonna being emulated by another woman, hence she utters the line [...] "She started dressing <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> talking like me, It freaked me out, She started calling you {{up in the middle of}} the night, What's that about?" ...|$|E

500|$|A second {{version of}} the video (known as the Sugar Lumps version), which adds the Sugar Lumps—a satirical {{version of the}} Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu, and Jennifer Saunders—was filmed for the [...] "Red Nose Day" [...] of the 1997 Comic Relief, {{one of the two}} {{high-profile}} telethon events held in the United Kingdom. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls dreaming of becoming Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-synching the song. Halliwell commented about the shoot: [...] "The women were all really warm and funny and nice. The freakiest thing about it was seeing Jennifer Saunders. She looked just <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> everyone said they thought she was me. It was alsolutely bizarre–the make-up, everything. It was scary–like, do I really do that?".|$|E
500|$|Garbage {{launched}} the Bleed Like Me World Tour promoting the record on March 29, 2005, with {{a concert in}} Paris. The tour visited North America, Europe and Australia, and encompassed headline performances, rock festivals, and television and radio shows. Former Jane's Addiction bassist Eric Avery left Alanis Morissette's backing band to perform with Garbage for the tour. Matt Walker played drums in the August 22 concert in Chicago because Vig had to depart for his mother's funeral. After being initially organized low-key, the tour was moved into large venues when Bleed <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> its lead single [...] "Why Do You Love Me" [...] became surprise hits outside the U.S. In September, the band canceled concerts planned for the following month in Europe, and released a press statement saying that the band members had overextended themselves. The tour concluded with a concert in Perth, Australia on October 1, {{after six months of}} concerts.|$|E
500|$|Olivier's acting {{technique}} was minutely crafted, {{and he was}} known for changing his appearance considerably from role to role. By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up, and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents. His own description of his {{technique was}} [...] "working from the outside in"; he said, [...] "I can never act as myself, I {{have to have a}} pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig... I cannot come on looking <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> be someone else." [...] Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier [...] "built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details". This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, [...] "When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. I want an actor to tell me Lear's time of day and Olivier doesn't. He bids me watch the wheels go round." ...|$|E

500|$|Stan Lee tweeted in February 2010 that Marvel was {{prepping}} {{the film}} and that he met with Wright for lunch to discuss the character. Wright noted {{that there was no}} timetable for the film because Marvel did not consider the character to be one of their bigger, tentpole properties, so [...] "It's more <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Kevin Feige saying...'Let's make a good script that works, that's all about a great genre film, and that isn't necessarily relying on anything else'". At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright said that Ant-Man would not fit in the chronology of The Avengers due to the origin story he had written not working in the MCU. In January 2011, Wright stated that he had resumed writing the script for the film following the conclusion of the international promotion for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and by April he and Cornish delivered the second draft of Ant-Man to Marvel. At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright revealed a third draft had been handed in.|$|E
500|$|The trio {{embarked}} on a European tour the following fall, during which DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life. [...] "It became [...] we weren't a band, it wasn't {{the three of us}} working together for a goal," [...] said Hoppus, [...] "it was <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Travis having to pull his along, and be like, 'Come on, let's go, let's do this that we all created and that we love.'" [...] DeLonge eventually expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring in order {{to spend more time with}} family. Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break. In addition, DeLonge was not fond of Barker's new reality television series, Meet the Barkers; he disliked television cameras everywhere, feeling as though his personal privacy was invaded. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, DeLonge agreed to perform at Music for Relief's Concert for South Asia, a benefit show to aid victims. Further arguments ensued during rehearsals, rooted in the band member's increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another. DeLonge asserted he would only record another album at his home in San Diego, suggesting he mail Pro Tools files back and forth to Hoppus and Barker in Los Angeles. The duo were flexible regarding DeLonge's time off, but became angry when he began deciding [...] "when we can and can't tour, when and how we can record." ...|$|E

[...] "I want people to <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> the people who play my friends, and not everybody else" [...] she said.
