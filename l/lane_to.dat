5|$|Historically, the Bedford Estate {{defined the}} {{boundary}} of Covent Garden, with Drury <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin's <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of Covent Garden has expanded northwards past Long Acre to High Holborn. Since 1971, {{with the creation of}} the Covent Garden Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin's Lane and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the main thoroughfare, running north-east from St Martin's <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> Drury Lane. Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} season in {{succession}} {{the highlights of the}} fixture list were the games against local rivals The Wednesday, with a record 22,900 supporters attending Bramall <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> see the Blades record a 5–0 victory at the end of October. Just under a month later United lost the return fixture at Olive Grove 4–1 in front of a more modest crowd of just under 12,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Wilson {{appointed}} <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> the Council of National Defense (CND), {{where he}} urged {{cooperation between the}} private and public sectors. He defused a difficult situation for the CND when it decided to merge its male-dominated state and local organizations with the separate Women's Committee into a unified Field Division. Lane headed the Division, leading a board of five men and five women.|$|E

5|$|St Mary's Church is an Anglican {{church at}} the end of a <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> the south of the village of Nether Alderley, Cheshire, England. It dates from the 14thcentury, with later {{additions}} and a major restoration in the late-19thcentury. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated GradeI listed building.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} workers' cottages {{along the path}} from Mareham <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> the {{industrial}} site; each are Grade II listed. The complex's offices, storage depot, weigh offices, cartsheds, gateways, walls and mess rooms are also listed at the same grade.|$|E
5|$|Working {{closely with}} {{international}} engineering and design consultants Arup, The L Trust held {{a series of}} public consultations during May and June 2012, providing information to local communities about plans for obtaining a TWO, and the next phase of the reinstatement, south-west from Killington <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> Blackmoor, then Wistlandpound, and north-east to Caffyns, and eventually to Lynton.|$|E

50|$|Eastbound at Mannheim Road (exit 17), {{the highway}} splits into two express and one local lane; they {{are joined by}} two onramps from I-88 and form express lanes three lanes wide and local <b>lanes</b> <b>to</b> Mannheim Road two lanes wide. After Mannheim Road, the highway {{immediately}} narrows <b>to</b> three <b>lanes</b> in width, causing mile-long (1.6 km) backups. It remains three <b>lanes</b> <b>to</b> Austin Boulevard. Westbound, I-290 merely is three <b>lanes</b> wide <b>to</b> Mannheim Road, and then four <b>lanes</b> wide <b>to</b> the I-88/I-290 split. Exits at Harlem Avenue (exit 21B) and Austin Boulevard (exit 23) are Inverted single-point urban interchanges (inverted SPUIs), with left offramps and onramps. These cause backups as trucks switch <b>lanes</b> <b>to</b> exit, and a {{large volume of traffic}} enters {{on the left side of}} the highway.|$|R

5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted that serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, traffic {{had reached}} 172,300vehicles a day, which had {{increased}} by nearly 10percent {{over the previous}} year. It was hoped that the construction of SR52 would help to reduce the congestion. A revised Mission Gorge Road eastbound exit opened in 1979, merging with traffic from I-15. Traffic reached 212,000vehicles a day by February1981, and Caltrans declared I-8 east of I-805 the busiest highway in the region. In 1987, Caltrans determined that I-8 west between College Avenue and Waring Road had the highest ratio of cars to number of lanes worldwide, at 2400cars per hour. Plans to add another <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> I-8 west from College Avenue to I-15 began in March1992.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{travelled}} to White Hart <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> face Tottenham Hotspur in {{the sixth}} round. The team finished the tie as comfortable 4–0 winners, never looking as though they would crumble once William Gallas scored inside 12 minutes. The one negative from their performance was the dismissal of Graeme Le Saux for a second bookable offence in the second half. Local rivals Fulham were Chelsea's semi-final opponents. A scrappy match, which saw Fulham dominate much of the play but creating little, was settled in Chelsea's favour. Terry scored just before half time, heading the ball through the legs of Louis Saha standing in Fulham's goal.|$|E

Carr Hill was part of County Durham until it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972. It is now bordered by settlements which are also part of the metropolitan borough. These are Sheriff Hill to the south, Deckham to the west, Felling to the north and Windy Nook to the east.|$|E
5|$|Erica Durance plays Lois Lane, Chloe's {{cousin who}} comes to Smallville to {{investigate}} Chloe's supposed death and stays with the Kents. Durance, a recurring guest in season four, became a series regular. The producers wanted to bring Lois <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> the series, and Chloe's supposed death in the season-three finale provided the opportunity. Durance was cast three days before filming began; although she could initially appear in only four episodes, according to the film division of Warner Bros., after negotiations her character was cleared for more appearances.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Lane {{returned}} to San Francisco {{to open the}} Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The President was supposed to open the fair, {{but was unable to}} attend, and sent the Interior Secretary in his place. In 1916, Wilson appointed <b>Lane</b> <b>to</b> lead the American delegation and meet with the Mexican commissioners at Atlantic City, New Jersey about the unstable military situation in Mexico. These negotiations led to the withdrawal of United States troops from Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Jamie McMurray {{took the}} lead by the 53rd lap, when a third caution was {{deployed}} after Reutimann's right-rear tire blew on the backstretch, causing Gordon to take evasive action by turning right and heavily damaged the nose of his car when he collided with the outside wall. Reutimann's tire broke Johnson's front splitter brace. All drivers, including McMurray, chose to make pit stops. Vickers elected {{to stay on the}} track and led the field at the restart on lap 58, ahead of Kvapil and Skinner. Two laps later, Hamlin used the draft to take over the lead, with Labonte moving into second. Kahne used the outside <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> claim first position, before Reed Sorenson also drove on the outside <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> claim first place on the next lap. The pack drove three abreast on lap 63, as Truex moved into first place on the 64th lap. McMurray reclaimed the first position when he got ahead of Truex at the start-finish line on lap 65, and Kahne dropped to 26th position by the same lap. Truex re{{took the lead}} from McMurray {{at the start of the}} following lap, and Harvick moved into first on lap 67.|$|E
5|$|On- and off-ramps project northward from Eastern Avenue, each {{adding a}} <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> both carriageways. The {{expressway}} continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between {{the highway and}} Bayview Avenue. The Parkway passes beneath Dundas and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the 'Don Flats' plateau at Riverdale Park. In this section, the elevation of the highway {{is close to the}} level of the river and is liable to flood after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example.|$|E
5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E

5|$|The circuit {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> allow drivers more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E
5|$|The disproportion was {{so great}} at parting, {{that it was almost}} impossible, in Drury <b>Lane,</b> <b>to</b> muster up a {{sufficient}} number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} in maximum bandwidth {{is achieved by}} raising the lane speed from 6 Gbit/s to 12 Gbit/s and {{increasing the number of}} AV data lanes from 3 to 4 (i.e. using all 4 lanes to carry data). The data lanes runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the clock signal in itself. This allows the clock <b>lane</b> <b>to</b> be used for data (in addition to the existing three data lanes). The lane data structure has been changed to a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|E
