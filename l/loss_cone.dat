We propose a method for estimating the unknown parameters in the model by utilizing pre-existing data from psychophysical experiments on unilateral dichromats. The model is validated using this existing data and by using predictions on known test images for detecting dichromacy. Using the model and analysis we evaluate the feasibility of <b>cone</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>cone</b> replacement hypotheses that have previously been proposed for modeling dichromatic color vision.

As a result, the occupation number within the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> is significantly smaller than outside. Classical diffusive treatment of this regime predict exponentially small occupation number deep in the <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> We revisit this classical derivation of occupancy distribution of objects in the empty <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> regime. We emphasize the role of the rare large scatterings and show that the occupancy does not decay exponentially within the <b>loss</b> <b>cone,</b> but it is rather flat, with a typical value ∼ [(j_d/j_ lc) ]^ 2 ^- 2 (j_ lc/j_) compared to the occupation in circular angular momentum (where j_ is the smallest possible scattering). Implication are that although the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> for tidal break of Giants or binaries is typically empty, tidal events which occurs significantly inside the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> (β≳ 2), are almost as common as those with β 1 where β is the ratio between the tidal radius and the periastron.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the possible diurnal modulation of outer radiation belt electron precipitation {{by considering the}} effect of the convection electric field on geomagnetically trapped electrons. The modulation flux is the flux due to electrons in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone,</b> i. e., those which drift into the bounce <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> The electron flux in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> is related to the time allowable for diffusion from the stably trapped population to the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> for precipitation at a specific geographic location. This time, which is termed the maximum L-shell lifetime, is obtained by computing electron trajectories, using a realistic magnetic field model and a simple model for the electric field. The maximum L-shell lifetimes are taken to be the times between successive entries into the bounce <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> Conservation of the first two adiabatic invariants, as electrons are slowly energized by the convection electric field, leads to variations in pitch angle, maximum L-shell lifetimes, and, consequently, to changes in the electron flux in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> These results are compared with observations of precipitating electrons made with sounding rocket payloads...|$|E

30|$|The {{second type}} of event, with an {{apparent}} upward-going conic (58 % of observations), has a similar <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> to the first, but with enhanced flux surrounding this <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> The flux enhancement consists of “wings” on the upward-going half of the distribution extending in the perpendicular velocity direction, suggestive of perpendicular heating of the electrons. As above, the width and depth of the observed <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> varies {{among the members of}} this population, but the form of the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> and the apparent oblique flux enhancement remains very consistent in the solar wind frame. The energy dependent <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> clearly appears in all frames, indicating a truly energy-dependent reflection process. The conic, on the other hand, appears more prominently in the solar wind frame than the dHT frame, indicating that it arises partly from reflection from a moving obstacle, as also observed in the terrestrial foreshock (Fitzenreiter et al., 1990). In essence, the conic results partially from the parallel translation in velocity space of a <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> distribution. However, a weak conic signature also remains in the dHT frame, possibly indicating that some other heating process operates. Alternatively, this signature could result from errors in our frame transformation over crustal magnetic fields or from non-adiabatic effects resulting from the small spatial scale of the reflection region.|$|E
40|$|Context. Collapsing {{magnetic}} traps (CMTs) {{have been}} suggested as one possible mechanism responsible for the acceleration of high-energy particles during solar flares. An important question regarding the CMT acceleration mechanism is which particle orbits escape and which are trapped during the time evolution of a CMT. While some models predict the escape {{of the majority of}} particle orbits, other more sophisticated CMT models show that, in particular, the highest-energy particles remain trapped at all times. The exact prediction is not straightforward because both the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> angle and the particle orbit pitch angle evolve in time in a CMT. Aims. Our aim is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the conditions leading to either particle orbit escape or trapping in CMTs. Methods. We present a detailed investigation of the time evolution of particle orbit pitch angles in the CMT model of Giuliani and collaborators and compare this with the time evolution of the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> angle. The non-relativistic guiding centre approximation is used to calculate the particle orbits. We also use simplified models to corroborate the findings of the particle orbit calculations. Results. We find that there is a critical initial pitch angle for each field line of a CMT that divides trapped and escaping particle orbits. This critical initial pitch angle is greater than the initial <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> angle, but smaller than the asymptotic (final) <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> angle for that field line. As the final <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> angle in CMTs is larger than the initial <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> angle, particle orbits with pitch angles that cross into the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> during their time evolution will escape whereas all other particle orbits are trapped.
