50|$|<b>Leonardite</b> {{is used to}} {{stabilise}} {{and thin}} fluids used in the drilling of wells for hydrocarbon exploration/extraction and geothermal drilling. It was first employed extensively during World War II when quebracho became difficult to obtain. It has very good temperature stability and prevents solidification of lime muds near 150 °C.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used to}} {{condition}} soils either by applying it directly to the land, or by providing a source of humic acid or potassium humate for application. The carbon geosequestration potential of <b>Leonardite,</b> particularly to rapidly accelerate microbial action to lock up and retain carbon in soils, provides the basis for extensive research in Victoria on the organic fertilising aspect of brown coal.|$|E
50|$|Although xyloid lignite may {{sometimes}} have the tenacity {{and the appearance}} of ordinary wood, {{it can be seen that}} the combustible woody tissue has experienced a great modification. It is reducible to a fine powder by trituration, and if submitted to the action of a weak solution of potash, it yields a considerable quantity of humic acid. <b>Leonardite</b> is an oxidized form of lignite, which is also contains high levels of humic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leonardite</b> is a soft waxy, {{black or}} brown, shiny, {{vitreous}} mineraloid that is easily soluble in alkaline solutions. It is an oxidation product of lignite, associated with near-surface mining. It {{is a rich}} source of humic acid (up to 90%) and is used as a soil conditioner, as a stabilizer for ion-exchange resins in water treatment, in the remediation of polluted environments and as a drilling additive. It was named after A. G. Leonard, first director of the North Dakota Geological Survey, in recognition of his work on these deposits.|$|E
50|$|Potassium humate is the {{potassium}} salt of humic acid. It is manufactured commercially by alkaline extraction of brown coal (lignite) <b>Leonardite</b> {{to be used}} mainly as a soil conditioner. The extraction is performed in water {{with the addition of}} potassium hydroxide (KOH), sequestering agents and hydrotropic surfactants. Heat is used to increase the solubility of humic acids and hence more potassium humate can be extracted. The resulting liquid is dried to produce the amorphous crystalline like product which can then be added as a granule to fertiliser. The potassium humate granules by way of chemical extraction lose their hydrophobic properties and are now soluble. Depending on the source material product quality varies. High quality oxidised lignite (brown coal), usually referred to as <b>leonardite,</b> is the best source material for extraction of large quantities of potassium humate. The less oxidised the coal the less potassium humate extracted. Sources low in ash produce the best quality. Less oxidised brown coal contains a higher proportion of the insoluble humin fraction and along with peat which is lower in humic acid content and usually high in ash content requires separation by filtration or centrifugation to remove ash, humin. Peat is also high in non humified organic matter that needs to be reduced to produce a high quality product. The benefit of peat is that it is usually 2-3 times higher in fulvic acid content, which are the low molecular weight fractions of humic acid that are high in oxygen containing functional groups and soluble at a low pH of <1. Fulvic acids have a higher cation exchange capacity and therefore have a higher chemical interaction with fertilisers and are able to form soluble chelates of trace metals.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>leonardite</b> {{application}} with fertilizer-N and P doses on climbing bean yield and soil properties were studied during 2003 and 2004 years. The experiment was conducted as a randomized split-plot design with three replications. Soil EC (electrical conductivity), pH and lime {{did not change}} significantly at the application of <b>leonardite.</b> The differences between soil organic matter (OM) and phosphorus (P) contents at <b>leonardite</b> treatments compared with control treatment (no <b>leonardite)</b> were significant at p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 05 levels, respectively, but significant effects between <b>leonardite</b> treatments were not obtained. Marketable bean yield was greater in T 2 treatment(recommended fertilizer plus 10 Mg ha - 1 <b>leonardite)</b> than that of T 1 treatment (control plot; recommended fertilizer doses) and this difference between T 2 and T 1 treatments was significant at p< 0. 05 levels. Marketable bean yields in the half of the recommended fertilizer dose plus 1 Mg ha - 1 <b>leonardite</b> dose (T 4) and 20 Mg ha - 1 <b>leonardite</b> doses (T 5) treatments were higher observed compared with T 1 treatment.

40|$|Coriolus versicolor has {{previously}} been shown to degrade <b>leonardite,</b> an oxidized form of lignite. An extracellular fraction containing protein purified from a C. versicolor culture solubilized <b>leonardite</b> in vitro. Expression of the activity did not require the presence of <b>leonardite</b> and appeared during idiophase. During ion-exchange and gel filtration column chromatography, leonardite-biosolubilizing activity eluted with syringaldazine oxidase activity and with protein, as measured by A 280 and the biuret protein assay. Syringaldazine is a substrate of the polyphenol oxidase formed by C. versicolor. Comparison of leonardite-biosolubilizing activity {{with the effects of}} chelators and surface-active agents on <b>leonardite</b> showed that biosolubilization was not due to either surfactant or chelating ability. Heat treatment of the preparation at 60 °C for 30 min significantly reduced both syringaldazine oxidase and leonardite-biosolubilizing activities. Cyanide, azide, and thioglycolate, which are known inhibitors of syringaldazine oxidase activity of C. versicolor, also inhibited <b>leonardite</b> biosolubilization. From these data, we conclude that the purified protein fraction from C. versicolor contains a syringaldazine oxidase activity that participates in <b>leonardite</b> biosolubilization by enzymatic action...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} slow release fertilizers by using <b>Leonardite</b> and Zeolite. Two formulations of slow release fertilizer were prepared namely the <b>Leonardite</b> and Zeolite slow release fertilizer and the <b>Leonardite</b> slow release fertilizer. Theirnutrient releasing rates were investigated and comparedwith {{that of the}} commercially availableslow release fertilizer which contained N 8 :P 24 :K 24. Specifically the slow release fertilizers were formulated from <b>leonardite,</b> zeolite and other fertilizer materials such as ammonium phosphate and potassium chloride. Each formulation was then pelletized and baked at 100 °C for 1 hr to remove water; then they were kilned at 150 °C for 1 hr. All the kilned fertilizers were analyzed subsequently by using the Fertilizer Test Kit (KU. 5) to determine the releasing rates of the main N, P and K nutrients. Each fertilizer was immersed in distilled water and shakenat the speed of 150 rpm for 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr and 2 hr.

40|$|Lignosulfonate-humate a and lignosulfonate-humate b, {{derived by}} an {{industrial}} process from lignin, were studied chemically and biologically, {{and their effects}} on maize metabolism compared with the responses induced by humic substances obtained from <b>leonardite.</b> Lignosulfonate-humate a and lignosulfonate-humate b elicited hormonelike activity and <b>leonardite</b> displayed giberellin properties. To improve our understanding of their biological action, lignosulfonate-humate a, lignosulfonatehumate b and <b>leonardite</b> were supplied to maize plants and their effect was studied on growth, nitrogen metabolism and photosynthesis. All products increased root and leaf growth. Glutamine-synthetase, glutamate-synthase enzyme activities and protein content were all increased. The treatments also increased chlorophyll content, glucose, fructose and rubisco enzyme activity, suggesting a positive role of lignosulfonate-humate a, lignosulfonate-humate b and <b>leonardite</b> in the photosynthetic process. In addition, an increase in phenol content was observed. In light of these results, being environmentally friendly products, lignosulfonate-humate a and lignosulfonate-humate b {{could be used to}} increase crop yield...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} our {{laboratory}} used a spectrophotometric assay to study biomimetic solubilization of <b>leonardite</b> by sodium oxalate.

This problem {{did not appear to}} be significant for short term incubations (ie., up to - 24 h) and was circumvented in long term incubations by using a gravimetric assay to assay for solubilization. In other studies during this reporting period we examined oxalate production by P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor grown in Fahreus-Reinhammar medium in agitated pelleted culture. It was found that in this system concentrations of oxalate are produced that are much lower than those that would be optimal for <b>leonardite</b> solubilization...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES:The {{effects of}} two humate {{products}} {{were compared to}} that of prednisolone on a contact hypersensitivity rat model. METHODS: Rats, sensitized with dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), were placed on a daily oral treatment of 61 mg/kg BW of humate derived from either <b>leonardite</b> or bituminous coal or on prednisolone at one mg/kg BW and challenged 6 days later with a topical application of DNFB to the right ear. The inflamed ears were measured daily. In a toxicity study rats were exposed to daily oral treatment of <b>leonardite</b> humate at 1, 000 mg/kg BW for 1 month. A teratogenicity study was done where pregnant rats were treated with 500 mg/kg BW on days 5 to 17 of pregnancy. RESULTS: Only the <b>leonardite</b> humate compared favourably with prednisolone in suppressing contact hypersensitivity. No signs of toxicity were observed and weight gain was normal during the 6 -day and 1 month treatments and during the teratogenicity study with the <b>leonardite</b> humate. However, the rats on the other two products experienced slower weight gain. CONCLUSION: The identification of a naturally occurring nontoxic compound with anti-inflammatory activity is exciting and merits further evaluation in the treatment of patients suffering from inflammatory conditions...|$|E
40|$|Three humic acids (HA) extracted, respectively, from a {{volcanic}} soil, a North Dakota <b>Leonardite,</b> and an oxidised coal and their hydrolysed products obtained after acidic hydrolysis, were studied for their interaction with atrazine. Adsorption kinetics showed that HA from oxidised coal {{had the highest}} capacity of adsorbing atrazine (84 %) followed in order by HAs from <b>Leonardite</b> (45. 3 %) and volcanic soil (31. 7 %). A reverse order is shown by the hydrolysed products, HA from volcanic soil being the highest adsorber (69. 2 %) followed by <b>Leonardite</b> HA (45. 6 %) and by oxidised coal HA (27 %). Desorption kinetics, mass balance extractions and adsorption isotherms confirmed these results. Characterization by 13 C NMR indicated that humic acid aromaticity decreased and aliphaticity increased in the order: oxidised coal, <b>Leonardite,</b> and volcanic soil. Chemical characterization showed that total, carboxylic, and phenolic acidities increased after hydrolysis for all HAs and failed to explain the observed differences in atrazine adsorption. Molecular weight distribution by gel permeation chromatography showed that the structural modifications induced by hydrolysis are able to explain the different adsorbing capacities of HA samples. Molecular dimension and concentration of chromophore groups seemed to govern atrazine adsorption. These results indicate that (1) atrazine is mainly adsorbed through a charge-transfer mechanism between electron-poor groups of HAs and electron-rich atoms in atrazine and (2) more atrazine is adsorbed the higher the aromaticity, the polycondensation, and the molecular size of HAs...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} lignin {{degrading}} fungi mediate solubilization and subsequent biodegradation of coal macromolecules (a. k. a. coal polymer) from highly oxidized low rank coals such as leonardites. It appears that oxalate or possibly other metal chelators (i. e., certain Krebs Cycle intermediates) mediate solubilization of low rank coals while extracellular oxidases {{have a role}} in subsequent oxidation of solubilized coal macromolecule. These processes are under nutritional control. For example, in the case of P. chrysosporium, solubilization of <b>leonardite</b> occurred when the fungi were cultured on most but not all nutrient agars tested and subsequent biodegradation occurred only in nutrient nitrogen limited cultures. Lignin peroxidases mediate oxidation of coal macromolecule in a reaction that is dependent on the presence of veratryl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. Kinetic evidence suggests that veratryl alcohol is oxidized to the veratryl alcohol cation radical which then mediates oxidation of the coal macromolecule. Results by others suggest that Mn peroxidases mediate formation of reactive Mn{sup 3 +} complexes which also mediate oxidation of coal macromolecule. A biomimetic approach was used to study solubilization of a North Dakota <b>leonardite.</b> It was found that a concentration {approximately} 75 mM sodium oxalate was optimal for solubilization of this low rank coal. This is important because this is well above the concentration of oxalate produced by fungi in liquid culture. Higher local concentrations probably occur in solid agar cultures and thus may account for the observation that greater solubilization occurs in agar media relative to liquid media. The characteristics of biomimetically solubilized <b>leonardite</b> were similar to those of biologically solubilized <b>leonardite.</b> Perhaps our most interesting observation was that in addition to oxalate, other common Lewis bases (phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate and bicarbonate/carbonate ions) are able to mediate substantial solubilization of <b>leonardite</b> at physiological pH values. Lastly, we present evidence that some fungi appear to possess coal solubilization ability in which the initial events of solubilization is not mediated by oxalate ion...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the antimutagenic and antitoxic effects exerted by humic substances (HSs) of different origin (Mollisols, <b>leonardite,</b> river sediments, peat, aquatic sediments, hill soils and alluvial soils) on eleven plant species (Vicia faba, Allium cepa, Pisum sativum, Triticum turgidum var. durum [T. durum], Phaseolus vulgaris, Brassica napus var. oleifera, Sinapis alba, Linum usitatissimum, Lycopersicon esculentum, Cucumis melo and Helianthus annuus) treated with different mutagenic and phytotoxic compounds (maleic hydrazide, colchicine, alachlor, 2, 4 -D and glyphosate). Results showed that the HSs samples have an apparent antimutagenic action in the plant species which differs in intensity and type of genetic damage that is reduced {{as a function of the}} source and dose of HS applied, plant species and mutagen used. The largest antimutagenic effect was obtained for HS of aquatic, peat and <b>leonardite</b> sources in V. faba and A. cepa treated with mutagen maleic hydrazide.

40|$|During this {{reporting}} period we have further studied the oxidation of soluble coal macromolecules by lignin peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Previous studies by others {{have suggested that}} a soluble fraction (coal macromolecule B- 111) from a nitric acid solubilized North Dakota Lignite is depolymerized by this enzyme. Our investigations indicate that fraction B- 111 is a substrate for lignin peroxidase as this material is decolorized {{in the presence of}} lignin peroxidase H 8 and hydrogen peroxide. Of interest, however, is the observation that little, if any, depolymerization of this material occurs. Instead, it appears that lignin peroxidase and coal macromolecule B- 111 form a precipitate. These results are similar to those observed in our investigations of lignin peroxidase mediated oxidation of oxalate solubilize coal macromolecule. Previous studies in our laboratory using a spectrophotometric assay suggested that, in addition to oxalate, several other fungal metabolites are able to solubilize <b>leonardite.</b> We have reinvestigated this phenomenon using a more reliable gravimetric procedure for assessing solubilization. Our results confirm our earlier findings that malate, oxaloacetate and citrate are effective solubilizing agents whereas succinate, fumarate and x-ketoglutarate solubilize relatively small amounts of <b>leonardite.</b> Finally, we have studied the composition of the insoluble material remaining following extensive solubilization by sodium oxalate. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon is increased in the insoluble material relative to the parent <b>leonardite.</b> However, the ratio of oxygen to carbon is also increased in the insoluble material.

Applied at low concentration (10 ppm) HS stimulated especially primary root growth. But at high concentration (100 ppm), LHS inhibited root formation of alder, while birch was more tolerant. The application of 100 ppm of HHS, did not affect alder root growth but increased root growth in birch. Humic acids fractions (HA) were favorable and improved root growth while, fulvic acids (FA) and other molecules (OM) decreased significantly root growth, especially those extracted LHS. The root inhibition expressed at high LHS concentration {{may be due to}} the presence of different toxic molecules and root growth inhibitors in OM and FA fractions and that some of them remained in the OM fraction from <b>leonardite.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
