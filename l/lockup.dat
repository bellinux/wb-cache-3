5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid system failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre <b>lockup</b> into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually {{take place on}} Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake <b>lockup</b> at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} breakup {{fees and}} stock <b>lockups</b> as devices for prospective target firms to encourage bidder participation in takeover contest. We show that, unless bidding {{costs for the}} first bidder are too high, breakup fees provide for the socially desirable degree of competition and ensure the efficient allocation of the target to the highest valued buyer in a takeover auction. In contrast, stock <b>lockups</b> permit the target firm to subsidize entry of a new bidder {{at the expense of}} an incumbent bidder. Stock <b>lockups</b> induce too much competition when offered to a second bidder and too little competition when offered to a first bidder. Despite their socially wasteful properties, target management would favor stock <b>lockups</b> as they induce takeover competition at least cost to the target...|$|R

On 1 June 1866 a bushranging gang consisting of the Clarke brothers, Patsy Connell and two accomplices held up Michelago town (which then consisted of Thomas Kennedy's Hibernian Hotel, a police station and <b>lockup,</b> Abraham Levy's store, a Church of England schoolhouse, a Catholic church and a few houses) and drank its entire liquor supply before staggering off to their rocky hide-out called 'Beefcask' in the Tinderrys.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lockups</b> are {{designed}} to prevent insiders from liquidating assets too quickly after a company goes public. When employees and pre-IPO investors initially get their shares or options, they sign {{a contract with the}} company that typically prohibits trades for the first 90-180 days after a future IPO. When the company is ready to go public, the underwriting bank then reaffirms the existing agreements in new contracts. This helps to ensure the market will not disproportionately increase the supply, which drives prices downward. While <b>lockups</b> used to be simple—usually lasting 180 days for everyone—they have become increasingly complex.|$|R

40|$|Using adult {{jails and}} <b>lockups</b> for {{confining}} youths {{is a major}} issue in juvenile justice. Proponents of removing children from these facilities are concerned with the conditions of confinement, the. ate of suicide among youths held in adult facilities, the excessive use of secure confinement for youths, and the legal liability of jurisdictions that hold juveniles in adult facilities. Nebraska has made significant progress in reducing the number of youths confined in adult jails and <b>lockups,</b> but has yet to pass legislation or develop programs and facilities to complete the task.

25|$|In 1966 it {{was decided}} that the Town Hall Station could not provide {{adequate}} room for new equipment. Subsequently, a new 19th district police station was built {{on the grounds of the}} former Riverview Amusement Park at 2452 W. Belmont. Rather than having the new station supplant the Town Hall District, officials split the district down the middle. The new station became the 19th district and the Town Hall Station became the new 23rd District. Clark Street became the dividing line between the two districts. In 2004, the <b>lockup</b> at the Town Hall Station closed and all arrested in the 23rd District were taken to the 19th.|$|E

Permanent <b>lockup</b> cells and stables were completed in Redruth mid-1847. In September that year, William Lang was appointed resident magistrate and coroner for the Murray District and initially housed in a company cottage in Kooringa. The first hotel was a temporary wooden structure erected {{at the entrance to}} the township of Kooringa in mid-1846, and the first permanent hotel was the Burra Hotel (opened 25 September 1847) built by William Paxton, a SAMA director and original owner of Ayers House.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} precursors of the perp walk, before the term came into use, occurred in 1903. NYPD inspector George W.

After they had been in <b>lockup</b> for a night, McClusky had the cuffed suspects marched through the streets of Little Italy, in full view of their fellow Italian immigrants, from police headquarters to the nearby Third Judicial District Courthouse for arraignment, claiming that the paddy wagons in which this would normally be done had not arrived as scheduled.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{employees}} and early investors want shorter <b>lockups</b> (so they can cash out sooner) while the underwriting banks want longer ones (to keep insiders from flooding {{the market and}} sinking the share price).
