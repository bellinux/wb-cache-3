2500|$|In 2016, Lovely Warren, {{the mayor}} of Rochester, put a red, white and blue sign next to Anthony's grave the day after Hillary Clinton {{obtained}} the nomination at the Democratic National Convention; the sign stated, [...] "Dear Susan B., we thought you might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{for the first time}} in history, a woman is running for president representing a major party. 144 years ago, your illegal vote got you arrested. It took another 48 years for women to finally gain the right to vote. Thank you for paving the way." [...] The city of Rochester put pictures of the message on Twitter and requested that residents go to Anthony's grave to sign it.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large {{controversy}} {{in the media and}} in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man [...] "sparked a playground craze" [...] where [...] "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'" [...] As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.|$|E

60|$|Everybody <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> {{be taken}} {{into the details of}} {{technical}} business; and of course everybody <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a bookseller is losing money. These, I realised, were two axioms in the methods of Mr. Sellyer.|$|R
6000|$|Brown {{looked at}} him with a curious little smile which Austin found disconcerting. [...] "There are Mrs. Hatherly and Muriel. I almost think Jacinta would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you and Jefferson were under a misapprehension, too. Still, that is, perhaps, not very important, after all. I suppose Jefferson told you that he expects to get a good deal for the Cumbria and her cargo?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Would you?' said Dennis, {{after looking}} at his face to assure himself that he was serious. 'Would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> man, Muster Gashford?' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{how did the}} cap come to {{be hanging}} from the bush? Yes, Christine would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> before she gave it back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You young men," [...] he declared, [...] "are so imaginative. Mr. Guest {{has simply}} been removed {{to the part}} of the hotel which is {{reserved}} for sick people. No one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they have anybody next door to them who is seriously ill. As for the doctor, he is a highly qualified practitioner, and visits the hotel every day by arrangement with the manager; and the nurse was sent from the nearest nurses' home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He'll find it, too, {{if it is}} to be done. I thought you'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> so <b>that</b> {{you could}} go out with me and the soldiers." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{before we}} go any further I should <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the very day Rose was born I {{determined}} that her son should go to Cambridge.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Glad of that. We thought he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Paddy {{has been}} carried to the sick-house in ravin' delirium. They think it's {{concussion}} of the brain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything {{has been}} unlucky, Mr. Fregelius--or lucky," [...] he added beneath his breath. [...] "But you will <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she died singing it. The aerophone told me that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Violet," [...] he said, [...] "this is no {{time for}} misunderstandings. I should <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> apart from one young lady, who {{possesses}} my whole affection--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{could see}} the crowd before getting very near and would <b>know</b> enough <b>to</b> stay at a distance," [...] Neal replied. [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>that</b> statue represents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] I said {{directly}} she {{had approached}} me near enough. [...] "Perhaps you would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mr Fyne is upstairs with Captain Anthony at this moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> too," [...] said Dorothy. [...] "But, tell me; {{how does}} it happen that {{you are able to}} talk? I thought hens could only cluck and cackle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's like you. What's the use {{of money}} you can see? How are you to make money out of money by looking at it? I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my money is fructifying." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{was a sort}} of an all-round {{sound of}} sympathy and wonder as the last quarter opened, and then there began exactly what The Maltese Cat had foreseen. People crowded in close to the boundaries, and the Archangels' ponies kept looking {{sideways}} at the narrowing space. If you know how a man feels to be cramped at tennis--not because he wants to run out of the court, but because he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he can at a pinch--you will guess how ponies must feel when they are playing in a box of human beings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will wait}} till to-morrow,--when I call to see Felix. I should <b>like</b> her <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I am coming. Paul Montague {{was in town}} the other day. He was here, I suppose?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I thought you'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the lad {{had gone}} home to Cleopatra's wedding, so you cannot have him to dance at yours. Have you {{forgotten}} how you waltzed that night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "A shame? How can {{you provide}} if you don't {{know how many}} are coming? I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> But of course I couldn't expect you to give in gracefully." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, {{we shall}} be most grateful. [...] You have been a most kind and forbearing friend. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you were happy,' said Mary, lingering, and hardly knowing what to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Guess we had better. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where <b>that</b> fellow is," [...] I replied. [...] "Likely as not he is prowling {{about here}} somewhere. If {{we can only}} catch sight of him, we can-- Hark!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where <b>that</b> nest is," [...] said he {{to himself as}} he scampered along. [...] "I suppose Mrs. Grouse has hidden it so cleverly that it is quite useless to look for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can have}} your revenge and five guineas besides," [...] Flash said. [...] "But we must be there at the time. I should <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I was at the bottom of his being caught." ...|$|R

"When Matthew {{was here}} he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> hear you laugh and he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you found {{pleasure}} in the pleasant things around you," [...] said Mrs. Allan gently. [...] "He is just away now; and he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it just the same. I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences that nature offers us. But I can understand your feeling. I think we all experience the same thing. We resent the thought that anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us, and we almost feel {{as if we were}} unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O," [...] he said, [...] "I know, I know! I was a {{young fellow}} of sixteen, with my ears wide open; and a fellow of <b>that</b> age, you <b>know,</b> is pretty wide awake, and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{everything}} <b>that's</b> going on. O, I know!" ...|$|R
