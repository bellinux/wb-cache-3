The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E

[...] "You think life must lack plot-interest for me," [...] she began, slowly, [...] "because, with certain natures, I can {{partially}} guess beforehand what is coming. But {{have you not}} observed that, in reading a novel, part of the pleasure you feel arises from your conscious anticipation of the end, and your satisfaction in seeing that you anticipated correctly? Or part, sometimes, from the occasional unexpectedness of the real denouement? Well, life is like that.

Here is an equally typical Greek-school landscape, by Wilson--lost wholly in golden mist; the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers, and no care for color whatever; perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist--"Apollo and the Python." [...] Now here is Raphael, exactly between the two--trees still drawn leaf by leaf, wholly formal; but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance. Well, then, last, here is Turner's; Greek-school of the highest class; and you define his art, absolutely, as first the displaying intensely, and with the sternest intellect, of natural form as it is, and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire. Only, there are two sorts of cloud and fire. He knows them both. There's one, and there's another--the [...] "Dudley" [...] and the [...] "Flint." [...] That's what the cloud and flame of the dragon mean: now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the dragon means himself.|$|E

[...] The doctor chimed in facetiously: [...] "I'm Lady Harry's medical referee; you'll find her French delicacies half digested for you, sir, before you can open your mouth: signed, Clarence Vimpany, member of the College of Surgeons." [...] Remembering Mrs. Vimpany's caution, Hugh {{concealed}} his distrust of this outbreak of hospitable gaiety, and made his excuses. Lord Harry followed, with more excuses, on his part. He deplored it--but he was obliged to go out. Had Mr. Mountjoy met with the new paper which was to beat [...] "Galiguani" [...] out of the field? The [...] "Continental Herald [...] "--there was the title. [...] "Forty thousand copies of the first number have just flown all over Europe; we have our agencies in every town of importance, at every point of the compass; and, {{one of the great}} proprietors, my dear sir, is the humble individual who now addresses you." [...] His bright eyes sparkled with boyish pleasure, as he made that announcement of his own importance. If Mr. Mountjoy would kindly excuse him, he had an appointment at the office that morning. [...] "Get your hat, Vimpany. The fact is our friend here carries a case of consumption in his pocket; consumption of the purse, you understand. I am going to enrol him among the contributors to the newspaper. A series of articles (between ourselves) exposing the humbug of physicians, and asserting with fine satirical emphasis the overstocked state of the medical profession. Ah, well! you'll be glad (won't you?) to talk over old times with Iris. My angel, show our good friend the 'Continental Herald,' and mind you keep him here till we get back. Doctor, look alive! Mr. Mountjoy, au revoir." [...] They shook hands again heartily. As Mrs. Vimpany had confessed, there was no resisting the Irish lord.|$|E
