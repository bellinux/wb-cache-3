This stunned and depressed the composer, for {{up to that point}} he had only been wary of multiples of 13 and never considered adding the digits of his age. He died on Friday, 13 July 1951, shortly before midnight. Schoenberg had stayed in bed all day, sick, anxious and depressed. His wife Gertrud reported in a telegram to her sister-in-law Ottilie the next day that Arnold died at 11:45pm, 15 minutes before midnight [...] In a letter to Ottilie dated 4 August 1951, Gertrud explained, [...] "About a quarter to twelve I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and said to myself: another quarter of an hour and then the worst is over. Then the doctor called me. Arnold's throat rattled twice, his heart gave a powerful beat and that was the end" [...]|$|E
