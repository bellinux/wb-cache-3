5|$|Along {{with the}} {{infantry}} <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second wave, supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies. Combat engineers, tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches, landed off-target and without their equipment.|$|E
5|$|Polynesian {{settlers}} {{arrived from}} Tahiti in the 6th century. In 1606, the Portuguese captain, Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, {{was the first}} European recorded as <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> islands. Captain Cook, who gave the islands their current name, arrived in 1773 and 1777. Missionaries from the early 1800s brought schools and Christianity, and developed a written language.|$|E
50|$|The {{watershed}} of Sechler Run has {{an area of}} 7.6 square miles. Most of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed is agricultural land.

5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade, now {{commanded}} by Brigadier Hugh Bellamy, was given several objectives in the operation. The 2nd OBLI, <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north, had {{to secure the}} bridges over the River Issel. The 1st RUR had the main road bridge over the river from Hamminkeln to Brunen as their objective, and the 12th Devons were to capture the town of Hamminkeln.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 17 was {{the last}} of the Apollo program, <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan {{commanded}} Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the nine}} {{companies}} <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first wave, only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended. E/116, aiming for Easy Green, ended up {{scattered across the}} two beaches of the 16th RCT area. G/116, aiming for Dog White, opened up a 1,000-yard (900m) gap between themselves and A/116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead. I/16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1917, while {{performing}} trials, Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup, {{believed to have}} been N6453, successfully on board Furious, becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship. On 7 August, he made one more successful <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner, but on his third attempt, in Pup N6452, the engine choked and the aircraft crashed off the starboard bow, killing him. The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land.|$|E
5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing {{personnel}} from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E

5|$|Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France on 15August 1944. The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Normandy, {{but the lack of}} available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Arawe (also {{known as}} Operation Director) was fought between Allied and Japanese forces during the New Britain Campaign of World War II. The battle formed {{part of the}} Allied Operation Cartwheel, and had the {{objective}} of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western New Britain, and was reinforcing the region {{at the time of}} the Allied <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arawe area on 15December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force.|$|E
5|$|The division's two {{parachute}} brigades, <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{early hours}} of 6June, were scattered across the countryside during the parachute drop. Most of the battalions could only muster around sixty per cent or less of their total strength on the drop zones (DZ). They did carry out all of their objectives, however, before the 6th Airlanding Brigade arrived by gliders to reinforce them at 21:00 that evening.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{watershed}} {{is owned}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Bureau of Forestry, and Sproul State Forest.

50|$|<b>In</b> 1858 <b>the</b> Turks {{enacted a}} law stating that all landowners names must be officially {{documented}} {{as a means}} of regulating matters relating to <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire. Most of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Negev was classified as muwat (dead land, wasteland unsuitable for cultivation).|$|R

5|$|The {{flight of}} the Fiji parrotfinch is fast and undulating with rapid wingbeats, and {{frequent}} calling. It tends to fly fairly high, <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree tops, then descending to seek food. Its call is a high, thin seep or peep, {{similar to those of}} other parrotfinches such as blue-faced and red-throated, and is often repeated in bursts of varying length. The song is a long whistled double note similar to, but less urgent, than that of the orange-breasted myzomela, a Fijian endemic honeyeater.|$|E
5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans.|$|E
5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', moving his troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the name Baxter Creek is unknown, but historians {{believe it to be}} from a family which once owned <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.

5|$|After the battle, Spruance {{became chief}} of staff to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) and Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPOA). In Halsey's {{continued}} absence, Kinkaid became commander of Task Force 16, built around the carrier , although he was not an aviator, and his experience with carriers had been restricted to commanding their screens at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway. In early July Kinkaid was briefed by Nimitz about plans for a <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solomon Islands, codenamed Operation Watchtower. For this operation, Kinkaid's Task Force 16 would be one of three carrier task forces under Fletcher's overall command. To protect his flagship, Enterprise, Kinkaid had the battleship , heavy cruiser , antiaircraft cruiser , and five destroyers. The addition of the new battleship and its twenty /38 caliber dual-purpose guns greatly strengthened Task Force 16's antiaircraft defenses.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} {{event of the}} 2016/17 season in Ruka, Finland, Prevc, who was leading after the first series, fell upon <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second series and {{finished}} third. His brother Domen scored his first World Cup victory at that occasion. Throughout December, Prevc was struggling with his jumps, fell again upon landing at the first event in Engelberg and did not reach the final round at the second event. After the Four Hill Tournament, where he finished 14th, Prevc skipped the events in Wisla. Following the break, his results started to improve again. Prevc was the best individual of the team event in Zakopane, where Slovenian team finished third. The team event in Willingen saw, for the first time, all three Prevc brothers representing Slovenia, together with Tepeš; they finished fourth. On 11 February, he won in Sapporo for the fourth year in a row. It was a double win with Maciej Kot.|$|E
