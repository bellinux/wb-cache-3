5000|$|... 4-IPO is a {{specific}} lethal toxicant which mainly targets bronchiolar exocrine cells in the smaller bronchioles of rodent and cattle lungs. With an increased dosis {{it is also possible}} to affect other cells and the airway of organisms. Covalent binding of 4-IPO to members of the CYP family (mainly CYP4B1) eventually leads to biotransformation of 4-IPO into an enedial intermediate, which is able to bind to a variety of proteins. These binding events are permanent and responsible for 4-IPO toxicity. This will result in cytotoxicity and eventually necrosis of bronchiolar exocrine cells, while ciliated bronchiolar cells and other epithelial lung cells are not affected, due to lower levels of cytochrome proteins. Necrotic patches, also called lesions or primary pathological changes, can develop into edemas, resulting in thickening of the alveolar septum, congestion, and hemorrhage (secondary and tertiary pathological changes). Lethality is probably due to pulmonary edema. Prior to death the dogs also showed rapid and shallow respiration, while in rats labored respiration and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion</b> can be observed. The LD50 dose varies between different species. In female mice 21 mg/kg/day 4-IPO are sufficient while in male mice 35 mg/kg/day were necessary. 15 mg/kg 4-IPO intravenously administered into rats is lethal and in dogs this dose is 12 mg/kg. It is possible to increase the LD50 by 2-4.5 fold when individuals are treated with multiple non-toxic doses beforehand.|$|E

We have developed a mouse model of myocarditis following mouse adenovirus 1 (MAV- 1) infection to study the pathogenic mechanisms of this important cause of pediatric myocarditis. Following intranasal infection of neonatal C 57 BL/ 6 mice, we detected viral replication and induction of interferon gamma (IFN-) in the hearts of infected mice. MAV- 1 caused myocyte necrosis and induced substantial cellular inflammation that was composed predomi-nantly of CD 3 T <b>lymphocytes.</b> <b>Depletion</b> of IFN- during acute infection reduced cardiac inflammation inMAV- 1 -infected mice without affecting viral replication.

For this purpose, we used viral vectors based on simian virus 40 (rSV 40). Importantly, we observed that nonmatured DCs infected with rSV 40 vectors remained phenotypically immature. Infection of CT- 26 tumor cells with rSV 40 expressing IL- 12 (rSVIL- 12) or IL- 15 (rSVIL- 15) failed to inhibit tumor development.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Authors {{overlook}} the recent {{findings in the}} field of the complex interrelationship among nutrition, immune status and parasitic infestation. After summarizing the general characteristics of the active immune system, they describe the first period of the systemic immune response, the acute phase reaction. The cause of drastical decrease in serum zinc concentration is redistribution into the liver and lymphocyte metallothioneins. Immune defi-ciency correlates only indirectly with the nutrition. Ingestion of feed mycotoxins (e. g. T- 2 toxin) and peroxides causes <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>depletion</b> in the lymphoid organs. Events of immunological stress are a special form of homeorrhetic control. Lack of energy and protein hardly damages the humoral immunity. Undernutrition fundamentally affects the cell-mediated immune response and the complement production. In animals, the lack of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, iodine and selenium has been associated with signs of immunodeficiency. The concentrations of trace elements required for healthy animals are often below what is required for animals experiencing an immunological challenge. Zinc has both specific and aspecific role in the immune defence mechanism. Zinc regulates the maturation and function of immune cells, among others by protecting developing lymphocytes from apoptosis. As part of the zinc-finger proteins, may influence DNA transcription. The thymus synthesizes a 9 -amino acid peptide hormone, the thymulin, which is activated after having bound zinc.

Agents that profoundly deplete lymphocytes have included monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic drugs, and radiation. We have studied several such agents but focused on antibod-ies that deplete not only peripheral blood lymphocytes, but also lymph node <b>lymphocytes.</b> <b>Depletion</b> of lymph node T lymphocytes appears to permit peripheral tolerance at least for T cells in animal models. Nevertheless, B-cell responses may be resistant to such approaches, and T memory cells are likewise relatively resistant to depleting antibodies. We review the experimental and clinical approaches to depletion strategies and outline some of the pitfalls of depletion, such as limitations of currently available agents, duration of tolerance, infec-tion, and malignancy. It is notable that most tolerogenic strategies that have been attempted experimentally and clinically include depleting agents {{even when they are}} not named as the underlying strategy. Thus, there is an implicitly acknowledged role for reducing the precursor frequency of donor antigen-specific lymphocytes when approaching the daunting goal of transplant tolerance.

These results demonstrate the suppressive effect CD 4 +CD 25 + Treg cells have on the CD 8 + immune response during the acute and chronic stages of FIV infection and suggest that the mechanism of suppression may be mediated by mTGF-Î²...|$|R
40|$|A {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antileucocyte antibodies {{was used in}} a study of Hodgkin's disease (HD) to explore the phenotypic characteristics of Sternberg-Reed and related cells (collectively termed HD cells). Cryostat preparations of 31 lymph nodes and 2 spleens were obtained from 30 patients with active HD. The histological diagnoses were: lymphocyte predominance (LP), 4 patients; nodular sclerosis (NS), 22; mixed cellularity (MC), 2; <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion</b> (LD), 2. The monoclonal antibodies used were: OKT 3, Ti 1, Leu-...|$|E
40|$|Outbred Swiss albino mice thymectomized {{at birth}} show a marked <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion</b> and a {{striking}} impairement of {{the capacity to}} form antibodies against sheep red blood cells (RBC) and to reject allogeneic skin grafts, as compared to sham-operated controls, but rarely exhibit symptoms of wasting disease. Neonatal ablation of the thymus neither significantly modifies the susceptibility of mice chronically exposed to casein to develop amyloidosis nor does it lessen {{the gravity of the}} disease, when compared to sham-operated controls...|$|E
40|$|Doses of 1. 5 mg of {{prednisolone}} to newborn rats cause massive thymic involution and {{peripheral blood}} <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion</b> without excessive mortality. By 3 weeks thymic mass, thymocytes and {{peripheral blood lymphocyte}} levels have all recovered fully, but antibody responsiveness to typhoid `H' antigen is still depressed. As late as 10 weeks diminished levels of a serum immunoglobulin provisionally identified as IgA and depressed `H' agglutinin titres are found in male but not in female treated rats...|$|E
40|$|Chylous ascites {{is a rare}} form of ascites and {{generally}} associated with a poor outcome since it is often secondary to neoplasms. Its true incidence is not well established in the general medico-surgical population. Any source of lymph vessels obstruction or leakage can potentially cause chylous effusions in the peritoneal or retroperitoneal cavities. Any type of cancer and lymph node involvement {{may be associated with}} this uncommon type of ascites. Traumatic, and mainly surgical, vessels leakage is the second most common source of chylous effusions. Other even more rare underlying conditions have been described as leading to chyloperitoneum. Large fluid volume losses together with proteins, and lymphocytes can induce additional morbidity in a previously debilitated population or severely ill patients. This includes organ dysfunction related to volume and electrolytes losses, but mainly secondary infections due to impaired immunity by antibodies and <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>depletion.</b> Even if a vast majority of chylous effusions shall heal spontaneously, early and full treatment has to be initiated in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Adapted oral diet is to be introduced to reduce lymph flow. Low lipid, high medium-chain triglycerides alimentation is the first measure to implement. Total parenteral nutrition is to be reserved to failures of oral diet. In addition, paracentesis is indicated to improve patient comfort, reduce intra-adbominal pressure and secondary renal dysfunction. Somatostatin analogues have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing lymphorragia and may be proposed prior to consider the surgical approach. Direct lymph vessels ligation can be indicated for large lymph vessels leakage demonstrated by radiologic techniques and when medical treatment has failed. Peritoneo-venous shunt becomes a less common technique in refractory chylous effusion because of its high morbidity. Herein, the other causes of chylous effusions are reviewed as the diagnostic procedures. A treatment algorythm is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Eicosanoids, in {{particular}} prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), are potent inhibitors {{of a number}} of immune responses, including lymphocyte proliferation. We have previously shown that fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), inhibit mitogen-stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes. One mechanism by which fatty acids could exert their inhibitory effect is via modulation of eicosanoid synthesis. This possibility was investigated in the present study. PGE 2 concentrations in the medium taken from lymphocytes cultured {{in the presence of a}} range of different fatty acids did not correlate with the inhibitory effects of the fatty acids upon lymphocyte proliferation. Although PGE 2 at concentrations above 10 nM caused inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, PGE 2 at the concentration measured in lymphocyte culture medium (0. 3 - 4 nM) was not inhibitory. PGE 3 did not inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, except at high concentrations (greater than 250 nM). The maximal inhibition of proliferation caused by PGE 2 or PGE 3 was less than the inhibition caused by each of the fatty acids except myristic or palmitic acids. Inclusion of inhibitors of phospholipase A 2, cyclo-oxygenase or lipoxygenase in the culture medium did not prevent the fatty acids from exerting their inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation. The eicosanoids present in lymph node cell cultures originate from macrophages rather than <b>lymphocytes.</b> <b>Depletion</b> of macrophages from the cell preparation by adherence did not prevent fatty acids from inhibiting proliferation. Proliferation of thoracic duct lymphocytes, which are devoid of macrophages, is inhibited by fatty acids to a similar extent as proliferation of lymph node lymphocytes. These observations provide convincing evidence that the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by fatty acids is independent of the production of eicosanoids. Therefore, other mechanisms must be investigated if the effect of fatty acids upon lymphocyte proliferation is to be understood at a biochemical level...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{clinical}} enteropathies {{are associated with}} a local cell-mediated immune (CMI) response, and experimental evidence indicates that cytokines are responsible for the intestinal pathology. We show here that depletion of IL- 4 using MoAb or a soluble form of the IL- 4 receptor (IL- 4 R) prevents the jejunal manifestations of a proliferative form of murine graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) characterized by crypt hyperplasia and recruitment of intraepithelial <b>lymphocytes</b> (IEL). <b>Depletion</b> of IL- 4 did not prevent the appearance of villus atrophy in a destructive model of GVHR, and had no effect on any indices of systemic immunity. These results indicate that IL- 4 may play a selective role in mediating proliferative aspects of intestinal immunopathology, and suggest that this cytokine may provide a useful target for immunotherapy...|$|R
