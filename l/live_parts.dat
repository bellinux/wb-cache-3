25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as <b>live</b> <b>parts.</b> Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E
2500|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide three electrical {{connections to the}} supply conductors. These are termed neutral, line and earth. [...] Both neutral and line carry current and are defined as <b>live</b> <b>parts.</b> Neutral is usually at or very near to earth potential, being earthed either at the substation or at the service entrance (neutral-to-earth bonding is not permitted in the distribution board/consumer unit). Line (commonly, but technically incorrectly, called live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral. The [...] protective earth connection allows the exposed metal parts of the appliance {{to be connected to}} earth, providing protection to the user should those exposed parts inadvertently come into contact with any <b>live</b> <b>parts</b> within the appliance. [...] Historically, two-pin sockets without earth were used in Britain, but their use is now restricted to sockets specifically designated for shavers and toothbrushes.|$|E
2500|$|Where XLR {{connectors}} {{are used}} for DC power, the genders are reversed {{with respect to their}} standard use for line-level and mic-level audio. Typically, audio signals on XLR connectors [...] "follow the pin," [...] such that a male connector is an output and a female connector is an input. In most power applications (not just XLR connectors) the female connector is the output and the male connector is the input. This makes accidental contact with <b>live</b> <b>parts</b> less likely. In audio devices it also prevents accidental application of DC power to signal inputs.|$|E

2500|$|Dimensions {{are chosen}} to provide safe {{clearance}} to <b>live</b> <b>parts.</b> The distance from {{any part of}} the [...] and neutral pins to the periphery of the plug base must be not less than 9.5mm. [...] This ensures that nothing can be inserted alongside a pin when the plug is in use, and helps keep fingers away from the pins. [...] The longer earth pin ensures that the earth path is connected before the live pins, and remains connected after the live pins are removed. The earth pin is too large to be inserted into the [...] or neutral sockets by mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Where the {{building}} wiring system defines a [...] "neutral" [...] conductor that {{is close to}} earth potential, it is an advantage for appliance designers to preserve that distinction. For example, appliances may ensure single-pole switches interrupt the line side of the circuit, or ensure that screw-base lampholder shells {{are connected to the}} neutral side of the supply, minimizing the chance of contact with <b>live</b> <b>parts.</b> This requires a plug that can only be connected in one way to the socket, so that the energised and neutral conductors are not interchanged. In most designs, such [...] "polarized" [...] plugs cannot be mated with non-polarized sockets. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth do not benefit from polarized plugs.|$|E
2500|$|A BS1363 plug has two horizontal, {{rectangular}} pins for [...] and neutral, {{and above}} these pins, a larger, vertical pin for an earth connection. [...] Note, both line and neutral carry current and {{are defined as}} <b>live</b> <b>parts.</b> [...] The earth pin also serves to operate the basic shutter mechanism used in many sockets. [...] Correct polarity is established by {{the position of the}} earth pin relative to the other two pins, ensuring that the [...] pin is connected to the correct terminal in the socket-outlet. [...] Moulded plugs for unearthed, double-insulated appliances may instead have a non-conductive plastic pin (an Insulated Shutter Opening Device or ISOD) the same size and shape as an earth pin, to open the shutters. [...] When looking at the plug pins with the earth uppermost the lower left pin is line, and the lower right is neutral.|$|E
