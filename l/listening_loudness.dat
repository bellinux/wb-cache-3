40|$|Most {{perceived}} {{parameters of}} sound (e. g. pitch, duration, timbre) {{can also be}} imagined {{in the absence of}} sound. These parameters are imagined more veridically by expert musicians than non-experts. Evidence for whether loudness is imagined, however, is conflicting. In music, the question of whether loudness is imagined is particularly relevant due to its role as a principal parameter of performance expression. This study addressed the hypothesis that the veridicality of imagined loudness improves with increasing musical expertise. Experts, novices and non-musicians imagined short passages of well-known classical music under two counterbalanced conditions: 1) while adjusting a slider to indicate imagined loudness of the music and 2) while tapping out the rhythm to indicate imagined timing. Subtests assessed music listening abilities and working memory span to determine whether these factors, also hypothesised to improve with increasing musical expertise, could account for imagery task performance. Similarity between each participant’s imagined and <b>listening</b> <b>loudness</b> profiles and reference recording intensity profiles was assessed using time series analysis and dynamic time warping. The results suggest a widespread ability to imagine the loudness of familiar music. The veridicality of imagined loudness tended to be greatest for the expert musicians, supporting the predicted relationship between musica...|$|E
30|$|This work {{concentrates}} on the other main category, namely signal-based methods. They predict quality based on evaluation of a test speech signal at {{the output of the}} channel. They can be divided into two further sub-categories, intrusive or non-intrusive. Intrusive signal-based methods use an original reference and a degraded signal, which is the output of the system under test. They identify the audible distortions based on the perceptual domain representation of two signals incorporating human auditory models. Several intrusive models have been developed during recent years. The ITU-T Recommendation P. 861 (PSQM), published in 1996, was a first attempt to objectively model human listeners and predict speech quality from subjective listener tests. It was succeeded in 2001 by P. 862, commonly known as PESQ, a full-reference metric for predicting speech quality. PESQ has been widely used and was enhanced and extended over the next decade. It was originally designed and tested on narrowband signals. It improved on PSQM and the model handles a range of transmission channel problems and variations including varied speech levels, codecs, delays, packet loss, and environmental noise. However, it has a number of acknowledged shortcomings including <b>listening</b> levels, <b>loudness</b> loss, effects of delay in conversational tests, talker echo, and side tones [1]. An extension to PESQ was developed that adapted the input filters and MOS mapping to allow wideband signal quality prediction [3].|$|R
40|$|Objective: To date, {{the main}} {{direction}} in frequency-lowering hearing aid studies {{has been in}} relation to speech perception abilities. With improvements in hearing aid technology, interest in musical perception as a dimension that could improve hearing aid users’ quality of life has grown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the influence of non-linear frequency compression (NFC) on hearing aid users’ subjective impressions of listening to music. Design & sample: A survey research design was implemented to elicit participants’ (N = 40) subjective impressions of musical stimuli with and without NFC. Results: The use of NFC significantly improved hearing aid users’ perception of the musical qualities of overall fidelity, tinniness and reverberance. Although participants preferred to <b>listen</b> to the <b>loudness,</b> fullness, crispness, naturalness and pleasantness of music with the use of NFC, these benefits were not significant. Conclusion: The use of NFC can increase hearing aid users’ enjoyment and appreciation of music. Given that a relatively large percentage of hearing aid users express a loss of enjoyment of music, audiologists should not ignore the possible benefits of NFC, especially if one takes into account that previous research indicates speech perception benefits with this technology. </p...|$|R
