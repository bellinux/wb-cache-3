50|$|The Dragoon ALSV (Armored <b>Logistics</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Vehicle)</b> is a Dragoon APC fitted out as {{an armored}} truck of sorts. The load area in this vehicle is open-topped, {{and there is a}} materiel-handling crane with a {{capacity}} of 1 ton. It can carry standard NATO pallets and containers, as well as several makes of civilian ones. This vehicle is normally used to carry bulk cargo like ammunition and spare parts to forward elements, and is often found accompanying Dragoon EMVs on their rounds.|$|E
5000|$|Boxer GNGP (Boxer Geniegroep) - The Boxer GNPR is an {{engineering}} and <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{and will be}} deployed for the transport of troops and engineer group equipment. It provides seating for six dismounts with space available for their personal equipment and an additional separate stowage section for munitions. It may be deployed as a support vehicle with other units or used for independent assignments such as route clearance, or as a protected work location during mine clearance or demolition operations. The Boxer GNGP replaces the YPR-765 prgm/PRCO-C3 variant of the AIFV (Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle). The Royal Netherlands Army will now convert 12 of the 92 GNGP vehicles to Boxer Battle Damage Repair. (BDR) configuration. The BDR variant is able to accommodate the special equipment, tools, expendable and non-expendable supplies needed to carry out diagnoses, maintenance and minor repairs if required. Crew consists of an engineer commander, driver, observing commander, gunner, and five engineers.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to government facilities, many private sector industries with facility security concerns {{are beginning to}} implement ANPR solutions. Examples include casinos, hospitals, museums, parking facilities, and resorts. In the US, private facilities typically cannot access government or police watch lists, but may develop and match against their own databases for customers, VIPs, critical personnel or [...] "banned person" [...] lists. In {{addition to}} providing perimeter security, private ANPR has service applications for valet / recognized customer and VIP recognition, logistics and key personnel tracking, sales and advertising, parking management, and <b>logistics</b> (vendor and <b>support</b> <b>vehicle</b> tracking).|$|R

40|$|To gain {{maritime}} {{dominance in}} the littorals in the 2020 timeframe, the US Navy must have capabilities to assure access to the littorals and to enable Sea Basing and Sea Strike. These capabilities necessitate innovative and radical concepts for systems, tactics, support, and force structures. Focusing on only system-of systems (SoS) concepts, we consider a system of only manned platforms, a system of primarily unmanned platforms, and a balanced hybrid system of manned and unmanned platforms. Based on a cost, risk-to-personnel, performance, and sensitivity analysis, using a Shallow Water Acoustics Toolset (Excel/SWAT), the Autonomous Littoral Warfare Systems Evaluator Discrete Event Simulation (ALWSE), and a Force/Theater Extend Model, we select a balanced hybrid system of manned and unmanned platforms that uses distributed communications network architecture and a decentralized command and control structure. Our work demonstrates that unmanned platforms, while cost effective and capable of reducing risk to personnel, complement but cannot replace manned platforms. Manned platforms will still be required for command and control, crucial operational decision making, and <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> to unmanned <b>vehicles.</b> Finally, we suggest further research to provide additional insight into {{the solution to the}} problem of maritime {{dominance in the}} littorals...|$|R

This {{was one of the}} aims at this work. Chapters I., II., III., IV. describe <b>logistics</b> and <b>logistics</b> <b>support,</b> crisis management, citizen protection and integrated rescue system. Chapter V. describes basic legislation connected with crisis management and citizen protection. Chapter VI. deals with <b>logistics</b> and <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> in crisis management and citizen protection and presents information on the Institute of Citizen Protection, the Logistics base in Olomouc, the Administration of Government Material Reserves and the Fire Brigade of the Czech Republic. An analysed anonymous questionnaire {{is a part of the}} graduation thesis as well. Its aim was to find out the level of <b>logistics</b> and <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> in the Police of the Czech Republic. The assessment of the research showed deficiencies in the <b>logistics</b> and <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> of the Czech Police. The following hypothesis was determined in connection with the graduation thesis: 1. <b>Logistics</b> and <b>logistics</b> <b>support</b> in crisis management and citizen protection are on a good level.

With {{the implementation of the}} ILS concept, there has been a remarkable progress; yet substantial problems were found that had to be addressed.
