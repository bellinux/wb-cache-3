40|$|Translation and {{interpretation}} have long played {{a vital role}} in many legal contexts, from providing equal rights to defendants to facilitating mutual understanding among the members of the United Nations. Legal language, though, is incredibly complex and even faithfully equivalent translations can fail to meet the high standards required for operation in international legal contexts, where a lack of understanding over a single term could mean the difference between a material and non-material breach in a treaty or transnational contract. Branches of linguistics, such as comparative legal linguistics and forensic linguistics, study the characteristics and functions of legal language across many tongues. As the globalization of our world continues, the opportunities for confusing and misunderstanding legal language increase. While a global legal language could, by some views, be the ultimate fix to such issues, the current state of international systems is poorly equipped to develop such a structure. The timing is simply not right {{at this point in the}} process of globalization. This note examines the current context and state of legal translation and similar areas of linguistic study and takes the view that, instead, the role of the <b>lawyer-linguist</b> professional and the technique of co-drafting should be maximized to facilitate better understanding among languages and legal systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} a successful co-operation between academic researchers and non-academic institutions to investigate the quality and viability of videoconference-based interpreting in legal proceedings. The collaborative approach outlined here will {{be of interest to}} a number of public services, especially to legal, healthcare and local government institutions, which encounter problems with access to qualified interpreters. The collaboration started in 2008 in response to the observation that videoconference links were widely used by police forces, courts, probation and prison services in Europe and that the use of interpreters in such video links was rapidly increasing. Furthermore, in 2008, the Metropolitan Police Service in London began to consider the use of ‘remote interpreting’ via video link to reduce interpreter travel costs. At European level, the adoption of Directive 2010 / 64 /EU on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings created a legal basis for using videoconference links to gain access to qualified legal interpreters. However, until 2008, very little was known about the viability and quality of videoconference-based interpreting in legal proceedings. There was a high risk of potential miscarriages of justice through the combined effects of videoconferencing and interpreting. Relevant training for legal practitioners and interpreters was non-existent. There was thus an urgent need for practice-oriented research and research-led practical guidance. To address these issues, we formed a European partner consortium that included research institutions with combined experience in legal interpreting and videoconference communication (University of Surrey, KU Leuven, Institut Télécom Paris); relevant governmental bodies (Ministry of Security and Justice of the Netherlands, Dutch Legal Aid Board, Local Police Antwerp); a lawyer from the Antwerp-based law firm Van der Mussele-Vanden Bosch; a <b>lawyer-linguist</b> with 30 years’ experience as a Magistrate in the UK; and the Polish Society of Sworn and Specialised Translators. The aim was to conduct a comparative study of traditional and video interpreting, and to use the findings to develop guidelines of good practice and to design and pilot training modules for interpreters and legal practitioners. This collaboration was funded by the European Commission, Directorate-General for Justice from 2008 - 11 (AVIDICUS 1; JLS/ 2008 /JPEN/ 03) and 2011 - 13 (AVIDICUS 2; JUST/ 2010 /JPEN/AG/ 1558). The presentation first explains how this collaboration was implemented and outlines its major achievements, which include a collaborative book publication by the consortium partners (Braun & Taylor, eds, 2012. Videoconference and remote interpreting in legal proceedings. Cambridge/Antwerp: Intersentia); incorporation of our guidelines into the Guide on Videoconferencing produced by the European Council Working Party on e-Law (eJustice) and into the European e-Justice Portal [URL] delivery of our training modules to over 350 police-certified interpreters at the Metropolitan Police Service in London; advising offender management institutions in Europe on the use of videoconferencing and interpreting. The subsequent discussion and assessment of these achievements focuses on highlighting the benefits of the collaborative approach, especially outlining the reasons why this approach is likely to have generated greater impact on relevant stakeholders than an ‘ivory-tower’ approach. The discussion then turns to potential challenges, especially the question of how different interests in this type of collaboration can be balanced and how researcher independence can be maintained. The presentation will end by explaining how this collaboration is currently being continued and extended in AVIDICUS 3 (2013 - 16, JUST/ 2013 /JPEN/AG/ 4553). status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Translation {{competence}} {{includes a}} complex variety of cognitive, linguistic and cultural skills. Translation {{in the field}} of law represents an even more demanding process, as it can be defined as “an act of communication in the mechanism of law” which leads “to legal effects and may induce peace or a prompt war” (Šarčević, 1997). In this paper, different aspects of the translator’s competence in legal translation are discussed. In the introductory part, an overview of theoretical approaches to the translation process is offered. The main part of the paper is dedicated to problems and challenges that legal translators are faced with. Special attention is paid to teaching the documentary approach to translation of EU legislation within the Lifelong Learning Programme for <b>Lawyer-Linguists</b> in the Republic of Croatia. The problems occurring in legal translation and competences of legal translators are discussed from the teacher’s perspective, based on the experience in teaching the course Introduction to the Theory of Legal Translation and Terminology within the Lifelong Learning Programme for <b>Lawyer-Linguists</b> at the Faculty of Law, University of Osijek, Croatia...|$|R

Published as chapter 11 of Gueldry M (eds) How Globalizing Professions Deal With National Languages: Studies in Cultural Conflict and Cooperation, Lewiston, Queenstown, Lampeter: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, 239 - 263. The role of {{language}} and translation {{in the production of}} the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice (and Court of First Instance) of the European Communities is a significant one. That multilingual jurisprudence consists mainly of collegiate judgments drafted by jurists in a language that is generally not their mother tongue; it also undergoes many permutations of translation into/out of up to 23 different languages and thus is necessarily shaped by the particular way in which the Court of Justice works and by the actors within it. This paper considers the role played by language in the institutional dynamics of the Court of Justice, focusing in particular on those {{whose job it is to}} translate the jurisprudence of that Court, the <b>lawyer-linguists.</b> Based on qualitative data largely obtained from empirical fieldwork research, the first part of the paper considers the role of the Courtâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s <b>lawyer-linguists</b> prior to the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 mega-enlargementâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 of the European Union in 2004; the second part of the paper focuses on the implications of enlargement within the Court of Justice and considers whether such enlargement requires the rethinking of existing problematics and the development of new ways of functioning for that institution...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to identify the key aspects of Quality Assurance (QA) affecting the quality of translations at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The chapter starts with a brief clarification of the terms connected with QA, which are quite often used interchangeably and imprecisely. The next two sections set the background for the analysis by exploring the current language arrangements at the CJEU and associated challenges and by discussing two standards {{that are relevant to}} the field of legal translation, namely EN- 15038 : 2006 and ISO 17100. The main part of the chapter proposes a two-tiered approach to translation quality at the CJEU. It is argued that it can be conceptualized at two interrelated levels, namely the human resources level and workflow level. While the human resources level comprises, inter alia, in-house <b>lawyer-linguists,</b> external contractors, revisers, auxiliary staff and project managers, the workflow level consists of measures aimed at achieving proper structurization of the translation process as well as intra- and interinstitutional co-operation...|$|R
