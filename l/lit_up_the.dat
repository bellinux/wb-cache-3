The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum {{on the east side of}} the Square.|$|E

On March 3, 1969, the Special Forces camp at Ben Het was {{attacked}} by the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment. The 202nd was given the task of destroying the camp's 175mm self-propelled guns. One of the PT-76s had detonated a land mine, which not only alerted the camp, but also <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> other PT-76s attacking the firebase. Flares had been sent up, thus exposing adversary tanks, but sighting in on muzzle flashes, one PT-76 scored a direct hit on the turret of a M48, killing two Patton crewmen and wounding two more. A second Patton, using the same technique, destroyed a PT-76 with their second shot. At daybreak, the battlefield revealed the wreckage of two PT-76s and one BTR-50 armored personnel carrier.|$|E

Alerted by the flames, help arrived from nearby parish fire engines; as there were only two hand-pump engines on the scene, they were of limited use.

Special assault squads were formed to breach the camp's perimeters, while the second squad would fan out to destroy key targets inside the garrison. White was alerted to the movements of enemy troops outside his perimeter, so he quickly organized his Nung soldiers and placed his troops on 50% alert. The Marine detachment – commanded by Lieutenant Bob Adams – was unable to operate their howitzers {{due to the lack of}} flechette rounds, which were designed for battery defense and anti-personnel fire. Shortly after 3am, the suspect Montagnard CIDG soldiers approached the garrison from the eastern entrance, where they asked the U.S. Marine guarding the outer perimeter to let them through; as the Montagnards entered the perimeter, satchel charges were hurled at allied positions while VC soldiers <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> perimeters with flamethrowers, marking the first double-cross of the battle.|$|E

When the fog cleared later in the morning, the ship was firmly seated on the rocks {{at the base of a}} [...] cliff, and some [...] from the mainland. Coast Guardsmen on shore attached three lines to the ship and set up a breeches buoy to take off the harbor pilot, but the crew stayed on board the ship in hopes that the high tide would free her from the rocky perch. As word of the shipwreck spread, spectators clambered over the cliff to get a view of the scene; one man died from a heart attack and two women broke ankles in separate falls. Newsboys soon arrived on the scene, selling newspapers telling of Ohioans woe within sight of the stranded ship. Policemen were called out to keep order as the crowd grew into the thousands.|$|E

Minor skirmishes between light troops {{increased}} in intensity throughout November, with almost daily losses being incurred by both the British and the Americans. In retaliation, on November 22, Howe ordered his troops to set fire to several large country houses in the Germantown area, including Fair Hill, a mansion and country estate that had previously belonged to John Dickinson. [...] Eleven houses in all were burned to the ground, and residents of Philadelphia climbed onto rooftops and church steeples to watch the spectacle. [...] Just one day earlier, crowds had gathered to watch the burning of Commodore John Hazelwood's Pennsylvania Navy in the Delaware. [...] On the same morning the mansions were burned, an earthquake struck Philadelphia, and was felt {{as far away as}} Lancaster. [...] On November 27, an aurora borealis <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> night skies.
