This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} hydrological {{process is}} the interaction between rivers and aquifers. However, accurately determining this interaction from one method alone is difficult. At a point, the water exchange in the riverbed can be determined using temperature variations over depth. Over the river reach, differential gauging {{can be used to}} determine averaged losses or gains. This study combines these two methods and applies them to a 34 km reach of a semi-arid river in eastern Australia under highly transient conditions. It is found that high and low river flows translate into high and low riverbed Darcy fluxes, and that these are strongly losing during high-flows, and only slightly losing or gaining for <b>low-flows.</b> The spatial variability in riverbed Darcy fluxes may be explained by riverbed heterogeneity, with higher variability at greater spatial scales. Although the river-aquifer gradient is the main driver of riverbed Darcy flux at high-flows, considerable uncertainty in both the flux magnitude and direction estimates were found during <b>low-flows.</b> The reach scale results demonstrate that high-flow events account for 64 % of the reach loss (or 43 % if overbank events are excluded) despite occurring only 11 % of the time. By examining the relationship between total flow volume, river stage and duration for in-channel flows, we find the loss ratio (flow loss / total flow) can be greater for smaller flows than larger flows with similar duration. Implications of the study for the modelling and management of connected water resources are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{uncertainties}} regarding the future climatic context, lots {{of studies have}} focused on hydrological effects of climate change on the Meuse catchment. It appears that both winter high flows and summer low flows could be exacerbated. Climate change and its impacts on hydrology will thus affect various socio-economic sectors. High flows have been widely studied compared to <b>low-flows.</b> This poster will put the emphasis on a methodology developed in order to study impacts of droughts on agriculture. Agriculture is among the most impacted sectors due to climate change. The consequences could be both positive as negative in accordance with the range of predicted changes and the adaptation capacity of agricultural systems. Most of the existing studies related to climate change on agriculture focused on specific territory. Within the AMICE Interreg IVB project, a transnational approach has been developed to assess droughts impacts on agriculture through the Meuse basin. The project’s previous works gave us a common scenario of climate trends and of the evolution of the hydrology in the Meuse basin. The methodology is based on the use of a physically-based model able to simulate the water-soil-plant continuum (derived from EPIC model). In order to be transferable from one country to another, the methodology proposed used data available at the basin scale. The UE soil data base was complemented with local information on agricultural practices and statistics. Three crops have been studied: maize, wheat and barley. The basic cultural calendar {{is supposed to be the}} same for the different countries. The methodology developed permits to study the evolution of yields, leaf area index, crops stress due to excess or lack of water through time under different scenarios build up in the frame of the project. It appears that corn is negatively affected by climate change, and thus despite the CO 2 fertilization effect. Wheat and barley have similar behavior and are positively affected by climate change and CO 2 fertilization. Leaf Area Index study reveals that the different crops start earlier and reach earlier maturity. These first results will be completed with other economic sectors’analysis like drinkable water production, electricity production and navigation. Therefore, the project will progress towards a better understanding of economic effects of future droughts and <b>low-flows.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Otters do not {{dramatically}} reduce prey {{populations in}} the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, <b>low-flow,</b> or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the river otter, the deciding factor whether the river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.|$|E

Projected changes in precipitation and temperature characteristics due to climate change would have {{significant impact on the}} Meuse River and its tributaries. In this study, we focus on two tributaries of the Meuse in Belgium the Lesse and the Vesdre catchments. The physically based, distributed model EPICGrid, a model which reflects water-soil-plant continuum, is driven by four sets of meteorological information. Two time slices (2020 – 2050 and 2070 – 2100) and two scenarios (wet and dry) were studied. The meteorological scenarios are produced by the CCI-HYDR Perturbation Tool, a tool specially designed for the Belgian climate and taking into account a broad range of models. Water balance, high-flows and <b>low-flows</b> are calculated. It highlights that {{towards the end of the}} century, plants may suffer from water shortage and excess.

40|$|AbstractSimulation of {{low flow}} process is {{critical}} to water quality, water supply, and aquatic habitat. However, the poor performance of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in dry seasons has impeded its application to watersheds characterized largely by <b>low-flows.</b> Aiming at overcoming this shortage, a seasonal calibration scheme was proposed, in which SWAT was calibrated separately for the dry and wet periods and the “optimal” simulation results of these two periods were combined into a complete runoff series. An extended SWAT model incorporating with the proposed seasonal calibration scheme, named SWAT-SC was constructed and compared with the original SWAT to simulate daily runoff in the Jinjiang watershed dominated by a typical subtropical monsoon climate in southeastern China. The study reveals that when Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) of the original SWAT model indicated a satisfied model performance in a wet season or a whole year, it may not guaranty acceptable performance for the dry period. A significant improvement was achieved by using SWAT-SC for simulating runoffs in the dry period, and although not as notably as the dry period, improvements for runoff simulation of the wet and overall periods were observed as well...|$|R
40|$|Baseflow is an {{important}} component in hydrological modeling. This process is usually modeled by using the linear aquifer storage–discharge relation approach, although the outflow from groundwater aquifers is nonlinear. To identify the accuracy of baseflow estimates in rivers dominated by snow and/or glacier melt in arid and cold northwestern China, a nonlinear storage–discharge relationship for use in SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tools) modeling was developed and applied to the Manas River basin in the Tianshan Mountains. Linear reservoir models and a digital filter program were used for comparisons. Meanwhile, numerical analysis of flow recession curves from 78 river gauge stations revealed variation in the coefficients of the nonlinear relationship. It was found that the nonlinear reservoir model can improve the streamflow simulation, especially for <b>low-flows.</b> The highest Nash–Sutcliff efficiency and lowest Percent Bias were obtained when compared to the one- or two-linear reservoir approach.

Further, this is the first paper that establishes a link between the convexity of the flow-performance relation and implicit risk incentives of hedge fund managers. In a first stage, we employ a switching regression approach to explain quarterly hedge fund flows, based on defining two regimes where either inflows or outflows are dominating, combined with a flexible functional form for each of the equations, allowing for a nonlinear impact of past performance at different lags. We characterize the local and global convexities of the relationship by several measures and investigate how they vary over time. In a second stage, we find evidence of significant risk-shifting behaviour of hedge fund managers in response to changes over time and in the cross section in convex payoffs implied by the flow-performance relation.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the role played}} by {{vegetation}} parameters, necessary to the hydrological distributed modeling, is investigated focusing on the correct use of remote sensing products for the evaluation of hydrological losses in the soil water balance. The research was carried out over a medium-sized river basin in Southern Italy, where the vegetation status is characterised through a data-set of multi-temporal NDVI images. The model adopted uses one layer of vegetation whose status is defined by the Leaf Area Index (LAI), which is often obtained from NDVI images. The inherent problem is that the vegetation heterogeneity – including soil disturbances – has a large influence on the spectral bands and so the relation between LAI and NDVI is not unambiguous. We present a rationale for the basin scale calibration of a non-linear NDVI-LAI regression, based on the comparison between NDVI values and literature LAI estimations of the vegetation cover in recognized landscape elements of the study catchment. Adopting a process-based model (DREAM) with a distributed parameterisation, the influence of different NDVI-LAI regression models on main features of water balance predictions is investigated. The results show a significant sensitivity of the hydrological losses and soil water regime to the alternative LAI estimations. These crucially affects the model performances especially in <b>low-flows</b> simulation and in the identification of the intermittent regime...|$|R

40|$|In-channel fine-sediment storage, {{especially}} in areas draining highly erodible materials, constitutes {{an important part}} of the sediment budget of a drainage basin. This phenomenon occurs when sediment production in the basin is greater than the river's transport capacity, resulting in large accumulations of fines along the river channel. In-channel sediment storage has been studied in a similar to 3 -km channel length reach of the River Isabena during an average hydrological year (2007 - 2008). The River Isabena drains an area of 445 km(2). It is located at the Southern Pyrenees and the channel network flows through an area of extremely erodible materials producing an enormous amount of suspended sediment. Total in-channel sediment storage for the study period has been estimated at approximately 679 t, which equates to 0. 32 % of the annual suspended sediment load calculated at the basin's outlet. Sediment storage values obtained in the study reach have been extrapolated to the whole main channel length (45 km), resulting in a total storage of 9, 810 t, representing the 4. 7 % of the annual total load. In-channel storage shows both temporal and spatial trends. In relation to the former, sediment is continuously accumulated during <b>low-flows</b> while the latter shows that sediment accumulation increases in the downstream direction. Results suggest that the fine-grained sediment stored in the channel may represent an important component of the suspended sediment budget of rivers draining highly erodible materials such as the River Isabena.

Study focus: We {{assessed}} daily streamflow predictions by applying two simple conceptual models and one complex model for four major gauged watersheds of the study area and compared these modelâs capabilities in reproducing observed streamflow in the time and quantile domains. New hydrological insights for the region: The multi-criteria based model comparison shows that the simple conceptual models performed best in smaller watersheds for reproducing observed streamflow in the time domain, whereas the complex model performed best for the largest watershed. For reproducing observed streamflow in the quantile domain, the simple conceptual models performed best for simulation of high, moist, mid-range, and dry-flows in the Gilgelabay watershed; of dry and <b>low-flows</b> in the Gummera and Megech watersheds; and of high flows in the Ribb watershed. For the remaining flow ranges of each watershed, the complex model performed better. This study also addressed the sensitivity of the complex model for the number of partitioned subbasins. In the largest watershed, the performance of the complex model improved when the number of partitioned subbasins was increased. This finding indicates that the distributed models are especially applicable for the complex watershed because of its physical heterogeneity.

40|$|Water {{companies}} in the United Kingdom have considered climate change in their water resources plans {{for more than a}} decade through studies funded by UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR). This paper presents an initial assessment of the impact of the UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP 09) on river flows at a national scale for the 2020 s under the A 1 B scenario and the implications for water resource planning. A daily hydrological modelling framework based on two conceptual model structures and the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology has been applied to 70 catchments across the UK. A Latin Hypercube Sampling approach was adopted to handle the probabilistic nature of UKCP 09. Results show a decrease in mean annual flow over most of the UK, with negative median values of all monthly changes except in winter over the western and northern mountainous areas. Furthermore the results indicate a high likelihood of a significant decline in summer flows. An analysis of variance shows that the main uncertainty in river flow changes comes from the spread in climate projections. Finally results are found to be consistent with a previous UKWIR assessment based on individual projections from 6 Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the A 2 scenario. The reduction in summer <b>low-flows,</b> critical for water resources, appears however more limited with UKCP 09.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The rapid {{increase}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) over the last 250 years {{has led to the}} absorption of approximately 550 billion tons of anthropogenic CO₂ by the global ocean. This oceanic uptake of CO₂ has resulted in decreasing pH and alterations to carbonate chemistry, threatening many ecologically and economically important marine species. The majority of biological production takes place on highly dynamic coastal margins, which require instrumentation capable of high-frequency measurements. In practice, measurements of sufficient resolution often do not include all required analytical parameters necessary to constrain the carbonate chemistry in order to investigate biogeochemical processes relevant to ocean acidification. This report provides a proof-of-concept for the development of an instrument designed to make autonomous measurements of the partial pressure of CO₂ (PCO₂) and total CO₂ (TCO₂) in a continuous sample stream at high frequency, based on combination of two existing measurement techniques. The objective is to provide measurements sufficient to constrain the carbonate chemistry in ocean waters while capturing the variability seen over short timescales in estuaries and on coastal margins. By constraining the carbonate chemistry and performing real time calculations of the saturation state of calcium carbonate and other carbonate parameters, this instrument can be utilized as a monitoring tool for fisheries in need of high resolution time series carbonate data. In our combined system, PCO₂ is determined by measuring the infrared absorbance due to CO₂ in the re-circulated gaseous headspace of a shower-type equilibrator. For TCO₂ analysis, a <b>low-flowing</b> seawater sample stream is acidified and passed through a microporous membrane contactor.

40|$|Vegetative {{treatment}} areas (VTA) {{are commonly}} used as an alternative means of treating agricultural wastewater. Little information exists regarding {{the effectiveness of these}} VTAs at removing nutrients in the subsurface. Furthermore, current design methods and recommendations do not fully incorporate hydrological processes that govern likelihood of soil saturation and surface discharge. The first study utilized an applied tracer and a simple binary mixing model within two VTAs to characterize incoming wastewater movement following an event. Results demonstrated that concentrated surface flow paths existed within both VTAs. Rapid preferential flow to shallow monitoring wells was also observed. A shallow restrictive layer (i. e. fragipan) likely exacerbated surface flow but restricted runoff movement to deeper groundwater. A more comprehensive VTA design process is called for that accounts for shallow soils and antecedent moisture conditions. The importance of regular maintenance and design measures to prevent the formation of concentrated flow paths to prevent surface discharge was made apparent. The second study investigated subsurface nutrient removal within three VTAs (WNY, CNY-East, and CNY-West) receiving silage bunker runoff. This {{was one of the first}} studies performed on VTAs receiving this type of wastewater. Conservative tracer and nutrient data from a monitoring well network within each VTA were used to calculate mass balances. Mass removal of ammonium in all three VTAs was over 60 %. Very little nitrate entered or exited any of the VTAs. Removal of soluble reactive phosphorus varied, and actually increased in one VTA where soluble reactive phosphorus loading was relatively low. Results also demonstrated that nutrient reduction mechanisms other than vegetative uptake can be significant within VTAs and that groundwater impairment from leaching of nitrate beneath the VTAs was not likely. Results highlighted the importance of capturing concentrated <b>low-flows</b> in VTA systems. The third study built upon the findings of the first study.

40|$|The key {{findings}} from this study are: • There is no evidence of any old waters or of any mineralisation indicative of long or deep flow paths from an off-island source; • The unpredictable nature of the so called “deep aquifer” (25 m plus beneath the water table) does not warrant its further exploitation; • The uppermost “shallow aquifer” can best be exploited by dispersed small volume sources • The groundwater body and the surface water body are part of a single water system; • Reduction in aquifer yield with depth provides a self protection mechanism to the aquifer; • Based on the survey conducted there is a consensus on Guernsey that the renewable water resource is finite and that it needs safeguarding. The annual volume of water supplied by the States of Guernsey Water Board is approximately 5 Mm 3. Additional abstraction from private sources may amount to a further 1. 5 Mm 3, particularly in a relatively dry year. The public water supply derives from surface water courses and is stored in surface water reservoirs. The private abstractions draw on groundwater (wells, boreholes and springs), roof top collection and surface water abstraction. The groundwater body and the surface water body are part of a single water system. Groundwater discharge (or baseflow) from springs and seepages into streams maintains the surface water <b>low-flows</b> during prolonged dry weather. The groundwater body is itself divisible into three contiguous levels. Where present, there is an upper granular aquifer within superficial deposits of alluvium and raised beach material. Beneath this is the main aquifer which is contained within the shallow weathered zone of the bedrock, which is underlain by a deeper aquifer with groundwater flow restricted to occasional dilated fractures. Bedrock mainly consists of ancient crystalline metamorphic rocks. Generally, the water table lies within 3 to 8 metres of the ground surface, and the main aquifer, in which the majority of groundwater flow takes place, is situated in a 25 m zone immediately below the water table. Beneath this depth there is some groundwater flow in deeper fractures, but borehole yields from the greater depths are commonly less than those from the shallow weathered zone. This reduction in aquifer yield with depth provides an element of self protection, whereby baseflow discharge from the aquifer and abstraction from boreholes is automatically reduced as the water table falls. Groundwater recharge occurs in the High Parishes and flows south to the coast and north-west to the coast. There is little potential for groundwater flow beneath the low-lying land towards {{the northern part of the}} island.

25|$|In {{the period}} 1960-2010 average {{precipitation}} in the Upper Barada basin {{has remained the}} same. While the yield of the Fijeh springs has declined from an annual average of 9.5m3/second in 1967-71 to 5.5 m3/second in 1996-2000, {{this is due to}} pumping from the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the springs that was begun in 1981 in order to supply more water to Damascus during the dry season. Climate models project a reduction of rainfall and an increase of temperatures for the Eastern Mediterranean. Hydrological and meteorological data are considered a state secret in Syria, so that data are only indirectly available. According {{to a study by the}} Karlsruhe Institute of Technology conducted in 2010 and financed by German development cooperation funds, the yield of the Fijeh springs during the critical <b>low-flow</b> period from July to December is projected to decline by about 5% in the period 2021-2050 compared to the historical average during 1962-1991. However, the model projects a stronger decline of 15% for the distant future (2069-2098) compared to the base period, and even stronger declines of up to 50% during the springs' high-flow period in March–May.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources of}} water supply for Damascus are the Fijeh and Barada springs. The Fijeh springs are {{a group of three}} large karstic springs - The Fijeh main spring, the Fijeh side spring and the Harouch spring - in the Barada gorge. The three springs used to {{contribute}} half the flow of the Barada River. The Barada spring is located North of the Fijeh springs close to the Lebanese border. The entire flow of all these springs is captured today, including through wells positioned around the springs. This is why it appears during the summer that the Barada spring has dried up, while its flow is actually being captured and transferred along the river to supply various towns in the Barada gorge as well as Damascus itself with drinking water. Water from the Barada and Fijeh springs is transferred to a mixing station near Dummar where it is being chlorinated and distributed to the city. The city’s water supply is complemented by well fields in the plains around the city. The flow of the springs is highly seasonal, lagging several months behind the precipitation because of snow melt and the karstic characteristics of the rocks from which they emerge. The flow of the Figeh springs is less than 4 m3/second during the <b>low-flow</b> period from July to December. However, it reaches a maximum of more than 12m3/second (average 1962-1991) in April.|$|E
500|$|The Atlas of Oregon ranks 31 {{rivers in}} the state by average streamflow; the top five are the Columbia, Snake, Willamette, Santiam, and Umpqua. [...] Not all Oregon rivers with high average flows are on this list of longest streams because neither their main stems nor any of their tributaries (including what are called [...] "forks") are at least 50miles (80km) long. High-flow streams {{mentioned}} in the Atlas but {{not included in this}} long-stream list are the Metolius, Hood, Youngs, and Coos rivers. On the other hand, the list includes four <b>low-flow</b> intermittent streams—Dry River, Rattlesnake Creek, Rock Creek, and Dry Creek—that cross parts of the Oregon High Desert.|$|E
