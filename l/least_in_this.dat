25|$|If the two {{principles}} are authentically Plato's and the monistic interpretation is correct, then Plato's metaphysics strongly resembles the Neo-Platonic {{systems of the}} Roman Imperial period. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato is, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus, the founder of Neo-Platonism, as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to {{the first generation of}} Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.|$|E

The crypto-Maoist campaign of singing red songs {{is also likely to}} be stopped. However, other aspects of the Chongqing model—in particular the egalitarian social policies, subsidized education and low-income housing projects—drew grassroots and popular support. At <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> regard, the successes of the Chongqing Model are likely to be remembered and studied, according to analyst Wu Zhong.|$|E

2500|$|The USGS geologists found paleosols {{with organic}} {{material}} {{above and below}} a [...] thick layer of debris flow deposits. The bottom paleosol was radiocarbon dated to 4267 ±38 years Before Present (BP), and the top one was dated to 3720±50 years BP. This means that, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area, the bed aggraded [...] in 550 years, for an average rate of about [...] per year (though the aggradation occurs only during short-lived events).

2500|$|A retired {{journalist}} for The New York Times, William K. Stevens wrote: [...] "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change {{said the}} likelihood was 90 percent to 99 percent that emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks, were the dominant {{cause of the}} observed warming of the last 50 years. In the panel's parlance, this level of certainty is labeled 'very likely'. Only rarely does scientific odds-making provide a more definite answer than that, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> branch of science, and it describes the endpoint, so far, of a progression.".|$|E
2500|$|The Novial system {{displays}} a systematic correspondence between singular and corresponding plural forms (i.e. vu, vus; lo, los; la, las; lu, lus; le, les). Strictly speaking [...] "we" [...] {{is not the}} plural of [...] "I", because [...] "many I’s" [...] is nonsensical. Jespersen suggested that nu, the singular of nus, {{could be used as}} a [...] "royal we". The optional marking of sex in Novial, especially in the third person plural, permits greater flexibility than in Esperanto, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case. Exactly the same system is applied to other pronouns and to nouns with natural sex differences.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is also a}} view of Gaudiya Vaishnavas that Sanatana Goswamis Brihad Bhagavatamrita, [...] has {{illustrated}} this principle, {{not just}} in terms of comparative cosmology or avatara hierarchy as in Vaishnava Pancaratra, but also in terms of cosmology of adi-rasa. The cosmological principle of the four dhamas (with a separate place for the last two: Vaikuntha - abode of Vishnu or Narayana, tad-ekatma rupa, in transcendence, and Goloka as abode of Svayam Bhagavan in transcendence) is the key of the graphical presentation, but it is also an answer to the dilemma.
