40|$|A recent {{decision}} by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission allows entrants to interconnect with incumbent telephone companies for purposes of providing switched (public) long-distance service. The decision represents a potentially very important step towards promoting competition in Canada's telecommunications industry; however, continued regulation of the industry, restrictions on foreign ownership and mandated cross-subsidization of <b>local</b> <b>access</b> from toll <b>revenues</b> raise grounds for concern that the actual consequences of the decision will fall short of the potential. ...|$|R

First, we show that the dual ownership of a local telephone network and a cable network, compared with separate ownership, may increase or decrease incentives to invest in upgrading the cable television network. Second, we argue that separate ownership of the two networks is important to promote competition in <b>local</b> <b>access.</b> Cable Networks, <b>Local</b> <b>Access,</b> Competition...|$|R

40|$|Competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> {{networks}} and <b>local</b> loop unbundling have been central in the 1999 {{review of the}} EU communications regulatory framework. These issues also figure high on national policy agendas. Competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> is thought to stimulate internet penetration {{and the development of}} e-commerce and interactive applications, all key elements for the move towards a 'new economy'. Following an analysis of different ways to promote competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> {{networks and}} a review of the respective EU debate, this paper then concentrates on the relevant developments in Britain. At a broader level, it explores the interplay between EU debates and British policies and actions and the scope for harmonisation of national regulatory regimes. At a more specific level, the paper assesses the evolution of <b>local</b> <b>access</b> competition and relates this to the role of regulation and the question of facilities- vs. services-based entry. It is argued that the introduction of new market restructuring initiatives, such as local loop unbundling, requires a larger involvement by regulators, particularly in the early stages, rather than just a reliance on general competition rules.

40|$|In a {{distributed}} {{programming environment}} with location transparency, fast access to remote resources is absolutely critical for efficient program execution - {{but it is}} not sufficient. Locality optimization will try to group objects according to their communication patterns and replace remote <b>access</b> by <b>local</b> <b>access</b> whenever possible. Locality optimization {{is based on the assumption}} that <b>local</b> <b>access</b> always is much faster than remote access. Using conventional communication packages like RMI, this assumption is void. A remote object always needs an access layer around it to allow access to the object by means other than direct reference. Transparent access to a remote object also needs to overcome this access layer, even in a <b>local</b> <b>access.</b> Direct reference access can not be used, because of different parameter passing semantics. In this paper we present techniques to provide transparent <b>local</b> <b>access</b> to potentially remote objects in the same magnitude as direct Java access...|$|R

40|$|Stakeholder {{participation}} {{has become}} {{widely viewed as}} an essential feature of sustainable policy and decision-making. As a result the provision for stakeholder participation has been included within a range of decision-making processes but without necessarily ensuring that its structure is appropriate to the context. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 legislation required the creation of <b>Local</b> <b>Access</b> Forums to advise on public access to the English countryside. However guidance on their role and structure was vague and in 2005 a government commissioned survey indicated that many <b>Local</b> <b>Access</b> Forums were experiencing a lack of empowerment. Through observation of four <b>Local</b> <b>Access</b> Forums (LAFs) {{over a period of}} two years it was possible to compare their experiences with the findings of the government commissioned survey. One of the four LAFs studied provided indications of strategies leading to outcomes that were satisfactory for both participants and organisers.
