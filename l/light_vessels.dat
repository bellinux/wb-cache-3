5|$|In February 1793, the National Convention that governed the French Republic {{expanded}} the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars by declaring war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. The <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> of the British Royal Navy had {{been preparing for}} the conflict for several months, having concentrated in June 1792 at Spithead {{in anticipation of the}} outbreak of war. These ships were stationed in large numbers in the North Sea and the English Channel to defend British maritime trade against the threat of French commerce raiders operating from the French Channel ports. The French Navy by contrast was riven with the same social divisions that had divided France {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution four years earlier. This had led to the collapse of the professional officer corps and the elimination of the rank of trained seamen-gunners on the grounds of elitism, resulting in a dearth of experience both in seamanship and naval combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of war between Britain and France {{in the spring}} of 1793 came at a time of differing fortunes for the navies of the two countries. The Royal Navy had been at a state of heightened readiness since 1792 in preparation for the conflict, while the French Navy had still not recovered from the upheavals of the French Revolution, which had resulted in the collapse of the naval hierarchy and a dearth of experienced officers and seamen. French naval strategy early in the war was to send squadrons and <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> to operate along British trade routes, in order to disrupt British mercantile operations. This resulted in Britain forming its merchant ships into convoys for mutual protection, escorted by warships while in European waters to defend against roving attacks by French ships.|$|E
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated in a timely manner. Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|E

25|$|In {{his younger}} days, Gan Ning {{was known to}} be very {{energetic}} and eager to behave like a youxia or vigilante. He gathered a group of wayward young men, with him as their chief, and engaged in piracy. They were armed with either bows or crossbows, wore feathers in their hats and tied bells on their bodies. The ringing of the bells alerted people to the presence of Gan Ning and his gang. Gan Ning's plundering and murderous ways earned him infamy throughout Ba Commandery. On land, he and his gang travelled by riding on horses or in chariots in a certain formation; on water, they sailed on <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> linked together. They were dressed in elaborate and flamboyant garments to attract attention wherever they went. When they stopped at a certain location, they used silk to tie their boats to the jetties; when they were departing, they cut the silk and abandoned it as a display of their extravagance.|$|E

500|$|SMS Blitz was a [...] of the Prussian Navy (later the Imperial German Navy) {{that was}} {{launched}} in 1862. A small vessel, armed with only three light guns, Blitz served during all three wars of German unification in the 1860s and early 1870s. The ship was present during the Battle of Heligoland in May 1864 during the Second Schleswig War, but was too slow to engage the Danish squadron. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, she operated against the Kingdom of Hanover in the North Sea, but did not see extensive action. In August 1870, Blitz and three other <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> attacked the French blockade force in the Baltic Sea during the Franco-Prussian War, but they withdrew without either side scoring any hits. During her peacetime career, Blitz {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean Sea twice, in 1863 and 18671868. She was employed as a fisheries protection ship, a guard ship, and a survey vessel in the early 1870s, before being decommissioned in 1875 and broken up for scrap in 1878. Parts of her machinery were reused in the gunboat [...]|$|E
500|$|Although Greta did not {{directly}} track over land as a tropical storm or hurricane, {{the size of the}} system contributed to large waves, exceeding [...] in height over a large expanse of the Atlantic. Impacts from the storm were felt as far away as the eastern United States. The National Weather Bureau warned ships {{in the vicinity of the}} system to take precautions. St. Croix was nearly isolated and stressed into an emergency due to Greta after the storm's swells destroyed docks and prevented ships carrying food from reaching the island. Several <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> were destroyed by Greta's gale-force winds and only schooners with little carrying capacity were able to make it to the island. Along the coast of Jacksonville, Florida alone, coastal structures sustained roughly $1.2million (1956 USD; $9.6million 2009 USD) in damages. In Puerto Rico, waves up to [...] caused significant damage and resulted in the death of one person after he did not evacuate his home. Swells up to [...] were recorded in the Virgin Islands. In Guadeloupe, 80% of the port installations were destroyed by rough seas. In all, damages from Greta amounted to roughly $3.6million (1956 USD; $ USD).|$|E

2500|$|On 28 June, having {{entrusted}} {{itself to}} the Virgen del Carmen, the Allied fleet sailed from Cartagena, arriving off Algiers on 10 July. Two days later at 8:30 AM, the bombardment began with the Spanish ships opening fire. It was kept up until 4:20 PM, during which time about 600 bombs, 1,440 cannon balls and 260 shells were fired over the city, compared to 202 bombs and 1,164 cannonballs fired by the Algerians. Major damage {{to the city and}} its fortifications and a large fire were observed. [...] An attack by <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> of the Algerian fleet, composed of 67 ships, was repulsed, four of them being destroyed. The Allied casualties were minimal: 6 killed and 9 wounded, most of them due to accidents with the fuses of the bombs.

60|$|This {{was true}} enough. Just as the captain spoke, {{the object of}} the order was made {{sufficiently}} apparent, by all the <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> to windward of the French fleet, bearing up together, until they brought the wind abaft their beams, when away they glided to leeward, like floating objects that have suddenly struck a swift current. Before this change in their course, these frigates and corvettes had been struggling along, the seas meeting them on their weather-bows, at the rate of about two knots or rather less; whereas, their speed was now quadrupled, and in a few minutes, the whole of them had sailed through the different intervals in their main line, and had formed as before, nearly half a league to leeward of it. Here, {{in the event of an}} action, their principal duties would have been to succour crippled ships that might be forced out of their allotted stations during the combat. All this Sir Gervaise viewed with disgust. He had hoped that his enemy might have presumed on the state of the elements, and suffered his <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> to maintain their original positions.|$|E
60|$|On Friday morning Howard sailed for Dover {{to take in}} the {{supplies}} that were so sorely needed. The Earl of Sussex, who was in command of the castle, gave him all that he had, and the stores taken from the prizes came up in <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> and were divided among the fleet, and in the evening the English fleet again sailed out and took up its place {{in the rear of the}} Armada. On Saturday morning the weather changed. After six days of calm and sunshine it began to blow hard from the west, with driving showers. The Spaniards, having no pilots who knew the coasts, anchored off Calais. The English fleet, closely watching their movements, brought up two miles astern.|$|E
60|$|The midshipmen, however, {{were able}} to tell Jack {{that they had not}} been {{altogether}} idle, as the fleet had at last, on the 22d of May, been set in motion, and they had but two days before returned from their expedition. All the <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> of the English and French fleets had taken part in it. The fort of Yenikale which commanded the entrance of the Bay of Kertch had been captured, the batteries silenced, and the town occupied, and in four days after the squadron had entered the straits of Kertch they had destroyed 245 Russian vessels employed in carrying provisions to the Russian army in the Crimea. Besides this, enormous magazines of corn and flour were destroyed at Berdiansk, Genitchi and Kertch, and at the latter place immense quantities of military and naval stores also fell into our hands. Had this expedition taken place in October instead of May, it is probable that the Russians would have been unable to maintain their hold of Sebastopol.|$|E

60|$|From {{the little}} strip of eastern and {{southern}} coast on which they first settled, the English advanced slowly into the interior by the valleys of the great rivers, and finally swarmed across the central dividing ridge into the basins of the Severn and the Irish Sea. Up the open river mouths they could make their way in their shallow-bottomed boats, as the Scandinavian pirates did three centuries later; and {{when they reached the}} head of navigation in each stream for the small draught of their <b>light</b> <b>vessels,</b> they probably took to the land and settled down at once, leaving further inland expeditions to their sons and successors. For this second step in the Teutonic colonisation of Britain we have some few traditional accounts, which seem somewhat more trustworthy than those of the first settlement. Unfortunately, however, they apply for the most part only to the kingdom of Wessex, and not to the North and the Midlands, where such details would be of far greater value.|$|E
60|$|Hawkeye was not mistaken; {{for when}} the Hurons found their course was likely to throw them behind their chase, they {{rendered}} it less direct, until, by gradually bearing more and more obliquely, the two canoes were ere long, gliding on parallel lines, within two hundred yards of each other. It now became entirely a trial of speed. So rapid was {{the progress of the}} <b>light</b> <b>vessels,</b> that the lake curled in their front, in miniature waves, and their motion became undulating by its own velocity. It was, perhaps, owing to this circumstance, in addition to the necessity of keeping every hand employed at the paddles, that the Hurons had not immediate recourse to their fire-arms. The exertions of the fugitives were too severe to continue long, and the pursuers had the advantage of numbers. Duncan observed, with uneasiness, that the scout began to look anxiously about him, as if searching for some further means of assisting their flight.|$|E
60|$|Those {{who have}} {{witnessed}} such a scene can alone conceive {{the state of}} bustle in Fairport. The windows were glancing with a hundred lights, which, appearing and disappearing rapidly, indicated the confusion within doors. The women of lower rank assembled and clamoured in the market-place. The yeomanry, pouring from their different glens, galloped through the streets, some individually, some in parties of five or six, as they had met on the road. The drums and fifes of the volunteers beating to arms, were blended with {{the voice of the}} officers, the sound of the bugles, and the tolling of the bells from the steeple. The ships in the harbour were lit up, and boats from the armed vessels added to the bustle, by landing men and guns destined to assist in the defence of the place. This part of the preparations was superintended by Taffril with much activity. Two or three <b>light</b> <b>vessels</b> had already slipped their cables and stood out to sea, in order to discover the supposed enemy.|$|E
