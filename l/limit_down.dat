50|$|The {{contribution}} {{limits for}} the Solo 401(k) {{are the same}} as a standard ERISA 401(k). They are broken down into a profit sharing contribution which comes from the employer, and a salary deferral contribution which comes from the employee. However, {{due to the fact that}} in a Solo 401(k) the plan holder is acting both as employer and employee, the actual percentages assume a more meaningful role. If the plan holder is filing as a Sole Proprietor or Single Member LLC (which is true in most cases), then the limit is capped at 20% of the self-employed income plus $18,000 for 2016, the same as 2015. Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(3) states that the amount of employer contributions is limited to 25 percent of the entity’s income subject to self-employment tax. Schedule C sole-proprietors must do an added calculation starting with earned income to determine their maximum contribution, which, in effect, brings the maximum 25% of compensation <b>limit</b> <b>down</b> to 20% of earned income.

5000|$|Surface {{monitoring}} is used {{to check}} the integrity of caps on waste and check on borehole monitoring. It may give preliminary indications of the migration of gas off-site. The typical regulatory limit of methane is 500 parts per million (ppm) by volume (in California, AB 32 may push this <b>limit</b> <b>down</b> to 200 ppm).

Surface monitoring {{can be broken down}} into Instantaneous and Integrated. Instantaneous monitoring consists of walking over the surface of the landfill, while carrying a flame ionization detector (FID). Integrated consists of walking over the surface of the landfill, while pumping a sample into a bag. The sample is then read with a FID or sent to a lab for full analysis. Integrated regulatory limits tend to be 50 ppm or less.|$|E
