5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across his chest as he <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
25|$|The couple's son, Daniel Christopher Benoit, {{also died}} of asphyxia, {{apparently}} killed as he <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> on Saturday morning. Then on Sunday evening Benoit {{committed suicide in}} his weight room, when he used a weight lifting machine to break his own neck. He placed copies of the Bible alongside the bodies {{of his wife and}} son, as well as a third Bible on his weight lifting machine. Since Benoit's suicide, numerous explanations for his actions have been proposed, including brain damage, steroid abuse, and a failing marriage. The incident led to numerous media accounts, and a federal investigation into steroid abuse in professional wrestling.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{round the}} place, sir. Six o'clock doesn't often find me <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> summer or winter. What's {{the use of}} <b>laying</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> when one has had enough of sleep?" ...|$|R

25|$|E: As I <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> that night, I overheard {{the three}} doctors {{tell my parents}} {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|Mwanje {{had little}} {{military}} value {{but it has}} been proposed that the rebels may have hoped to find weapons and ammunition there. Led by Jonathan Chigwinya, the insurgents stormed one of the houses and killed the plantation's stock manager, Robert Ferguson, with a spear as he <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> reading a newspaper. Two of the colonists, John Robertson and his wife Charlotte, escaped into the cotton fields and walked [...] to a neighbouring plantation to raise the alarm. One of the Robertsons' African servants, who remained loyal, was killed by the attackers.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Tyler's life, he {{suffered}} from poor health. As he aged, {{he suffered}} more frequently from colds during the winter. On January 12, 1862, after complaining of chills and dizziness, he vomited and collapsed. He was treated, but his health did not improve, and he made {{plans to return to}} Sherwood Forest by the 18th. As he <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> the night before, he began suffocating, and Julia summoned his doctor. Just after midnight, Tyler took a sip of brandy, and told his doctor, [...] "I am going. Perhaps it is best." [...] He died shortly thereafter, most likely due to a stroke.|$|E

5000|$|The song, says Carey, is {{from the}} {{perspective}} of her Tennessee character Krystal, an aspiring singer. [...] "The song has its own arc," [...] Carey said. [...] "She begins by telling us where she started, like she <b>lays</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and wonders where she left herself. A lot of people go through that sort of thing. It's kind of about empowerment." ...|$|R

In the video, she sings [...] "When I <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> I touch myself and I think of you". The video then shows Gaga rehearsing for the festival and displays in pink font, [...] "We wanna give you #sexdreams'". Gaga also promoted the song on social media by posting song lyrics ("Last night damn, you were in my #SexDreams doing really nasty things"), and encouraging use of a hashtag containing lyrics (#whenilayinbeditouchmyselfandthinkofyou).|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to look at her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night I <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> so blue / Cause' I {{realized}} the truth/ They can't love me like you / I tried to find somebody new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E

2500|$|When viewers {{realized}} that Willow was {{falling in love}} with Tara, Whedon remembered that some threatened to boycott the show, complaining [...] "You made Willow a fag", to which he responded, [...] "Bye. We'll miss you a whole lot." [...] However, he also said, [...] "For every (negative) post, there's somebody saying, 'You made my life a lot easier because I now have someone I can relate to on screen'." [...] Gay characters had been portrayed before on television, and at the time the popular sitcom Will & Grace was on the air. Lesbian-themed HBO special If These Walls Could Talk 2 won an Emmy. Twenty-three television shows depicted a gay character of some kind in 2000. However, these other characters were mostly desexualized, none were partnered or shown consistently affectionate towards the same person. Willow and Tara's relationship became the first long-term lesbian relationship on U.S. television. Jane magazine hailed Willow and Tara as a bold representation of gay relationship, remarking that [...] "they hold hands, slow-dance and <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> at night. You won't find that kind of normalcy on Will and Grace." [...] Despite Whedon's intentions of not making Buffy about overcoming issues, he said Willow's exploration of her sexuality [...] "turned {{out to be one of}} the most important things we've done on the show".|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterwards}} on August 6, 1871, Hardin, {{his cousin}} Gip Clements, and a rancher friend named Charles Couger {{put up for}} {{the night at the}} American House Hotel after an evening of gambling. Clements and Hardin shared one room, with Couger in the adjacent room. All three had been drinking heavily. Sometime during the evening, Hardin was awakened by loud snoring coming from Couger's room. He first shouted several times for the man to [...] "roll over" [...] and then, irritated by the lack of response, drunkenly fired several bullets through the shared wall in an apparent effort to awaken him. Couger was hit in the head by the second bullet as he <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and was killed instantly. Although Hardin may not have intended to kill Couger, he had violated an ordinance prohibiting firing a gun within the city limits. Half-dressed and still drunk, he and Clements exited through a second-story window onto the roof of the hotel. He saw Hickok arrive with four policemen. [...] "Now, I believed," [...] Hardin wrote, [...] "that if Wild Bill found me in a defenseless condition he would take no explanation, but would kill me to add to his reputation." [...] A newspaper reported, [...] "A man was killed in his bed at a hotel in Abilene, Monday night, by a desperado called Arkansas. The murderer escaped. This was his sixth murder." [...] Hardin leapt from the roof into the street and hid in a haystack {{for the rest of the}} night. He then stole a horse and rode to the cow camp 35 miles outside town. Hardin claimed he ambushed lawman Tom Carson and two other deputies there. According to Hardin, he did not kill them but forced them to remove all their clothing and walk back to Abilene. Carson denied the incident ever took place. The next day, Hardin left for Texas, never to return to Abilene.|$|E
2500|$|Upon their marriage, Thomas {{moved into}} his wife’s house, at Chelsea Manor in London, {{where she lived}} with her step-daughter, the 14-year-old Elizabeth. Thomas was the uncle of Elizabeth's half-brother, and the newly wed husband of her step-mother, and their family roles {{regarding}} each other were, perhaps, unclear. Now, living {{under the same roof}} as Elizabeth, Thomas became more than a little familiar, if not intimate, with Elizabeth, indulging in daily romps with her, tickling her, and slapping her on her behind as she lay in her bed, or coming into her room in his nightclothes. Her governess, Kat Ashley, thought this scandalous, and reported it to Catherine. [...] Indignant, Thomas retorted, 'By God's precious soul, I mean no evil, and I will not leave it!' [...] At first, Catherine dismissed the behaviour as just innocent fun, and even joined in the romps on a few occasions. Elizabeth's feelings regarding this behaviour are unknown, but it was said that she bore Thomas some degree of affection. And though her governess, Kat Ashley, [...] "bade him go away in shame," [...] she found him more amusing than dangerous. When Catherine was pregnant in the spring of 1548, she had become concerned enough about her husband’s flirtatious relationship with Elizabeth that she sent Elizabeth away to live with Anthony Denny and his wife, Joan Champernowne (Kat Ashley's sister), in Hertfordshire. In June 1548, Catherine and Thomas Seymour moved their household from London to Sudeley Castle, the property granted to Seymour when he became Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary Seymour. In the following days, she became uncharacteristically hostile and delusional. Thomas <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> with her to quiet her, but she did not get better, and died of complications due to childbirth, just before Elizabeth’s 15th birthday. Upon her death, Catherine bequeathed all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the richest men in England. He said he was [...] "amazed" [...] at her death; yet it opened up new opportunities to him, as his eye returned to Elizabeth. From fear or shrewdness, she avoided him, returning, with her governess, Kat Ashley, to her childhood home, Hatfield House.|$|E

I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|R
