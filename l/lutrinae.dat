The morphology of the M 1 supports the inclusion of the species in Enhydra. The functional morphology and the ecology of the reviewed species is discussed and compared to extant lutrines. Adaptations in the postcranial skeleton indicate a very aquatic way of life for Lutra simplicidens, L. trinacriae, L. euxena and, to an even greater extent, Sardolutra. Lutrogale cretensis on the contrary shows a more terrestrial adaptation. Cyrnaonyx shows adaptations similar to Lutra and probably was a stream dweller, thus differing from its extant relative Aonyx. From the dentition and the endocranial cast, conclusions on the feeding habits are drawn. The described Lutra and Sardolutra species were probably all specialized on motile prey, viz. fish. Lutrogale, Algarolutra, Megalenhydris and Cyrnaonyx show adaptations to a mixed diet, consisting of both fish and shellfish, though differences in the feeding habits between those forms are noted also. Enhydra reevei probably fed on shellfish exclusively. In the last part, the phylogeny and palaeogeography of the <b>Lutrinae</b> are discussed.

40|$|Abstract Background Mustelidae, as {{the largest}} and most-diverse family of order Carnivora, {{comprises}} eight subfamilies. Phylogenetic relationships among these Mustelidae subfamilies remain argumentative subjects in recent years. One {{of the main reasons}} is that the mustelids represent a typical example of rapid evolutionary radiation and recent speciation event. Prior investigation has been concentrated on the application of different mitochondrial (mt) sequence and nuclear protein-coding data, herein we employ 17 nuclear non-coding loci (> 15 kb), in conjunction with mt complete genome data (> 16 kb), to clarify these enigmatic problems. Results The combined nuclear intron and mt genome analyses both robustly support that Taxidiinae diverged first, followed by Melinae. <b>Lutrinae</b> and Mustelinae are grouped together in all analyses with strong supports. The position of Helictidinae, however, is enigmatic because the mt genome analysis places it to the clade uniting <b>Lutrinae</b> and Mustelinae, whereas the nuclear intron analysis favores a novel view supporting a closer relationship of Helictidinae to Martinae. This finding emphasizes a need to add more data and include more taxa to resolve this problem. In addition, the molecular dating provides insights into the time scale of the origin and diversification of the Mustelidae subfamilies. Finally, the phylogenetic performances and limits of nuclear introns and mt genes are discussed in the context of Mustelidae phylogeny. Conclusion Our study not only brings new perspectives on the previously obscured phylogenetic relationships among Mustelidae subfamilies, but also provides another example demonstrating the effectiveness of nuclear non-coding loci for reconstructing evolutionary histories in a group that has undergone rapid bursts of speciation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese otter lived {{throughout}} {{four main}} Japanese islands, {{but it has}} not been observed in the wild since 1979 and was declared extinct in 2012. Although recent taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that it should be treated as an independent species, International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List considers it as subspecies of Lutra lutra. Therefore, the taxonomic status of this species needs to be resolved. Here we determined the complete mitochondrial genome of two Japanese otters caught in Kanagawa and Kochi prefectures and five Eurasian otters (L. lutra). We reconstructed a molecular phylogenetic tree to estimate the phylogenetic position of the Japanese otter in <b>Lutrinae</b> using the Japanese otters and the other 11 <b>Lutrinae</b> species on the basis of ND 5 (692 bp) and cytochrome b (1, 140 bp) sequences. We observed that the two Japanese otters had close relationships with Eurasian otters, forming a monophyletic group (100 % bootstrap probability). To elucidate detailed phylogenetic relationships among the Japanese and Eurasian otters, we reconstructed a maximum likelihood tree according to mitochondrial genome sequences (14, 740 bp). The Japanese otter (JO 1) collected in Kanagawa was deeply nested in the Eurasian otter clade, whereas the Japanese otter (JO 2) collected in Kochi formed a distinct independent lineage in the Lutra clade. The estimated molecular divergences time for the ancestral lineages of the Japanese otters was 0. 10 Ma (95 %: 0. 06 - 0. 16 Ma) and 1. 27 Ma (95 %: 0. 98 - 1. 59 Ma) for JO 1 and JO 2 lineages, respectively. Thus, JO 1 was identified as a member of L. lutra; JO 2 represented the old Japanese otter lineage, which may be a distinct new species or subspecies of Lutra. We suggest that the ancestral population of the JO 2 lineage migrated to Japan via the land bridge that existed between western Japanese islands and Asian continent at 1. 27 Ma...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} a concatenated (8492 bp) nuclear-mitochondrial DNA {{data set}} from 44 musteloids (including the first genetic data for Lyncodon patagonicus) with parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic and biogeographic inference and two Bayesian methods of chronological inference. Here {{we show that}} Musteloidea emerged approximately 32. 4 - 30. 9 million years ago (MYA) in Asia, shortly after the greenhouse-icehouse global climate shift at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. During their Oligocene radiation, which proceeded wholly or mostly in Asia, musteloids diversified into four primary divisions: the Mephitidae lineage separated first, succeeded by Ailuridae and the divergence of the Procyonidae and Mustelidae lineages. Mustelidae arose approximately 16. 1 MYA within the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, and extensively diversified in the Miocene, mostly in Asia. The early offshoots of this radiation largely evolved into badger and marten ecological niches (Taxidiinae, Melinae, Mellivorinae, Guloninae, and Helictidinae), whereas the later divergences have adapted to other niches including those of weasels, polecats, minks, and otters (Mustelinae, Ictonychinae, and <b>Lutrinae).</b> Notably, and contrary to traditional beliefs, the morphological adaptations of badgers, martens, weasels, polecats, and minks each evolved independently more than once within Mustelidae. Ictonychinae (which is most closely related to <b>Lutrinae)</b> arose approximately 9. 5 - 8. 9 MYA, most likely in Asia, where it diverged into the Old World Ictonychini (Vormela, Poecilictis, Ictonyx, and Poecilogale) and New World Lyncodontini (Lyncodon and Galictis) lineages. Ictonychini presumably entered Africa during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (at the Miocene-Pliocene transition), which interposed the origins of this clade (approximately 6. 5 - 6. 0 MYA) and its African Poecilictis-Ictonyx-Poecilogale subclade (approximately 4. 8 - 4. 5 MYA). Lyncodontini originated approximately 2. 9 - 2. 6 MYA at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition in South America, slightly after {{the emergence of the}} Panamanian land bridge that provided for the Great American Biotic Interchange. As the genera Martes and Ictonyx (as currently circumscribed) are paraphyletic with respect to the genera Gulo and Poecilogale, respectively, we propose that Pekania and Poecilictis be treated as valid genera and that "Martes" pennanti and "Ictonyx" libyca, respectively, be assigned to these genera...|$|E

A ariranha captura peixes maiores e mais ativos (por exemplo, anostomídeos e grandes caracídeos) do que a lontra, a qual provavelmente vasculha o substrato em trechos rasos de rios em busca de peixes mais lentos, de hábitos sedentários ou noturnos (principalmente pequenos bagres). Outras presas que não peixes (répteis, roedores e macroinvertebrados aquáticos), apesar de pouco comuns na dieta de ambas as espécies, foram mais frequentes na alimentação da lontra do que na da ariranha. Além disso, as ariranhas consumiram peixes de uma maior diversidade de famílias do que a lontra. Neste sentido, a lontra parece ser mais especializada na captura de certos tipos de peixes, mostrando nítida preferência pelo consumo de pequenos bagres da família Doradidae. Os resultados obtidos indicam pequena sobreposição na dieta, porém sem indicação de interações tróficas significativas entre ariranhas e lontras no Parque Nacional do Jaú. The {{giant otter}} (Pteronura brasiliensis) and the neotropical river otter (Lontra longicaudis) are {{two species of}} carnivorous mustelids belonging to the <b>Lutrinae</b> subfamily, which feed mainly on fish. These two species coexist in the Jaú National Park, in Central Brazilian Amazon, and the supposed similarity in the diet could generate interactions between them. This study describes and compares the diets of the giant otter and the neotropical river otter in the lower Jaú and Carabinani rivers, through the analyses of fecal samples collected between 2006 and 2008 (82 giant otter and 75 neotropical river otter). About 85 % of the samples were collected during the dry season, which limited the analyses to the low water period. The giant otter feeds mainly on fish of the Cichlidae (frequency of occurrence = 91. 5 %), Erythrinidae (74. 4 %) and Characidae (29. 3 %) families, while the neotropical river otter consumed mainly fish of the Doradidae (75. 3 %), Loricariidae (26. 7 %) and Cichlidae (25. 3 %) families. The two otter species showed low similarity in their diets (Pianka’s Index = 0. 16), which possibly reflects the use of different microhabitats and foraging tactics and the abundance and richness of fish in the Amazon. The giant otter catch larger and more active fish (eg. anostomids and large characins) than the neotropical river otter, which probably scans the substrate in shallow river parts in search of slower, sedentary and nocturnal (mainly small catfish) fish. Other than fish prey (reptiles, rodents and aquatic invertebrates), although uncommon in the diet of both otter species, were more frequent in the diet of the neotropical river otter that in the giant otter. Moreover, the giant otter ate a greater diversity of fish families than the neotropical river otter. In this sense, the neotropical river otter {{seems to be more}} specialized in capturing certain types of fish, showing a clear preference for the consumption of small catfish of the Doradidae family. The results indicate litter overlap in the diet, but no indication of trophic interaction between giant otters and neotropical river otters in Jaú National Park...|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses infect a {{wide range}} of vertebrates. The {{understanding}} of the deep history and host distribution of retroviruses remains far from complete. Retroviruses can be integrated into their host genomes and occasionally become vertically inherited genomic loci. These integrated retroviruses, known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), provide "molecular fossils" for past retroviral infections and are useful for studying the deep history and ecology of retroviruses. ERVs are highly abundant in vertebrate genomes. However, endogenous foamy viruses and lentiviruses appear to be extremely rare. The primary focus of the research presented here is to discover and analyze novel endogenous foamy viruses and lentiviruses in animal genomes. Foamy virus has been thought to exclusively infect three placental mammal superorders (Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires, and Xenarthra). The discovery of endogenous foamy viral elements (CoeEFV) in the genome of the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) extends the host range of foamy viruses to fish lineages (Appendix A). I demonstrate that foamy viruses have likely codiverged with their vertebrate hosts for more than 407 million years. The discovery of CoeEFV provides evidence for an ancient marine origin of retroviruses. Endogenous foamy virus-like elements (PSFVaye) were also identified within the genome of a Malagasy lemur, the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) (Appendix B). Phylogenetic analysis shows that PSFVaye is divergent from all currently known simian foamy viruses, suggesting a potentially ancient association between foamy viruses and primate species. Another novel endogenous foamy virus (CaEFV) was identified in the genome of the Cape golden mole (Chrysochloris asiatica). The discovery of CaEFV reveals foamy virus infection in the placental mammal superorder Afrotheria and the long-term cospeciation between foamy viruses and placental mammals (Appendix C). Lentivirus has been thought to have a relatively recent origin. Endogenous lentivirus insertions (MELV) were discovered within the genomes of some species of the Weasel family (Mustelidae) (Appendix D). I verified the presence of MELV insertions in the genomes of several species of the <b>Lutrinae</b> and Mustelinae subfamilies but not the Martinae subfamily, which suggests that the lentiviral invasion likely occurred between 8. 8 and 11. 8 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis suggests MELV might represent a novel lentiviral group. The discovery of MELV extends the host range of lentiviruses to the Caniformia. Endogenous lentiviruses (GvaELV) were also identified in the genome of the Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) (Appendix E). Phylogenetic analysis shows that GvaELV is a sister group of all known lentiviruses. The discovery of GvaELV might give a clue to the early evolution of lentiviral genome architecture. In summary, the discoveries and analyses of these novel ERVs provide important insights into the deep history and ecology of foamy viruses and lentiviruses as well as the retroviruses as a whole...|$|E
