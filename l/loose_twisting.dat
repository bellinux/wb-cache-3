25|$|The {{original}} {{base fabric}} {{on which the}} images are embroidered is a woven purple gauze, {{which may have been}} imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple twill or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The <b>looser</b> <b>twist</b> of the yarn {{may be one of the}} reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved.|$|R
60|$|Timber-hitch.--The {{virtues of}} the timber-hitch (fig. 1, p. 326) are, that, {{so long as the}} strain upon it is kept up, it will hold fast; when the strain is taken off, it can be cast loose immediately. A timber-hitch had better have the <b>loose</b> end <b>twisted</b> more than once, if the rope be stiff.|$|R

50|$|For cotton fabrics reeds {{typically}} have between 6 and 90 dents per inch. When the reed {{has a very}} high number of dents per inch, sometimes there are actually two rows of wires which are offset. This is to keep <b>loose</b> fibers from <b>twisting</b> and blocking the shed.|$|R
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric.; Very tattered and dirty. Some areas are {{held together by}} only a few warp yarns. <b>Loose</b> sections have <b>twisted</b> away {{from the direction of}} the rest of the fabric and have become twisted back onto another section. In two of these areas the loose warp and weft yarns have become partially felted to the rest of the fabric. Many of the weft yarns are abraded...|$|R
50|$|Twist {{chewing tobacco}} is a rope-like piece of tobacco twisted together. Unlike most <b>loose</b> leaf tobaccos, <b>twist</b> chewing tobacco {{is usually not}} sweetened. Pieces of twist are either bitten off or cut and then chewed. Some brands of twist include Cotton Boll, Cumberland, and Warren County. Twist chewing tobacco is not widely {{available}} and is mostly found in Appalachia. Historically, twists could also be smoked in a pipe, or ground up into nasal snuff.|$|R

Presently there came along a youth playing a violin and a little girl singing. And a whole party of other children, all loaded with as many grapes as they could carry, came leaping and singing after them; their black hair <b>loose,</b> or sometimes <b>twisted</b> with vine-leaves; their big black eyes dancing with merriment, and their bare, brown legs with glee.|$|R
40|$|Doll {{formed by}} folding a {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric in half, inserting a few small pieces of rock near the center and wrapping palm fiber cords around to form a “neck”. The cord consists of two strands of palm fiber, slightly Z-twisted and tied at both ends with overhand knots. There are several stitches in the fabric. Weft yarns are unevenly spun; thick and thin, <b>loose</b> to tightly <b>twisted</b> and kinked.; Somewhat dirty, stained and worn. There are a few small edge tears and interior holes. There is a large hole in the doll’s “head”. The pieces of rock have fallen out and are included in a separate plastic bag in the bag with the doll. Edges are frayed...|$|R
5000|$|Bareback bronc riding {{began to}} develop as a {{professional}} rodeo sporting event around 1900. The riding equipment used during that era varied. In some cases, the rider simply held onto the horse's mane, called a mane-hold. Others held a <b>loose</b> or <b>twisted</b> rope tied around the horse's girth, and other methods involved using multiple handhold leather riggings based on a surcingle. In the early 1920s, when the old rodeo rules allowing two handed riding were being phased out and replaced with the newer rule of riding with one hand in the rigging and one hand in the air, Earl Bascom invented, designed and made rodeo's first one-hand bareback rigging. The original one-handed rigging was made by Bascom from a section of rubber belting discarded from a threshing machine, with the entire rigging - the handhold and the body - all made as one piece. The handhold was folded back and riveted to {{the main body of}} the rigging, with a 'D' ring riveted on each side for tying the latigos. This rigging was first used at the Raymond Stampede in Alberta, Canada in July 1924. Bascom then refined the design, making his second one-handhold rigging out of leather and rawhide. Sole leather was used for the rigging body. Strips of leather, with rawhide sewed between, were used for the handhold with sheepskin glued under the handholds to protect the knuckles; this arrangement became known as [...] "Bascom's Rigging". Honored in several Halls of Fame, Bascom is now known as the [...] "Father of the Modern-day Bareback Rigging". Variations of Bascom's rigging are still used in rodeos today.|$|R
50|$|Ellen was {{expected}} to work from 5.30 am till 8.00 pm in the mill. Her job entailed looking after half a frame of throstles, this would probably be 32 ends. As she started, an experienced tenter (spinning operative) would have worked the other half, and been on hand to help her. In time she would have taken over the entire frame, with a consequent wage rise. Later this may have increased to two frames- or more as she trained up another youngster. There are three parts to the job: piecing any broken rovings, rovings can break at any time. The two <b>loose</b> ends are <b>twisted</b> back together {{in a way that}} keeps lumps out of the yarn, it is best done by small young fingers rather than large old arthritic ones. The cops have to be creeled, and the new rovings threaded through the rollers and the flyer and secured to the bobbin. Taller workers find this task easy. Full bobbins have to be doffed and replaced with empty ones. The operative has a degree of control over the timing of these two latter tasks- and throughout the shift would try and balance the timing so roving bobbins did not all run out together, producing a smoother and less stressful work flow. Ellen complained to her mother that she couldn't do this and couldn't 'keep all her ends up'.|$|R
40|$|In the United States, {{moist snuff}} {{has been studied}} more widely than other {{distinct}} categories of oral tobacco. In this study, we measured pH, moisture, nicotine (total and unprotonated), and tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs) for other established (<b>twist,</b> <b>loose</b> leaf, plug, and dry snuff without pouch) and emerging oral tobacco products (dry snuff pouch, US-made snus, and dissolvable tobacco). Among the seven product categories, product pH ranged from 4. 7 to 7. 9, and total nicotine concentration spanned from 3. 9 to 40. 1 mg/g. The most readily absorbable form of nicotine (unprotonated nicotine) varied more than 350 -fold, ranging from 0. 01 to 3. 7 mg/g. While the highest total nicotine concentrations were observed in twist products, snus and dissolvable tobacco had the highest unprotonated nicotine levels. Among all products, total TSNA concentrations ranged from 313 to 76, 500 ng/g with dry snuff having the highest total TSNA concentrations. This study demonstrates the diversity among oral tobacco products and highlights the potential of these products to deliver {{a wide range of}} nicotine and carcinogenic TSNAs. Characterizing the chemical content of these products may be helpful in further understanding the risk of marketing these products to oral tobacco users and smokers as an alternative and discrete form of tobacco.

50|$|A primary {{requirement}} for forge welding {{is that both}} weld surfaces need to be heated to the same temperature and welded before they cool too much. When steel reaches the proper temperature, it begins to weld very readily, so a thin rod or nail heated to the same temperature will tend to stick at first contact, requiring it to be bent or <b>twisted</b> <b>loose.</b> One of the simplest ways to tell if iron or steel is hot enough is to stick a magnet to it. When iron or steel cross the A2 critical temperature, it begins to change into the allotrope called gamma iron. When this happens, the steel or iron becomes non-magnetic. In steel, the carbon begins to mix with gamma iron at the A3 temperature, forming a solid solution called austenite. When it crosses the A4 critical temperature, it changes into delta iron, which is magnetic. Therefore, a blacksmith can tell when the welding temperature is reached by placing a magnet {{in contact with the}} metal. When red or orange-hot, a magnet will not stick to the metal, but when the welding temperature is crossed, the magnet will again stick to it. The steel may take on a glossy or wet appearance at the welding temperature. Care must be taken to avoid overheating the metal {{to the point that it}} gives off sparks from rapid oxidation (burning), or else the weld will be poor and brittle.|$|R
40|$|To {{develop new}} agents against {{strawberry}} grey mould and {{to aid in}} the development of biological pesticides, we investigated the inhibitory effect of a natural compound, phenazine- 1 -carboxamide (PCN), against Botrytis cinerea using a growth rate assay. Additionally, indoor toxicity and the in vitro control effect of PCN were further studied to determine its potential mechanisms of action on B. cinerea. PCN was inhibitory against B. cinerea with a 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) of 108. 12 μg/mL; the toxicity of PCN was equivalent to that of carbendazim (CBM). The best in vitro control effect of PCN against grey mould in strawberry (fruit) reached 75. 32 %, which was slightly higher than that of CBM. The field control effect of PCN against grey mould reached a maximum of 72. 31 % at a PCN concentration of 700 μg/mL, which was 1. 02 times higher than that of CBM. Fungistatic activity was observed at low concentrations of PCN, while high concentrations of PCN resulted in fungicidal activity against B. cinerea. This natural compound strongly inhibited both spore and sclerotium germination of B. cinerea, with the best relative inhibition rates of 77. 03 % and 82. 11 %, respectively. The inhibitory effect of PCN on mycelial growth of B. cinerea was significant and reached levels of 87. 32 %. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that after 48 h of PCN treatment, the mycelia appeared <b>loose,</b> locally <b>twisted,</b> and folded, with exudation of contents; the mycelia was withered and twisted, with edge burrs, deformations, ruptures and a sheet-like structure. Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that after 48 h of PCN treatment, the structure of the cell nucleus was unclear and the vacuoles had ruptured; additionally, various organelles exhibited disordered structures, there were substantial non-membrane transparent inclusions, the cells were plasmolysed, the cell walls were collapsed in some cases, and the hyphal tissue was essentially necrotic. A PCN dosage of 35 - 140 μg/mL had no effect on the cell membrane permeability of the mycelia, while a PCN dosage of 700 μg/mL resulted in significant permeability. PCN inhibited B. cinerea toxin; the mycotoxin level was approximately 0. 41 of the value recorded for the control at a PCN dosage of 700 μg/mL. PCN affected the activity of pectin methylgalacturonase (PMG), polygalacturonase (PG), cellulase (Cx) and β-glucosidase (BG); the lowest activities of PMG, PG, BG and Cx reached 0. 3 U/mg, 0. 62 U/mg, 0. 64 U/mg, and 0. 79 U/mg, respectively, after treatment with 700 μg/mL PCN...|$|R
