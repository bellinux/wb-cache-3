5000|$|Through the 1930s, {{fortunes}} {{improved with}} new models, the Standard Nine and Standard Ten addressed the <b>low</b> to <b>mid</b> range <b>market.</b> At the 1935 Motor Show the new range of Flying Standards was announced with (semi) streamlined bodies. The Flying Standards {{came to the}} market in 1936 with their distinctive streamlined sloping rears virtually replacing the existing range of Nine, Twelve, Sixteen, and Twenty. The Flying Standards were so-called because of the major radiator shell change to a waterfall grille topped by the Union Jack badge apparently streaming backwards in contrast to its previous forward-facing position. In 1938 a new factory was opened at Fletchampstead. That year, Standard launched the Flying Eight. The Flying Eight had a new four-cylinder engine smaller than that in the Flying Nine, {{and was the first}} British mass-produced light saloon with independent front suspension. [...] The Flying Ten and Flying Twelve were also given new chassis with independent front suspension in 1938.|$|R
