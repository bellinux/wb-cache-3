A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} republican {{motherhood}} {{was inspired by}} this period and reflects the importance of Republicanism as the dominant American ideology. It assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Women were considered to have the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed {{to the war effort}} through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.|$|E

25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out what to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection.</b> In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E
25|$|In this region, Diwali {{marks the}} killing of Narakasura: Celebrated as Naraka Chaturdashi, one day before Diwali, it commemorates {{the killing of}} the evil demon Narakasura, who wreaked havoc. In {{different}} versions, either Krishna or Krishna's wife Satyabhama killed Narakasura during the Dwapara yuga. The festival is celebrated over six days. It starts with Govatsa Dwadashi. Go means cow and vatsa means calf. Dwadashi means the 12th day. The story associated with this day is that of King Prithu, son of the tyrant King Vena. Because of the ill rule of Vena, there was a terrible famine and earth stopped being fruitful. Prithu chased the earth, who is usually represented as cow, and ‘milked’ her, meaning that he brought prosperity to the land. On second day, people shop for utensils, clothes, gold and other items. The third day is called Chaturdashi, the day on which the demon Narakasura was killed by Krishna – an incarnation of Vishnu. It signifies the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. The day is celebrated with puja, fireworks, and feast. The fourth day, is Diwali night, celebrated like rest of India. The fifth day is Govardhan Puja, celebrated as the day Krishna defeated Indra by the lifting of Govardhana hill to save his kinsmen and cattle from rain and floods. Symbolic mountains of food are prepared representing the Govardhan hill lifted by Krishna, then shared in the community. The last day is Yama Dwitiya where brothers and sisters meet to mark their bond, <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> for each other. If sister is married and lives in a distant area, the brothers typically visit their sisters’ place on this day and usually have a meal there. The brothers also bring and give gifts to their sisters.|$|E
500|$|Attachment {{theory is}} {{primarily}} an evolutionary and ethological theory. In relation to infants, it primarily consists of proximity seeking to an attachment {{figure in the}} face of threat, for the purpose of survival. Although an attachment is a [...] "tie," [...] it is not synonymous with <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection,</b> despite their often going together and a healthy attachment is considered to be an important foundation of all subsequent relationships. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts and expectations in later relationships.|$|E

500|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels criticize {{what she}} {{viewed as the}} [...] {{institution}} of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> outside of marriage with two passionate romantic friendships, one with a woman and one with a man. Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft's most radical feminist work, revolves around {{the story of a}} woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecraft's novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman. At the end of Mary, the heroine believes she is going [...] "to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage", presumably a positive state of affairs.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{date of the}} European leg of {{the tour}} {{was to have been}} the first time in Slipknot's history that would perform in Israel, but due to [...] "sudden {{personal}} and family conflicts" [...] the band canceled their appearance. The band stated that they will perform in Israel in the future. The band's appearance in Moscow marked Slipknot's first performance in Russia. During an interview with Kerrang! prior to their appearances in the UK, percussionist Crahan expressed excitement for the upcoming dates, saying, [...] "There's always been a deep <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> between the British fans and ourselves." [...] Machine Head did not perform in Copenhagen on November 13, due to frontman Robb Flynn's [...] "severe throat and bronchial infection." [...] On December 12, in Sheffield, Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel collapsed on stage during their second to last song, forcing his band to cancel their appearances at the European leg's final two dates. Slipknot's performance in London on December 3, 2008 was recorded for MTV's World Stage series and aired on March 13, 2009, in the UK. It was also made available in over 160countries.|$|E
500|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, attachment means [...] "a biological instinct {{in which}} proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort". Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds {{are based on the}} child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. John Bowlby begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like [...] "fixed action patterns" [...] to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be [...] "goal-corrected" [...] with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication. Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection,</b> although these may indicate that bonds exist.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the second season, it was {{indicated}} that Kevin and Jason were involved in a relationship. It was also announced that Jason would be leaving for Malaysia to serve as [...] "missionary" [...] for the impoverished people. While both Kevin and Jason told <b>and</b> shared their <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affections</b> for each other, it was implied that their relationship would undergo some emotional strain. This marks a significance in Kevin Walker, as this is the first boyfriend that he has professed a love for, though it was not his first love declaration: his ex-boyfriend Scotty professed a love for him early on as did his ex-boyfriend Chad Barry.|$|R
5000|$|The term true lover's knot, {{also called}} true love knot {{is used for}} many {{distinct}} knots. The association of knots with the symbolism of <b>love,</b> friendship <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> dates back to antiquity. Because of this, no single knot can be determined to be the true [...] "true love knot".|$|R

2500|$|Reaction formation: acting the {{opposite}} way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, [...] "often exaggerated and obsessive".

2500|$|Psychiatrist Bruce Perry {{cites the}} use of holding therapy {{techniques}} by caseworkers and foster parents investigating a Satanic Ritual Abuse case in the late 1980s, early 1990s, as instrumental in obtaining lengthy and detailed alleged [...] "disclosures" [...] from children. In his opinion, using force or coercion on traumatised children simply re-traumatizes them and far from producing <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection,</b> produces obedience based on fear, as in the trauma bond known as Stockholm syndrome.|$|E
