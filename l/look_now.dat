5|$|At the 27th British Academy Film Awards, Anthony B. Richmond won for Best Cinematography, and Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> {{received}} further nominations in the Best Film, Direction, Actor, Actress, Sound Track and Film Editing categories. It {{was also}} nominated in the Best Motion Picture category at the 1974 Edgar Allan Poe Awards.|$|E
5|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> is {{also very}} well {{regarded}} by other industry professionals, placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound's directors poll, run in tandem with their critics poll. A survey of 1000 people who work across the film and television industry, undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999, saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century. It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011, in which 150 film industry professionals were polled. In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll of the horror industry, {{in which more than}} 100 professionals who work within or have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films, which saw Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> finish in twelfth position.|$|E
5|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> {{was chosen}} by the British Film Institute in 2000 as one of eight classic films from those that had begun to {{deteriorate}} to undergo restoration. On completion of the restoration in 2001, the film was given another theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|While Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> observes many {{conventions}} of the thriller genre, it focuses on the psychology of grief and the effect {{the death of a}} child can have on a relationship. Its depiction of grief has been identified as unusually strong for a film featuring supernatural plot elements.|$|E
5|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{began his}} {{professional}} film career directing commercials and music videos, and became {{associated with the}} film production company Warp X. He served as Second Unit Director on the film Reverb. Blackburn co-wrote and directed Donkey Punch, which was his first film to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival. He shot the film on a £1 million budget over 24 days in South Africa. Movie critics likened {{his work on the}} film to filmmaker Peter Berg's Very Bad Things, director Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm, and Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water. He went on to serve as writer for the film Vinyan, which critics compared to two films by director Nicolas Roeg, Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> and Heart of Darkness.|$|E

5|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
5|$|Nicolas Roeg had {{employed}} the fractured editing style of Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> on his previous films, Performance and Walkabout, {{but it was}} originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg. Roeg's use of colour—especially red—can {{be traced back to}} earlier work: both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it—along with the whole screen—turn completely red. The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character. The fleeting glimpses of the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings pack painful memories of his lost love.|$|E
25|$|Sutherland rose to fame after {{starring}} {{in a series}} of successful films including The Dirty Dozen (1967), M*A*S*H (1970), Kelly's Heroes (1970), Klute (1971), Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> (1973), Fellini's Casanova (1976), 1900 (1976), Animal House (1978), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Ordinary People (1980) and Eye of the Needle (1981). He subsequently established himself {{as one of the most}} respected, prolific and versatile character actors of Canada.|$|E

25|$|Sutherland {{found himself}} as a leading man {{throughout}} the 1970s in films such as the Venice-based psychological horror film Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> (1973), co-starring Julie Christie, a role which saw him nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor, the war film The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Federico Fellini's Casanova (1976) and the thriller Eye of the Needle (which was filmed on location on the Isle of Mull, West Scotland). His role as Corpse of Lt. Robert Schmied in the Maximilian Schell's 1976 German film-directed End of the Game is listed in crazy credits. and as the ever-optimistic health inspector in the science fiction/horror film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) alongside Brooke Adams and Jeff Goldblum.|$|E
500|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> {{has been}} much admired by and an {{influence}} on subsequent filmmakers. [...] Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now.</b> Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now,</b> Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now,</b> has stated {{that it is a}} film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We Need to Talk about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|E

500|$|Blackburn {{served as}} writer {{on the film}} Vinyan, {{directed}} by Fabrice Du Welz. Vinyan stars Emmanuelle Béart, Rufus Sewell, and Julie Dreyfus. Sky Movies likened Vinyan to Nicolas Roeg's two films Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> and Heart of Darkness; Blackburn interviewed Roeg in 2008 for Time Out London and noted, [...] "Nic Roeg inspires me." [...] This Is London characterised the film as, [...] "a dark and pessimistic drama which goes slap-happily mad towards the end but keeps you watching all the same." [...] Empire Magazine also compared the film to Nicolas Roeg's Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now,</b> and concluded, [...] "Horrific and harrowing but the narrative arc could leave the audience unmoved." ...|$|E
500|$|The dark tone of {{the series}} is modeled after the ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's {{grandmother}} forced him to watch {{when he was younger}} to toughen him up. He also cited Rosemary's Baby, Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now,</b> The Amityville Horror, and Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining as influences for the series.|$|E
500|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> {{was to be}} Nicolas Roeg's third directorial feature {{following}} Performance and Walkabout. Although real-life couple Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner were {{suggested for}} the parts of Laura and John Baxter, Roeg was eager to cast Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland from the very start. Initially engaged by other projects both actors unexpectedly became available. [...] Christie liked the script and was keen to work with Roeg who had served as cinematographer on Fahrenheit 451, Far from the Madding Crowd and Petulia {{in which she had}} starred. Sutherland also wanted to make the film but had some reservations about the depiction of clairvoyance in the script. He felt it was handled too negatively and believed that Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> should be a more [...] "educative film", and that the [...] "characters should in some way benefit from ESP and not be destroyed by it". Roeg was resistant to any changes and issued Sutherland with an ultimatum.|$|E

500|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> {{has become}} famous for a sex scene {{involving}} Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, which caused considerable controversy {{prior to its}} release in 1973. British tabloid newspaper, the Daily Mail, observed at the time [...] "one of the frankest love scenes ever to be filmed is likely to plunge lovely Julie Christie into the biggest censorship row since Last Tango in Paris". The scene was unusually graphic for the period, including a rare depiction of cunnilingus in a mainstream film.|$|E
500|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> was {{produced}} by Peter Katz through London based Casey Productions and Rome based Eldorado Films. [...] The script based on the short story by Daphne du Maurier was offered to Nicolas Roeg by scriptwriter Allan Scott, who had co-written the screenplay with Chris Bryant, while Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland were cast in the principal roles. Filming began in England in December 1972, breaking off for Christmas, and resuming in January 1973 for seven more weeks in Italy.|$|E
500|$|Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Now</b> {{has been}} {{released}} on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. Extras include an introduction by film journalist Alan Jones, an audio commentary by director Nicolas Roeg, a retrospective documentary featurette ("Looking Back"), an extract from a 1980s documentary about Roeg ("Nothing is as it Seems"), and interviews with Donald Sutherland, composer Pino Donaggio ("Death in Venice"), scriptwriter Allan Scott, cinematographer Anthony Richmond and film director Danny Boyle, {{as well as a}} [...] "compressed" [...] version of the film made by Boyle for a BAFTA tribute.|$|E
