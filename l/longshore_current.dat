5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

50|$|Sandy shores, {{also called}} beaches, are coastal shorelines where sand accumulates. Waves and {{currents}} shift the sand, continually building and eroding the shoreline. <b>Longshore</b> <b>currents</b> flow {{parallel to the}} beaches, making waves break obliquely on the sand. These currents transport large amounts of sand along coasts, forming spits, barrier islands and tombolos. <b>Longshore</b> <b>currents</b> also commonly create offshore bars, which give beaches some stability by reducing erosion.|$|R

50|$|A spit or sandspit is a {{deposition}} bar or beach landform off coasts or lake shores. It develops {{in places where}} re-entrance occurs, such as at a cove's headlands, {{by the process of}} longshore drift by <b>longshore</b> <b>currents.</b> The drift occurs due to waves meeting the beach at an oblique angle, moving sediment down the beach in a zigzag pattern. This is complemented by <b>longshore</b> <b>currents,</b> which further transport sediment through the water alongside the beach. These currents are caused by the same waves that cause the drift.|$|R
50|$|In {{places of}} re-entrance along a {{coastline}} (such as inlets, coves, rias, and bays), sediments carried by a <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> will fall {{out where the}} current dissipates, forming a spit. An area of water isolated behind a large bar is called a lagoon. Over time, lagoons may silt up, becoming salt marshes.|$|E
5000|$|Longshore drift is a {{geological}} process {{that consists of}} the transportation of sediments (clay, silt, sand and shingle) along a coast parallel to the shoreline, which is dependent on oblique incoming wind direction. Oblique incoming wind squeezes water along the coast, and so generates a water current which moves parallel to the coast. Longshore drift is simply the sediment moved by the <b>longshore</b> <b>current.</b> This current and sediment movement occurs within the surf zone.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, {{the beach}} profile is {{lower in the}} storm season (winter in {{temperate}} areas) due to the increased wave energy, and the shorter periods between breaking wave crests. Higher energy waves breaking in quick succession tend to mobilise sediment from the shallows, keeping it in suspension where it is prone to be carried along the beach by longshore currents, or carried out to sea to form longshore bars, especially if the <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> meets an outflow from a river or flooding stream. The removal of sediment from the beach berm and dune thus decreases the beach profile.|$|E

50|$|In extreme cases, beach {{nourishment}} may involve placement of large pebbles or rocks {{in an effort}} to permanently restore a shoreline subject to constant erosion and loss of foreshore. This is often required where the flow of new sediment caused by the <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> has been disrupted by construction of harbors, breakwaters, causeways or boat ramps, creating new current flows that scour the sand from behind these structures, and deprive the beach of restorative sediments. If the causes of the erosion are not addressed, {{beach nourishment}} can become a necessary and permanent feature of beach maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The tombolo model affirms a {{constant}} sediment source {{and a high}} unidirectional or bi-directional (monsoonal) <b>longshore</b> <b>current.</b> One study tentatively concludes that there is insufficient evidence to indicate eustatic emergence and that the raised reef in southern India probably results from a local uplift. Other studies also conclude that during periods of lowered sea level over the last 100,000 years, Adam's Bridge has provided an intermittent land connection between India and Sri Lanka, which according to famous ornithologists Sidney Dillon Ripley and Bruce Beehler supports the vicariance model for speciation in some birds of the Indian Subcontinent.|$|E
50|$|Where the {{direction}} of the shore inland re-enters, or changes direction, for example at a headland, the <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This is called deposition. This submerged bar of sediment allows longshore drift or littoral drift to continue to transport sediment in {{the direction}} the waves are breaking, forming an above-water spit. Without the complementary process of littoral drift, the bar would not build above the surface of the waves becoming a spit and would instead be leveled off underwater.|$|E
50|$|Sediment-starved margins produce narrow {{continental}} {{shelves and}} passive margins.

5000|$|In the {{formation}} of sea cliffs, wave erosion undercuts the slopes at the shoreline, which retreat landward. This increases the shear stress in the cliff-forming material and accelerates mass movement. The debris from these landslides collects {{at the base of}} the cliff and is also removed by the waves, usually during storms, when wave energy is greatest. This debris provides sediment, which is transported through <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> for the nearby bay. Joints in the headlands are eroded back to form caves, which erode further to form arches. These gaps eventually collapse and leave tall stacks at the ends of the headlands. Eventually these too are eroded by the waves.|$|E
5000|$|Passive margins {{consist of}} both onshore coastal plain and {{offshore}} continental shelf-slope-rise triads. Coastal plains are often dominated by fluvial processes, while the continental shelf {{is dominated by}} deltaic and <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> processes. The great rivers (Amazon. Orinoco, Congo, Nile, Ganges, Yellow, Yangtze, and Mackenzie rivers) drain across passive margins. Extensive estuaries are common on mature passive margins. Although there are many kinds of passive margins, the morphologies of most passive margins are remarkably similar. Typically they consist of a continental shelf, continental slope, continental rise, and abyssal plain. The morphological expression of these features are largely defined by the underlying transitional crust and the sedimentation above it. Passive margins defined by a large fluvial sediment budget and those dominated by coral and other biogenous processes generally have a similar morphology. In addition, the shelf break seems to mark the maximum Neogene lowstand, defined by the glacial maxima. The outer continental shelf and slope may be cut by great submarine canyons, which mark the offshore continuation of rivers.At high latitudes and during glaciations, the nearshore morphology of passive margins may reflect glacial processes, such as the fjords of Norway and Greenland.|$|E
50|$|MitigationThe {{purpose of}} {{mitigation}} {{is not only}} to minimize the loss of property damage, but minimize environmental damages due to development. To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resourcesStructural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline. Structural management deals {{with the use of the}} following: groins which are man-made solution to <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the protection of the coastline. Vegetation is a key factor when protecting from erosion, specifically for to help stabilize dune erosion.|$|E

50|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.Surface currents only affect the top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, but there are also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses on either side of the Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.Besides gyres, there are temporary surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> is created as water is pushed along parallel to the coastline.

It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of 1 m/s, can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

40|$|A {{new class}} of nearshore waves based on the shear {{instability}} of a steady <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> is discussed. The dynamics depend on the conservation of potential vorticity but with the background vorticity field, traditionally the role of Coriolis in larger scale flows, supplied by the shear structure of the <b>longshore</b> <b>current.</b> The resulting vorticity waves are longshore-progressive with celerities roughly equal to V 0 / 3, where V 0 is the peak <b>longshore</b> <b>current</b> velocity. A natural frequency scaling for the problem is fs, the shear of the seaward face of the <b>longshore</b> <b>current.</b> While the instability can span a range of frequencies and wavenumbers, a representative frequency is given by 0. 07 fs, typically {{in the range of}} 10 - 3 - 10 - 2 Hz (called the Far Infragravity, orFIG, band because frequencies are just below those of the infragravity band). Wavelengths are of the order of 2 x 0, where x 0 is the width of the <b>longshore</b> <b>current.</b> Growth is exponential with an e-folding time that is typically half of a wave period. Field data, presented in the companion paper [Oltman-Shay et al., this issue], demonstrate the presence of energetic motions from a natural beach whose behavior matches the theory in many aspects.

40|$|International audienceIn nearshore applications, the {{estimation}} of <b>longshore</b> <b>currents</b> is of primary importance since it controls the alongshore sediment transport and coastal evolution. Direct estimation of <b>longshore</b> <b>currents</b> using in-situ instruments is difficult and costly, especially under highly energetic wave climates. Low cost remote sensing systems based on video observations constitute a promising alternative when the drifting sea foam left {{after the passage of}} breaking waves is visible. In this paper we describe a method based on longshore timestacks that necessitates less data than approaches using the full video frames. Our approach uses the Radon transform applied on the time series derived from timestacks to produce an estimate of the longshore component of nearshore surface currents detected from the foam signature in video images. The Radon transform can be used to separate the wave crests from the drifting foam part. The identification of the longshore drift is enhanced with both a temporal and a spatial filters. The corresponding sinogram from the Radon transform is computed in order to find the angle of the alongshore drifting that is further converted into the longshore component of the surface currents.
