40|$|In eastern Cuba area several {{geophysical}} {{techniques have}} been applied to distinguish the main geological characteristics of the laterites which are of economical importance for the extraction of iron, nickel and chrome. The geophysical measurments include an aeromagnetic survey and thorium (eTh), potassium (K) and uranium (eU) isotope measurements.

The application of the magnetic and isotope methods allowed the determination of the distribution and development of the laterite crust, as well as the determination of hydrothermal alterations affecting the laterites, which is very useful for mining exploration and exploitation. Such alterations indicate the presence of silicates, which have negative effects on the metallurgic process. It is known that laterite crust has a high content of eU and eTh. From the content of the isotope abundance (eU and eTh) it was possible to infer that Moa laterites were formed before the Mayari Region.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Marajó Basin area {{presents}} geologic and {{geomorphologic features}} chiefly {{due to the}} Mesozoic extension and post-Miocene neotectonics. The extension event with an Early and a Late Cretaceous phases originated four sub-basins that constitutes the Marajó Basin, with a thick continental clastic sequence showing marine influence.

The extension, related to the Equatorial Atlantic opening, propagated into the continent along crustal weakness zones of the Precambrian Tumucumaque, Amapá and Araguaia orogenic belts. The neotectonic event is a strike-slip regime which developed transtensional basins filled in by Upper Tertiary shallow marine (Pirabas Formation) and transitional sequences (Barreiras Group), followed by Quaternary fluvial deposits and transitional sequences derived from the Amazon and Tocantins rivers and the Marajoara estuary.

The three main superficial lithounits in the area are classified as chemical duricrust, iron-ore duricrust and hematite, with the latter having economic interest. The polarimetric quad-pol L-band images were acquired using the airborne SAR-R 99 B sensor from the SIVAM/CENSIPAM system. The techniques of digital classification of polarimetric images based on the polarimetric target decomposition theory proposed by Cloude & Pottier were evaluated. The validation of classification obtained from the Cloude-Pottier scheme has indicated a poor performance for the polarimetric classifier, with an overall poor Kappa value.

40|$|The Kapalagulu and Musongati {{intrusions}} are differentiated mafic–ultramafic intrusions, {{more than}} 1 km in stratigraphic thickness and several 10 s of km 2 in size. They {{form part of}} the Kabanga–Musongati belt of intrusions in western Tanzania and Burundi. The intrusions of the Kabanga–Musongati belt were emplaced at ca 1. 4 Ga into pelitic sediments of the Burundi and Karagwe–Ankolean Supergroups that accumulated during an early rifting phase of the Kibaran orogeny. The parental magmas to the intrusions were of picritic composition (ca 15 % MgO) that assimilated variable amounts of sulfidic sedimentary rocks during emplacement. Modeling suggests that the Musongati magma assimilated ca. 5 % of sedimentary material, whereas the Kapalagulu magma assimilated ca. 15 % of sediment. Contamination caused enrichment of the magma and the cumulates in incompatible trace elements, the development of negative Nb–Ta–Ti anomalies, and crustal sulfur isotopic signatures (δ 34 S = + 4. 5 to + 20). At Kapalagulu, contamination of the parent magma {{led to the formation}} of basal olivine melanorite cumulates. In the less contaminated Musongati intrusion dunites and harzburgites formed at the base. Both intrusions are prospective for magmatic Ni and PGE deposits. This is indicated by empirical observations, notably the presence of important Ni sulfide ores at Kabanga and reef-type PGE concentrations at Musongati and Kapalagulu. It is also supported by theoretical considerations, namely the high-magnesian composition of the parental magmas and the abundance of sulfides in the host sedimentary rocks.

40|$|Summary: Grass savannas on <b>lateritic</b> <b>crusts</b> are {{characteristic}} landscape {{elements of the}} Sudanian savannas. In the W Na-tional Park and its surroundings in SE-Burkina Faso, plant diversity of savannas on and adjacent to bowé was assessed by a survey of 19 bowal areas with relevés along transects in each of these. The vegetation structure and species composition of the herb and shrub strata, soil depth, particle size and the concentration of Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, H+, C and N were recorded on each bowal and its surroundings. Our results show that soils on <b>lateritic</b> <b>crusts</b> are rather shallow and acidic compared to the surrounding savanna woodlands. Nutrient availability is hence comparatively low. The observed flora comprises 130 species mainly belonging to the families Combretaceae, Cyperaceae, Leguminosae and Poaceae with a predominance of therophytes and a comparatively high share of C 4 species. In the pastures surrounding the National Park a higher species richness was found than inside the Park due to the occurrence of pioneers, ruderal and unpalatable plants.

A majority of France’s Overseas Territories {{are governed by}} a tropical climate that is typically hot and humid. The vegetation, generally lush in such climatic conditions, and plays {{an active role in}} the weathering of the geological substrate, and notably in the development of a <b>lateritic</b> <b>crust</b> that may accumulate to thicknesses of several tens of meters. According to the nature of the weathered substrate, an old craton for French Guiana, an ophiolitic sheet for New Caledonia or an island arc for the Antilles, the diversity of the soils is accompanied by a diversity in fertility, but also in the hazards to which they are subject (landslides, coastal erosion, flooding). Laterite formations may also be a source for economically viable mineral resources, like the New Caledonian nickel deposits. This cohabits with another resource, water, which unavoidably leads to conflicts over use. Guiana’s example is quite different. Lying atop an old granite craton with relatively unfertile soils, its wealth reposes on gold mining. However, the lateritic cover does represent a major stake that must be managed by the public authorities. Despite heavy rainfall, the distribution of water resources is still an issue, and landslide risks present an obstacle for infrastructure projects.

The <b>lateritic</b> <b>crusts,</b> {{which represent}} the relict of paleoclimatic changes especially between the Cenozoic and the Recent, allow inferring the {{conditions and the}} evolution of weathering in the intertropical region of the Earth. At the edge of the Guianas Shield, in the central region of Roraima, where occur <b>lateritic</b> <b>crusts</b> outcropping, has developed the Graben of the Tacutu.

With the objective to determine the implications of that environment in the weathering of the basement rocks from the Guiana Shield, the region of Mucajai was selected to where it is situated the Serra da Prata and to a less extent the Serra da Mo?a. These relief features are inserted in the Piedmont Rio Branco-Rio Negro, and its surroundings lowered portion on the Dissected Plateau North of the Amazonas. Rocks, crusts and soils of the region were studied on basis of field survey of the lithotypes and their textural, mineralogical and geochemical characterization. The major oxides, the trace elements (Mn, Zr, V, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sc, Co, Ga, Cr, Y, Th, Hf, Nb, Ta, Ba, Mo, Sr, Rb, Cs, U, W, As, Au, Ag, Hg, Ge, In, Li, Sb, Se, Te, Tl and ETR) and the Pb isotopes were analyzed. The lateritic lithotypes developed from charnockites, gabbro, granites and gneisses. Crusts of protopisoliticas and pisoliticas types were formed {{at the top of the}} Serra da Prata and vermiform in the lower portions of the landscape which are cover by clay-sandy reddish brown soils. The crusts are immature, friables with abundant clay matrix, composed mainly of goethite and hematite, and low content of gibbsite.

40|$|O estudo da geologia e geoquímica do carbonatito Seis Lagos e da jazida de Nb e ETR associada foi realizado a partir de testemunhos de dois furos de sondagem efetuados pela CPRM nos anos 70. Um dos furos, locado numa parte mais central do morro dos Seis Lagos, perfurou a crosta laterítica mineralizada, interpretada como formada a partir do carbonatito alterado. O outro furo, locado fora da estrutura mineralizada, perfurou a encaixante gnáissica e cortou, a 230 m de profundidade, um dique de carbonatito originalmente descrito neste trabalho. As técnicas utilizadas foram microscopia ótica, microscopia eletrônica, difratometria de raios X e análises químicas de rocha total por ICP. As características químicas e mineralógicas do carbonatito caracterizam-no como um siderita carbonatito. O Nb ocorre na forma mineralógica de chumbopirocloro; os ETR ocorrem {{principal}}mente na monazita e subordinadamente na barita e na gorceixita. O carbonatito apresenta concentrações anômalas de Nb, ETRL (especialmente pelo Ce), Ba, Sr e Pb. A crosta laterítica foi subdividida em 7 tipos texturais/composicionais, do topo para a base: crosta pisolítica, crosta fragmentada, crosta mosqueada, crosta roxa com oólitos, crosta manganesífera, crosta roxa e crosta marrom. Em todas as crostas, a hematita é o mineral mais abundante, seguido pela goethita; na crosta manganesífera (até 32 % de MnO), o principal mineral de Mn é a hollandita; os ETR ocorrem na forma de florencita (secundária) e o Nb na forma de Nb-rutilo e Nb-brookita (ambos relictos). A Nb-brookita ocorre na forma de oólitos com estrutura do tipo anéis de Liesegang, sua origem pode ser ligada ao estágio hidrotermal. A crosta manganesífera exerceu um forte efeito (scavenger) sobre a distribuição vertical de alguns elementos, notadamente pelo Co, Ba, Ce e ETRP que, lixiviados de crostas superiores, foram enriquecidos na crosta manganesífera. A remobilização dos ETR durante a lateritização foi bem menor nas crostas mais inferiores. Nestas, o Ce 4 + foi fortemente estabilizado e enriquecido em até 10 vezes. Além deste, somente o La foi apenas localmente um pouco enriquecido. O enriquecimento do Nb na laterita em relação ao carbonatito foi da ordem de 10 vezes, eventualmente atingindo 100 vezes. As modificações nas concentrações de Nb ao longo do perfil laterítico são associadas a variações nas composições do protólito e aos processos de abatimento da laterita. Um processo de bauxitização posterior parece ter afetado a parte superior do perfil laterítico; parte da florencita aí existente pode ser ligada a esta fase. The geology and geochemistry of the Seis Lagos carbonatite and the Nb and REE bearing associated {{ore deposit}} were studied using cores of two drill holes performed by CPRM in the 70 ´s. One of the drills, allocated {{in a central}} part of the Seis Lagos hill, cut a weathered and mineralized <b>lateritic</b> <b>crust</b> that was interpreted as formed by the carbonatite alteration. The other core, allocated outside the mineralized structure, cut the gneissic host rock and a carbonatite dyke, at 230 m depth. This carbonatite is first described in this report. The techniques used in this work were the optic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and ICP bulk rock chemical analyses. The chemical and mineralogical carbonatite data classify it as a siderite carbonatite. Th and Nb occur as plumbopyrochlore; REE as monazite and, subordinately, in barite and gorceixite. Anomalous concentrations of Nb, LREE (especially Ce), Ba, Sr and Pb were found in the carbonatite. The <b>lateritic</b> <b>crust</b> were subdivided in 7 textural/compositional types, from top to bottom: pisolitic crust, fragmented crust, mottled crust, purple crust with oolits, manganesitic crust, purple crust and brown crust. In all of the crusts, the hematite is the main mineral, followed by goethite; at the manganesitic crust (up to 32 % of MnO), the main Mn mineral is hollandite; the REE occurs as florencite (secondary) and the Nb crystallize as Nb-rutile and Nb-brookite (both relict). The Nb-brookite occurs at the form of oolits with Liesegang rings structures, and its genesis may be connected to a hydrothermal stage. The manganesitic crust produced a strong effect (scavenger) over the vertical distribution of some elements, especially the Co, Ba, Ce and HREE that were leached from upper crusts and enriched in the manganesitic crust. The remobilization of REE during the lateritization process was less effective in the lower crusts. In these, the Ce 4 + was strongly stabilized and enriched up to 10 times. In addition to this, only the La was locally slightly enriched. The enrichment of Nb in laterite, in relation to the carbonatite, was on average 10 times, eventually up to 100 times. The change in the Nb concentrations along the laterite profile was associated to the changes in the protolith composition and laterite collapse process. A posterior bauxitic process seems to have affected the upper lateritic profile, and part of the florencite can be connected to this stage...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{studying}} the genesis of soils developed on lateritic crusts, five profiles located {{in the region of}} Carajás (N 5 and Igarapé Bahia procpects) as well as in Paragominas (Camoaí Mine) and Belém (Mosqueiro and Outeiro Beaches) municipalities all them located in Pará State, Brazil - have been selected. Based on the structures described in the profiles (N 5, igarapé Bahia, Camoaí, Outeiro and Mosqueiro), it has been Possible to distinguish four differents horizons: fresh crust, partially-weathered crust, weathered crust and soil. The fresh crust is compact, vacuolar and composed of iron and aluminium oxyhydroxides. The partially-weathered crust is made up of fresh-crust relicts enclosed in yellowish or reddish clayey matrix, depending on the mineralogical composition of the fresh crust. The weathered crust is characterized by dominance of clayey matrix in relation to relicts, while the soil is composed exclusively of clayey material. The structures of the profiles show that the change from fresh crust to the overlying soil is gradual with volume expansion {{at the beginning of the}} fragmentat ion processes. This expansion is followed by the collapse of the profile as the relicts are entirely transformed into an earthy micro-aggregated material. The profiles of N 5 and Igarapé Bahia prospects have been derived from a mature iron-aluminous crust, being characterized by the highest contents of kaolinite and hematite either in the crust or in the relícts. Gibbsite Al-goethite, anatasse and quartz are concentrated in the soil, which tends to be initially bauxitic, at the base of the profile, and to become kaolinite-rich toward the top. The mineralogical changes led to chemical modifications such as decrease in Fe 2 O 3 and 8 iO 2 and increase in Al 2 O 3, TiO 2 and PF. The trace elements (V, Cr, Ni, R, Mo, Zr, Ga, Sc, Y, Mn, Cu and Pb besides Au in the profile of Igarapé Bahia) and REE's exhibit concentrations of 8 and Zr whereas the remaining ones tend to be progressively diluted from the crust toward the soil. The TiO 2 -mass balance shows that the transformation of the crust into soil took place by means of leaching of SiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 in two profiles above mentioned, while Al 2 O 2 underwent enrichment in the profile of N 5 and leaching in the profile of igarapé Bahia. The soil formation from a mature aluminous crust in Camoaí differs from those described in the profile of Igarapé Bahia and of N 5 in that it shows a decrease in gibbsite contents and an increase in kaolinite and quartz, whereas the verey low contents of,hematite, goethite, and anatase do not present a characteristic distribution. The trace elements and the REE's, with contents much lower than those observed in the others profiles, show an increase in Zr and Mn toward the soil horizon and a dilution of the remaining ones. In the Camoaí, the transformation of the aluminous crust into soil, based on the TiO 2 -mass balance, took place through leaching of Al 2 O 3 and enrichment in SiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3. In the profiles of Outeiro and Mosqueiro, deriveci from immature silicoferruginous <b>lateritic</b> <b>crust</b> the soil formation occurred by means of decreasing in hematite+goethite so that, in the resulting soil, quartz and kaolinite predominate. In consequence of this, a decrese in the Fe 2 O 3 contents and an increase in SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 have been observed in those profiles. The trace elements distribution presents, as in igarapé concentration of Zr and dilution of the remaining ones. Based on TiO 2 -mass balance, it could be noticed that the transformation of the crust in the profiles of Mosqueiro and Outeiro took place through leaching of Fe 2 O 3, whereas SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 underwent enrichment in the profile of Outeiro and Leaching in the one of Mosqueiro. On the basis of structures, mineralogical composition and geochemical data of the profiles, it has been possible to characterize an accentuated process of Fe loss in the iron-aluminous and in the silicoferruginous crust as well as Ai removal in the aluminous ones what led to soil generation. In the profiles derived from the iron-aluminous and the silicoferruginous crust, it has been observed substitution of hematite by Al-goethite, an intermediated segment - where there is predominance of gibbsite in the iron-aluminous profiles [...] and presence of kaolinite at the top of both profiles. In every profiles, it has been reported quartz acumulation. The enrichment in quartz and the S 1 O 2 being the latter likely come from externai sources -via vegetable-material decay - caused the neoformation of kaolinite from gibbsite in the profiles of N 5, igarapé Bahia, and Camoaí. In the profiles of Mosqueiro and Outeiro the kaolinite presence in the soil is a consequence of its relative enrichment in the relation to the crust from which it has been derived. As a consequence of the mineralogical transformation, Fe has been leached from the profiles of N 5, Igarapé Bahia, Mosqueiro, and Outeiro and Al from those of the Camoaí, as well as V, Cr, Mo, Ga, Sc, Cu, Pb and REErs. On the other hand, a strong enrichment in Zr and, in part, in 8 and Mn has been reported in every stud ied profiles. The transformations that caused the break down of the balance of the crusts, their desmantlement and comminution, forming relicts and a new clayey mineral phase, are consequence of organic matter influence which turns the environments conditions more acid and less oxidizing, in a process similar to that of weathering-profiles formation in humid tropical environments. The mineral and chemical difference observed between the profiles are consequence of compositional variation of the crusts which, in part, also reflect the degree of maturity of theirs. The mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the soils in the investigated profiles allow us to correlate them to the Belterra Clay and, in consequence of this, to admit that Belterra Clay had an autochthonous origin in relation to the underlying lateritic crusts. PADCT - Programa de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoCNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoPara estudar a gênese dos solos desenvolvidos sobre crostas lateríticas foram selecionados cinco perfis, localizados na região de Carajás (N 5 e igarapé Bahia) e nos municípios de Paragominas (Mina de Camoaí) e Belém (balneários de Outeiro e Mosqueiro), todos no Estado do Pará. A estruturação dos cinco perfis (N 5, Igarapé Bahia, Camoaí, Outeiro e Mosqueiro) permitiu individualizar quatro horizontes: crosta sã, crosta parcialmente intemperizada, crosta intemperizada e solo. A crosta sã é compacta vacuolar, constituída por óxi-hidróxidos de Fe e Al. A crosta parcialmente intemperizada compõe-se por relictos da crosta sã envolvidos por uma matriz argilosa amarelada ou avermelhada, dependendo da composição mineralógica da crosta sã. A crosta intemperizada caracteriza-se pela predominância da matriz argilosa em relação a seus relictos enquanto o solo é formado exclusivamente por material argiloso. A estruturação dos perfis mostra que a passagem da crosta sã para o solo sobreposto é gradual, havendo expansão de volume no inicio da fragmentação e posterior colapso do perfil, quando os relictos se transformam totalmente em um material terroso e microagregado. Os perfis de N 5 e Igarapé Bahia são derivados a partir de urna crosta ferro-aluminosa matura. Caracterizam-se pelos teores mais elevados de caolinita e hematita na crosta e seus relictos. No solo concentram-se a gibbsita, Al-goethita e anatásio com tendência a formação de um solo inicialmente bauxítico, que passa a caolinítico em direção ao topo do perfil. No Igarapé Bahia tem-se acúmulo de quartzo no solo. Quimicamente observa [...] se que a modificação mineralógica leva a um decréscimo nos teores de Fe 203 e 6 i 02 e aumento de Al 203, TiO 2 e PF. Os elementos-traço (V, Cr, Ni, B, Mo, Zr, Ga, Sc, Y, Mn, Cu e Pb, além de Au no perfil do igarapé Bahia) e os ETR mostram concentração de B e Zr, enquanto os demais tendem a serem diluídos da crosta para o solo. O balanço isotitânio mostra que a transformação da crosta em solo se dá por lixiviação de SiO 2 e Fe 2 O 3 nos dois perfis, enquanto o Al 2 O 3 se enriquece no perfil de N 5 e é lixiviado no perfil do Igarapé Bahia. A formação do solo de Camoaí, a partir de crosta aluminosa matura, difere dos perfis de N 5 e Igarapé Bahia pela diminuição nos teores de gibbsita e aumento nos de caolinita e quartzo, enquanto os teores de hematita, goethita e anatásio, muito baixos, não tem variação significativa. Acompanhando a composição mineralógica tem-se diminuição nos teores de Al 2 O 3 e aumento nos de SiO 2, enquanto os de Fe 2 O 3 e TiO 2, muito baixos, não tem uma distribuição característica. Os elementos-traço e os ETR, com teores bem mais baixos que nos demais perfis, mostram aumento de Zr e Mn em direção ao solo e diluição dos demais elementos. Em Camoaí a transformação da crosta aluminosa em solo, segundo o balanço isotitânio, dá-se pela lixiviação de Al 2 O 3 e enriquecimento em SiO 2 e Fe 2 O 3. Nos perfis de Outeiro e Mosqueiro, derivados de crostas lateriticas silico-ferruginosas imaturas, a formação do solo se com diminuição nos teores de hematita+goethita, de modo que no solo predominam quartzo e caolinita. Conseqüentemente tem-se decréscimo nos teores de Fe 2 O 3 e aumento nos de SiO 2 e Al 2 O 3. A distribuição dos elementos-traça mostra, assim como em N 5 e igarapé Bahia, concentração de Zr e diluição dos demais. Com base no balanço isotitânio a transformação da crosta dos perfis de Outeiro e Mosqueiro se dá pela lixiviação de Fe 2 O 3, enquanto o SiO 2 e o Al 2 O 3 se enriquecem no perfil de Outeiro e são lixiviados no de Mosqueiro. Com base na estruturação dos perfis, na mineralogia e geoquímica, foi possível caracterizar um acentuado processo de desferrificação das crostas ferro-aluminosas e sílico-ferruginosas e de desaluminizaçâo das aluminosas, levando a geração de solos. No perfis derivados das crostas ferro-aluminosas e silico-ferruginosas tem-se a substituição da hematita por Al-goethita, uma fase intermediária onde predomina gibbsita nos perfis ferro-aluminosos e, finalmente, caolinita no topo dos dois perfis. Em todos os perfis observou-se acúmulo em quartzo. O enriquecimento em quartzo e o provável aporte externo de SiO 2, via decomposição de material vegetal, levou a neoformação da caolinita a partir da gibbsita nos perfis de N 5, igarapé Bahia e Camoaí. Nos perfis de Outeiro e Mosqueiro a presença de caolinita no solo deve-se ao seu enriquecimento relativo a partir da crosta. Como consequência da transformação mineralógica houve a lixiviação de ferro nos perfis de N 5, igarapé Bahia, Outeiro e Mosqueiro e de alumínio no de Camoaí, além de V, Cr, Ni, Mo, Ga, Sc, Cu, Pb e ETR, forte enriquecimento em Zr e em parte de 13 e Mn em todos os perfis. As transformações que levaram à quebra no equilíbrio das crostas, a sua desagregação e cominuição, formando relictos e uma nova fase mineral argilosa, são consequências da ação da matéria orgânica, que torna o ambiente mais ácido e menos oxidante, em um processo similar ao da formação de perfis intempéricos em ambiente tropical úmido. As diferenças mineralógicas e geoquímicas observadas entre os perfis são conseqüência das variáveis composicionais das crostas que, em parte, refletem também o seu grau de maturidade. As características mineralógicas e geoquímicas dos solos nos perfis estudados permitem que eles sejam correlacionados a Argila de Belterra, podendo-se portanto admitir que a Argila de Belterra tem origem autóctone em relação as crostas lateríticas subjacentes...|$|E

In Indian peninsula, it is a post-Cretaceous stratigraphic succession with a polycyclic nature of evolution which marks the unconformity with recent Quaternary alluvium. There are perennial problems and research gaps {{in the investigation of}} laterites in India as well as in West Bengal: (1) defining, identifying and classifying lateritic materials, (2) mode of formation of laterite and its other horizons, (3) determining the ages of laterites, (4) reliability of laterites as palaeoclimatic indicators, (5) identifying topographic requirements and pedogeomorphic processes for laterite formation, and (6) reconstructions of former lateritized landscapes.

This paper reveals that the low-level secondary laterites (probably the Pliocene‒Early Pleistocene age) of Rarh Bengal are composed of heterogeneous Fe‒Al rich gravelly materials which were derived from the high-level primary laterites (probably the Eocene‒Miocene age) of plateau since the Paleogene Period by the peninsular river system, following the underlying structure of Bengal Basin. Alongside the roles of drifting of Indian Plate, establishment of monsoon climate, neo-tectonic uplifts and re-lateritization of ferruginous shelf deposits are determined here to unearth the palaeogenesis of primary and secondary laterites in West Bengal...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Relatively small aluminous {{lateritic}} deposits {{are abundant}} {{in the northeast and}} northwest parts of the Pará and Maranhão states, respectively. Most of them hosts aluminum phosphate mineralization forming hills and plateaus that stand out in the topography of the undulating plains of this region. The Piriá ridge is one of those topographic features, covered by <b>lateritic</b> iron <b>crusts</b> that have been studied in the 1970 s as part of iron ore exploration campaigns and recently for phosphates prospection. This study improves the knowledge about the evolution of the lateritic Piriá deposit and demonstrates its relationship with the most evolved laterites of the Amazon, known as mature laterites, which formed major ore deposits during the Paleogene. Samples of a 17 meter-deep borehole were investigated through mineralogical (X-ray diffraction -XRD, optical and electron microscopy) and chemical methods (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry - ICP-OES and X-ray fluorescence - XRF). The studied lateritic profile comprises a clay bauxitic horizon overlaid by an aluminous iron crust. Upwardly continuous dissolution of kaolinite occurs with the formation of gibbsite, as the result of intensive leaching, resulting in a higher Al 2 O 3 content in the crust. The continuous formation of hematite from goethite resulted from the transition to more arid conditions. Anatase is a newly formed mineral (100 - 400 nm crystallites), showing a gradual increase, following the increase in TiO 2 content, which is high and indicative of a mafic parent rock, confirmed by the Ti × Zr dispersion pattern. Prominent zoning in the lateritic profile is characterized by the mineralization in bauxite and augelite and abrupt chemical transition between the horizons, marked by a decrease in Si and increase in Fe content from the bottom {{to the top of the}} profile. These features are compatible and indicative of mature laterites formed in Amazon during the Paleogene...|$|R
40|$|Interpreting the {{geological}} record of Amazon biomass combustion requires comparing charcoal accumulation rates in various biomes at different time scales. Charcoal accumulation rates, {{a proxy for}} palaeofire records, were obtained in sediment cores from Amazon lakes surrounded by several vegetation types and from a reservoirs in an intense land use change region. The records presented {{in this study were}} obtained in the following areas i) a reservoirs in Alta Floresta region (northern Mato Grosso State); ii) Lago do Saci (southern Pará State), a lake close to Alta Floresta and located at the southern border of Pará State; iii) a bog in an ecotone area in the Humaitá region (southern Amazonas State); iv) lakes in <b>lateritic</b> iron <b>crust</b> of the Carajás Hills (southeastern Pará State); v) Lago Comprido, a floodplain lake close to the Amazon River and surrounded by tropical rain forest (Monte Alegre, Pará State; vi) Lagoa da Pata in the Morro dos Seis Lagos alkaline complex (São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State) and vii) Lago Caracaranã, a secluded lake in the northern Amazon cerrado (Roraima State). The highest charcoal accumulation rates were observed for modern records related to an intense change in land use at Alta Floresta, which had no precedent during the Holocene history of the Amazon. High charcoal accumulation rates that were observed in the Carajás region during low lake level phases in the Amazon in the mid-Holocene were comparable to those {{at the onset of the}} human settlement in Alta Floresta region. An increase in charcoal accumulation rate was observed in the late Holocene when the lake level was high, suggesting an interaction between climates and human presence. Low charcoal accumulation rates are typical of modern high rainfall environments, as observed in Lagoa da Pata where the environment is not susceptible to occurrences of wildfires even during relatively drier climatic phases. Low charcoal accumulation rates also exist in the relatively dry cerrado (savanna type) biome even during relatively dry phases in the Caracaranã region where the savanna-type vegetation biomass is lower and thus generates less charcoal particles than forest ecosystems. 201...|$|R
40|$|Na ilha de Itacupim, localizada na região costeira do nordeste do Pará, foram encontrados veios de fosfatos de alumínio contendo turquesa, além de quartzo e argilominerais. A ilha é sustentada por espesso perfil laterítico maturo desenvolvido sobre complexo alcalino-ultramáfico mineralizado em apatita. Os veios e vênulas são de espessura centimétrica, normalmente constituídos de wavellita fibro-radial, onde pode ser observada turquesa verde-azulada, em massas subesferolíticas, microcristalinas, intercrescidas com caulinita e oxi-hidróxidos de Mn, além de quartzo. A identificação mineral foi realizada por DRX, microscopia óptica, análises químicas de rocha total, MEV/SED. Os teores de CuO são inferiores aos das turquesas em geral, compensados por Fe 2 O 3 e ZnO. Os subesferolitos de turquesa contêm inúmeras inclusões micrométricas de goyazita ou svanbergita. A ocorrência da turquesa, na forma de veios e vênulas, seu aspecto porcelanado e a conhecida relação desse mineral com ambiente hidrotermal sugerem que a turquesa de Itacupim também seja de origem hidrotermal, reforçada pela sua associação com wavellita, goyazita ou svanbergita, quartzo e argilominerais. Ela não foi encontrada no perfil laterítico. Seu aspecto compacto e sua cor esverdeada abrem perspectivas para seu uso como mineral de gema. ABSTRACT: Veins and veinlets of {{aluminum}} phosphates with turquoise {{occur at the}} Itacupim Island in the coastal plain northeast the state of Pará. A thick mature <b>lateritic</b> iron <b>crust</b> rich in aluminum phosphates developed an apatite-bearing alkaline-ultramafic complex which constitutes the Island. The veins and veinlets are cm-thick, usually constituted by wavellite, fibrous to radialfibrous, with bony or porcelaneous aspect, and can turquoise. Pebbles of these phosphates inside of apatite-bearing ultramafic rocks are very common {{at the base of}} the hang wall, and locally form expressive agglomerates. Turquoise forms half spheroids and is bluish-green, microcrystalline, and is intergrown with kaolinite and Mn oxy-hydroxides. The mineral identification was carried out by XRD optic microscopy, chemical analyses by wet methods and by SEM/EDS. The lower CuO values, in comparison to turquoise elsewhere, are compensated by the higher Fe 2 O 3 and ZnO. The spheroids display countless inclusions of micrometric goyazite or svanbergite. The turquoise relation to veins and veinlets with wavellite, goyazite or svanbergite, quartz and clay minerals, its porcelaneous aspect and well-known occurrence of turquoise in hydrothermal environment indicate that the Itacupim turquoise was formed by the same mechanism. It doesn't display any clear relationship to laterite profile. The color and compact aspect of this turquoise make it suitable for use as gems...|$|R

The {{objective of}} this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} genesis and evolution of the lateritic lithotypes, resulting from the weathering in savannah areas in the region of Tucano ridge. The structural and textual characteristics were studied and the mineralogy, the chemical composition of the chemical elements Al, Ca, Si, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Ti, PF, trace elements (As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Cs, Ga, Ge, Hf, Hg, Li, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Pd, Rb, Re, Sb, S, Se,Sc, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn, Zr and ETR) and Pb isotopes was analyzed. In the region there are from thin, thick sandstones to rusty conglomeratic (Fe oxidation), vermiform crusts, protopisolitic, pisolitic, loosed concretionary material and clay and sandy soils consisting primarily of quartz, goethite-hematite, kaolinite, anatase, rutile and gibbsite. In the southwestern (SW) of Tucano ridge there is Redondo Hill constituted of diabase. The Si is high in the diabase, in the sandstones and in the soils while Fe is higher in the crusts and in the concretionary whereas Al and Ti are high in the soils. The alkalis and P are below the limit of the lateritic lithotypes detection and they are higher in the diabase. The Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Rb, Sc, Sr, W and Zn are more concentrated in the diabase. The Ag, As, Au, Bi, Ga, Hg, Sb, Se, Sn, Pb, Tl, Th and V are in the crusts and concretionary. The Hf, Nb and Zr are in the soils and the Mn in the conglomeratic and thick sandstones, in the pisolitic crust, in the concretionary and in the clay soils. The REE are more concentrated in the conglomeratic sandstone, in the pisolitic crust, in the concretionary 2 and in the soils where there are positive anomalies of Ce/Ce* and soft and negative ones of Eu. In the isotopic studies, higher rations of 207 Pb/ 206 Pb in the sandstones conglomeratic and clay soils and the rations of 208 Pb/ 206 Pb are higher especially in the diabase, in the thick sandstones to rusty conglomeratic, in the concretionary and in the clay soils.

40|$|Este trabalho aborda o contexto later?tico com base nos aspectos texturais, mineral?gicos, geoqu?micos. Na regi?o da Vila Nova Colina no centro sul do estado de Roraima, h? dois tipos de crostas later?ticas: (i) vermiforme ferruginosa com elevados teores de caulinita, goethita, hematita, magnetita e anat?sio e maior concentra??o de Al 2 O 3, Sc, Th, e Zr desenvolvida sobre granitos e, (ii) maci?a ferro-titan?fera com altos teores de magnetita, hematita, maghemita, goethita, caulinita, anat?sio, gibbsita e ilmenita e de Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2, V e Cu desenvolvida a partir de quartzo-hornblenda gabro. A crosta maci?a em posi??o topogr?fica mais elevada (220 m) e sua composi??o mineral?gica e geoqu?mica, indicam maior maturidade que a crosta vermiforme em cota mais baixa (140 m). Al?m disso, a presen?a de gibbsita na crosta maci?a, indica que ela ? relicto de uma fase erosiva na centrosul de Roraima, provavelmente associada a subsid?ncia da bacia do Tacutu no Mioceno. Na regi?o norte e noroeste de Rond?nia ocorrem perfis later?ticos desenvolvidos a partir de monzogranitos do cr?ton Amazonas (p. e. Su?tes Intrusivas Serra da Provid?ncia, Santo Ant?nio, S?o Louren?o-Caripunas e Laje). Os perfis s?o completos e incompletos de acordo com o est?gio de evolu??o/truncamento. O sapr?lito e o horizonte mosqueado s?o formados por caulinita, quartzo, goethita, rutilo/anat?sio, muscovita, illita e albita marcados por teores mais elevados em Al 2 O 3, PF, Nb, Pb, Th, U e Zr. As crostas later?ticas exibem textura vermiforme e colunar, localmente pisol?ticas com maior conte?do de goethita, gibbsita e hematita e de Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, PF, TiO 2, Ga, Hf, Nb, Sc, Th, U, V e Zr. Os solos, no topo dos perfis s?o quimicamente similares as crostas sobrepostas. Assim como em Roraima, os perfis s?o remanescentes de uma fase erosiva associada ao esculpimento da Chapada dos Parecis e a forma??o do tra?ado atual do rio Madeira. A estrutura dos perfis e a aus?ncia de crosta baux?tica, indicam estrutura t?pica de perfis pouco evolu?dos desenvolvidos a partir do Plio-Pleistoceno, ?poca da segunda fase de lateritiza??o na Amaz?nia. This paper {{approaches}} the laterite context based on textural, mineralogical, geochemical aspects. In {{the region of}} Vila Nova Colina south {{of the state of}} Roraima, the profiles have two types of lateritic crusts: (i) the ferruginous vermiform one with high amounts of kaolinite, goethite, hematite, magnetite and anatase, higher concentration of Al 2 O 3, Sc, Th e Zr developed on granites and, (ii) the iron-titaniferous massive crust with high amounts of magnetite, hematite, maghemite, goethite, kaolinite, anatase, gibbsite and ilmenite, and consequently in higher amounts of Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2, V e Cu developed from quartz-hornblende gabbro. The higher topographic position of the massive crust (220 m) and its mineral and geochemical composition, indicate higher maturity than the vermiform crust on lower topographic position (140 m). The presence of gibbsite on the massive crust and its higher topographic position at the regional scale, indicates that it is relict of an erosive phase in the center-south of Roraima, probably associated with subsidence of the Tacutu basin in Miocene. In the north and northwest of Rond?nia occur lateritic profiles developed from monzogranites of the Amazon craton (e. g. Serra da Provid?ncia, Santo Ant?nio, S?o Louren?o-Caripunas and Laje Intrusive Suite). The profiles are complete and incomplete according to the stage of evolution/truncation. The saprolite and mottled horizon consist of kaolinite, quartz, goethite, rutile/anatase, muscovite, illite, and albite marked by higher levels of Al 2 O 3, PF, Nb, Pb, Th, U and Zr. The <b>crusts</b> <b>lateritic</b> show vermiform texture and columnar, pisolitic locally with higher content of goethite, hematite and gibbsite and Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, PF, TiO 2, Ga, Hf, Nb, Sc, Th, U, V and Zr. The soils {{on the top of the}} profiles are chemically similar to those crusts. As well as Roraima the profiles are remnants of an erosive phase, associated with the sculpting of Chapada dos Parecis and the formation of the current route of the Madeira River. The structure of profiles and the absence of bauxitic crust indicate typical structure of little evolved profiles developed from the Plio-Pleistocene, time of the second lateritization phase in the Amazon...|$|R
