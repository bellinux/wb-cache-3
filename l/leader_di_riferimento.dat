The study is premised on the hybrid, heterogeneous nature of Company Annual Reports in terms of discourses, text types, audience and functions. The aim of this study is therefore to identify the categories and functions of hedging that are typically associated with hybrid texts {{and the extent to which}} they are shared and socially accepted by the international financial discourse community...|$|R

This real-practice case serves as a springboard for discussion about the current evidence on differential diagnosis of capecitabine-related cardiac toxicity, its risk factors, and the underpinning mechanisms of early onset. Moreover, we discussed whether a rechallenge with fluoropyrimidines could be safe in patients who had experienced a previous cardiac adverse event.

40|$|Helical Tomotherapy (HT) is {{a highly}} {{conformal}} image-guided radiation technique, introduced into clinical routine in 2006 at the Centro <b>di</b> <b>Riferimento</b> Oncologico Aviano (Italy). With this new technology, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is delivered using a helicoidal method. Here we present our dosimetric experiences using HT in 100 children, {{adolescents and young adults}} treated from May 2006 to February 2011. The median age of the patients was 13 years (range 1 – 24). The most common treated site was the central nervous system (50; of these, 24 were craniospinal irradiations), followed by thorax (22), head and neck (10), abdomen and pelvis (11), and limbs (7). The use of HT was calculated in accordance to the target dose conformation, the target size and shape, the dose to critical organs adjacent to the target, simultaneous treatment of multiple targets, and re-irradiation. HT has demonstrated to improve target volume dose homogeneity and the sparing of critical structures, when compared to 3 D Linac-based radiotherapy (RT). In standard cases this technique represented a comparable alternative to IMRT delivered with conventional linear accelerator. In certain cases (e. g., craniospinal and pleural treatments) only HT generated adequate treatment plans with good target volume coverage. However, the gain in target conformality should be balanced with the spread of low-doses to distant areas. This remains an open issue for the potential risk of secondary malignancies (SMNs) and longer follow-up is mandatory...|$|R

The aim is to understand how the informational material supplied to patients by CIP-LP staff, and previously assessed by an internal Materials Evaluation Committee with proper evaluation tools, is assessed by the users. The answers to the questionnaire demonstrate total clarity of the information supplied for 64 % of the sample, understandability (59 %), usefulness (45 %) and completeness (49 %).

40|$|Base <b>di</b> <b>riferimento</b> europeo per le forme di humus. (ABSTRACT: In Europe an {{abundance}} of humus taxonomies exists starting with early approaches in the late 19 th century. Frequently used in an international context, they do not cover all site conditions in the European area. Although having basic concepts and general lines, the European (and North American, Canadian) classification systems differ in important parameters used for the description and classification of humus forms. These discrepancies result in incongruities, so require adjustments when exchanging partially compatible soil data, even between nearby countries. In 2003, 26 European specialists in humus forms met in Trento (Italy) and decided to formulate rules of classification based on morphogenetic descriptions and diagnostic horizons, adapted to European ecological conditions. Taking into account old and new European and North American systems of humus forms classification, six main references (Anmoor, Mull, Moder, Mor, Amphi and Tangel) were defined, each of them further dividing into detailed categories. This inventory assigned a strong discriminatory power to {{the action of the}} pedofauna. Both semiterrestrial (anoxic) and terrestrial (aerated) topsoils were classified. The descriptors of the diagnostic horizons were conceived in accordance with the spirit of recent international soil classifications. Assigning an “ecological value” to each main humus form along a gradient dividing those characterized by accumulation of poorly transformed organic matter, from very biologically active forms degrading and incorporating all organic remains, this European system of classification avoids a hierarchical structure and allows an elastic approach open to additional ecological contributions and renditions...|$|R

40|$|L’importanza che la datazione puntuale delle ecchimosi assume in ambito medico-forense, soprattutto nei casi di discordanza tra testimonianza e referto clinico, e la non accuratezza riscontrata nei metodi visivi finora impiegati, ci hanno spronato ad elaborare un sistema di discriminazione temporale che risulti efficace, agevole ed economico. A tal proposito, abbiamo reclutato 120 volontari, li abbiamo suddivisi in quattro classi in base al loro fototipo, e abbiamo provocato un’ecchimosi in ognuno di essi. Successivamente abbiamo fotografato tali ecchimosi con una fotocamera digitale Reflex in molteplici intervalli di tempo, dalla loro comparsa fino alla completa guarigione. Le immagini ottenute sono state poi esaminate con un {{software}} di analisi del colore (Adobe RGB). In particolare abbiamo valutato l’andamento temporale del parametro R (misura la quantità di rosso presente nell’immagine) rispetto alla cute sana adiacente alla lesione. In tutte le classi di fototipi si è osservato un progressivo decremento di R fino a 36 ore dall’epoca di produzione dell’ecchimosi. In seguito R aumenta gradualmente fino a 132 ore (epoca di scomparsa delle lesioni). Essendo la variazione temporale di R costante a prescindere dal fototipo, abbiamo calcolato per ogni intervallo di tempo la media ponderata di R in modo da ottenere un unico valore per i quattro gruppi. Successivamente, come verifica del metodo proposto, abbiamo fotografato delle ecchimosi di natura accidentale. Soltanto uno degli sperimentatori era a conoscenza dell’epoca della lesione. Lo sperimentatore “cieco”, dopo aver misurato il parametro R sulle immagini raccolte, ha confrontato i valori così ottenuti con quelli <b>di</b> <b>riferimento</b> determinati nella precedente fase dello studio, con l’intento di datare le ecchimosi.
