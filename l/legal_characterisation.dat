A total of 350,000 were arrested and 247,157 were executed. Of these, the Polish operation, which targeted the members of already non-existing Polska Organizacja Wojskowa appears to have been the largest, with 140,000 arrests and 111,000 executions.

5000|$|Unlike some {{commissions}} {{of inquiry}} {{with a specific}} mandate to identify the perpetrators of violations and make them accountable for their actions, {{the objective of the}} Mapping Exercise was not to establish or to try to establish individual criminal responsibility. Instead, its aim was to expose in a transparent way the seriousness of the violations committed, with the aim of encouraging an approach aimed at breaking the cycle of impunity. The report does, however, identify the armed groups to which the alleged perpetrators belonged, since it was essential to identify the groups allegedly involved in order to suggest proper <b>legal</b> <b>characterisations</b> for the conduct in question. Consequently, information on the identity of the alleged perpetrators of some of the crimes listed does not appear in the report but is held in a confidential project database submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. However, the identities of alleged perpetrators under warrant of arrest and those already sentenced for crimes listed in the report have been disclosed. Names have also been cited where political officials have assumed public positions encouraging or provoking the violations listed.|$|R
40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{say that}} a {{nation-state}} is secular? Secular law typically begins when a state has no religious competitor for authority. For this reason, {{it can be said that}} the Australian state is secular because its authority is derived from its own laws. What makes Australian law sovereign, the highest authority within the state, is its secularity. However, given Australia's colonial heritage, it is not just the absence of religious authority, such as a state religion, that gives the state its secularity. The law's foundations in colonial violence and the extinguishment of Indigenous sovereignty as a competing authority are also a crucial way in which secular Australian law can continue to operate as the sovereign authority within the state. Using the work of Charles W. Mills, I will critically interrogate how <b>legal</b> and political <b>characterisations</b> of the law as secular work to disavow the state's racialised foundations in colonial violence in the form of a "secular contract". In developing this notion of a "secular contract" I hope to show that secularism be must re-thought of as not simply the operation of law without religion, but also, as complicit with the ways indigenous sovereignties in (post) colonial states are negated. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Olusanya, O. (2004). Double Jeopardy Without Parameters: Re-characterization in International Criminal Law. Series Supranational Criminal Law: Capita Selecta, volume 2. Antwerp: Intersentia. RAE 2008 This book {{deals with}} the double {{jeopardy}} rule, namely the practice of multiple characterisation of the same facts, under different headings, in international criminal law. Such practice is problematic, {{due to the fact}} that know how it works within the context of international criminal law. How does one distinguish a situation in which an act may appear simultaneously to breach several criminal provisions, whilst in reality it violates only one, from another where the act does in fact breach more than one criminal provision? International crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes cannot be confined a single category of well-defined offences such as murder, voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, theft, etc. Instead these crimes embrace broad clusters of identical offences and share certain general <b>legal</b> features. Multiple <b>characterisation</b> of the same facts under different headings in international criminal law is therefore a complex legal problem. Every case of multiple convictions based on one act is, at its best, a plausible conjecture which however every next judgment may turn out to be a counter judgment. This book provides a combination of innovative charts, analysis, debate and solutions. From a unique perspective it examanies the history of international crimes and the jurisprudence of World War II tribunals, contemporary ad hoc international criminal tribunals, the International Criminal Court and special courts, as well as national law on international crimes...|$|R

5000|$|This {{has become}} the case because of the {{doctrine}} of jura regalia, which means that [...] "all lands of the public domain belong to the state" [...] (2). The next problem encountered was that the ancestral domain rights’ <b>legal</b> <b>characterisation</b> as [...] "private but communal" [...] differentiated from the Philippines’ civil law's idea of co-ownership of real property. This meant that areas in ancestral domains is shared by the members of the community, {{but that does not mean}} that they are considered as co-owners of the said property according to the New Civil Code (2).|$|E

However, the Court held that it was not bound by the <b>legal</b> <b>characterisation</b> of facts made {{in the context of the}} criminal proceedings and that it was for the Court, exercising its discretion to the full, to investigate whether the conduct complained of in proceedings brought under Article 213(2) EC constituted a breach of the obligations arising from the office of Commissioner. Accordingly, the decision of the Chambre du conseil of the Tribunal de première instance de Bruxelles that there was no evidence of criminal conduct on Cresson's part could not bind the Court.|$|E
40|$|The {{conflict}} of laws relating to the assignment of receivables raises characterisation difficulties. Based on the property-contract approach currently employed in <b>legal</b> systems, the <b>characterisation</b> of <b>legal</b> issues as contractual and proprietary results in complications. No general solution can be reached regarding the proprietary aspects of assignment, especially third parties’ effectiveness and priority issues. This thesis establishes that the core cause of the difficulty resides in the property-contract approach itself. It therefore attempts to provide {{a new approach to}} the {{conflict of}} laws for assignment, namely, a rights-based approach. It argues against the property-contract approach on the ground that assignment is not a hybrid of contract and property. Rather, it proves that the true legal nature of assignment is not the transfer of items of property, but a contractual method for transferring contractual rights to payment in receivables. The assignment of receivables not only creates triangular relationships between assignor, assignee and debtor, but also has external effects on third parties. In the rights-based approach, {{there is no need to}} differentiate between the contractual and proprietary aspects of assignment. The {{conflict of laws}} for assignment is established based on the relationships of rights between relevant persons, i. e. the relationship of rights between assignor and assignee, that between assignee and debtor, and the relationship of rights as it affects third parties including priority issues. These are proposed as being governed by the law of assignment and of assigned receivables. The rights-based approach eliminates the need to refer to property law and resolves characterisation difficulties. Consequentially, it grants an opportunity to modernise and harmonise the law of assignment based on contract law. In this way, positive outcomes vis-à-vis the financial practice concerning the assignment of receivables are the end result of this approach...|$|R

It asks whether the remedy is an avoidance of a void contract, or a rescission of a voidable contract. The article then considers the general significance of that distinction to the capacity of a party to exercise its primary right of avoidance, and to the secondary rights of the contracting parties - arising in consequence of the avoidance - to prevent unjust enrichment or achieve restitution. Before considering the potential for - and the desirability of - further reform in the area, the article evaluates the importance of the <b>legal</b> <b>characterisation</b> of insurance risk avoidance in the particular context of insurance contracts affording indemnity to multiple insured parties...|$|E
40|$|The September 11 {{attacks and}} the ensuing {{military}} operations in Afghanistan have raised a multitude of complex and disturbing problems for the existing humanitarian normative order. Much of the legal scholarship on recent events concerning Afghanistan {{has focused on the}} issues of the legal status of captured Taliban and Al Qaeda soldiers under humanitarian law, their detention conditions at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and the inadequacy of procedural safeguards for judicial proceedings of the proposed Military Commissions under the US Presidential Order and the Department of Defence Order. This paper takes a somewhat different approach, looking first at the <b>legal</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the armed conflicts in Afghanistan since 6 / 7 October 2001 and particularly the internecine hostilities that have continued since the apparent end of the war, before examining the status of combatants and that of prisoners of war. Clarification {{of the nature of the}} armed conflicts and of the scope of application of the rules on prisoners of war is essential for disentangling the legal quagmire surrounding the controversy over the legal status of both Taliban and Al Qaeda soldiers under the jus in bello...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the present criminal law position {{with respect to}} medically administered active voluntary euthanasia in Australia. Under existing criminal law principles, whilst there is some scope for passive euthanasia, active volunta. rY euthanasia is treated as murder and no account is taken of the special circumstances existing in such cases. Notwithstanding this prohibition, {{there is evidence that}} Australian doctors are involved in the practice of active voluntary euthanasia. However, police and prosectors appear reluctant to intervene in this area of medical practice, and judging from the experience in other jurisdictions, there is every likelihood that if a doctor were prosecuted in Australia for having administered active voluntary euthanasia, the doctor would escape the full rigours of the criminal law. Against this background, this thesis seeks to highlight the problems which exist {{as a result of the}} marked discrepancies between law and practice in this area. Attention is also drawn to the law's differential treatment of active and passive euthanasia and the difficulties and anomalies which arise from the <b>legal</b> <b>characterisation</b> of a number of other medical practices which bear some similarity to active voluntary euthanasia such as the turning off of artificial life-support and the administration of pain-relieving drugs which are known to be likely to hasten the patient's death. The thesis argues that active voluntary euthanasia should not be subject to a blanket criminal law prohibition. This argument is based on a number of factors including the principle of self-determination, current legal and medical practice, changing community attitudes, and jurisprudential arguments regarding the proper role of the criminal law. The conclusion of this thesis is that the law with regard to active voluntary euthanasia in Australia should be reformed by the introduction of legislation creating· a very limited exception to the homicide laws that would confer on doctors an immunity from liability, provided active voluntary euthanasia is performed in accordance with strict criteria and safeguards. It is argued that the practice of active voluntary euthanasia by doctors in the Netherlands provides a useful guide to law reform in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Plagiarism {{may have}} {{accompanied}} acts of creation, either endorsing or contradicting them. Esteemed {{as a general}} rule of literature or censured as literary larceny, it embodies the disavowal of authorship in the intellectual works of others and thus breaches their right to be acknowledged as authors, while also feasibly deceiving the public and, in any case, contradicting the universal rule of creative imitation. Historically entangled with the concepts of counterfeiting and piracy, it only later reached an autonomous collocation as a violation of the moral right of attribution. Placed in the broadest context of copyright law, it yet struggles against its confinement to a strict <b>legal</b> <b>characterisation,</b> given its colourful appearance and inherent inconsistency according to the type of works or field of knowledge to which it relates, thus refuting any unyielding interpretation. In such a mutable context, the purpose of this research, which revolves around the systems of Italy and the United Kingdom, is to explore a view of plagiarism that appreciates the different instances in which a genuine borrowing or a deceitful practice appear, considering the dimension of copyright infringement, but also looking at other possible legal and non-legal means of construal. Given these premises, an accurate exploration of the phenomenon requires a preliminary consideration of the manifold literature on the subject, which increasingly progresses together with the development of technology and social practices. Furthermore, its literal absence in statutory law does not impede finding a collocation {{in the context of the}} judiciary, which is analysed with reference to the legal systems of both Italy and the United Kingdom. This does not infer that courts deliver a flawless and unfailing interpretation of plagiarism. On the contrary, a careful reading of the ruling confirms that the narrow realm of copyright law is shrinking. However, the unpredictability of the statutory and judicial approach towards plagiarism may also be welcomed as an attempt by the law to acknowledge the difficulty to appraise its complexity. Therefore, the present study openly adopts an interdisciplinary and comparative analysis that may help to describe its controversial legal breadth while also possibly unravelling any other principled range...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{offers a}} reading of the book of Exodus as a {{literary}} artifact. This is accomplished through the investigation of its main literary characters Yhwh, Moses and Israel. The text is understood {{to be part of a}} communicative situation between author and reader. This hermeneutical claim and the nature of Exodus itself entail certain consequences with regard to the method of enquiry. The method applied is a modified form of rhetorical criticism, which is understood to provide an interpretive perspective on the text. The particular focus is on the functional aspects of the text which direct the reading process and thus guide the reader. Given the difficulties in determining the circumstances of the origin of Exodus and the paucity of secured knowledge about early Israelite history, the `implied reader' is introduced as a key-term. It is assumed that this implied reader informed the inventio and dispositio of the book. Because of the book's central themes - identity and relationship -a careful investigation of the characters is a worthy avenue to pursue. Three characters have been chosen on account of their continuous involvement in the plot. The introduction of each character into the plot receives special attention. The developing portrayal of each character is closely linked to its paradigmatic qualities and to its influence on the reader. First, the portrait of God is discussed, especially in relation to the contributions of the narrative, poetic and legal parts of Exodus. The very important but often neglected <b>legal</b> <b>characterisation</b> of Yhwh in Exodus is a topic of special interest. Although the legal collections say much about their recipients, they also reveal deep insights into the law-giver's nature and concerns. Yhwh is identified as the king who justly claims obedience and service. A further focus is the possibility of the relationship between Israel and their king, Yhwh. Second, with regard to Moses there is a significant difference between his first appearance in Exod 2 - 5 and his later development. This remarkable tension in the Mosaic portrayal reveals interesting insights into the implied reader's preconceptions. Here we trace closely the argumentative strategy of the author in his attempts to convince this reader. Furthermore, it is necessary to discuss the paradigmatic qualities of the character Moses. Third, reader-identification is at the heart of the construction of Israel. Here the historical gulf between the Israel of the narrative and the one of the implied reader is bridged. The complexity of Israel is a central aspect of Exodus' rhetoric, urging its readers to comply with the ideal which the author sought to communicate in his book. The results of this study provide insights into the specific poetics of Exodus and its management of the reading process. Because of the proposed unity of form and content, it is possible to specify the message of the entire book by taking into account its intriguing mixture of different genres. An abstraction from modern reading-conventions in the encounter of ancient Hebrew texts is shown, and the possibility of reading the text on its own terms is explored...|$|E
