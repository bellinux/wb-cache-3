5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|The missile fuel {{was common}} to every {{tactical}} missile of the Cold war: {{a mix of}} kerosene, ignited by a nitric acid oxidizer, called IRFNA. Each missile loaded 4,500kg of <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant,</b> composed by a 22% of kerosene and 78% of IRFNA.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1920s, German {{scientists}} had begun experimenting with rockets that used liquid propellants capable of reaching relatively high altitudes and distances. In 1927 {{and also in}} Germany, a team of amateur rocket engineers had formed the Verein für Raumschiffahrt (German Rocket Society, or VfR), and in 1931 launched a <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> rocket (using oxygen and gasoline).|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the {{decision}} to develop a totally new moon rocket in the 1962 Soviet UR-700M-class (Project Aelita) able to launch a 500-ton payload in LTO and a more modest 50 tons LTO payload LV has been discussed in a 2006 conference by academician Zhang Guitian (张贵田), a <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> rocket engine specialist, who developed the CZ-2 and CZ-4A rockets engines.|$|E
25|$|However, Goddard's {{tendency}} to secrecy was not absolute, {{nor was he}} totally uncooperative. In 1945 GALCIT was building the WAC Corporal for the Army but was having trouble with the rocket's engine performance.

5000|$|The primary {{performance}} {{advantage of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants</b> {{is due to}} the oxidizer. Several practical liquid oxidizers (liquid oxygen, nitrogen tetroxide, and hydrogen peroxide) are available which have better specific impulse than the ammonium perchlorate used in most solid rockets, when paired with comparable fuels. These facts have led to the use of hybrid propellants: a storable oxidizer used with a solid fuel, which retain most virtues of both liquids (high ISP) and solids (simplicity). (The newest nitramine solid propellants based on CL-20 (HNIW) can match the performance of NTO/UDMH storable <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants,</b> but cannot be controlled as can the storable liquids.) ...|$|R

25|$|His OKB 456 (later NPO Energomash) would {{design the}} 35-metric ton (340 kN) thrust RD-101 engine {{used in the}} R-2, the 120-ton (1,180kN) thrust RD-110 {{employed}} in the R-3, and the 44-ton (430kN) thrust RD-103 used in the R-5 Pobeda (SS-3 Shyster). The R-7 ("Semyorka") would include four of Glushko's RD-107 engines and one RD-108. In 1954, he began to design engines for the R-12 Dvina (SS-4 Sandal), which had been designed by Mikhail Yangel'. He also became responsible for supplying rocket engines for Sergei Korolev, the designer of the R-9 Desna (SS-8 Sasin). Among his designs was the powerful RD-170 <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For next {{generation}} air-breathing and rocket propulsion systems gelled propellants {{can be a}} promising replacement for conventional solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants.</b> Especially for rocket engine op-eration, {{the application of a}} gelled fuel and gelled oxidizer can combine the advantages of conventional solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants</b> without taking into ac-count the specific disadvantages of both individual systems. The present publication describes the rheo-logical behavior of gelled JP- 8 turbine fuel and gelled rocket propellant RP- 1 when fumed silica is used as a gelling agent. Alongside the determination of an optimal gel mixing process, gel stability and rheolog-ical parameters showed a significant influence of the added silica amount...|$|R
50|$|Most {{countries}} {{in the early stages}} of developing ICBMs have used <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants,</b> with the known exceptions being the Indian Agni-V, the planned but cancelled South African RSA-4 ICBM, and the now in service Israeli Jericho III.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>propellants</b> {{are subject}} to slosh, which has {{frequently}} led to loss of control of the vehicle. This can be controlled with slosh baffles in the tanks as well as judicious control laws in the guidance system.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the energy}} {{ultimately}} comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when {{a very high}} speed is required, such as ICBMs or orbital launch. For example, NASA's space shuttle fires its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000tonnes of solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000litres of <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> (106,261kg of liquid hydrogen fuel) to lift the 100,000kg vehicle (including the 25,000kg payload) to an altitude of 111km and an orbital velocity of 30,000km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle has a kinetic energy of about 3TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200GJ. Given the initial energy of 20TJ, the Space Shuttle is about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon {{propelled}} by air {{coming out of a}} tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is pulled by it. Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note {{that in the case of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber -typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.|$|E
25|$|Liquids tend to {{have better}} thermal {{conductivity}} than gases, {{and the ability to}} flow makes a liquid suitable for removing excess heat from mechanical components. The heat can be removed by channeling the liquid through a heat exchanger, such as a radiator, or the heat can be removed with the liquid during evaporation. Water or glycol coolants are used to keep engines from overheating. The coolants used in nuclear reactors include water or liquid metals, such as sodium or bismuth. <b>Liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> films are used to cool the thrust chambers of rockets. In machining, water and oils are used to remove the excess heat generated, which can quickly ruin both the work piece and the tooling. During perspiration, sweat removes heat from the human body by evaporating. In the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning industry (HVAC), liquids such as water are used to transfer heat from one area to another.|$|E
5000|$|Turbopumps to pump <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants</b> {{are complex}} to design, and can suffer serious failure modes, such as overspeeding if they run dry or {{shedding}} fragments {{at high speed}} if metal particles from the manufacturing process enter the pump.|$|R
50|$|From 1949 to his {{retirement}} in 1970, Clark developed <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants</b> at the Naval Air Rocket Test Station at Dover, New Jersey (after 1960, this became the Army's Liquid Rocket Propulsion Laboratory of Picatinny Arsenal). His title there was chief chemist.|$|R

25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant,</b> or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E

[...] The propellant mixture above {{is one of the}} most predictable and stable, with a flat pressure profile during firing. [...] Misfires are usually caused by inadequate ignition. The movement of the shell after a misignition causes a large bubble with a larger ignition surface area, and the greater rate of gas production causes very high pressure, sometimes including catastrophic tube failures (i.e. explosions).|$|E
50|$|Propellants that {{explode in}} {{operation}} are of little practical use currently, {{although there have}} been experiments with Pulse Detonation Engines.
