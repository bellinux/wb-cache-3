50|$|Pursuit First appearance: Heat 7. Contenders {{race against}} each other across an {{obstacle}} course with Gladiators chasing them after a three-second headstart. The obstacle course consisted of a balance beam, wire bridge, hand <b>ladder,</b> <b>web</b> trap, low wall, web trap, high wall, sprint finish. 10 points were awarded for the first contender to pass the finish, 5 points for second with no points awarded if a contender was tagged.|$|E
50|$|H. multipuncta {{is found}} in {{tropical}} parts of southern Asia where its range includes India, Malaysia, China and New Guinea. It is often found in association with man and has spread to other countries where it is considered invasive. Its habitat is the trunks of trees and the walls of buildings where it creates a small web close to the surface. The web starts off as an orb web using prominences on the underlying structure for support. As the spider grows, so does the web and allometrically becomes a substrate-dependent <b>ladder</b> <b>web</b> with parallel-sided rather than rounded side frames. The hub of the web is modified into a silken cup. This species {{is said to be}} invasive and synanthropic.|$|E
5000|$|Weaving {{together}} economic theory, psychology, and {{the histories}} of immigration, industrialization, class formation and slavery, Roediger in this work addressed {{what has become a}} common question in labor history, specifically, and American political culture more generally: why, historically, have working class blacks and whites not found common cause in their shared suffering {{at the bottom of the}} social <b>ladder?</b> (<b>W.E.B.</b> DuBois also posed this question in his seminal work, Black Reconstruction (1935), as he saw a failure of labor in creating connections across racial lines.) In the nineteenth-century context where the small-scale, autonomous craftsmen were being replaced, slowly but inexorably, by the factory system - with great consequences for the [...] "liberty" [...] of ordinary Americans, Roediger suggested that for workers to embrace [...] "whiteness" [...] and a caricatured representation of black slaves provided them with a meaningful symbolic [...] "wage," [...] replacing the status values of independence and craft skill for workers.|$|E
25|$|Traditional orb webs are not {{effective}} for capturing moths, because only their scales will stick, allowing the moth to escape. The <b>ladder</b> <b>webs</b> of Scoloderus species {{appear to be}} adaptations in web design to increase moth capture. These webs extend vertically about seven times their width. When a moth slides down the web, it leaves a trail of scales until its body sticks to the web. However, these spiders {{do not seem to}} be closely related to bolas spiders. The nearest relatives seems to be the Cyrtarachneae (e.g. Pasilobus) of the Paleotropics. They also specialize on moths, and use threads that are beaded with sticky droplets. Celaenia and Taczanowskia species in South America seem to use chemical attractants to catch moths, too, and may also be closely related to bolas spiders.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to adults and immature individuals, all the juveniles were observed {{to build their}} catching <b>ladders</b> and support <b>webs</b> inside the tree hollows. No catching ladders of juveniles {{have been found in}} the open. This seems to indicate that early instars of odd-clawed spiders live exclusively within the tree hollows.|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{plasticity}} {{is important}} for maximizing fitness in variable environments. Orb web spiders, which rely on their webs being optimized for particular conditions, should benefit from plasticity in their web-building behaviours as prey and environmental conditions vary over time. Small-scale variation {{in the structure of}} webs results from spiders adjusting the web to suit local conditions. On the other hand, broader-scale variation in orb webs of different species, particularly in some more extreme web forms, can be attributed to evolved adaptations for catching specific prey types. Australian <b>ladder</b> <b>web</b> spiders, Telaprocera maudae, build extreme orb webs that are many times taller than wide and attached against tree trunks. The degree of web elongation is strongly negatively correlated with tree circumference. In this study we tested whether this extreme web form is a result of highly plastic web-building behaviour or whether it is an evolved trait. Spiders were allowed to build in frames of various diameters to control available horizontal space. We found that T. maudae built significantly more elongated webs when space was limited, but more 'typical', circular orb webs when space limitation was relaxed. These results indicate that the extremely elongated webs of these spiders are largely due to unprecedented plasticity in web-building behaviour. This allows spiders to maximize web area, and hence foraging potential, when building in space-limited microhabitats. These results are surprising as behavioural plasticity generally contributes to far more subtle variation in orb web structure. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Orb web spiders sit at {{the centre}} of their {{approximately}} circular webs when waiting for prey and so face {{many of the same}} challenges as central-place foragers. Prey value decreases with distance from the hub as a function of prey escape time. The further from the hub that prey are intercepted, the longer it takes a spider to reach them and the greater chance they have of escaping. Several species of orb web spiders build vertically elongated ladder-like orb webs against tree trunks, rather than circular orb webs in the open. As <b>ladder</b> <b>web</b> spiders invest disproportionately more web area further from the hub, it is expected they will experience reduced prey gain per unit area of web investment compared to spiders that build circular webs. We developed a model to investigate how building webs in the space-limited microhabitat on tree trunks influences the optimal size, shape and net prey gain of arboricolous ladder webs. The model suggests that as horizontal space becomes more limited, optimal web shape becomes more elongated, and optimal web area decreases. This change in web geometry results in decreased net prey gain compared to webs built without space constraints. However, when space is limited, spiders can achieve higher net prey gain compared to building typical circular webs in the same limited space. Our model shows how spiders optimise web investment in sub-optimal conditions and can be used to understand foraging investment trade-offs in other central-place foragers faced with constrained foraging arenas. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Customer {{value is}} {{understood}} {{as one of the}} constructs that best explains consumer decision making. Its proposal is to understand how consumers translate product or service characteristics and consequences of use into personal self-relevant values. The means-end theory is a way of systematically thinking in this hierarchical representation. The most commonly used method to achieve means-end chains is laddering. This theory and method were used to understand customer values of an important on-line Brazilian newspaper, which is an innovative approach, since on-line laddering is uncommon. The findings indicate that values related to goals of a personal nature are the most important ones. However, other values indicate the increase of the public man pointing to an alternative vision of what is commonly thought of as the contemporary isolated and selfish human. Academic research could benefit from a broader understanding and use of the means-end theory and <b>laddering</b> on the <b>Web.</b> Future research for managerial practices is warranted in areas such as segmentation, satisfaction measuring and customer value reevaluation, in addition to copy tests.
