500|$|The {{design for}} Buck McCoy was {{primarily}} based on Dennis Weaver, who portrayed {{him in the}} episode, as well as aspects of other western actors such as Roy Rogers and John Wayne. McCoy's costume in the fictional television show McTrigger {{was based on the}} attire worn by the main character in real-life television series McCloud. The design for the dog went through several different model changes until the Simpsons staff settled on the [...] "very angry bull-terrier design" [...] seen in the episode. A scene in the episode shows McCoy showcasing an array of films he starred in to the Simpson family through a movie projector. In order to achieve the strobe <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> done by the projector, the animators painted every other frame white and then blank.|$|E
500|$|The Sugababes {{performed}} an extended version of [...] "In the Middle" [...] during their UK tour in March and April 2004 to promote Three, {{in which they}} were supported by a four-piece band. The group performed the single, along with [...] "Hole in the Head" [...] and [...] "Too Lost in You", at Birmingham's Party in the Park festival on 10 July 2004. [...] "In the Middle" [...] was included in the set list for the band's 2007 tour in support of Overloaded: The Singles Collection. In addition, it was performed as part of the group's 2008 Change Tour, in which the performances featured the group in large, mirrored skirts, while rays of light were reflecting around the venue. Kat Keogh of The Journal praised their performance at the Newcastle City Hall as one of the show's highlights, while a critic from The Scotsman described their performance at the Edinburgh Playhouse as [...] "ridiculously camp", although admitted that the <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> was [...] "simple yet fantastically effective". The Sugababes performed [...] "In the Middle" [...] on 10 July 2009 at the Riverside Ground in County Durham, England, as part of a set list.|$|E
2500|$|Apple iMac was {{introduced}} in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted [...] "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's." [...] Described as [...] "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> when the computer went to sleep. The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makers – {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).|$|E

50|$|Karl Freund {{was born}} to Jewish parents in Dvůr Králové (Königinhof), Bohemia. At age 11 he moved {{with his family to}} Berlin.

In 1907 he began work at International Cinematograph and <b>Light</b> <b>Effect</b> Society. Freund was drafted by the Imperial Army to fight in World War I but was released from duty after only three months.|$|E

50|$|FFV {{claims that}} besides {{the effect of}} the massive {{spalling}} and fragmentation on the occupants of the armoured vehicle, which is standard for all HEAT warheads to a degree, the massive overpressure and intense heat will cause ammunition and more importantly the armoured vehicle's diesel fuel to ignite. The intense <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> will blind any occupants for at least seven minutes, in addition to the obscuring effect of the dense smoke created by the AT4's HEAT warhead.|$|E
50|$|Aconic reflectors {{are used}} in ultra violet light UV curing devices to smooth light density for a more uniform curing pattern. They {{can be used to}} mask hot spots {{generated}} by the lamp envelope and cold areas created by shadows. They can be used to illuminate a specific shape at a given distance. Examples include a search light reflector that is intentionally designed to generate a divergent beam, or a reflective curve with the intention of generating an aesthetic <b>light</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} in 1996 {{of a large}} collection of photographic prints and negatives made clear that Breitner was also a talented photographer of street life in the city. Sometimes he made various pictures of the same subject, from different perspectives or in different weather conditions. Photos sometimes formed the immediate example for a particular painting, for instance the girls in kimono. On other occasions, Breitner used photography for general reference, to capture an atmosphere, a <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> or the weather in the city at a particular moment.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{images and}} effects {{came from an}} Atlanta 1960's style light show venture called the [...] "Electric Collage." [...] The Electric Collage {{production}} company was popular at major rock concerts and rock festivals. Collage operators were able to produce complex lighting effects with projectors that were not possible using the video technology of the day. The Now Explosion had collage technicians create <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> images on a studio screen while videographers captured the effects with multiple studio cameras. Often these lightshow enhancements were combined with studio dance videos in later production before final programs were assembled on tape for broadcast and distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Uplighting is less common, {{often used}} to bounce {{indirect}} light off the ceiling and back down. It is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels. Uplighting (indirect) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces. It gives a more uniform presentation of the light output in operation. However indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface. While indirect lighting can create a diffused and shadow free <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> it {{can be regarded as}} an uneconomical lighting principle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} music videos which helped to put Orson onto the map were both {{directed}} by Tony Petrossian. The video for [...] "No Tomorrow" [...] uses a spotlight device to show only bits and snippets of the singer's night {{out with a}} girl. It features the attention focused on a circular light that moves around the screen and allows you to see through; {{the rest of the}} picture is darker than what's shown in the light and sometimes goes all black. The video for [...] "Bright Idea" [...] features a device that originated with Picasso when he took his still image labeled [...] "Menotaur." [...] In the Tony Petrossian-helmed music video, the streaking <b>light</b> <b>effect</b> comes to life and real time.|$|E
