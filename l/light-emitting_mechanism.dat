Analysis of the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) of the SS-MBE grown SiGe and their anodized porous counterparts processed under various conditions is used to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the visible <b>light-emitting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of porous SiGe. In addition, the photoluminescence decay dynamics of porous SiGe are examined and are found to differ in terms of speed and behaviour from porous Si. We interpret the origin of visible PL of the porous MBE SiGe films by considering the quantum confinement effect, as in the interpretation of PL from porous Si, and the evolution of the SiGe Si like-band structure...|$|E
40|$|So far,excitonic {{luminescence}} {{in metal}} halide (MH) has extensively been studied by many workers, with the interest {{not only in}} physics of excitons but also in its possible application in optoelectronics. In the actual MHs, however, excitonic luminescence is so weak that it {{is beyond the scope}} of applications. Here we report the rediscovery that inherent excitonic luminescence in MH is dominated by a dramatically high <b>light-emitting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This is demonstrated using improved films of MH yielded by two simple,independent methods, both applicable to several MHs. For example, improved CsPbCl 3 and CuBr films exhibit more than 103 â 104 times stronger excitonic luminescence than conventional films. Inherent excitonic luminescence in MH is promising for applications in exciton-based light-emitting devices,particularly in shorter-wavelength devices than the traditional, nonexcitonic ones because it is MH and only MH that includes many compounds with large band gap and large exciton binding energies...|$|E
40|$|In modern {{illumination}} systems, {{compact size}} and high brightness are important features. Light recycling allows {{an increase of}} the spectral radiance (brightness) emitted by a light source {{for the price of}} reducing the total radiant power. Light recycling means returning part of the emitted light to the source where part of it will escape absorption. As a result, the output brightness can be increased in a restricted phase space, compared with the intrinsic brightness of the source. In this work the principle of light recycling is applied to artificial light sources in order to achieve brightness enhancement. Firstly, the feasibilities of increasing the brightness of light sources via light recycling are examined theoretically, based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics including Kirchhoff's law on radiation, Planck's law, Lambert-Beer's law, the étendue conservation and the brightness theorem. The theory of light recycling can be derived from first principles. From an experimental viewpoint, the radiation properties of three different kinds of light sources including short-arc lamps, incandescent lamps and LEDs characterized by their light-generating mechanisms are investigated. These three types of sources are used in light recycling experiments, for the purpose of 1. validating the intrinsic light recycling effect in light sources, e. g. the intrinsic light recycling effect in incandescent lamps stemming from the coiled filament structure. 2. acquiring the required parameters for establishing physical models, e. g. the emissivity/absorptivity of the short-arc lamps, the intrinsic reflectivity and the external quantum efficiency of LEDs. 3. laying the foundations for designing optics aimed at brightness enhancement according to the characteristics of the sources and applications. Based on the fundamental laws and experiments, two physical models for simulating the radiance distribution of light sources are established, one for thermal filament lamps, the other for luminescent sources, LEDs. Both are validated with high resolution measurements. The physical models are capable of analytically modelling the radiance distribution with few required parameters (geometry, material properties and operating conditions). They are widely applicable to any kind of sources with similar <b>light-emitting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Combining the advantages of conciseness, high accuracy and wide applicability, the physical models can be integrated into ray-tracing software. As validation of the theoretical and experimental investigation of the light recycling effect, an optical device, the Carambola, is designed for achieving deterministic (as opposed to stochastic) and multiple light recycling. The Carambola has the function of a concentrator. In order to achieve the maximum possible brightness enhancement with the Carambola, several combinations of sources and Carambolas are modelled in ray-tracing simulations. Sources with different <b>light-emitting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and different radiation properties (optical thickness), and Carambolas with different geometries and optical properties are used. It is concluded that a high-pressure xenon lamp is suitable for light recycling with the Carambola due to its moderate optical thickness, its continuous spectrum and its geometrical features. In the ray-tracing simulation, the suitability of the XBO lamp and the Carambola optics for light recycling is confirmed. A prototype five-point reflective Carambola was manufactured from aluminium, for the purpose of experimentally demonstrating a brightness increase. The Carambola is tested with different sources. The experimental results are below the theoretical expectation, i. e. the measured brightness enhancement factor is lower than the designed factor and the modelled factor. The discrepancies are explained. A real Carambola must have a high reflectivity and an accurate shape, if a significant effect of light recycling is to be shown. The brightness enhancement by light recycling with the Carambola is expected to be improved greatly by enhancing the surface quality of the reflectors, using suitable sources with small optical thickness, compact size, (and in the case of LEDs) high intrinsic reflectivity and external quantum efficiency. The Carambola is expected to be utilized in applications such as high brightness displays. In conclusion, both theoretical investigation and experimental measurements on light recycling demonstrated a significant increase of the brightness of optically thin sources...|$|R
40|$|Electron-paramagnetic-resonance EPR and {{photoluminescence}} PL {{studies on}} magnesium gallate (MgGa_ 2 O_ 4) phosphor activated with divalent manganese {{have been carried}} out. The EPR spectrum exhibits a six-line hyperfine structure centered at g= 1. 995, which is a characteristic of a Mn^ 2 + ion with a nuclear spin I= 5 / 2. The spin-Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated. The concentration and temperature 123 - 433 K dependences of EPR signals have been studied. The number of spins participating in resonance N with temperature obeys the Boltzman law and from the graph of log N versus 1 /T the activation energy has been evaluated. The paramagnetic susceptibilities have been calculated from the EPR data at different temperatures and {{it is interesting to}} note that it obeys the Curie-Weiss behavior. The Curie constant has been evaluated from the 1 /χ versus T graph. A bright green photoluminescence according to the transition ^ 4 T_ 1 -> ^ 6 A_ 1 whose emission peak is located at 502 nm is observed from the phosphor under UV excitation when excited by 267 -nm light. Such a stable luminescence performance is promising for use in the field of flat panel <b>light-emitting</b> devices.

40|$|We discuss {{selection}} {{and testing of}} thermally sensitive phosphors for use with pressure-sensitive paints (PSP’s). These phosphors exhibit essentially no pressure dependence and therefore can provide an independent means for removing the temperature-dependent response of PSP’s. The major selection criteria were 1) temperature sensitivity from ambient to 300 C, 2) a short decay time (important for rapidly moving surfaces), and 3) that the material be excitable by a blue <b>light-emitting</b> diode. The <b>mechanisms</b> which affect the temperature dependence are discussed. For example, as temperature is increased, some phosphors show an initial decrease in decay time followed by an increase then a subsequent decrease. This is explained by a thermalization process. Plots of decay time versus temperature {{for a variety of}} phosphors are presented. In summary, the most striking temperature dependence is found in rare-earth oxysulfide hosts with either europium or terbium as the activator, but no single one of them covers the entire temperature range. Several praesodymium-doped oxysulfide compounds come close to meeting the above criteria. Also, several cerium-activated compounds show promise, for instance YAG:Ce. It is characterized by bright, efficient emission, a short decay time (about 60 ns), but the temperature dependence does not begin until about 160 C...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{models of}} micro-channel plate (MCP) and fluorescent screen of the framing camera were established. By combining the finite element integration and Monte Carlo method, software Simion and Lorenz were respectively used {{to simulate the}} effects of different voltages loaded on the fluorescent screen, different closed distance between fluorescent screen and MCP, and electrode immersion depth at MCP output on the spatial resolution, {{in order to obtain}} an axisymmetric distribution curve. Results showed that the closed distance between MCP and fluorescent screen had the largest impact on the framing camera&# 39;s spatial resolution. In addition, higher fluorescent screen voltage did not necessarily result in better spatial resolution, as it was influenced by the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the fluorescent screen. At the framing camera&# 39;s current closed distance of 0. 8 mm, a fluorescent screen voltage of 5000 V could achieve the best spatial resolution. © 2016 SPIE. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{combination}} of photonics and silicon {{technology is a}} great challenge because of the potentiality of coupling electronics and optical functions on a single chip. Silicon nanocrystals are promising in various areas of photonics especially for light-emitting functionality and for photovoltaic cells. This review describes the recent achievements and remaining challenges of Si photonics with emphasis on the perspectives of Si nanoscale materials. Many of the results and properties can be simulated and understood based on theoretical studies. However, {{some of the key}} questions like the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>mechanism</b> are subjects of intense debates despite a remarkable progress in the recent years. Even more complex and important is to move the known experimentalobservations towards practical applications. The demonstrated devices and approaches are often too complex and/or have too low efficiency.

40|$|Bioluminescence, i. e. {{the ability}} for living organisms to emit light, is a {{widespread}} phenomenon in deep-ocean, due to valuable ecological advantages it provides to organisms endowed with this capability. Six percent of deep-sea cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, skates and chimaeras) are luminous. Among them, the lantern shark Etmopterus spinax Linnaeus, 1758 {{is one of the}} most commons and can be easily caught. For this reason, it has recently become a model species for studying bioluminescence in shark. Although various aspects (functions and control) of this complex phenomenon are now better understood in this species, the photocyte (i. e. the <b>light-emitting</b> cell) <b>mechanism</b> of light emission remains unsolved. This is the subject addressed in this work. In the first chapter, photophore ultrastructure is explored since it is a key step in investigating an unknown bioluminescent mechanism. By using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we were able to describe photophore fine organization (Paper 1) : a new structure, a reflector, which was believed to be absent in shark photophores, was highlighted. Photocytes were found to be divided into three distinct areas, of which the apical one, oriented toward the photophore center and containing numerous granular inclusions, was proved to be the light-emitting area (Paper 2). By investigating photocyte ultrastructural changes during the course of a lightemission event, we proved granular inclusion to represent shark microsource (i. e. the intracellular light-emitting site, where the chemiluminescent reaction takes place), and we proposed the term “glowon” to characterize this novel particle (Paper 2). In the second chapter, we addressed E. spinax feeding habits in order to identify putative luminous preys and analyze whether the shark could obtain a known luciferin (i. e. the luminous substrate) through its diet and use it for its own light production. The results we obtained (Paper 3) suggested E. spinax does not use a known luciferin but might rather use a novel molecule as substrate or an unknown storage or active form of a known luciferin. The isolation and purification of putative new luminous molecules (luciferin and luciferase –i. e. the reaction enzyme) are initiated in the third chapter of which the purpose is to provide basis experiments and reflection for the future complete characterization of this system. Finally, all results were integrated and discussed together with regard to previous findings on bioluminescence functions and control in this shark species. (SC - Sciences) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Internal quantum {{efficiency}} (IQE) of a high-brightness blue LED has been evaluated from the external {{quantum efficiency}} measured {{as a function of}} current at room temperature. Processing the data with a novel evaluation procedure based on the ABC-model, we have determined separately IQE of the LED structure and light extraction efficiency (LEE) of UX: 3 chip. Full text Nowadays, understanding of LED efficiency behavior at high currents is quite critical to find ways for further improve­ment of III-nitride LED performance [1]. External quantum ef­ficiency ηe (EQE) provides integral information on the recom­bination and photon emission processes in LEDs. Meanwhile EQE is the product of IQE ηi and LEE ηext at negligible car­rier leakage from the active region. Separate determination of IQE and LEE would be much more helpful, providing correla­tion between these parameters and specific epi-structure and chip design. In this paper, we extend the approach of [2, 3] to the whole range of the current/optical power variation, provid­ing an express tool for separate evaluation of IQE and LEE. We studied an InGaN-based LED fabricated by Osram OS. LED structure grown by MOCVD on sapphire substrate was processed as UX: 3 chip and mounted into the Golden Dragon package without molding. EQE was measured with Labsphere CDS- 600 spectrometer. Plotting EQE versus output power P and finding the power Pm corresponding to EQE maximum ηm enables comparing the measurements with the analytical rela­tionships ηi = Q/(Q+p 1 / 2 +p- 1 / 2),p = P/Pm, and Q = B/(AC) 1 / 2 where A, Band C are recombination constants [4]. As a result, maximum IQE value equal to QI(Q+ 2) can be found from the ratio ηm/ηe plotted as a function of p 1 / 2 +p 1 - 1 / 2 (see Fig. la) and then LEE calculated as ηext = ηm (Q+ 2) /Q. Experimental EQE as a function of normalized optical power p is shown in Fig. 1 b along with the analytical approximation based on the ABC­model. The approximation fits perfectly the measurements in the range of the optical power (or operating current) variation by eight orders of magnitude. In conclusion, new express method for separate evaluation of IQE and LEE of III-nitride LEDs is suggested and applied to characterization of a high-brightness blue LED. With this method, we obtained LEE from the free chip surface to the air as 69. 8 % and IQE as 85. 7 % at the maximum and 65. 2 % at the operation current 350 rnA. [I] G. Verzellesi, D. Saguatti, M.
