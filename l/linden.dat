5|$|Trevor Linden's grandfather, Nick van der <b>Linden,</b> {{emigrated to}} Canada from the Netherlands in 1929. He ran a {{construction}} company until his son Lane, Trevor's father, replaced him in 1979. Trevor {{was born in}} Medicine Hat, Alberta to Lane and Edna <b>Linden.</b> <b>Linden</b> was a skilled athlete; despite hockey being his top priority, he also participated in baseball, golf, volleyball, basketball, and speed skating. An excellent student in school, he was offered a scholarship to Princeton University to play for their hockey team; instead, <b>Linden</b> chose to stay in Medicine Hat and play with the local major junior team, the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL. <b>Linden</b> grew up watching the Tigers and idolized Lanny McDonald, who played in Medicine Hat before he joined the NHL.|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} {{playing with the}} Medicine Hat Midget Tigers of the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMHL), <b>Linden</b> joined the WHL Tigers for the final five games of the 1985–86 regular season, where he scored two goals; he also {{appeared}} in six playoff games, scoring one goal. The next season, {{at the age of}} 16, he made the team full-time. In his first full season in the WHL, <b>Linden</b> had 36 points in 72 games, and then had nine points in 20 playoff games, including two goals in the championship game, helping Medicine Hat win their first Memorial Cup as Canadian junior champions. The next year, <b>Linden</b> had 110 points in 67 games, and led the Tigers to their second consecutive Memorial Cup title. During the 1988 WHL playoffs, <b>Linden</b> set a WHL playoff record by scoring the fastest goal from the start of a game, scoring seven seconds into a 6–5 Tigers win over the Saskatoon Blades on April 15, 1988. At the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, the Vancouver Canucks selected <b>Linden</b> second overall, after the Minnesota North Stars selected Mike Modano.|$|E

5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, <b>Linden</b> was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in the business side of the sport. In light of this service, <b>Linden</b> was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, <b>Linden</b> was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between <b>Linden</b> and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|Faye and Joseph separate, {{and she and}} <b>Linden</b> begin a relationship. Faye {{discovers that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joseph's baby, but <b>Linden</b> promises to support her and they become briefly engaged. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, <b>Linden</b> terminates their engagement. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when <b>Linden</b> attempts to defend her, he is {{hit in the head}} with a glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit.|$|E

He is still often referred to affectionately as 'Captain Canuck', despite not having captained the team since 1997.
