50|$|Part of {{the user}} {{interface}} design {{is affected by the}} quality of the page layout. For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the <b>layout.</b> <b>Page</b> pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of aesthetics on larger screens.|$|E
40|$|Document Image Understanding (DIU) is an {{interesting}} research area with a large variety of challenging applications. Researchers have worked from decades on this topic, as witnessed by the scientific literature. The main {{purpose of the present}} report is to describe the current status of DIU with particular attention to two subprocesses: document skew angle estimation and page decomposition. Several algorithms proposed in the literature are synthetically described. They are included in a novel classification scheme. Some methods proposed for the evaluation of page decomposition algorithms are described. Critical discussions are reported about the current status of the field and about the open problems. Some considerations about the logical layout analysis are also reported. Keywords: document image processing, document image understanding, automatic zoning, geometric and logical <b>layout,</b> <b>page</b> decomposition, document segmentation and classification, text segmentation, skew ang [...] ...|$|E

40|$|NOTE: Due to {{a number}} of reasons we have {{abandoned}} the pursuit of handling this within the filesystem layer. Instead, we’ve decided to adapt Linux’s MD software RAID implementation to include checksums and to reuse the techniques previously developed in [2] in order to speed up recovery of the RAID to a consistent state following a crash. The reasons for this are as follows: 1. The implementation of this method is far less intrusive. In the fs layer we would have had to fight with the entire fs <b>layout,</b> <b>page</b> cache, behavior, block allocation logic, etc. 2. Our journalling protocol didn’t really make use {{of the fact that we}} had journalled full checksum/parity blocks upon crash recovery. Rather, all it did was use their locations to figure out where it should recalculate the checksums/parity. This is effectively the same scheme as that presented in [2]. 3. Without being aware of it from top to bottom the filesystem can’t really do anything interesting to recovery from the fact that checksums don’t match anyways. RAID on the other hand can use this data to rebuild a stripe similar to ZFS...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first one is devoted to open {{questions}} directly related to the geometrisation and interpretation of the Penrose limit. Accordingly, in chapter 2 we provide the technical prerequisites concerning Penrose limits, plane waves and string theory in these backgrounds. The necessary equipment at hand we go to work in chapter 3 where we identify the Penrose limit [20] as the lowest order of a covariant metric expansion around a null geodesic, i. e. extend the result obtained in [20]. To this end we introduce the null analogue to Fermi coordinates which are usually based on an expansion around a timelike geodesic. Eventually, this will lead us to what we dubbed a Penrose-Fermi expansion of the metric. In addition to its aesthetically appealing properties this novel prescription comes with different technical advantages which we will discuss. Building on these results in chapter 4 we compare the Penrose-Fermi expansion of the metric on the one hand with a Riemann coordinate expansion of the string embedding variables on the other in order to clarify the usual statement that exact string theory in a Penrose limit plane wave background might be interpreted as a lowest order approximation to string theory in the original background. Indeed, as we will see both expansions agree order by order after imposing the light cone gauge which acts as a pivotal point between space-time and world-sheet expansions in this context. In the second part of this thesis we embed the observed universality for Penrose limits of various space-time singularities in the broader context of different space-time probes. To this end in chapter 5 we shortly review the results obtained in [20, 25] underlining the interpretation in terms of null geodesic congruences. Then in chapter 6 we replace the null congruence by what we consider as their nearest relative, namely a massless scalar field. After observing a completely analogous universal behaviour in this context, we concentrate on related topics as the uniqueness of time evolution near space-time singularities. We conclude in chapter 7 with a short outlook and discussion of open questions. Three publications are embedded into this thesis and form the larger part of its body, namely chapters 3, 4 and 6 are identical to [26], [27] and [28] respectively up to minor changes w. r. t. <b>layout,</b> (<b>page,</b> section, equation and citation) numbering and in some rare cases symbols, which were adjusted in favour of overall readability.

40|$|Abstract: The Constrained Run-Length Algorithm (CRLA) is a {{well-known}} technique for page segmentation. The algorithm is very efficient for partitioning documents with Manhattan layouts but not suited to deal with complex <b>layout</b> <b>pages,</b> e. g. irregular graphics embedded in a text paragraph. Its main drawback is to use only local information during the smearing stage, which may lead to erroneous linkage of text and graphics. This paper presents {{a solution to this}} problem by adding global information into the process of the CRLA. This enhanced CRLA can be applied to non-Manhattan <b>page</b> <b>layout</b> successfully. It can also extract text surrounded by a box. Both cases cannot be processed by the original CRLA...|$|R
