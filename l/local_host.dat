25|$|As a {{young man}} Hathorn, a native of today's Delaware, {{had been on the}} {{surveying}} team that established the present land border between New York and New Jersey, which had been the subject of a lengthy conflict between the two colonies for much of the 18th century. He settled in Warwick and opened a store and iron forge in 1770, and built the house after marrying Elizabeth Welling, daughter of his <b>local</b> <b>host,</b> in 1772. The inscription of their initials and the year of construction {{in the side of the}} house is a tradition more commonly associated with Germanic building traditions, a sign of how influential settlers of that background were in the Hudson Valley.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Ages, due to {{increasing}} geographical dispersion and re-settlement, Jews divided into distinct regional groups which today are generally addressed {{according to two}} primary geographical groupings: the Ashkenazi of Northern and Eastern Europe, and the Sephardic Jews of Iberia (Spain and Portugal), North Africa and the Middle East. These groups have parallel histories sharing many cultural similarities {{as well as a}} series of massacres, persecutions and expulsions, such as the expulsion from Spain in 1492, the expulsion from England in 1290, and the expulsion from Arab countries in 1948–1973. Although the two branches comprise many unique ethno-cultural practices and have links to their <b>local</b> <b>host</b> populations (such as Central Europeans for the Ashkenazim and Hispanics and Arabs for the Sephardim), their shared religion and ancestry, as well as their continuous communication and population transfers, has been responsible for a unified sense of cultural and religious Jewish identity between Sephardim and Ashkenazim from the late Roman period to the present.|$|E

2500|$|Paley was not fond {{of one of}} the network's biggest stars. Arthur Godfrey {{had been}} working locally in Washington, DC and New York City hosting morning shows. Paley did not {{consider}} him worthy of CBS, being a mere <b>local</b> <b>host.</b> [...] When Paley went into the Army and took up his assignment in London, and Frank Stanton assumed his duties, he decided to try Godfrey on the network. [...] By the time Paley returned, Godfrey was a rising star on the network with his daily Arthur Godfrey Time program. Paley had to accept the entertainer, but the two were never friends. Godfrey would, on occasion, mock Paley and other CBS executives by name, on the air. [...] Godfrey's massive revenues from advertising on the popular morning programs and his two prime-time shows Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts and Arthur Godfrey and his Friends, protected him from any reprisals. [...] In private, Paley and his colleagues despised Godfrey.|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasThis paper {{identifies}} {{when the}} transmission network <b>local</b> <b>hosting</b> capacity for a wind harvesting network {{may be limited}} because of steady-state bus voltage limits. In addition, the paper addresses how with the wind farm voltage control provision, such constraints may be overcome and the <b>local</b> <b>hosting</b> capacity can be increased. To answer these questions, actual Spanish system data is used on different network models of increasing complexity. Firstly, a simplified model of both transmission network and harvesting network is discussed to show that generally, only buses with low short-circuit power and low or high reactance-resistance ratio may limit <b>local</b> <b>hosting</b> capacity significantly. Secondly, {{in order to assess}} how modeling simplifications affect the results, the full model of an actual Spanish harvesting network is considered: the real reactive capability of the harvesting network at the transmission network connection node is computed and the <b>local</b> <b>hosting</b> capacity recalculated. Finally, in the last step, the results of the aforementioned simplified models are validated using the complete model of the Spanish transmission network. In addition, a complementary area hosting capacity analysis is included in order to show the importance of steady-state bus voltage constraints when large amounts of power need to be transported over long distances. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
