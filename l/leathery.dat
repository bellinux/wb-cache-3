5|$|Because of {{the similar}} {{raptorial}} forelegs, mantidflies may {{be confused with}} mantises. This similarity {{is an example of}} convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have the <b>leathery</b> forewings of mantises.|$|E
5|$|Other orders {{such as the}} Dermaptera (earwigs), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets), Mantodea (praying mantis) and Blattodea (cockroaches) have rigid <b>leathery</b> {{forewings}} that aren't flapped while flying, {{sometimes called}} tegmen (pl. tegmina), elytra, or pseudoelytron.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{consists}} of dehiscent loculicidal capsules (splitting between the locules) that are ellipsoid to subglobose (almost spherical) {{in shape and}} are papery to <b>leathery</b> in texture.|$|E
5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and <b>leathery.</b> They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} known monotremes was Teinolophos, which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and they lay eggs which are <b>leathery</b> and uncalcified.|$|E
5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both ixodid and argasid ticks {{by a combination of}} a projecting capitulum at the front and a soft, <b>leathery</b> skin. Other distinguish characteristics include the position of the stigmata, the lack of setae, the strongly corrugated integument, and the form of the fenestrated plates.|$|E
5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} <b>leathery</b> to woody follicles develop. Hanging {{downwards}} on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum was {{circumscribed}} by Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten in 1879 {{with what}} was then known as Hydnum suaveolens as the type species. Before then, fungi with spines (hydnoid fungi) had been grouped in Hydnum by Elias Fries in his 1821 work Systema mycologicum. Karsten defined Hydnellum as having fruitbodies with a corky or <b>leathery,</b> tough cap, and a centrally attached stipe. Synonyms of Hydnellum include Calodon (Karsten, 1881), and Phaeodon (Joseph Schröter, 1888).|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about {{pterosaur}} reproduction, and pterosaur eggs are very rare. The first known pterosaur egg was found in the quarries of Liaoning, the same place that yielded feathered dinosaurs. The egg was squashed flat with no signs of cracking, so evidently the eggs had <b>leathery</b> shells, as in modern lizards. This was supported by the description of an additional pterosaur egg belonging to the genus Darwinopterus, described in 2011, which also had a <b>leathery</b> shell and, also like modern reptiles but unlike birds, was fairly small compared {{to the size of the}} mother. In 2014 five unflattened eggs from the species Hamipterus tianshanensis were found in an Early Cretaceous deposit in northwest China. Examination of the shells by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of a thin calcareous eggshell layer with a membrane underneath. A study of pterosaur eggshell structure and chemistry published in 2007 indicated that it is likely pterosaurs buried their eggs, like modern crocodiles and turtles. Egg-burying would have been beneficial to the early evolution of pterosaurs, as it allows for more weight-reducing adaptations, but this method of reproduction would also have put limits on the variety of environments pterosaurs could live in, and may have disadvantaged them when they began to face ecological competition from birds.|$|E
5|$|Viewed with a microscope, {{the wall}} of the {{apothecium}} is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, <b>leathery</b> and compact, and covered with a fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.|$|E
5|$|The {{forewings}} {{are short}} oblong <b>leathery</b> plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding that requires the use of the cerci.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} N. rajah are very {{distinctive}} and reach a large size. They are <b>leathery</b> in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically peltate, whereby the tendril joins the lamina on the underside, before the apex. This characteristic is {{more pronounced in}} N. rajah {{than in any other}} Nepenthes species, with the exception of N. clipeata. However, it is not unique to these two taxa, as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves. The tendrils are inserted ≤5cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50cm. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The lamina is oblong to lanceolate-shaped, ≤80cm long and ≤15cm wide.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora palmata (commonly {{known as}} the stinking earthfan or the fetid false coral) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae. The fruit bodies are <b>leathery</b> and coral-like, with {{branches}} that are narrow at the base before widening out like a fan and splitting into numerous flattened prongs. The wedge-like tips are whitish when young, but darken as the fungus matures. The common names of the fungus refers to its pungent odor, likened to fetid garlic. A widely distributed but uncommon species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, where it fruits {{on the ground in}} both coniferous and mixed forest.|$|E
5|$|This {{extremely}} rare mushroom is notable for its unusual appearance and disjunct distribution: {{it is found}} only in select locales in Texas and Japan. The fruit body, which grows on the stumps or dead roots of cedar elms (in Texas) or dead oaks (in Japan), somewhat resembles a dark brown or black cigar before it splits open radially into a starlike arrangement of four to seven <b>leathery</b> rays. The interior surface of the fruit body bears the spore-bearing tissue known as the hymenium, and is colored white to brown, depending on its age. The fruit body opening can {{be accompanied by a}} distinct hissing sound and the release of a smoky cloud of spores.|$|E
5|$|The thorax and abdomen are {{segmented}} {{and have}} a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and <b>leathery</b> while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines {{and there are a}} pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.|$|E
5|$|While {{historically}} {{thought of}} as simple <b>leathery</b> structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the wing membranes of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (from the tip to the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called actinofibrils. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as is the exact material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), {{they may have been}} stiffening or strengthening agents in the outer part of the wing. The wing membranes also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Humankind {{enters a}} golden age of {{prosperity}} {{at the expense of}} creativity. Five decades after their arrival, the Overlords reveal their appearance, resembling the traditional Christian folk images of demons: large bipeds with cloven hooves, <b>leathery</b> wings, horns, and tails. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. George Greggson's future wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star-catalog number consistent with the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. With the help of an oceanographer friend Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near-light speeds, the elapsed time on the ship is only a few weeks, and he arranges to endure it in drug-induced hibernation.|$|E
5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and <b>leathery</b> peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E
25|$|Sea turtles are amphibious reptiles, {{but they}} are not {{amphibians}}. Reptiles belong to the class Reptilia while amphibians belong to the class Amphibia. These are two distinct taxonomic groups. Reptiles have scales and <b>leathery</b> skins, while the skins of amphibians are smooth and porous. Unlike frogs, sea turtle eggs have tough, <b>leathery</b> shells which allow them to survive on land without drying out.|$|E
25|$|A.resiliens resembles {{several of}} its congeners; in particular, it belongs to a group {{comprising}} varicolored spleenwort (A.heterochroum), A.nesioticum, and A.palmeri, as well as A.resiliens. The {{members of this group}} all share dark, lustrous stipes and lack prominent hydathodes {{on the surface of the}} blade, the latter characteristic distinguishing them from single-sorus spleenwort (A.monanthes) and others. Among the group, A.resiliens has a slightly more <b>leathery</b> leaf texture than the rest, lacks distinct teeth on the pinna margins, and tends to have once-forked, rather than simple, fertile veins. Stolze noted that specimens with leaf texture so thick as to obscure the veins may be identified as A.resiliens, as A.heterochroum and A.palmeri very rarely become this <b>leathery.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the starry}} five-pointed leaves of Liquidambar {{resemble}} those of some maples (Acer), Liquidambar is easily distinguished from Acer by its glossy, <b>leathery</b> leaves that are positioned singly (alternate), not in pairs (opposite) on the stems. Luna and Promethea moth caterpillars feed on the leaves.|$|E
25|$|Shagreen patches: Areas {{of thick}} <b>leathery</b> skin that are dimpled like an orange peel, and pigmented, {{they are usually}} found on the lower back or nape of the neck, or {{scattered}} across the trunk or thighs. The frequency of these lesions rises with age.|$|E
25|$|Fearsome {{reptiles}} {{of great}} power and intelligence, the Dragons were bred during {{the wars of}} the First Age by Morgoth. Most possessed <b>leathery</b> wings, fiery breath, {{and the power of}} speech. Some Dragons (such as Glaurung) also had a hypnotic power over their victims.|$|E
25|$|The walnut orb-weaver spider is {{very wide}} and flattened, with a <b>leathery</b> skin. Its color ranges from red brown and grey brown to black with a dark, {{yellowish}} to yellow-greenish leaf-like fleckled marking on its opisthosoma, where small dents are visible. These are the onsets of muscles that flatten the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium septentrionale {{is a small}} fern which {{grows in}} dense {{clusters}} superficially resembling tufts of grass. The long, dark stems support narrow, <b>leathery</b> leaf blades, which may appear slightly forked at the tip. The fronds are monomorphic, with no difference in shape or size between fertile and sterile fronds.|$|E
25|$|In fruit, the glomerules {{of flowers}} form connate hard clusters. The fruit (utricle) is {{enclosed}} by the <b>leathery</b> and incurved perianth, and is {{immersed in the}} swollen, hardened perianth base. The horizontal seed is lenticular, 2–3mm, with a red-brown, shiny seed coat. The seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).|$|E
25|$|The aposematic colours {{are most}} often some {{combination}} of red, yellow, black, white, whereas palatable animals are usually cryptic. The noxious animals may display by slow flying, and in general are prominently visible. Noxious animals usually have thick, <b>leathery</b> cuticles through which, at certain points, they extrude noxious fluids when pecked; they will often survive a 'trial'.|$|E
25|$|The cotyledons, {{the seed}} leaves, {{attached}} to the embryonic axis. There may be one (Monocotyledons), or two (Dicotyledons). The cotyledons are also the source of nutrients in the non-endospermic dicotyledons, in which case they replace the endosperm, and are thick and <b>leathery.</b> In endospermic seeds the cotyledons are thin and papery. Dicotyledons have the point of attachment opposite one another on the axis.|$|E
25|$|Camels' mouths have a thick <b>leathery</b> lining, {{allowing}} them to chew thorny desert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with nostrils that can close, form a barrier against sand. If sand gets lodged in their eyes, they can dislodge it using their transparent third eyelid. The camels' gait and widened feet help them move without sinking into the sand.|$|E
25|$|Acraea terpsicore, the tawny coster, is a small, , <b>leathery,</b> winged {{butterfly}} {{which is}} common in grassland and scrub habitats. It belongs to the Nymphalidae or brush-footed butterfly family. It has a weak fluttery flight. It is avoided by most insect predators. This species and the yellow coster (Acraea issoria) {{are the only two}} Indian representatives of the predominantly African tribe Acraeini.|$|E
25|$|The {{average time}} of {{development}} from Egg to adult at 30 degrees celsius is 20.5 days. The eggs of most species are off-white and oval in shape. The egg takes on average 3.8 days +/- 0.02 {{to develop into}} the first instar. The chorion is shiny and smooth. In certain species like epirerus or platylomalus it can look pale brown and be <b>leathery</b> in texture.|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{detached}} aptychi occur in certain beds of rock (such as {{those from the}} Mesozoic in the Alps). These rocks are usually accumulated at great depths. The modern Nautilus lacks any calcitic plate for closing its shell, and only one extinct nautiloid genus {{is known to have}} borne anything similar. Nautilus does, however, have a <b>leathery</b> head shield (the hood) which it uses to cover the opening when it retreats inside.|$|E
25|$|In {{the more}} {{temperate}} parts of its range, A.resiliens may {{be confused with}} ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) and maidenhair spleenwort (A.trichomanes). Its stipe and rachis are darker and its pinnae smaller and more rounded than that of A.platyneuron, which also displays frond dimorphism with prostrate sterile fronds. The pinnae of A.resiliens are more widely spaced than those of A.trichomanes, which also lack the upward-pointing auricle, {{the texture of the}} leaf tissue is more <b>leathery,</b> and the stipe darker.|$|E
25|$|Bifrenaria are {{generally}} robust plants, of sympodial growth, between ten and sixty centimeters tall. They {{are characterized by}} round-section root with thick velamen, four-angled fleshy pseudobulbs of one internode, often basally protected by dried sheaths and with only one apical leaf(except for Bifrenaria steyermarkii, which occasionally has two), plicate (fan-folded) enervated <b>leathery</b> leaves, yet malleable and not exceedingly thick, with a pseudo-petiole of basal round section, and a basal inflorescences bearing up to ten flowers, which seldom surpass the leaves' length.|$|E
25|$|Ghatanothoa {{is said to}} be the firstborn of Cthulhu. He is infamous for his horrid appearance, and fearsome medusa-like ability, {{which causes}} a viewer's skin to become hard and <b>leathery</b> but {{preserves}} the brain, leaving the victim to go slowly mad trapped within an immobile shell. Among the myriad of deities worshipped in Mu, Ghatanothoa was the most respected as well as the most feared. Prior to the destruction of Mu, Ghatanothoa's cult became the most powerful on the continent.|$|E
25|$|Out {{towards the}} Hautes-Côtes de Beaune west of Montrachet, the {{vineyards}} of St Aubin were once planted with Gamay but now produce {{a mixture of}} Chardonnay and Pinot noir. Traditionally the village has been overshadowed by the famous names to the east, although the reputation of its white wines is developing as the prices of their neighbours head into the stratosphere. The red wines have <b>leathery</b> notes in their youth, that soften attractively with age.	156ha of the 237ha are Premier Crus.|$|E
