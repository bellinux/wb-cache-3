25|$|The Great Hall was {{a room of}} some size, 80ft long by 22ft wide. The {{floor of}} the room was Hopton Wood stone, and it had a {{panelled}} wagon roofed ceiling. The wall were panelled to 10ft high in old oak, and above the panelling hung 17th century tapestries. On the south wall were several traceried windows, consisting of two tiers of four very narrow lights. The upper lights were trefoil headed having such massive framework that the central shaft is equal in width to the lights. On the west wall was a stone mullioned <b>leaded</b> <b>light</b> window some 20ft in height.|$|E

A <b>leaded</b> <b>light</b> window is on one side. Another side elevation has three large sash windows with the middle being wider than the two that are flanking it.|$|E
50|$|This {{was another}} pub {{owned by the}} Kemp Town Brewery and reordered at their request in the late 1920s. Denman {{inserted}} mock-Tudor doorways with carved timberwork, <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> and herringbone brickwork.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971 Zuckermann {{reported}} {{in a letter to}} the New York weekly newspaper Village Voice that he had been able to buy Stafford for [...] "no more than the average suburban one-family house in New Jersey". He also wrote that [...] "the house has much old paneling and <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> (even my goats have <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> in their stable.)", and he said that the gardens were tended by a pensioner who [...] "came with the property". The date Zuckermann left Stafford Barton is unknown, but advertisements and directory entries for his harpsichord business list him there up to 1973.|$|R
50|$|By 1911 the Tarrant Works covered c. 5 {{acres and}} {{included}} workshops for joinery, wrought iron and <b>leaded</b> <b>lights,</b> a stonemason's yard and a timber mill with drying sheds. The firm owned nurseries and brickfields elsewhere and was Byfleet's largest employer for many years.|$|R
50|$|The hall {{is noted}} for the fine oak panelling, of 15th century date and added in 1939 to the {{reception}} hall, dining room and the deep oak framed <b>leaded</b> <b>light</b> windows. The large panelled oak door in the Hall opens into an under stairs store, reputed to be a former priest's hole during the Reformation period and from which, many years ago, it is said there was an underground passage which {{may have led to}} Stone Building in Manor Lane.|$|E

50|$|Norton's {{dramatic}} {{designs were}} completed by 1863 and the extensive re-modelling of Tyntesfield commenced in October. The building work took {{over two years}} and was completed close to the £70,000 budget allowed for it. Reverend Seymour's restrained Regency house had been utterly absorbed, doubled in size and transformed into a soaring Gothic-revival masterpiece bristling with ornamentation born from its diverse construction elements. Though quite new, the range of buildings gave the appearance of having grown over a much longer period of time. Pinnacles, gables, crenellated towers, stained glass, plain glass and <b>leaded</b> <b>light</b> windows harmonised in a testimony to Norton's visionary skills and balance, and Plucknett's craftmanship.|$|E
50|$|The {{restoration}} and conservation included 80 new <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> and 27 new metal casements. The work undertaken {{was shown in}} a programme of the BBC2 series Restore to Glory. The building was in a parlous state prior to work and was included on both national and regional buildings at risk registers.|$|R
50|$|While the {{interior}} of the cathedral has a deliberately 'restrained' feeling to it, richness {{is to be found in}} the ceiling. The Roman key pattern and the double guilloche pattern, picked out in gold leaf, are dominant here. All the round-headed windows are in the Classical-Wren style, with clear <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> of hand-made glass.|$|R

5000|$|Rigby's Buildings is in five storeys, with a {{front of}} seven bays. The ground floor has a 19th-century {{frontage}} containing <b>leaded</b> <b>light</b> windows over {{which is a}} continuous fascia. In the upper storeys all the windows are four-pane sashes. The windows in the first floor have balustrades, and decorated architraves and lintels. The windows in the second storey are the most elaborate. They have balconies, decorated architraves, and pediments of different types. Along {{the top of the}} building runs a cornice with a parapet. At the centre of the parapet is the inscription [...] "Rigby's Buildings", and at the sides of this are balustrades. Standing on the parapet at its corners are urns. Rigby's Buildings is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.|$|E
5000|$|Cox & Barnard {{received}} many commissions in the Brighton and Hove area, for both {{religious and secular}} buildings. Many of the interwar semi-detached houses in the Nevill Road area of Hove have Art Nouveau-style <b>leaded</b> <b>light</b> panels and roundels in their doors and porches; and the Metropole, Brighton's largest hotel, had some stained glass installed during its postwar reconstruction. [...] The firm designed a glazed canopy {{at the entrance of}} the former Hove Town Hall (destroyed by fire in 1966), featuring the design of the Hove coat of arms; in 1946 they installed a window in the tower of the medieval parish church of Portslade, St Nicolas' Church; and in the late 20th century they designed stained glass windows for two synagogues in Hove and restored the windows in the 19th-century Middle Street Synagogue in Brighton.|$|E
50|$|Allt-y-Bela {{was built}} as a hall house in the mid-15th century, {{originally}} as a traditional, single-storey, cruck-frame building with wooden mullions and <b>leaded</b> <b>lights.</b> About a century later a first floor was added with dormer windows and chimneys. In 1599 the wealthy Midlands wool merchant Roger Edwards, the founder of Usk Grammar School, added a three-storey Renaissance tower.|$|R

50|$|Some {{settlement}} is quite normal after construction has been completed, but unequal (differential) settlement may cause significant problems for buildings. Traditional green oak-framed buildings {{are designed to}} settle with time as the oak seasons and warps, lime mortar rather than Portland cement is used for its elastic properties and glazing will often employ small <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> which can accept movement more readily than larger panes.|$|R

50|$|This {{outlying}} area of Islington carries a surprising wealth of historic architecture and Newington Green {{has become a}} conservation area. On {{the west side of}} the Green (numbers 52-55) is London's oldest surviving brick terrace, which is Grade I listed (see photo in section above). These were built in 1658, and 100 years later were home to Price and Rogers. Over the subsequent centuries many changes were made, internally and externally, in particular adding an extra storey to one of the middle houses and replacing its narrow staircase with a wider one with mid-Georgian detailing. At an unknown date the windows were enlarged and changed from mediaeval oak and <b>leaded</b> <b>light</b> mullion and transom pattern to Georgian vertically sliding sash windows. In the 1880s the floor levels of the front rooms were lowered to street level and shop fronts were added to all of them. In the 1980s the houses were in such poor condition that there was a serious danger of them collapsing. The Greater London Council bought three of them, carried out major structural repairs and sold them on to private clients.|$|E
50|$|Public and {{commercial}} use of stained glassStained glass {{has often been}} used as a decorative element in public buildings, initially in places of learning, government or justice but increasingly in other public {{and commercial}} places such as banks, retailers and railway stations. Public houses in some countries make extensive use of stained glass and <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> to create a comfortable atmosphere and retain privacy.|$|R
50|$|The east window depicts Christ and {{the west}} window is {{on the theme of}} the evangelists. Windows in the chancel contain stained glass by William Wailes of Newcastle made between 1848 and 1852. There are two late-Victorian windows made by Barnett of Newcastle {{and the rest of the}} church is glazed in clear <b>leaded</b> <b>lights.</b> The vestry was formed in 1882 by {{partitioning}} the north west corner with solid oak screens.|$|R
50|$|The mill was {{constructed}} {{to a very}} high standard, presumably as a demonstration of John Mildred's status. The timber framed building has a clay tile roof and the walls are tile-hung {{to the level of}} the brick base. Diamond pattern <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> echo the tiling. Uniquely in Surrey, it has a lucam or projection of the upper story over the roadway to allow wagons to be loaded and unloaded easily.|$|R
40|$|The church Chogoria, building. ” Exterior view showing Dr Irvine placing in {{a window}} during the {{construction}} of the chancel. The new church was designed and built by Dr Irvine; the chancel contained seven gothic windows with blue and grey <b>leaded</b> <b>lights.</b> ❧ The image is from the first twenty years of the Chogoria mission in Kenya, which was run by the Rev. Dr Archibald Clive Irvine (1893 - 1974), from the collection entitled ‘Chogoria, glimpses into the past’...|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} floor storey are 12 arched timber framed panels. The window above these {{is similar to that}} in the first floor. Over this window is a row of 12 square {{decorated}} timber-framed panels. In the attic is a double timber door surrounded by panels. On each side of this door, and above it, are two-light windows containing <b>leaded</b> <b>lights.</b> In the apex of the gable is herringbone timber framing. The bargeboard is carved and has a finial at its peak.|$|R
50|$|In 1895, aged 20, {{he set up}} his own {{building}} company, W G Tarrant Ltd, in {{the village}} of Byfleet, Surrey and in the early 1900s built extensively in adjoining Pyrford, West Byfleet and Woking. The company almost certainly constructed some of the first buildings at nearby Brooklands. By 1911 his premises in Byfleet covered over five acres and included workshops for joinery, wrought iron and <b>leaded</b> <b>lights,</b> a stonemason’s yard, and a timber mill with drying sheds. He also owned nurseries in Addlestone and Pyrford and brickfields in Chobham and Rowlands Castle.|$|R
50|$|Leadlights or <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> are {{decorative}} windows made {{of small}} sections of glass supported in lead cames. The technique of creating windows using glass and lead came is discussed at came glasswork. The term leadlight {{could be used}} to describe all windows in which the glass is supported by lead, but traditionally, a distinction is made between stained glass windows and leadlights, the former being associated with the ornate windows of churches and other such works of architecture and the latter with the windows of vernacular commercial and domestic architecture and defined by its simplicity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} in sandstone, brick, and timber framing with plaster panels. The roof is of grey slate. It has four storeys and a gable overlooking the street. The street level {{consists of a}} modern shop front {{on the right of}} which is a flight of 11 stone steps leading to the Row level above. At the Row level is another modern shop front. Between this and the street is a walkway, a sloping stallboard and a rail with balusters overlooking the street. Above the Row opening is a carved fascia. In the storey above is a window running almost the whole width of the building. Its frame projects from the wall and is carried on eight corbels. The window has 14 lights, is mullioned and transomed, and contains <b>leaded</b> <b>lights.</b> Below and {{on each side of the}} window are timber-framed panels. The top storey is jettied. At its base is a bressummer carved centrally with [...] "•T•C•1664" [...] (the initials are those of Thomas Cowper), on each side of which are carved patterns. The top storey has a ten-light mullioned and transomed casement window containing <b>leaded</b> <b>lights.</b> Below the window are eight panels containing wooden carvings, and two similar panels are on each side of the window. Above the window are quadrant-braced panels. The bargeboard is decorated with carvings and at its peak is a finial.|$|R
50|$|Located {{here also}} is Clanford Hall, a three-storey, half-timbered Tudor mansion in fine {{condition}} now {{used as a}} farmhouse. The building, dated 1684, is listed Grade II* and {{is a good example}} of 17th century vernacular architecture of the area. It is timber framed with a tiled roof and brick stacks, with two storeys and an attic, and four-storeyed on the East. It is restored in brick and colour-washed, with wood finials to gables and ornamental timbering at front and restored timbering at rear. There are casements and wood mullioned windows with modern <b>leaded</b> <b>lights.</b> The house has exposed ceiling beams.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the larger}} known renovations of Berritzgaard was in the 1890s where the {{existing}} <b>leaded</b> <b>lights</b> were added to mimic the Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen and the windows {{on the first floor}} were shortened so they would [...] "stand" [...] on the decorative limestone border, which is set into the redbrick wall all around the house. During the same renovation, several blinded windows were re-established. The house was kept in basic repair until 1970 where Christiane Henriette's great-great grandchild (the present owner) converted the house to his private residence with a general restoring and refurnishing of the house.|$|R
