2500|$|In 1954, {{standing}} up a 'new Mark IV' fighter squadron, progressing from an initial operating capability, having received its complement of aircrew, {{to a full}} operational capability required a change to a Mark III flying and training model. [...] First, flying practices to confirm that pilot/airborne interceptor integration was retained from No.3 OTU training, and learning the changes in Airborne Interception (AI) and Ground-Controlled Interception (GCI) tactics. The 'Guns Only' Conventional Pursuit Interception (flying Mark IIIs) was replaced with the <b>Lead</b> <b>Collision</b> <b>Course</b> (LCC) Attack (with 2.75-in Folding-Fin Aerial Rockets). The second stage began with a full night flying program, now with lights out interceptions (with fewer visual clues) and 'Bumping Heads'. The third stage of training saw gunnery practice at an air-to-ground range, both the [...]50 calibre guns and Mighty Mouse rockets at ranges near Winchester, south of Ottawa or Lac St. Pierre, near Sorel, Quebec. Air to Air (Towed) gunnery was practised on a range 'over' Lake Ontario, near RCAF Station Trenton.|$|E
40|$|The witness seminar “Tidig flygradar” [Early {{airborne}} radar] {{was held}} at Tekniska museet [the National Museum of Science and Technology] in Stockholm on 15 April 2008 and was led by Gunnar Lindqvist. During the seminar, the {{development and use of}} airborne radar systems in the Swedish air force during the 1950 s and 1960 s was discussed and debated. The use of airborne radar in the night fighters Mosquito and Venom, and its impact on fighter tactics, was covered in detail. The technical collaboration between the French electronics firm CSF, the radar division of the Royal Swedish Air Board and LM Ericsson was underlined as a crucial factor behind the successful introduction of the first Swedish built radar systems in the strike and night fighter versions of Lansen. Development of the <b>Lead</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> fire control system, and integration between radar and guided missiles, were critical undertakings in the development of airborne radar systems in the first Swedish supersonic fighter Draken. The subsequent efforts to modify the radar systems to counter electronic jamming were touched upon. Finally, the development of the PS- 37 radar, developed in collaboration between the Royal Swedish Air Board and LM Ericsson for use in the strike version of Viggen, was covered in detail.

50|$|Gates {{ordered a}} night march to {{commence}} at 10 PM on the 15th Aug., despite his army of 3,052, of which two-thirds were militia, having never maneuvered together. Unfortunately, their evening meal {{acted as a}} purgative while they marched, with Armand's horse in the <b>lead.</b> On a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> was Cornwallis' army, also on a 10 PM night march, with Tarleton's dragoons in the lead. A short period of confusion ensued when both forces collided around 2 AM, but both sides soon separated, not wanting a night battle.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> between a mobile robot and a moving object is modeled in polar {{coordinates}} using the kinematics equations. A {{model of the}} relative motion of the moving object as seen by the robot is then derived. This model consists of the relative velocities along and across the visibility line, and gives the range rate and the turning rate of the moving object {{with respect to the}} robot. The conditions for the <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> are derived in terms of the robot’s and the moving object’s states. We define two types of collision course: the exact <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> and the weak <b>collision</b> <b>course.</b> The exact <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> always results in a collision, and is clearly characterized by a given set of equations. The weak <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> may become an exact <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> near <b>collision</b> and allows an early detection of the <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> in various scenarios. Several examples and scenarios illustrating the theory are shown using simulation. Key Words Dynamic environment, <b>collision</b> <b>course,</b> relative kinematics equa-tions 1...|$|R

In this paper, we design a collision avoidance algorithm to resolve the conflict among UAVs that are on a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> while flying to heir respective destinations. The collision avoidance algorithm consist of each UAV that is on a <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> reactively executing a maneuver that will, as in `inverse' Proportional Navigation (PN), increase Line of Sight (LOS) rate between them, resulting in a `pulling out' of <b>collision</b> <b>course.</b> The algorithm is tested for high density traffic scenarios {{as well as for}} robustness in the presence of noise...|$|R
