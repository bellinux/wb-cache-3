Psychiatric illness or anxiety precedes IBS symptoms in two-thirds of patients, and psychological traits predispose previously healthy people to developing IBS after gastroenteritis.|$|E
40|$|Background: The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{might affect}} {{information}} processing in various ways, and reduce people's performance particularly the adolescents. The {{present study was}} designed to investigate the relationship be-tween <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> test <b>anxiety</b> and school performance of a group of adolescents. 536 second grade high school students served as the subjects of this study. Methods: Two questionnaires were used to collect the data including the student status, relevant information about the family and school performance. The Spielberger's Test Anxiety Inventory was also utilized to measure the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> test <b>anxiety.</b> Results: The results revealed a significant and negative correlation between test anxiety scores and Grade Point Average (GPA) of the students. Female students showed a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> in contrast to male students and school type (private, public and school for gifted students) affected the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> test <b>anxiety.</b> Conclusion: We showed the importance of school type on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> test <b>anxiety.</b> The lowest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> was seen among gifted children who generally better adjusted themselves than their peers of average or below average intelligence...|$|R

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that gifted students are universally gifted {{in all areas of}} academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child. Unrealistically high expectations of academic success are often placed on gifted students by both parents and teachers. This pressure can cause gifted students to experience high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety,</b> to become perfectionists, and to develop a fear of failure. Gifted students come to define themselves and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken when they do not live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.|$|E
25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated {{the ways in which}} facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The patient’s anxiety before {{seeing a}} doctor may {{influence}} her/his hospital choice behavior through various ways. In order to explore why high level hospitals were overused by patients and why low level hospitals were not fully used by patients in China, {{this study was}} set up to test whether and to what extent the patient’s anxiety before seeing a doctor influenced her/his hospital choice behavior in China. Methods This study commissioned a large-scale 2009 – 2010 national resident household survey (N= 4, 853) in China, and in this survey the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was employed to help patients assess their anxiety before seeing a doctor. Specified ordered probit models were established to analyze the survey dataset. Results When the patient had high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> before seeing a doctor, her/his <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> could not only predict that she/he was more likely to choose the high level hospital, but also accurately predict which <b>level</b> <b>of</b> hospital she/he would choose; when the patient had low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> before seeing a doctor, her/his <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> could only predict that she/he was more likely to choose the low level hospital, but it couldn’t clearly predict which <b>level</b> <b>of</b> hospital she/he would choose. Conclusion The patient with high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> had the strong consistent bias when she/he chose a hospital (she/he always preferred the high level hospital), while the patient with low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> didn’t have such consistent bias. </p...|$|R

Methods &amp; Materials: In this randomized clinical trial, sixty patients were selected using block sampling and randomly allocated into experimental and control groups. Data were gathered using a questionnaire including the spiel burger's standardized questionnaire. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> was measured in both groups. Then, the first phase of cardiac rehabilitation program (including physical exercise, and daily living activities) was carried out in the experimental group. Finally, patients in the experimental group discussed their experiences of surgery. Control group Patients received usual care. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> was measured in both groups the day before surgery and at the time of discharge. Data were analyzed using t-test, chi-square, and Friedman tests in SPSS. Results: Findings showed that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> had no significant differences between two groups at the time of admission. After implementing the rehabilitation program, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> decreased significantly (P&lt; 0. 001) in the experimental group.

25|$|Tobacco smoking {{increases}} the risk of developing panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and panic attacks; smoking started in adolescence or early adulthood particularly increases this risk of developing panic disorder. While the mechanism of how smoking increases panic attacks is not fully understood, a few hypotheses have been derived. Smoking cigarettes may lead to panic attacks by causing changes in respiratory function (e.g. feeling short of breath). These respiratory changes in turn can lead to the formation of panic attacks, as respiratory symptoms are a prominent feature of panic. Respiratory abnormalities have been found in children with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety,</b> which suggests that a person with these difficulties may be susceptible to panic attacks, and thus more likely to subsequently develop panic disorder. Nicotine, a stimulant, could contribute to panic attacks. However, nicotine withdrawal may also cause significant anxiety which could contribute to panic attacks.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{psychological}} processes related to tinnitus involves measurement of tinnitus severity and distress (i.e. {{nature and extent}} of tinnitus-related problems), measured subjectively by validated self-report tinnitus questionnaires. These questionnaires measure the degree {{of psychological}} distress and handicap associated with tinnitus, including effects on hearing, lifestyle, health and emotional functioning. A broader assessment of general functioning, such as <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety,</b> depression, stress, life stressors and sleep difficulties, is also important in the assessment of tinnitus due to higher risk of negative well-being across these areas, which may be affected by and/or exacerbate the tinnitus symptoms for the individual. Overall, current assessment measures are aimed to identify individual levels of distress and interference, coping responses and perceptions of tinnitus in order to inform treatment and monitor progress. However, wide variability, inconsistencies and lack of consensus regarding assessment methodology are evidenced in the literature, limiting comparison of treatment effectiveness. Developed to guide diagnosis or classify severity, most tinnitus questionnaires have also been shown to be treatment-sensitive outcome measures.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} significant psychosocial risk factors for bruxism, particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} triggering factor. It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E

Method: To this study 287 (% 78. 6) female, 78 (% 21. 4) male, total 365 university students participated. Hopelessness Scale, anxiety Inventory, and interpersonal cognitive distortions Scale were used to collect data and the data was analyzed by using SPSS.

Results showed that majority of the respondents belonged to age range of 14 - 18 years old range whereas for gender or sex, majority who avail of the clinic’s services are males. This is because women are more afraid than men in terms of dental problems. Further, younger people are more afraid than older ones.
