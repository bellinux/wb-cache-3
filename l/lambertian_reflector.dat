Color invariant color spaces are desensitized to disturbances in the image. One common problem in computer vision is varying light source (color and intensity) between multiple images and within a single image. To properly perform image segmentation and object detection requires an increased need for images that are stable to variations in imaging conditions. Normalizing RGB color space to rgb color system performs a linear transform. Normalized rgb space eliminates the effect of varying intensities from the light source. Uniform surfaces of color with varying geometric features are affected by the angle and intensity of the light source. Where a uniform red surface with a uniform green object placed on top, should easily be segmented. Due to the shape of the 3D object shades are formed preventing uniform fields of color.

A comprehensive 3 D ray-tracing simulation was applied to study the optical characteristics of the proposed module. It was found that when the geometric concentration ratio is 2. 0, the optical efficiency of the investigated Concentrating Photovoltaics (CPV) module is 62. 5 % and the radiant flux received by the solar cells is about 1. 4 times that of the counterpart module without solar concentrators.

A module with a 50 % coverage with 70 µm thick cells can capture up to 84 % of the light entering the module. Importantly, the performance of this kind of module is insensitive to module orientation. The results of the analytical model are compared with ray tracing studies and measurements and are shown to be in good agreement.

The PARASOL / POLDER observes the reflectance and polarization of a target quasi-simultaneously in multi-viewing angles at wavelengths of 490 nm, 670 nm and 865 nm. In this study, a new estimation method of aerosol properties using the polarized radiance effectively is described. The polarized radiance {{at the top of}} the atmosphere does not depend on the surface reflectance if the ground surface is assumed to be the uniform <b>Lambertian</b> <b>reflector.</b> First of all, the optical thickness τ, the refractive index Nr and the size distribution a (index of Junge power-law) of aerosols is estimated from polarized radiances at 670 nm received by the POLDER. In this case, it was assumed that the imaginary part of complex refractive index, Ni, is zero because there is very little absorption for dust particles at 670 nm. After that, the surface reflectance A is obtained from total radiances at 670 nm. Next, the τ, Ni (the imaginary part of complex refractive index) at 490 nm are estimated from polarized radiances because the absorption of light ray by aerosols is not ignored. The surface reflectance A at 490 nm is estimated at the same way as the case of 670 nm. Finally, the method described here was applied to PARASOL/POLDER data over land taken on April 28, 2006.

40|$|To {{accurately}} {{predict the}} light collection from a scintillating crystal through Monte Carlo simulations, {{it is crucial}} to know the angular distribution from the surface reflectance. Current Monte Carlo codes allow the user to set the optical reflectance to a linear combination of backscatter spike, specular spike, specular lobe, and Lambertian reflections. However, not all light distributions can be expressed in this way. In addition, the user seldom has the detailed knowledge about the surfaces that is required for accurate modeling. We have previously measured the angular distributions within BGO crystals and now incorporate these data as look-up-tables (LUTs) into modified Geant 4 and GATE Monte Carlo codes. The modified codes allow the user to specify the surface treatment (ground, etched, or polished), the attached reflector (Lumirror(R), Teflon(R), ESR film, Tyvek(R), or TiO paint), and the bonding type (air-coupled or glued). Each LUT consists of measured angular distributions with 4 o by 5 o resolution in theta and phi, respectively, for incidence angles from 0 ? to 90 ? degrees, in 1 o-steps. We compared the new codes to the original codes by running simulations with a 3 x 10 x 30 mm 3 BGO crystal coupled to a PMT. The simulations were then compared to measurements. Light output was measured by counting the photons detected by the PMT with the 3 x 10, 3 x 30, or 10 x 30 mm 2 side coupled to the PMT, respectively.

40|$|Since {{about three}} years after the launch the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the EOS-Aura satellite, the sensor’s viewing {{capability}} has been affected by what is believed to be an internal obstruction that has reduced OMI’s spatial coverage. It currently affects about half of the instrument’s sixty viewing positions. In this work we carry out an analysis to assess the effect of the reduced spatial coverage on the monthly average values of retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD), single scattering albedo (SSA), and the UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) using the 2005 – 2007 three-year period prior to the onset of the row anomaly. Regional monthly average values calculated using viewing positions 1 through 30 were compared to similarly obtained values using positions 31 thru 60 with the expectation of finding close agreement between the two calculations. As expected, mean monthly values of AOD and SSA obtained with these two scattering-angle-dependent sub-sets of OMI observations were in agreement over regions where carbonaceous or sulphate aerosol particles are the predominant aerosol type. Over arid regions, however, where desert dust is the main aerosol type, {{significant differences between the two}} sets of calculated regional mean values of AOD were observed. As it turned out, the difference in retrieved desert dust AOD between the scattering-angle dependent observation subsets was due to the incorrect representation of desert dust scattering phase function. A sensitivity analysis using radiative transfer calculations demonstrated that the source of the observed AOD bias was the spherical shape assumption of desert dust particles. A similar analysis in terms of UVAI yielded large differences in the monthly mean values for the two sets of calculations over cloudy regions. On the contrary, in arid regions with minimum cloud presence, the resulting UVAI monthly average values for the two sets of observations were in very close agreement. The discrepancy under cloudy conditions was found to be caused by the parameterization of clouds as opaque <b>Lambertian</b> <b>reflectors.</b> When properly accounting for cloud scattering effects using Mie Theory, the observed UVAI angular bias was significantly reduced. The analysis discussed here has uncovered important algorithmic deficiencies associated with the model representation of the angular dependence of scattering effects of desert dust aerosols and cloud droplets.

40|$|Cloud {{information}} from UV/VIS/NIR spectrometers aboard spacecraft platforms is highly valuable {{for the construction}} of cloud property climatologies, since it is complementary to the information retrieved using IR spectrometers, imagers and active sensors (cloud radars and lidars). Clouds, when present, are the main modulators of the radiation transport across the atmosphere. They are very diverse in terms of composition (ice, liquid water), thickness (thin cirri to thick cumulonimbi), variability (homogeneous stratocumuli to inhomogeneous cumuli), altitude, etc. Consequently, the modeling of the cloud-radiation insteraction {{is one of the most}} challenging tasks in the atmospheric science. The distance that photons travel across the atmosphere before being captured by a spaceborne instrument can be greatly affected by clouds. Absorption by atmospheric molecules is not only proportional to the molecular number density but also to the photon path legth. Therefore, the effects of clouds on the photon path legth is of particular interest in the atmospheric remote sensing. During the retrieval processing, changes in the absorption bands within the spectra are analyzed. These changes can be linked to variations in the molecular number density but also to variations in the photon path legth. Therefore, precise cloud information to correct for variations in the photon path length is mandatory for the accurate retrieval of atmospheric trace gases. The ROCINN algorithm retrieves cloud top height (pressure), cloud optical depth and cloud albedo rom measurements in and around the oxygen A-band (760 nm) taking as input the cloud fraction computed with the OCRA algorithm (a color space approach based on broadband reflectances). This paper presents the latest version of the ROCINN algorithm as implemented to process Sentinel- 5 p, Sentinel- 4 and Sentinel- 5 data. There are two variants of the ROCINN algorithm: one that treats clouds as reflecting boundaries (CRB)) (i. e. <b>Lambertian</b> equivalent <b>reflectors)</b> and a second one that treats louds as scattering layers (CAL). The ROCINN-CRB algorithm has been successfully used operationally for GOME/ERS- 2 and GOME- 2 /MetOp-A and -B instruments since over one decade. The CAL algorithm treats clouds in a more realistic way and provides cloud properties closer to reality. ROCINN V 3. 0 in the CRB and CAL variants have been included into the latest UPAS operational processor and is the baseline algorithm for the generation of cloud products from the atmospheric Sentinels.

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{new method}} for {{reducing}} space-varying, wavelength-dependent scattering in multispectral imagery caused by smoke and haze is described. It {{is intended for}} use in situations where atmospheric scattering affects the shorter wavelengths and varies in space. The method converts an image in which space-varying scattering is present into an image where the scattering has been equalized over the entire image so that previously developed techniques for removing constant scattering effects can be used. BACKGROUND Assume that the atmosphere can be modeled as a horizontally homogeneous medium, the earth is a <b>Lambertian</b> <b>reflector,</b> and atmospheric properties which vary exponentially with altitude can be assumed to be constant over the scene [l]. When {{the contribution of the}} ambient illumination (skylight) can be neglected and the scattering is constant over the image, the brightness r is the radiance of the surface, a represents the effects of atmospheric transmittance, sensor gain, and other multiplicative factors, and b represents the contribution of the path radiance. The brightness values at two or more pixels in the image together with measurements of the surface radiance at the corresponding locations on the ground can be used to solve for a and b. Alternatively, when ground truth is not available several methods have been developed to estimate the path radiance component [2 - 41. When the scattering is not constant a technique developed by Lavreau [5] which subtracts a portion of the fourth tasseled cap feature [6] from each band can be used. The method effectively removes space-varying haze but causes the corrected bands to become more correlated thus altering the spectral balance of the data.

It appears that these cloud pressures are not {{the pressure of the}} cloud top, but of a level inside the cloud. This is corroborated by comparisons with MODIS and CloudSat data: while the top of the cloud is seen by MODIS using emitted IR radiation, both OMI and PARASOL algorithms retrieve a pressure near the midlevel of the cloud. The three cloud pressure products are compared using 1 month of data. The cloud pressures are found to show a similar behavior, with correlation coefficients larger than 0. 85 between the data sets for high effective cloud fractions. The average differences in the cloud pressure are small, between 2 and 45 hPa, for the whole data set, with an RMS difference of 65 to 93 hPa. This falls within the science requirement for the OMI cloud pressure to have an accuracy of 100 hPa. For small to medium effective cloud fractions, the cloud pressure distribution found by PARASOL is very similar to that found by OMI using the O 2 –O 2 absorption. Somewhat larger differences are found for very high effective cloud fractions...|$|E
40|$|The GMES {{atmospheric}} services include {{global and}} European air quality monitoring and forecasting which require near real time delivery of atmospheric CO abundances. To achieve this, a numerically efficient retrieval approach for operational data processing {{is needed to}} derive CO column densities from shortwave infrared measurements in the 2. 3 μm band of the Sentinel 5 missions and its Precursor mission. The expected performance of both spectrometers will allow for clear-sky CO column retrievals over land with a precision of ≤ 10 % and an overall accuracy of ≤ 15 % even for background CO abundance and low surface reflection in the shortwave infrared spectral range. In this context, we present a new algorithm approach of the retrieval of CO from shortwave infrared measurements in clear sky and partially cloudy atmospheres over land and ocean surfaces. The algorithm employs simplified radiative transfer, where the model atmosphere is separated in a clear sky part, and a part which is bounded below by an elevated <b>Lambertian</b> <b>reflector</b> to account for atmospheric scattering by clouds and aerosols. Within the inversion scheme, Tikhonov regularization is used to determine, for each individual measurement, not only the vertically integrated CO column density and its retrieval error, but also the column averaging kernel. For the retrieval, a prior estimate of methane abundance is used to characterize the light path by retrieving effective cloud parameters from the shortwave infrared band itself. A performance analysis shows that, for a single cloud layer {{in the middle and}} lower troposphere, the bias on the CO retrieval due to the Lambertian cloud model is less than 2 - 3 %. The effect of boundary layer aerosols can also be treated with similar accuracy. In contrast, the presence of elevated dust plumes above bright surfaces or a single layer cirrus cloud causes significant errors and, in these cases, a reasonably low retrieval bias can only be achieved for an optical depth in the shortwave infrared spectral range lower than 0. 4. Another relevant error source for the CO retrieval algorithm is given by the prior uncertainty of methane. It is found that a 5 % uncertainty in the methane column density causes biases of 3 - 9 % on the retrieved CO column, depending on cloud fraction. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
