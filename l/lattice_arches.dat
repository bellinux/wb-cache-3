The sidewalls of the auditorium were accented by niches with mock tile roofs, grills and wooden <b>lattice</b> <b>arches</b> across the ceiling to create a courtyard effect. While Eberson experimented with atmospheric design at the Wichita Orpheum, the theatre lacks the fully developed effects of a true atmospheric theatre. He credited the Hoblitzelle Majestic Theatre (Houston, 1923) as the first.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} the largest iron arch road bridge {{remaining}} from the first half-century of iron and steel construction, before the technological innovation of suspension bridges. [...] It is described by architectural historian John Newman as [...] "a supremely elegant composition of five shallow segmental <b>lattice</b> <b>arches</b> carrying the gently curved roadway... This superstructure rests on reassuringly strong tapering piers of squared ashlar...". [...] Ornate ironwork on the bridge marks the boundary point between the two counties of Gloucester and Monmouth. The cast iron lamp posts were bought from Sheffield City Council and installed in 1969. [...] The bridge became a Grade I listed building on 24 March 1975.|$|E

5000|$|The 494 ft bridge has a 240 ft three-hinged {{braced rib}} steel arch, two 14 ft steel towers, and 16 timber trestle {{approach}} spans. The chords of the ribs {{are composed of}} channels. They are braced with two angles that are latticed in a Warren truss configuration. The vertical members of the towers and spandrel columns are madder up of two latticed channels. The 17.4 ft wide roadway rests on a Warren stiffening truss. The Minneapolis Steel and Machinery Company provided the steel for the project. The arches sit on concrete footings. The approaches and the deck were reconstructed in 1945.The Fairfax Bridge {{is one of two}} three-hinged <b>lattice</b> <b>arches</b> remaining within the State. In his book Bridge Engineering, J.A.L. Waddell explains the reason for the paucity of arches in the United States. [...] "Arches are employed very generally in Europe on account of their superior appearance as compared with simple-truss bridges, and because of the powerful influence of the old masonry arch upon the minds of European bridge designers, regardless of the consideration of economy. American engineers, on the other hand, have been indifferent to the question of aesthetics, and have preferred simple spans to arches mainly for reasons of simplicity and economy, but sometimes on account of their greater rigidity. Another reason why the arch has not been used much in American practice is that the conditions, which make it economical, are not met with as frequently in this country as in Europe. For deep gorges with rocky sides, or for shallow streams with rock bottom and natural abutments, arches are eminently proper and economical." [...] The conditions that made the bridge type economical in Europe were mirrored in the deep canyon of the Carbon River.|$|E

Both the <b>lattices</b> over the <b>arches</b> and the wall enclosing the central arch were re-used from Visigothic origins in the 7th century.|$|R
50|$|The first {{bridge was}} built between 1876-1878 for the Caledonian Railway Company, and opened on 1 August 1879 It was {{engineered}} by Blyth and Cunningham and built by Sir William Arrol & Co. It consisted of wrought iron lattice girders linked {{at the top}} by a light <b>arched</b> <b>lattice</b> girder, and carried on a cast iron arch (visible in the photograph) over twin piers in the river. The piers are formed of cast iron cylinders sunk to bedrock and filled with concrete, and then extended above the river with Dalbeattie granite.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the bridge was planned to relieve {{the bridge of the}} old town, linking the old marketplace (Stary Rynek) to the Theatre square. Works started in 1867, with the necessity to realize a one-span bridge that does not hinder water navigation on the river.The roadway had a width of 7.32, with a pedestrian way, based on cantilever beams. The steel bridge had two <b>arched</b> <b>lattice</b> girders, it was lit by four gas lamps standing on each side. The building was complete in 1872 under the name Kaiserbrücke, referring to William I, emperor of Germany and king of Prussia.|$|R

The bridge design incorporates dressed red and grey sandstone abutments with ashlar dressings, these are slightly curved and ramped, with chamfered ashlar quoins, string courses, and moulded cornices. The structural cast-iron consists of a single segmental span with four <b>arched</b> <b>lattice</b> ribs, braced by five transverse cast-ironmembers. The road deck is formed from cast-iron metal deck plates, tarmacked over, and now finished with gravel. The original parapets have at some point been replaced with painted cast-iron railings with dograils, dogbars and shaped end balusters.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this bachelor’s thesis is to design the steel roof {{structure}} of a sport hall {{in the area of}} city Jihlava. The plan dimensions of the structure are rectangural 45. 200 x 40. 300 m. The height of the structure is 15. 150 m. The hall is designed by cylindrical roof. The main load bearing structure is created by <b>arch</b> <b>lattice</b> frame. The width of the frame is 40. 300 m. The spacing of frames is 9. 000 m. Frames are connected by lattice purlins‘. Purlins’are arranged radially. Longitudal rigidity of the structure is provided by transverse wind braces and upper beams of the purlins‘. Roof covering is made of roof panels laid directly on the purlins‘. The cladding is made of panels too. In the front of the structure is the cladding made by self-supported structure, which is not part of this thesis...|$|R
6000|$|First we {{came into}} a broad open court, with a covered gallery running {{along one side}} of it. A camel was {{reclining}} on the grass there; near him was a gazelle, to glad J- with his dark blue eye; and a numerous brood of hens and chickens, who furnish his liberal table. On {{the opposite side of}} the covered gallery rose up the walls of his long, queer, many-windowed, many-galleried house. There were wooden <b>lattices</b> to those <b>arched</b> windows, through the diamonds of one of which I saw two of the most beautiful, enormous, ogling black eyes in the world, looking down upon the interesting stranger. Pigeons were flapping, and hopping, and fluttering, and cooing about. Happy pigeons, you are, no doubt, fed with crumbs from the henne-tipped fingers of Zuleika! All this court, cheerful in the sunshine, cheerful with the astonishing brilliancy of the eyes peering out from the lattice-bars, was as mouldy, ancient, and ruinous--as any gentleman's house in Ireland, let us say. The paint was peeling off the rickety old carved galleries; the arabesques over the windows were chipped and worn;--the ancientness of the place rendered it doubly picturesque. I have detained you a long time in the outer court. Why the deuce was Zuleika there, with the beautiful black eyes? ...|$|R
