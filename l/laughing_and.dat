5|$|The testimonies of the {{boatswain}} Cole, {{the carpenter}} Purcell, and the sailing master John Fryer were not unfavourable towards Heywood. However, Thomas Hayward's declared belief that Heywood {{was with the}} mutineers was damaging, as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood's alleged insolence in <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> {{turning away from the}} captive Bligh—though Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey while <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.|$|E

Duryodhana visits the mayasabha, {{where he is}} overawed with the beauty of sculpture and architecture. However, when he is returning, he trips and falls into a pool. He hears some people <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> sees Draupadi is among the crowd. He then concludes that she is behind all this and vows to avenge the insult {{in the presence of}} his brothers, Karna and Shakuni.|$|E

5|$|Ben then visits Jack, {{telling him}} his real name, {{and that he}} has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E
5|$|Stephen was a well {{established}} figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable of firm action. Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> eating with them. He was very pious, {{both in terms of}} his observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church. Stephen also had a personal Augustinian confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a penitential regime for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of Cistercians to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} cover of Trans-Europe Express was {{originally}} {{going to be}} a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series of mirrors. This idea was dropped for a photo by New York-based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour, with the group dressed in suits to resemble mannequins. J. Stara's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly retouched photo-montage of Kraftwerk from their shoulders up again posed as mannequins which are shown {{on the cover of the}} English version of the album. On the inside sleeve, a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used. The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour, taken on the group's American tour. Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> smiling. These were not used for the album's release.|$|E
60|$|The {{visitors}} again {{considered it}} a point of politeness to look at Sloppy, who, looking at them, suddenly threw back his head, extended his mouth to its utmost width, <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> loud <b>and</b> long. At this the two innocents, with their brains in that apparent danger, <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> Mrs Higden <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> the orphan <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> then the visitors laughed. Which was more cheerful than intelligible.|$|R

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Silent Hill, James decides to search a local park, where he meets Maria, who claims {{that she has}} never met or seen Mary. As she is scared, he allows her to follow him. While looking for Laura inside a hospital, James and Maria are ambushed by the monster Pyramid Head, and Maria is killed by him just as James escapes. He resumes his task of finding Mary, and chooses to search a local hotel where he and Mary spent their vacation. On the way, James finds Maria alive and unharmed in a locked room. She claims ignorance of their previous encounter and discusses elements of James' and Mary's past that only Mary would know. James then sets off {{to find a way}} to release Maria from the room and eventually returns to find her dead again. Later on, he rescues Angela from a monster; she confesses that her father used to sexually abuse her, and a newspaper clipping James can find implies she killed him in self-defense before coming to Silent Hill. He also confronts Eddie, who admits to maiming a bully, and killing a dog, before fleeing to Silent Hill. Attacked by Eddie, James kills him in self-defense. At this point, it is revealed that Eddie saw a different version of Silent Hill - while James sees monsters that reflect his relationship with his wife, Eddie sees people <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> taunting him to violence.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|Stage V: Around 42-52+ months {{children}} {{refine the}} complex grammatical structures and increase {{their use of}} morphemes to convey more complex ideas. Children in this stage use irregular third-person speech, the verb 'to be' as an auxiliary verb (She was not <b>laughing),</b> <b>and</b> in its contraction forms (It's, She's, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Gene {{had sent}} us a phoney press release and press packet. Listing all the places they had been playing and 'Reviews' of their performances. All were bogus.

25|$|At {{around two}} months, the baby engages in cooing, which mostly {{consists}} of vowel sounds. At around four months, cooing turns into babbling, {{which is the}} repetitive consonant-vowel combinations. Babies understand more than {{they are able to}} say. In this 0–8 months range, the child is engaged in vocal play of vegetative sounds, <b>laughing,</b> <b>and</b> cooing.|$|E

25|$|Hostile {{attribution}} bias, or hostile {{attribution of}} intent, is {{the tendency to}} interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign. For example, a person {{with high levels of}} hostile attribution bias might see two people <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> immediately interpret this behavior as two people laughing about him/her, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth's {{public image}} has noticeably {{softened}} in recent years; although she remains reserved in public, {{she has been}} seen <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> smiling much more than in years past, and has shed tears during emotional occasions such as at Remembrance Day services, the memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral for those killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks, and in Normandy, for the 60th anniversary of D-Day, where she addressed the Canadian troops. During most public appearances, she is dressed in solid colours, as this enhances visibility from a distance.|$|E
25|$|Test {{anxiety is}} the uneasiness, apprehension, or {{nervousness}} felt by {{students who have}} a fear of failing an exam. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of alienation from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder {{or whether it is}} a specific type of social phobia. The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.|$|E

25|$|The duo {{dress up}} in 1980s fashion and drive in a bright yellow jeep to a car wash, where Spears and backup dancers break into dance. Meanwhile, Azalea's alien powers cause a {{television}} to explode, water to turn pink and an ATM to begin shooting cash, which Spears dances around. Soon, the pair hop into a convertible with Spear's friends, where Azalea turns Spear's 1980s handheld telephone into a Samsung Galaxy S6. Nightfall arrives and the duo head to a club where Azalea raps and Spears and dancers perform a synchronized dance break. Suddenly, the nightclub begins to shake and an unseen force proceeds to abduct Azalea and Spears, to the latter's delight. The screen fades black before the pair appear <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> doing arm movements in the yellow jeep and the credits start.|$|E
25|$|Operation Bayshield was {{the first}} machinima work to {{incorporate}} custom digital assets. Clan Undead created graphical textures specifically for their characters and used custom visual effects, such as manipulating character images to produce first instance of lip synchronization in machinima. Although the effect was primitive, it was not used again in machinima for another year. This lip synchronization {{is an example of}} crude digital puppetry; other examples included the shaking of character bodies when <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> synchronized delivery of dialogue. Lowood believes that Clan Undead pre-recorded individual lines of dialogue to WAV files, and then triggered playback through a command in QuakeC. In April 1997, Clan Undead distributed the source code for its Operation Bayshield scripts over the Internet; Lowood believes that this release extended the Quake community's culture of sharing game modifications.|$|E
25|$|All {{four of the}} {{officers}} involved have since quit or have been fired from the LAPD. Officer Theodore Briseno left the LAPD after being acquitted on federal charges. Officer Timothy Wind, who was also acquitted a second time, was fired after the appointment of Willie L. Williams as Chief of Police. Chief Williams' tenure was also short-lived. The Los Angeles Police Commission declined to renew his contract, citing Williams' failure to fulfill his mandate to create meaningful change in the department {{in the wake of}} the Rodney King disaster. Susan Clemmer, an officer who gave crucial testimony for the defense at the initial trial, committed suicide in July 2009 in the lobby of a Los Angeles Sheriff's Station. She rode in the ambulance with King and testified that he was <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> spat blood on her uniform. She had remained in law enforcement and was a Sheriff's Detective at the time of her death.|$|E
