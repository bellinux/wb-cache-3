50|$|HDMLs had a round bilge heavy {{displacement}} hull 72 ft long with {{a beam of}} 16 ft and a <b>loaded</b> <b>draught</b> of 5 ft. Loaded displacement was 54 tons. The hull had a pronounced flare forward to throw the bow wave clear and provided considerable lift to prevent all but the heaviest seas from coming aboard. Although seaworthy, the boat had a considerable tendency to roll, especially when taking seas at anything other than directly ahead or astern. The cause was the round bilge midship section and a considerable reserve of stability, the effect of which was to impart a powerful righting moment if the boat was pushed over in a seaway. This, coupled with the round bilged hull and lack of bilge keels, would set up a rapid and violent rolling.|$|R

The kinetics of temperature increases were similar for locomotor muscles, right ventricle (body core), abdomen and subcutaneous tissue. At peak exercise the highest temperatures were measured in locomotor muscle (43. 3 degrees C). The blood temperature in the jugular vein was approximate to 1 degrees C below body core temperature at rest and approximate to 3 degrees C below at peak exercise.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on a highland pony. Special instruments were designed to measure how the forces acting on each foot changed while the animal was in motion. Effects of external load and {{the angle of the}} traces were studied. The results showed that the vertical ground reaction on the rear leg showed two peaks with a dip in the middle, whereas the front leg had a single peak. The horizontal force profile was similar on all feet. It has two separate phases; negative (braking) and positive (propulsive). As the applied load increased the positive portion increased while the negative portion decreased. At draught levels below 300 N the forelegs and the hind legs made equal contribution to the propulsion force, whereas at 710 N the hind legs contributed 57 % of total horizontal pull. At all draught levels the forelegs carried the greater weight. Both front and rear legs produced negative as well as positive power. As the <b>draught</b> <b>load</b> increased the negative power fell and the positive power increased. The hind legs developed more power than the front legs.

50|$|Testing of the ship's engines {{took place}} in June 1907 prior to full trials {{scheduled}} for July. A preliminary cruise, or Builder's Trial, was arranged for 27 July with representatives of Cunard, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and John Brown aboard. The ship achieved speeds of 25.6 kn over a measured 1 mi at Skelmorlie with turbines running at 194 revolutions per minute producing 76,000 shp. However, at high speeds the ship was found to suffer such vibration at the stern as to render the second class accommodation uninhabitable. VIP invited guests now came on board for a two-day shakedown cruise during which the ship was tested under continuous running at speeds of 15, 18 and 21 knots but not her maximum speed. On 29 July the guests departed and three days of full trials commenced. The ship travelled four times between the Corsewall Light off Scotland to the Longship Light off Cornwall at 23 and 25 knots, between the Corsewall Light and the Isle of Man, and the Isle of Arran and Ailsa Craig. Over 300 mi an average speed of 25.4 knots was achieved, comfortably greater than the 24 knots required under the admiralty contract. The ship could stop in 4 minutes in 3/4 of a mile starting from 23 knots at 166 rpm and then applying full reverse. She achieved a speed of 26 knots over a measured mile <b>loaded</b> to a <b>draught</b> of 33 ft, and managed 26.5 knots over a 60 mi course drawing 31.5 ft. At 180 revolutions a turning test was conducted and the ship performed a complete circle of diameter 1000 yards in 50 seconds. The rudder required 20 seconds to be turned hard to 35 degrees.|$|R
