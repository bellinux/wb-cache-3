5|$|Assault groups O1 to O3, {{tasked with}} landing {{the main body}} of the assault, were {{organised}} along similar lines, with each comprising three infantry transports, and varying numbers of tank landing ships (LST), <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Control (LCC), <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Infantry (LCI(L)), <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Tank (LCT), and <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Mechanized (LCM). Assault Group O4, tasked with landing the Rangers and the Special Engineer Task Force at Pointe du Hoc and Dog Green, comprising only six smaller infantry transports.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{developed}} its own <b>landing</b> <b>craft.</b> Development of an Australian {{version of}} the <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Assault, the ALCV (Australian <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft,</b> Vehicle), {{was carried out by}} Army personnel working alongside the Ford Motor Company. Prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on the Brisbane River. The initial version, known as the ALCV I was found to be too small, so the larger 12-metre ALCV II was developed. An Australian {{version of the}} <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Mechanized, the ALCM, was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong. Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger <b>landing</b> <b>craft,</b> so the ALCV III, an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the cargo capacity, was produced. The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs, a type of similar capacity to an American <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Tank, with five Ford V8 engines. Only four were delivered {{before the end of the}} war, but they arrived in time to see service in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|As {{the convoy}} of <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, {{they had a}} chance {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them. In the confusion that followed a number of the <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> were damaged and forced to turn back, while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result {{the decision was made to}} abandon the attack.|$|E

5|$|The American {{troops were}} also {{supported}} by air and naval units. At {{the time of}} the counterattack, the US Navy force assigned to the island comprised the six destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 22, a squadron of PT boats, a small number of <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Infantry fitted as gunboats and several armed <b>landing</b> <b>craft.</b> The air units on Bougainville (designated AirSols) had 64 SBD Dauntless dive bombers and 32 TBF Avenger torpedo bombers available for ground support tasks.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the order}} to {{withdraw}} was given from 11th Brigade headquarters. During the subsequent evacuation, two more <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> ran aground and although one managed to float free, the other remained stuck hard on a reef. Over {{the course of the}} next couple of days, the men in the <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> were subjected to heavy Japanese attack and it was not until 11 June that rescue efforts were completed. The battalion lost 23 men killed or missing, presumed dead, while a further 106 were wounded in the operation.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, seven <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> {{carrying}} 353 Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces {{troops of}} the 5th Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force, supplemented by a few engineers of the 14th and 15th Pioneer Units (Setsueitai), set out from Cape Nelson in the dark {{to participate in the}} attack on the Allied forces at Milne Bay. Upon reaching Goodenough Island they were unable to locate a suitable hiding place during the day for their <b>landing</b> <b>craft,</b> which had to be left on the beach, where the Allies discovered them. A coastwatcher at Cape Nelson reported the Japanese movements, and Milne Bay received a report around midday on 25 August that Japanese were on the west coast of Goodenough Island. Nine Kittyhawks from No. 75 Squadron RAAF were despatched to investigate. They located the <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> and destroyed all seven, along with the Japanese force's radio and most of its stores. The air raid killed eight Japanese; the survivors, lacking transport, were stranded. Meanwhile, the American detachment on Goodenough Island destroyed its own radios and withdrew from the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{first wave}} reached the shore at about 07:30. The first four waves of <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft,</b> Personnel (Ramped) (LCP(R)) from the APDs—arrived {{over the next}} 15 minutes. Each of the six LSTs in the assault towed a <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Mechanized (LCM) of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade; two carried bulldozers, two carried rocket {{equipped}} DUKWs, and two carried spare diesel fuel. The LCMs beached shortly before 08:30 and the LSTs soon after. The Shore Battalion, 542nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment laid Australian Reinforcing Company (ARC) mesh to provide a roadway across the beach for vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The need {{to acquire}} or produce extra <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> and troop carrier {{aircraft}} for the expanded operation {{meant that the}} invasion had to be delayed to June. Production of <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> was ramped up in late 1943 and continued into early 1944, and existing craft were relocated from other theaters. More than 600 Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft and their crews took a circuitous route to England in early 1944 from Baer Field, Indiana, bringing the number of available troop carrier planes to over a thousand.|$|E
5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to the beach, {{he found that the}} machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 {{but there was no sign}} of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then fired off an emergency signal flare; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff.|$|E

5|$|The voyage {{from the}} United Kingdom took {{approximately}} {{three weeks and}} on 7 November 1942 Awatea arrived at its assigned station off the coast near the harbour of Algiers. At 10:15pm No. 6 Commando took to their <b>landing</b> <b>craft.</b> The launch did not go smoothly. From the outset they were hampered by the inexperience of the crews lowering the <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> {{into the water and}} this, along with other factors that arose later including poor weather, breakdowns and navigational errors meant that the majority of No. 6 Commando's <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> missed the rendezvous with the motor launch that was to guide them to the landing beaches. As a result, many landed at the wrong spot and the schedule was ruined. In the end the first landings took place at 3:00am on 8 November, two hours later than planned, while the last wave came ashore in broad daylight at 6:30am.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a path between the ridge and the beach. After about 30 minutes of firing by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape to the beach. Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines {{made it to the}} beach near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at the beach in effort to keep them from successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E
5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of the VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E

5|$|The Dieppe Raid {{was a major}} {{operation}} {{planned by}} Admiral Lord Mountbatten and Combined Operations Headquarters. The attacking force consisted of around 6,000 troops. The Royal Navy supplied 237 ships and <b>landing</b> <b>craft,</b> and the Royal Air Force 74 squadrons of aircraft, of which 66 were fighter squadrons.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{troops with}} their {{supplies}} and equipment {{had to be}} loaded on board the ships on 31 December 1943, just {{five days after the}} assault on Cape Gloucester. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 <b>Landing</b> <b>Craft</b> Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when it was discovered that only nine APDs would be available. New embarkation tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised {{in the light of the}} reduced number of <b>landing</b> <b>craft.</b>|$|E
5|$|As rations {{and water}} dwindled, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made}} on 10 June to rescue {{the men in the}} stranded barge with support from artillery and aircraft. While Corsairs flew close support missions, Beaufort and Mitchell bombers dropped life rafts but the survivors were unable to reach them due to machine-gun fire. Further casualties occurred when, in the early morning of 11 June, a Japanese soldier managed to reach the vessel and fired upon the occupants with a machine-gun, killing two and wounding others before he was killed himself. Shortly after this a Japanese anti-tank gun fired two shells at the <b>landing</b> <b>craft,</b> destroying its stern. Further shots were prevented when Australian artillery ranged in on the gun, having been directed by Captain John Whitelaw, an artillery observer on one of two <b>landing</b> <b>craft</b> that had been despatched with canvas assault boats, crewed by engineers from the 16th Field Company.|$|E
