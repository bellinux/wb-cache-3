6000|$|Are you not my only friend? {{and have}} you not {{acquired}} a right to share my wealth? Answer me that, Alan Fairford. When I was brought from the solitude of my mother's dwelling into the tumult of the Gaits' Class at the High School--when I was mocked for my English accent--salted with snow as a Southern--rolled in the gutter for a Saxon pock-pudding,--who, with stout arguments and stouter blows, stood forth my defender?--why, Alan Fairford. Who beat me soundly when I brought the arrogance of an only son, and of course a spoiled urchin, to the forms of the little republic?--why, Alan. And who taught me to smoke a cobbler, pin a <b>losen,</b> head a bicker, and hold the bannets?--[Break a window, head a skirmish with stones, and hold the bonnet, or handkerchief, which used to divide High School boys when fighting.] Alan, once more. If I became {{the pride of the}} Yards, and the dread of the hucksters in the High School Wynd, it was under thy patronage; and, but for thee, I had been contented with humbly passing through the Cowgate Port, without climbing over the top of it, and had never seen the KITTLE NINE-STEPS nearer than from Bareford's Parks. [A pass on the very brink of the Castle rock to the north, by which it is just possible for a goat, or a High School boy, to turn the corner of the building where it rises {{from the edge of the}} precipice. This was so favourite a feat with the 'hell and neck boys' of the higher classes, that at one time sentinels were posted to prevent its repetition. One of the nine-steps was rendered more secure because the climber could take hold of the root of a nettle, so precarious were the means of passing this celebrated spot. The manning the Cowgate Port, especially in snowball time, was also a choice amusement, as it offered an inaccessible station for the boys who used these missiles to the annoyance of the passengers. The gateway is now demolished; and probably most of its garrison lie as low as the fortress. To recollect that the author himself, however naturally disqualified, was one of those juvenile dreadnoughts, is a sad reflection to one who cannot now step over a brook without assistance.] ...|$|E

40|$|Optimized {{structures}} {{found in}} nature can be sometimes imitated in engineering structures. The recent interest in functionally graded metallic materials makes bone structures interesting because bones are naturally functionally graded 1. The cellular structure of foam metals (Fig. 1) {{is very similar to}} that of the cancellous bone; therefore, these metals can be considered as potential candidates for future implant applications if porosity level, size and shape, strength and biocompatibility aspects satisfy the design specifications of implants. Foam metals based on biocompatible metallic materials (e. g. Ti and Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V) are expected to provide better interaction with bone. This is mainly due to higher degree of bone growth into porous surfaces and higher degree of body fluid transport through three-dimensional interconnected array of pores 2 (open cell foam), leading to better interlocking between implant and bone and hence reducing or avoiding the well-known implant <b>losening.</b> Furthermore, the elastic modulus of foam metals can be easily tailored with porosity level to match that of natural bone, leading to a better performance by avoiding the high degree of elastic mismatch which currently exists between conventional solid metallic implants and bone.

25|$|Even though {{creosote}} is pressurized {{into the}} wood, {{the release of}} the chemical can be seen from many different events. During the lifetime of the marine piling, weathering occurs from tides and water flow which slowly opens the oily outer coating and exposes the smaller internal pores to more water flow. Frequent weathering occurs daily, but more severe weather, such as hurricanes, can cause damage or <b>losening</b> of the wooden pilings. Many pilings are either broken into pieces from debris, or are completely washed away during these storms. When the pilings are washed away, they come to settle {{on the bottom of the}} body of water where they reside, and then they secrete chemicals into the water slowly over a long period of time. This long term secretion is not normally noticed because the piling is submerged beneath the surface hidden from sight. The creosote is mostly insoluble in water, but the lower molecular weight compounds will become soluble the longer the broken wood is exposed to the water. In this case, some of the chemicals now become water-soluble and further leach into the aquatic sediment while the rest of the insoluble chemicals remain together in a tar-like substance. Another source of damage comes from insects such as Shipworms and Limnoria. Though creosote is used as a pesticide preservative, studies have shown that Limnoria is resistant to wood preservative pesticides and can cause small holes in the wood which creosote can then be secreted from.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} clinical outcome of 2 surgical procedures performed to stabilze the traumatic luxation of the lumbosacral joint (LSJ) in 3 dogs thre paraplegic dogs with LSJ traumatic dislocation were included in the study. After premedication with Acepromazine at the dose of 20 µg/kg and Morphine at the dose of 0. 3 mg/kg IM, anesthesia was induced by Propofol (4 mg/kg IV) and maintained with Isoflurane in 10 % O 2. Case 1 : a 30 kg female mixbred, was treated with external skeletal fixation (ESF) utilzing 2 transilal pins, externaly locked with 2 clamps. Case 2 and 3 : males of 15 and 30 kg respectively, were treating performing lumbosacral fixation utilzing 6 pins. Two pins were inserted, acros articular proces L 7 /S 1, into the body of the sacrum; two pins were inserted into the L 6 and L 7 pedicle and body respectively. Al pins were cut and bent to achieve maximum overlap. Cerclage wire and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was aplied to bond fre ends of pins Case 1 : the ESF was removed 50 days after surgery although it has become lose 30 days before. By 7 months there was a marked improvement and the dog was able to walk and run with a slight neurological deficit. Case 2 : the dog was able to stand and walk within 48 h after surgery. 90 days after surgery the dog stil had mild urinary and faecal incontinence. Case 3 : the dog was able to stand and walk 24 h after surgery without presenting neurological alterations To the authors??? knowledge, diferent techniques have ben described to stabilze fracture or fracture/luxation of L 7 : nevertheles single traumatic LSJ dislocation and its treatment are not widely described in dogs 1. In our experience the ESF is able to stabilze L 7 fractures because the bone healing via calus formation neded a shorter time, while the healing via fibrosis requested for L 7 luxation lasted longer. On the other hand ESF shows several advantages, including limited disection of soft tisues, adjustabilty after aplication and removal after repair. The stabilzation technique with pins and PMMA provides a relatively rigid construct to reduction of L 7 luxation and have several advantages such as excelent strength and stabilty, minimal ned of postoperative care and short recovery time. Disadvantages can include soft tisues disection, relatively long time of surgery with higher risk of infections that we controled by using strict aseptic technique and antibiotic administration. In our experience the stabilzation with pin and PMMA shows beter clinical outcome with a short recovery time and mild complications, while ESF sems to not stabilze completely a LSJ luxation because of the early implant <b>losening</b> and the high risk of infection...|$|R

40|$|Transglutaminases (Tgases) are a wide {{family of}} enzymes whose main {{role is to}} {{catalyze}} calcium dependent acyl-transfer reactions from peptidyl glutamine residues to accepting primary amines. The amine substrates can be provided by either a soluble amine (usually polyamines or alternatively histamine) and/or the aminogroups of a protein-bound lysine residue, resulting into release of proteins which are modified at glutamine residues either by simple covalent incorporation of amines or by crosslinkage through proteinase-resistant isopeptide bonds. In mammals, eight distinct Tgase isoenzymes have been identified at the genomic level. The most extensively investigated isoenzyme is the ubiquitous cytosolic isoform, denoted tissue transglutaminase. Its physiologic function is still uncertain {{and it has been}} proposed to be involved into as different cell reactions as programmed cell death death and stimulation to proliferation. Tissue transglutaminase is a bifunctional enzyme displaying also GTP hydrolysis along with the transamidating activity. These activities are switched on-off alternatively. Transamidation is usually a latent activity, thanks to a mechanism involving conformational changes triggered by calcium (an activator essential cofactor in transamidation) and GTP itself (an inhibitor). The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the stability of the enzyme and the effects of ligands thereupon, employing heat as a simple quantificable destabilizing stimulus. In these studies we employed Tgase purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes. In thermal inactivation experiments, Tgase was submitted to heat treatment at various temperature, measuring residual activity at timed intervals. Along with effects on activity, we investigated structural perturbations of the protein by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), with heating cycles employing thermal gradient of 0. 8 °C/min in a temperature range between 20 °C to 90 °C to study the unfolding process in the absence and in the presence of ligands. Finally, selective perturbations of domains 1 and 2 of the enzyme were monitored by tryptophan fluorescence emission between 310 and 370 nm, with excitation at 295 nm, at constant temperature increments. The calculated ratio of fluorescence emission at two wavelengths (at 350 and 330 nm, marked F 350 /F 330) was a suitable measure of the loss of protein tertiary structure and was employed to measure ligand-induced conformational changes and their relationships to thermal stability. The regulation of tissue transglutaminase is achieved through conformational changes triggered by the modulatory ligands calcium (an essential activator) and GTP (an inhibitor), through induction of conformational changes. In this report we address the thermodynamics of these effects by means of a combination of thermal treatment, spectroscopic measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. Our data confirm that binding of ligands induce large conformational changes through movement of domains, identified by distinct unfolding transitions in DSC thermograms. In particular they demonstrate that the protein structure is characterized by tight interaction between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains in the absence of ligands, a reinforcement of the interaction in the presence of the inhibitor GTP and a <b>losening</b> in the presence of calcium ions, with appreciable changes in thermal stability, hindering or disclosing the active site to the substrate. Also addition of heparin did not by itself significantly modify the thermogram profile but it prevented completely the aggregation of the protein which is usually observed late in the fusion profile after the unfolding process is completed...|$|R
