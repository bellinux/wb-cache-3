However, the issue is controversial for certain types of occupational poisoning. This paper proposes the utilization of biological exposure <b>limits</b> currently <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> blood lead levels in Brazil as an important criterion for diagnosing occupational lead poisoning. The author argues that contrary to the traditional clinical criterion, one should deal with the diagnostic problem of lead poisoning from an epidemiological perspective, using the current Brazilian value for the biological exposure <b>limit</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> blood lead level {{as an indicator of}} high relative risk...|$|R
