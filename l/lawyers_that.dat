Lazar reluctantly accepted Putin's request in moving the Schneerson Library to Moscow's Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center as a form of compromise, which was criticized by the Chabad Library.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad's {{death penalty}} was affirmed by the Virginia Supreme Court on April 22, 2005, when it ruled {{that he could}} be sentenced to death because the murder was part of an act of terrorism.

The court rejected an argument by defense <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> Muhammad could not be sentenced to death because he was not the triggerman in the killings linked to him and Malvo.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{the appellate}} court agreed with Ruby's <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> he should be granted a new trial. On October 5, 1966, {{the court ruled that}} his motion for a change of venue before the {{original}} trial court should have been granted. Ruby's conviction and death sentence were overturned. Arrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when on December 9, 1966, Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital in Dallas, suffering from pneumonia. A day later, doctors realized he had cancer in his liver, lungs, and brain. Three weeks later, he died.|$|E
25|$|Chapman's {{legal team}} {{intended}} {{to mount an}} insanity defense based on expert testimony {{that he was in}} a delusional psychotic state {{at the time of the}} killing.

The judge allowed the plea change without further psychiatric assessment after Chapman denied hearing voices, and sentenced him to a prison term of 20 years to life with a stipulation that mental health treatment be provided. Chapman will most likely remain in prison for the rest of his life, having been denied parole nine times amidst campaigns against his release after becoming eligible in 2000.|$|E

25|$|In February 2015, Nasheed {{was arrested}} again {{and ordered to}} stand on trial for his {{decision}} to arrest Abdulla Mohamed in 2012 while he was the President. On 13 March 2015, Nasheed was sentenced to thirteen years in Maafushi Prison for abducting Abdulla Mohamed. He was charged under the Anti-Terrorism Act of Maldives. The three-judge bench unanimously found him guilty of ordering the arrest of Abdulla Mohamed in January 2012, when he held {{the office of the}} President. The ruling came four days after Nasheed's lawyers quit in protest against what they called was a biased trial aimed at destroying his political career. He was originally cleared of the charge but a few days later, the prosecutor general had him re-charged and arrested under tough anti-terror laws. The court rejected an objection from Nasheed’s <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> two of the judges were not suitable to hear the case because they had testified against Nasheed at a police inquiry on the judge’s arrest. The court also dismissed four witnesses produced by Nasheed’s lawyers before they even testified, saying they were not strong enough witnesses. Nasheed had earlier been charged with abuse of power but prosecutors last month filed more serious charges under the country’s terrorism law. The trial was completed after 10 hearings over 23 days.|$|E

500|$|By six {{votes to}} three, a U.S. Army court-martial found Dorothy guilty {{of first-degree murder}} and sentenced her [...] "to be {{confined}} at hard labor {{for the rest of}} her natural life". A unanimous verdict of guilty would have made the death sentence mandatory. She was flown back to the United States in a Military Air Transport Service plane and was imprisoned at the Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, in West Virginia. The United States Court of Military Appeals rejected an appeal filed by Krueger's <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> argued that Dorothy was not sane at the time of the incident, and that the testimony that the court-martial had heard to the contrary was military rather than medical.|$|E
500|$|After Downey missed another {{required}} {{drug test}} in 1999, {{he was arrested}} once more. Despite Downey's lawyer, John Stewart Holden, assembling for his client's 1999 defense the same team of <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> successfully defended O.J. Simpson during his criminal trial for murder, Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California (a.k.a. [...] "Corcoran II"). At {{the time of the}} 1999 arrest, all of Downey's film projects had wrapped and were close to release, with the exception of In Dreams, which he was allowed to complete filming. He had also been hired for voicing the devil on the NBC animated television series God, the Devil and Bob, but was fired when he failed to show up for rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|On November 23, Judge Rothman {{accepted}} Feldman's {{motion and}} set March 21, 1994, as the start {{date for the}} civil trial. Rothman ordered Jackson's deposition scheduled {{before the end of}} January 1994, but noted he might reconsider if Jackson was indicted on criminal charges. Jackson agreed to be deposed on January 18. [...] His attorneys said he was eager to testify, but also said they might oppose the deposition if criminal charges were filed or were still under consideration on his deposition date. [...] They said if charges were filed, they would want the criminal trial to go first. However, when authorities notified Jackson's <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> they expected their investigation to continue at least through February, Jackson's team still failed to win a delay of the civil case. Jackson's lawyers also lost a motion to prevent Feldman from turning over information (e.g. from the civil deposition) to prosecutors pursuing possible criminal charges.|$|E

500|$|On June 11, 2008, Donaghy alleged in a {{statement}} through his <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> several series in the NBA Playoffs had been improperly refereed according to the NBA's instructions. He alluded specifically to a playoff game where [...] "personal fouls [...] were ignored even when they occurred {{in full view of}} the referees" [...] because [...] "it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series." [...] The game referred to was widely believed to be Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings, in which the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter. Donaghy also referred to a playoff series where [...] "Team 3's Owner alleged that referees were letting a Team 4 player get away with illegal screens. NBA Executive Y told Referee Supervisor Z that the referees for that game were to enforce the screening rules strictly against that Team 4 player." [...] The playoff series was believed to be the first-round encounter between the Houston Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks in the 2005 NBA Playoffs. The Rockets led 20 in the series before losing in 7 games, and then-Rockets head coach Jeff Van Gundy was fined $100,000 for stating that a referee was targeting Houston center Yao Ming.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} November 7, {{articles}} were appearing in newspapers noting {{the omission of}} the motto [...] "In God We Trust" [...] on the eagle, and the Mint soon began to receive many complaints. [...] Roosevelt believed that using God's name on coins was sacrilegious, and had confirmed with government <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> no law required the motto's use. [...] Saint-Gaudens wanted to include only the minimum of lettering on the new coins, and was content to omit the motto. [...] According to his son Homer, as Saint-Gaudens considered [...] "the motto 'In God We Trust' as an artistic intrusion not required by law, he wholly discarded [...] and thereby drew down on himself the lightning of public comment". [...] The House of Representatives passed a bill ordering {{the use of the}} motto on the new eagle and double eagle (which also lacked the phrase) in March 1908; the Senate followed suit in May. [...] Roosevelt, finding public opinion against him, signed the bill into law that month. [...] Barber duly placed the motto on the reverse, {{to the left of the}} eagle's breast. [...] On the [...] "No Motto pieces" [...] struck at the Denver Mint in 1908 (catalogued as 1908-D), the mintmark [...] "D" [...] appears above the leaves near the eagle's feet on the reverse; on the pieces with motto struck both at Denver and at San Francisco (mintmark S) beginning in 1908, the mintmark appears to the left of the arrow on which the bird stands. Barber also made other, minor changes in the coin; according to Breen, [...] "Aside from the addition of the motto, none of Barber's niggling changes are defensible as improvements, unless one insists that more of the first U of UNUM had to show. Nor is striking quality increased." ...|$|E
500|$|The next week, Kinne's lawyers {{requested}} {{that she be}} released on bond, supported by a community petition signed by 132 supporters of her innocence. The motion was denied {{on the basis of}} first-degree murder not being a bailable offense; presiding judge Tom J. Stubbs also counseled Kinne's <b>lawyers</b> <b>that</b> he felt their involvement in such a petition at a time when a motion for bond was being considered was [...] "highly improper". A subsequent defense motion {{requested that}} Kinne's conviction be vacated because the jury had delivered its verdict based on [...] "surmise and speculation" [...] rather than [...] "substantial evidence". The motion also listed a series of procedural errors that Kinne's counsel alleged had taken place before and during the trial, including a juror taking [...] "incomplete" [...] notes, attorneys for both sides of the case having disputed John Boldizs's testimony, and an incorrect number of potential jurors being provided for selection. The motion was denied by Judge Stubbs in April 1962, but appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, which in March 1963 reversed Kinne's conviction and ordered a new trial on the basis of Kinne's defense having been denied adequate peremptory challenges during jury selection in her trial. Kinne was denied an opportunity for bail in May 1963, but that ruling was overturned in July and Kinne was released on $25,000 bond, posted by her brother. The state's request that the Missouri Supreme Court re-consider its position on Kinne's conviction was granted, but in October 1963 that hearing resulted in further grounds being found for a new trial, this time {{on the basis of the}} prosecutor having been allowed to cross-examine a prosecution witness. A second request for a re-hearing on the validity of Kinne's conviction was denied by the Missouri Supreme Court. Kinne and her children moved in with her mother and awaited the start of her new trial.|$|E
