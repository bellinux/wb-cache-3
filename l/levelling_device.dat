40|$|In North-eastern Italian Alps wood {{extraction}} in steep terrain (up to 25 - 30 %) {{is generally}} performed {{by means of}} 4 WD agricultural tractors equipped with winches. One problem {{associated with the use}} of agricultural tractor in forestry, especially in off-road moving in steep terrain, is the stability and hence operator’s safety. In order to overcome such a problem an adaptation of a 4 WD agricultural tractor for wood extraction in steep terrain has been developed. It considers different features especially designed to be installed on an agricultural tractor. The first feature consists in a self-levelling device, made by two arms, articulated on the tractor’s final drive box and moved by two hydraulic rams. On the end of each arm a free-turning bogie is mounted. Another feature is the elongation of the fork in which the front axle is articulated, in order to increase its tilting angle. Two side plates, bolted on the rear body of the tractor, represent the last feature. The plates allow moving the p. t. o. shaft and the three-point linkage to the back permitting the use of the mounted winch. The control of the <b>levelling</b> <b>device</b> is both automatic and manual. When manually operated the <b>levelling</b> <b>device</b> is controlled by means of a single lever on the right side arm of the operator’s seat. The adapted tractor has demonstrated to operate in efficient and safe way on sloping and rough terrain...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} was {{elaborated}} the topic: Project and surveying {{of the network}} for planimetry and hight points {{in the area of}} the river Ostřice using several methods. Its purpose was a reconnaissance of the part of a basin of Ostřice, assessment of existing point field, propose and complete the point network for planimetry in sufficient density for further surveying work in the area and survey of location and level by using geodetic methods and GPS. The reconnaissance of the area was conducted due to geodetic and levelling data of the points and maps. A network of 18 points of the detailed point network was built. I located nine of them by using a GPS method and a method of polygonal traverse. The electronic total station Leica TC 407 was used for the point survey by the method of polygonal traverse, for the GPS method was used a GPS apparatus Trimble 4600 LS. Altitude of the points was determined by the method of technical levelling. For the altitude determination was used a Topcon AT [...] 24 A <b>levelling</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E

The paper describes design considerations, architecture and the components of the CANDLE control system. The mainrequirements are operability, reliability, flexibility and to be open to evaluations and hardware modifications. The basic ideas are as follows: usage of standard components, distributed control system, multi-layered structure and modular hardware/software design. Software developments arebased on object oriented technology. Consisting of three layers the architecture implements low <b>level</b> <b>device</b> servers as independent programs.

40|$|One of the {{important}} issues in a substation automation system is performance of the communication buses consist of station bus and process bus. The station bus provides communication between station <b>level</b> <b>devices</b> and bay <b>level</b> <b>devices</b> and the process bus provides communication between bay <b>level</b> <b>devices</b> and primary equipment. In substation automation system, the appropriate operation of protection, control and monitoring systems depends on communication network accuracy. The communication network architecture {{is based on the}} required data, reliability and commissioning requirements during the installation of the SAS (Substation Automation System). It is clear that the reliability and security of the communication networks are different respect to importance of the substation. Therefore, the significance of the substation can be used to determine the communication network and inside the substation bus configuration. In this study, a new approach is proposed to determine the significance level of substation based on 7 factors and then the architecture of communication buses has been configured...|$|R

40|$|The {{popularity}} of group-oriented applications, secure and efficient communication among all group members {{has become a}} major issue. Another major issue is that to provide dynamic rekeying for all the users that join and leave the group. For the rekeying of the group key all members of the group should agree the rekeying of the key. When keys are distributed dynamically the content should be handled by an authenticated person and safe communication must be enhanced. In this paper we present a solution for dynamic rekeying by optimized rekey method to generate dynamic rekey for the users. This mechanism maintains the key server for frequent updating of key and calculating the key length to minimizing the storage cost as well as computational cost. The authentication is provided by a method, anonymity system. The security of users is provided by implementing anonymity manager to blacklist the misbehaving users in the networks. The devices once found to be authenticated; they start communication by adopting various cryptographic techniques depending on the types of <b>devices.</b> The <b>level</b> may be classified based on the memory capacity and type of processor used. Elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) schemes for high <b>level</b> <b>devices,</b> advanced encryption standard (AES) for intermediate <b>level</b> <b>devices</b> and hashing schemes with key harning for low <b>level</b> <b>devices</b> are implemented. Thus our proposed system reduces the number of rekeying and provides authenticated and secured group communication. Keywords: Key management, multicast services, dynami...|$|R

40|$|With {{a growing}} elderly {{population}} in many developed countries, technologies for supporting elderly healthcare {{are becoming more}} and more important. As technologies such as the Web and consumer <b>level</b> <b>devices</b> evolve, this opens up new opportunities for telehealthcare. In this paper, we discuss how the paradigm known as the Web 2. 0 can be leveraged to develop solutions that are more patient-centric and empower the patients, especially the elderly, to manage their own health from home. We critically analyse popular Web 2. 0 health applications and propose a framework for overcoming their shortcomings. Furthermore, we describe how consumer <b>level</b> <b>devices</b> such as off-the-shelf computers and motion sensing input devices can be used to make telehealthcare more accessible and affordable. Devices such as iPhones and the Wiimote controllers can enable patients to perform rehabilitation and prevention activities such as exercises at home. We argue that by combining the potentials of Web 2. 0 and new consumer devices, a more holistic approach to telehealthcare can be achieved. ...|$|R
