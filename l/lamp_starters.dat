40|$|The peroxo-oxalate {{complexation}} {{method is}} a method {{that can be used}} for the preparation of doped barium titanate. In this paper we focus on BaTi 0. 91 Zr 0. 09 O 3, which can be used for discharge capacitors in <b>lamp</b> <b>starters.</b> The preparation method described here is based on the complexation and subsequent precipitation in basic environment of Ba, Ti, and Zr ions with hydrogen peroxide and oxalate. The influence of several process parameters, like precipitation temperature and pH, on powder properties is described. A single-phase perovskite crystal structure is obtained after calcination starting from a chloride precursor solution using a precipitation temperature of 40 Â°C and a pH of 9. Because the peroxo-oxalate process starts with inexpensive chlorides and is performed in air, the peroxo-oxalate process is suitable for the commercial production of doped barium titanate...|$|E

5000|$|LED tubes {{based on}} Retro-Fit design can {{typically}} {{be installed in}} place of former fluorescent tubes in compatible luminaires as they are, with consideration of manufacturer and lamp-specific restrictions. Some models are only compatible with magnetic ballasts, but models that can be installed in any old fluorescent tube luminaire are also available on the market. In some Retro-Fit LED tubes, a special LED starter is used {{in place of the}} fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>starter.</b> Re-introduction of fluorescent lamps is still possible merely by <b>lamp</b> and <b>starter</b> replacement. If used in luminaires equipped with compensation capacitors, LED tubes often generate a lot of reactive power.

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the newer}} electronics is price. It can cost 3 to 5 times more per lamp to use electronic ballasts than traditional choke ballasts, which is why choke ballasts are still used {{in the majority of}} new tanning systems. Another {{disadvantage of}} the older style choke ballast is they are designed for European electricity, and require incoming voltage in the range of 220 V AC and 230 V AC. Most US homes have 240 V service and businesses use 208 V three-phase service that requires these beds to use a buck-boost transformer in order to receive the proper voltage. Too low a voltage will result in the <b>lamp</b> <b>starter</b> not letting the lamp ignite (or at the least, very slowly) whereas too high a voltage can lead to premature failure in the <b>starters</b> and <b>lamps.</b> The average cost of these transformers is $200 to $250. While this makes the newer electronics cost about the same for the typical tanning bed, buckboost transformers are usually sold separately, so the total cost is not always obvious to the consumer at first glance.|$|R
50|$|A bipin or bi-pin, (sometimes {{referred}} to as two-pin, bipin cap or bipin socket), is a standard from the IEC for lamp fittings. These are used on many small incandescent light bulbs (especially halogen <b>lamps),</b> and for <b>starters</b> on some types of fluorescent lights as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{mercury in}} the tube is a liquid at normal temperatures. It {{needs to be}} vaporized and ionized before the tube will conduct {{electricity}} and the arc can start. So, like fluorescent tubes, mercury vapor <b>lamps</b> require a <b>starter,</b> which is usually contained within the mercury vapor lamp itself. A third electrode is mounted {{near one of the}} main electrodes and connected through a resistor to the other main electrode. In addition to the mercury, the tube is filled with argon gas at low pressure. When power is applied, there is sufficient voltage to ionize the argon and strike a small arc between the starting electrode and the adjacent main electrode. This starting arc discharge heats the mercury and eventually provides enough ionized mercury to strike an arc between the main electrodes. This process takes from 4 to 7 minutes, so mercury lamps are slow starting. Some bulbs include a thermal switch which shorts the starting electrode to the adjacent main electrode, extinguishing the starting arc once the main arc strikes.|$|R
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the <b>starter</b> <b>lamp.</b> This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|R
