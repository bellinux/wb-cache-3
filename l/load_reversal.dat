The resultant stress-strain data was compared to a 1 D mechanics model and a finite element model used to design a composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV).

40|$|Gas turbine {{operating}} cycles at {{high temperatures}} often consist of <b>load</b> <b>reversals</b> mixed with hold times; the latter occurring either as cruise for aero engines or at continuous power output for land based turbines, {{but also at}} low frequency loading conditions, e. g. slow “ramp up” of engine thrust. The hold time conditions cause the crack to grow by intergranular fracture due to material damage near the crack tip, thus rapidly increasing the crack growth rate. Since the damaged zone will affect the crack propagation rate due to cyclic loadings as well, the complete load history of a component therefore has to be considered. The crack propagation model {{presented in this paper}} is based on the damaged zone concept, and considers the history effect in the form of damaged zone build up during hold times, and subsequent destruction as the crack propagates onwards by rapidly applied <b>load</b> <b>reversals.</b> By incorporating crack closure for handling different R-values, an aero engine component spectrum is evaluated for a surface crack at 550 C.

Performance of the extended CZM is examined using finite element (FE) simulation of a single Sn- 4 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 405) solder interconnect specimen. Strain rate-dependent response of the solder is represented by unified inelastic strain equations (Anand's model) with optimized model parameters for SAC 405 solders. The 3 D FE model of the specimen is subjected to cyclic relative displacement (Δδ = 0. 003 mm, R = 0) so as to induce shear-dominant fatigue loading. Results show that interface crack initiated {{at the leading edge}} of the solder/IMC interface on the tool side of the assembly after 22 cycles have elapsed.

30|$|In view of {{the present}} study, it is {{important}} to perform a retrospective review of experimental tests performed on rectangular columns under horizontal loads, especially with biaxial behaviour. The response of RC members subjected to axial loads together with biaxial bending moment reversals is recognised as a very important research topic for building structures in earthquake-prone regions. On one hand, studies of the response of RC building columns to earthquake actions deal in general with its three-dimensional response, due to the random characteristics of the earthquake direction and to the actual building irregularities. On the other hand, the biaxial features of bending moment histories applied to a given RC column section tend to reduce its actual capacity and to accelerate the strength and stiffness deterioration process during successive <b>load</b> <b>reversals.</b> In addition, the 3 D response of frame structures to actual earthquake motions generally does not induce the same type of increased deterioration in beams because they behave essentially in only one direction (vertical), i.e., the potential development plastic hinges in beams are not aggravated by that fact. This means that both the biaxial loading effects in columns and the 3 D features of the general structure response positively contribute to inelasticity and damage concentration in the columns rather than in the beams, which is essentially the opposite of what present-day design code requirements created to avoid collapse of RC frame structures under lateral <b>load</b> <b>reversals</b> (plastic hinges in the beams rather than in the columns) CEB (1996).|$|R

40|$|Since a {{wide range}} of {{opinions}} exists on axially loaded friction piles in sand a further evaluation and determination of the mechanisms involved with pile shaft capacities has been undertaken. A series of model pile load tests have been carried out in a geotechnical centrifuge {{to determine the effects of}} continuous <b>load</b> <b>reversals.</b> Axial compression and tension tests were performed on closed end pipe piles in a medium to dense dry silica sand. Both the end bearing and the total pile capacity were simultaneously measured to enable direct calculation of the shaft capacity. Pile loads and displacements were measured, as was the pile's inclination off vertical. With this information and the soil properties obtained within the laboratory, back calculations were performed using various methods to theoretically determine the pile shaft capacities. The theoretical values were then compared with the pile model data at prototype scale. This comparison has revealed the lack of reliability of design procedures of full displacement-type friction piles in sand and has yielded recommendations for the further experimental testing of pile models, which may ultimately lead to recommendations to existing design guidelines. [...] The study demonstrated that pile shaft capacities in non-cohesive soils can be both underestimated and dangerously overestimated by following conventional analytical design procedures. Pile inclination was determined to have a great affect on shaft capacity. Furthermore, the mobilization of pile end bearing was observed to have a distinct influence on compressive shaft resistances. Test results revealed a significant reduction in tensile shaft resistance after the first few load cycles and a continued reduction with an increasing number of <b>load</b> <b>reversals.</b> Conversely, an increase in the total pile compressive resistance after several cycles was observed and thought to be due to granular crushing and material densification at the zone of end bearing. Similar to the end bearing response, the compressive shaft resistance initially reduced with <b>load</b> <b>reversals</b> but a trend reversal did become apparent. As the end bearing began to increase with continuous load cycling, so did the compressive shaft resistance. Focussing on an individual load cycle, the observed tensile shaft resistances were approximately equal to the compressive resistances before the end bearing was mobilized. Beyond this point the compressive shaft resistances increased to values of 2 to 3 times that of the corresponding tensile capacities. The increase in compressive shaft resistance was observed to be proportional to the simultaneous increase in end bearing capacity. [...] It is believed that a pressure bulb is generated at the pile base that in turn increases the lateral confining stresses along the lower portion of the pile shaft The study has shown that as soon as the end bearing is activated, the formation of a pressure bulb can dominate the frictional behaviour of relatively short piles...|$|R
