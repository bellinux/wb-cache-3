40|$|Friction {{management}} in the railway industry is a well-establishedtechnology {{with the aim of}} optimizing the friction between wheeland rail. Determining the friction coefficient (Q) at the wheel-railinterface is therefore important especially for heavy haul lineswith higher axel loads. This paper presents an initial study of thetop-of-rail friction condition of a 30 ton axel load, Iron Ore line inthe northern part of Sweden. The friction coefficient between therail and a metal wheel of a portable Tribometer was measured atdifferent geographical locations and during differentenvironmental conditions. The effects of precipitation are studiedand compared with the effects of top of rail friction modifiers.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} that facilitates prediction of the transient {{solution for the}} pressure and film thickness in an elastohydrodynamically <b>lubricated</b> <b>line</b> contact for the case of arbitrary surface microgeometry (roughness) under the assumption of Newtonian lubricant behaviour and small roughness amplitude. In the model the {{two parts of the}} transient solution (particular integral and complementary function) are calculated for each Fourier component of a surface real roughness and combined to obtain the complete transient solution. As no time-consuming numerical simulations are required, the computational scheme forms a simple and efficient tool for use in a practical engineering environment. To validate the approach, first simple cases such as single dents and harmonic waviness were considered. The predictions obtained for these cases are compared with the results of full numerical simulations, showing good agreement. Subsequently the results obtained for a realistic roughness profile are presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{classical}} Reynolds equation-based modeling of lubrication, the exit area is only considered through a pressure boundary condition which fails {{to predict the}} remaining amount of lubricant on each moving surface after the film rupture. A two-phase flow model using the Navier-Stokes equations and a diffuse interface approach is developed to analyze the lubricant behavior at the exit of rolling and sliding <b>lubricated</b> <b>line</b> contacts. After physical and numerical descriptions of the two-phase flow model, results are compared with experimental data from the literature. Good agreements are found concerning pressure profiles and meniscus exit abscissas. The model is then used to study in detail the flow behavior at the exit for different surface tensions. It is shown that when surface tension effects are important, recirculation areas occur downstream the air/oil meniscus. Sliding effects on fluid distribution are then investigated. Finally, an analytical approach is proposed, as a synthesis of the numerical results...|$|R

The model is applied to elastohydrodynamically <b>lubricated</b> <b>line</b> contacts with smooth surfaces and isothermal conditions. A few investigations are carried out where different parameters are varied. The first study investigates the influence on the film thickness distribution due to {{a variation of the}} maximum Hertzian pressure when the slide-to-roll ratio is constant. The second study investigates how far the non-Newtonian region propagates at low slide-to-roll ratios for a few different values of the Hertzian pressure. The results show that it is a remarkably small slide-to-roll ratio necessary to cause slip planes in {{a large part of the}} Hertzian contact zone. A third study regards the influence of the entrainment velocity on the film thickness generation at different slide-to-roll ratios. Finally some theological parameters are varied. First, only the limiting shear stress at atmospheric pressure (tau(0)) is varied, and second, a few different lubricants are studied, each with their own set of rheological parameters.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a mixed lubrication {{model in}} order to predict the Stribeck curve for starved <b>lubricated</b> <b>line</b> contacts. This model {{is based on a}} combination of the contact model of Greenwood and Williamson and the elastohydrodynamic (EHL) film thickness for starved line contacts. The starved solution to be implemented in the EHL component is obtained by using numerical data of Wolveridge, who computed the starved film thickness for smooth line contacts. Calculations are presented for different oil supply layer thickness over roughness values (hoil/s). For values of the oil layer thickness over roughness ratio larger than approximately 6, the Stribeck curve and separation between the rough surfaces do not change compared to the fully flooded situation. If the oil layer thickness over roughness ratio is in the range of 6 down to 0. 7, friction starts to increase and the film thickness decreases. When the oil layer thickness over roughness ratio is less than approximately 0. 7, the Stribeck curve tends to transform into a straight line and separation stays at the same value as in the boundary lubrication regime. Comparison between measurements and calculations is made and a good agreement is found...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{efficient}} numerical method for the fully <b>lubricated</b> <b>line</b> contact between a rotating, deformable cylinder and a rigid surface. By exploiting the dynamic variation structure of this non-linear problem the deformation of {{and the pressure}} at the free, contact boundary are calculated. The dynamic formulation leads in a natural way to an iterative procedure, where the evolution from one iterate to a subsequent one is governed by a minimization problem. Physically, the Euler-Lagrange equation expresses {{the fact that the}} mass has to be conserved. For this reason, in contrast with earlier approaches, mass flux defects do not occur here. The proposed dynamic algorithm starts with the calculation of the lubricated contact between a rigid cylinder and the rigid surface. Then the stiffness of the cylinder is lessened until the desired value is reached, where after the loading on the cylinder is increased by moving it towards the rigid surface. The effort to proceed in time is significantly reduced by preconditioning: the discretized Euler-Lagrange equation is multiplied by an approximation of the inverse of the global operator governing the deflection of the cylinder. In this way, solutions that are comparable to large-time (or super-) computer computations can be calculated on a PC. ...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} {{numerical}} simulations the amplitude reduction of waviness in a transient elastohydrodynamically <b>lubricated</b> <b>line</b> contact is investigated {{as a function}} of slip, under conditions representative of a highly loaded (piezoviscous) situation. Firstly, the case of waviness on one of the surfaces is investigated. It is shown that the behaviour of the deformed amplitude {{as a function of}} the sliding velocity can be traced back to the variations in the mass flow induced by the waviness (which are forced by the squeeze term oscillations). The results are compared with recent theoretical work, showing excellent agreement. In particular, the peculiar effect of (significant) amplification of the amplitude (instead of reduction) for short wavelengths under conditions of sliding predicted in this work is confirmed by the presented results. However, for similar conditions it is almost absent if lubricant compressibility is taken into account. Secondly, waviness was assumed on both surfaces. The magnitude of the film oscillations in the centre of the contact has been monitored {{as a function of the}} sliding velocity and amplitude ratio. Again the behaviour can be traced back to the squeeze term and mass flow variations. Furthermore, it is shown that, for the conditions considered here, accurate predictions can be obtained on the basis of the results obtained for single-sided waviness. A simple formula is presented...|$|R

Theoretical solutions showing the influence of elastic distortions upon friction, pressure and film shape are presented. These are supported by experiments upon the same type of bearing. Pressure measurements and the tangential force on the plane surface for layers of various thicknesses are recorded as obtained from two experimental rigs. The persistence of hydrodynamlc or boundary lubrication for a soft layer compared to a rigid plane, under conditions of low speed or low viscosity lubricant, is also illustrated by the friction measurements.

40|$|A {{numerical}} solution of an elastohydrodynamically <b>lubricated</b> (EHL) <b>line</b> contact between two long, rough-surface cylinders that considers the frictional heating of asperities was obtained. Pressure distribution, temperature distribution, film thickness and EHL load for given speeds, lubricant properties, material properties of surfaces, and surface roughness parameters were theoretically solved by simultaneous {{solution of the}} elasticity equation and the Reynolds equation for two partially lubricated rough surfaces. The pressure due to asperity contact was calculated by assuming a Gaussian distribution of surface irregularities. The elastic deformation used for film thickness computation was found from the two kinds of pressure by plane strain analysis. The temperature rise in the contact zone was calculated by using the Blok-Jaeger flash temperature model. The effects of surface roughness on EHL load for various slide-role ratios, surface roughness parameters, surface patterns, and temperature parameters was studied.

One example of its function in the reproductive lining relates to blastocyst implantation resulting from MUC4 downregulation. It is found to be overexpressed during the luteal phase of menstruation. MUC-4 may also have a role in fetal morphogenic development. It should be noted that MUC-4 is not found in the gallbladder, pancreas, or liver except in abnormal conditions such as cancer.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{three different}} topics {{within the field}} of tribology. First, design functions for analyses of slider bearings are developed. Second, a lubricant model applied to elastohydrodynamically <b>lubricated</b> (EHL) <b>line</b> contacts considering wall-slip is presented. Finally, an experimental apparatus for investigations of lubricants at high pressures is presented. The design of hydrodynamic bearings usually requires a total numerical analysis of the pressure distribution and the corresponding design quantities such as load capacity and power loss. The objective of this part of the thesis was to determine curve-fitted functions describing each design quantity. Three different kinds of geometry were analysed; rectangular tilting-pad thrust bearings, sector-shaped tilting-pad thrust bearings and journal bearings with two axial oil grooves. The approximate design functions obtained are shown to be in very good agreement with the numerically calculated results. The functions are intended to be implemented in short computer programs. A wall-slip model including limiting shear stress is presented. The lubricant model was applied to EHL line contacts using isothermal conditions. The main part of the model concerns the lubricant velocity at each surface that is decoupled from the corresponding surface velocity giving two new variables in the EHL equations. The lubricant velocity at the surface is related to the corresponding shear stress. As long as the value of the shear stress is below the limiting shear stress, the lubricant velocity is equal to the surface velocity. However, when the shear stress reaches the limiting shear stress, interfacial slip appears and the lubricant velocity differs from the surface velocity. Both smooth and wavy surfaces were used in the calculations and the influence of the wall-slip model on the results compared to a Newtonian model was investigated. Results from a high pressure chamber are presented. It is possible to use the apparatus for a number of different measurements. The compressibility variation with the pressure for five different lubricants was investigated for pressures up to 2. 7 GPa. The density variation for each lubricant is presented as a curve-fit...|$|R

40|$|Wear is {{considered}} one of the main challenges in the twenty-first century for engineers and designers of mechanical systems. The objective is to understand the wear mechanisms and to seek new solutions - materials, lubricants, additives - to extend the lifetime of components, enable scheduled maintenance and replacement intervals. Research conducted during the past decades shows that wear can be minimized but not eliminated from systems operation due to a large number of parameters which are influencing the evolution of this phenomenon: load, velocity, temperature, type of lubrication as well as the surface roughness. Depending on operation conditions, the occurrence of wear leads to a change in the macro contact geometry of the components. In time, this will affect the functioning of the components, for example: high friction for brakes, clutches and transmissions or low friction for cylinder-piston contact, cam-follower and gears. In this thesis the influence of macroscopic wear on friction in lubricated sliding concentrated contacts is investigated. Experimental wear and friction tests were conducted on different types of <b>lubricated</b> contacts: <b>line,</b> point and elliptical. These tests have shown a change in contact geometry and in operating regime of the systems, i. e. friction level. To understand this, a relation between wear, contact geometry and minimum film thickness is made. In a lubricated contact three zones are distinguished: inlet, contact and outlet zone. The inlet zone dictates the formation of the minimum film thickness between contacting surfaces. When wear is present the contact geometry changes, leading to a modification in pressure distribution. Changes in separation due to wear are modeled based on hydrodynamic theory and are incorporated in a deterministic mixed lubrication friction model. Using this model the transition between the lubrication regimes, as shown in a Stribeck curve, can be predicted. The experimentally obtained results are in agreement with the theoretical simulations. It is shown that increased wear leads to a decreased friction level resulting from the occurrence of the hydrodynamic effects due to a reduced contact pressure. This causes a change in the operating regime of the system. In the one case this changed regime can be considered to be the main cause of failure in a system, whereas in another system it means smooth operation after a period of running-in. The theoretical results are presented in a generalized Stribeck curve. From this, it is possible to select the parameters such that the components of a lubricated system operate in the preferred regime in order to control friction and minimize wear...|$|R

Two bypass filter sizes of 6 and 1 micron were investigated, both filter sizes were effective but the one micron filter had the greatest benefit. This was tested on two nominally identical EURO 1 emissions compliance refuse trucks, fitted with Perkins Phazer 210 Ti 6 liter turbocharged intercooled engines and coded as RT 320 and RT 321. These vehicles had lubricating oil deterioration and emissions characteristics that were significantly different, {{in spite of their}} similar age and total mileage. RT 321 showed an apparent heavier black smoke than RT 320. Comparison was made with the oil quality and fuel and lubricating oil consumption on the same vehicles and engines with and without the on-line bypass oil recycler.
