This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark's presuppositional apologetics, with the exception that Clark never thought the <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> faith was contrary to reason (see also Fideism).|$|E

25|$|In Kierkegaard's meaning, purely {{theological}} assertions are subjective truths {{and they}} cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge. For him, choosing {{if one is}} for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice. He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> faith, since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified. For him the Christian faith {{is the result of}} the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices).
