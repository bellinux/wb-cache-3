The State Premiership final against Launceston at York Park saw Devine's North Hobart win by a record 20 goals. He was nicknamed [...] "Dead Legs" [...] due to his loping running style, which belied his speed and hard-at-the-ball playing style. He returned to coach North Hobart in 1981 which by then was a struggling outfit and returned a disappointing one win for the season in taking out the wooden spoon before retiring.|$|E

Only the Lakers made an appearance in the NBA Finals that decade, losing the 1991 NBA Finals to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, the first championship in the Bulls' dynasty.

[...] Both teams also faced set backs in the form of personal misfortune. On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.

The change to the wishbone was kept under such secrecy that when the media would visit practice, Bryant had the team practice the pro-style system that was phased out. Alabama later opened the season with an upset victory over USC that was credited to the surprise switch to the wishbone that caught the Trojans off-guard.|$|R

40|$|For {{young people}} under age 15, year-round {{specialization}} {{in a single}} sport is more often associated with developmental risks than rewards. Positive physical, psychological and social development {{is most likely to}} occur when young people participate in multiple sports and informal physical activities throughout childhood and early adolescence. Specializing in a single organized, competitive sport at an early age is a controversial issue. As adults turn to organized youth sports to foster positive development in children, they find that many programs encourage or require early specialization. As these programs have grown, it’s become increasingly “normal ” for young people to specialize year round in a single sport. This change has <b>led</b> parents, teachers <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> to ask, “Should young people under age 15 specialize in a single sport year round or play multiple sports? ” It also has inspired careful research by exercise and sport scientists. Based on research findings across multiple fields, it is NASPE’s current position that: � Participating regularly in a variety of sports and physical activities yields many documented physical, psychological and social benefits related to both short- and long-term development and to future participation in both recreational and competitive sports...|$|R
