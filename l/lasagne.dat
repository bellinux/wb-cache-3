25|$|The {{above-mentioned}} dishes {{have developed}} a distinctively Argentine nuance. That is why, for example, Argentine pasta includes {{a wide variety of}} dishes ranging from spaghetti, fusiles (fusilli), ñoquis (gnocchi), ravioli, cintas (pasta ribbons), and <b>lasagne</b> to the Argentine-made sorrentinos, agnolottis (agnolotti), canelones (cannelloni), and fetuchines (fetuchini).|$|E

50|$|The Swiss-based company Nestlé {{reported}} on 18 February 2013 {{that it had}} found more than 1% horse DNA in two beef pasta products. It withdrew chilled pasta products, Buitoni Beef Ravioli and Beef Tortellini, in Italy and Spain. Sourced from sub-contractor HJ Schypke, itself a German sub-contractor of Belgian-based Nestlé supplier JBS Toledo, also withdrew frozen <b>Lasagnes</b> à la Bolognaise Gourmandes, a product for catering businesses produced in France.|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} by European {{forensic science}} laboratories of horse DNA in food labelled as beef meat products has brought renewed public scrutiny and interest to meat supply network activities and associated politics and policies. These have included concerns about food safety, horror from national and religious communities {{who have been}} sold food that contained meat from animals that are culturally unacceptable for them to eat, and questions about the nutritional quality of low-value processed meat products. It is within cheaper-end processed meat products, including frozen beefburgers, meatballs and frozen beef <b>lasagnes,</b> that traces of meat other than beef (including the headline-grabbing horsemeat) have been found. In the first instance the revelations led to claims of a mislabelling scandal. However, as investigations have deepened {{there have been more}} serious allegations about the existence of fraudulent practices in a complex international production, supply and distribution network of processed meat products. The horsemeat story brings to light some of the challenges of commercializing animal bodies for edible meat products within a globalized agro-food network...|$|R
25|$|In {{variation}} to {{rice and}} beans, Brazilians usually eat pasta (including spaghetti, <b>lasagne,</b> yakisoba, lamen, and bīfun), pasta salad, various dishes using either potato or manioc, and polenta as substitutions for rice, {{as well as}} salads, dumplings or soups of green peas, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, broad beans, , soybeans, lentils, moyashi (which came to Brazil due to the Japanese tradition of eating its sprouts), azuki, and other legumes in substitution for the common beans cultivated in South America since Pre-Columbian times. It is more common to eat substitutions for daily rice and beans in festivities such as Christmas and New Year's Eve (the tradition is lentils), as follow-up of churrasco (mainly potato salad/carrot salad, called maionese, due to {{the widespread use of}} both industrial and home-made mayonnaise, which can include egg whites, raw onion, green peas, sweetcorn or even chayote squashes, and pronounced almost exactly as in English and French) and in other special occasions.|$|E
500|$|Italian cuisine is {{the most}} popular Mediterranean cuisine in England. In its current form, with plenty of pizza and pasta, {{inspired}} by Elizabeth David, its rise began after 1945. There were some Italian restaurants before World War II, but they mostly served a generalised haute cuisine. Soon after the war, Italian coffee bars appeared, the first places to trade on their Italianness; they soon started to sell simple and cheap Italian food such as minestrone soup, spaghetti bolognese and pizza. From the early 1960s, the slightly more elegant trattoria restaurants offered [...] "Italian specialities" [...] such as <b>lasagne</b> verde al forno (baked <b>lasagne,</b> coloured with spinach).|$|E
500|$|Items in the restaurant's menu {{used to have}} themed names, such as [...] "The Galactic Grill" [...] (triple-decker {{grilled cheese}} sandwich), [...] "Beast from 1,000 Islands" [...] (Reuben sandwich), [...] "Tossed in Space" [...] (garden salad), [...] "The Cheesecake that Ate New York", [...] "Attack of the Killer Club Sandwich", [...] "Beach Party Panic" [...] (fish fillet), [...] "Saucer Sightings" [...] (rib eye steak), [...] "Terror of the Tides" [...] (broiled fish), and [...] "Journey to the Center of the Pasta" [...] (vegetable <b>lasagne),</b> but these have since been {{replaced}} with more descriptive names. A popcorn bisque was once on the menu, but it was removed due to poor reception.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociologist}} Bob Ashley {{observed that}} while people in Britain might {{agree that the}} core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast beef with all the trimmings, tea with scones, and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a National Trust café, whose manager claimed [...] "We're not allowed to do foreign food... I can't do <b>lasagne</b> or anything like that", in fact served curry, because [...] "seemingly curry is English". Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed {{been part of the}} national diet since the eighteenth century.|$|E

Some pubs offer elaborate hot and cold snacks free to customers at Sunday lunchtimes, to prevent them getting hungry and leaving for their lunch at home.|$|E
2500|$|Dante's day {{is spent}} in the purgatory of serving a {{succession}} of customers while repeating {{the fact that he}} is [...] "not even supposed to be here today". Stressed with the demands of his job, Dante passes time in wide-ranging conversations with his best friend, Randal Graves. Randal is an irresponsible slacker who works in the next-door video store, RST Video, although he spends most of the day at the Quick Stop, neglecting the video store's customers. They converse about many things to pass time, such as whether or not the contractors working on the second Death Star when it was destroyed at the end of Return of the Jedi were innocent victims. Other events of the day include the discovery that Dante's high school girlfriend, Caitlin Bree, whom he has been having early morning phone conversations with, is engaged to be married. Dante's current girlfriend, Veronica Loughran, also stops in to bring him homemade <b>lasagne.</b> The two talk about Dante's stuck-in-a-rut lifestyle with no motivation to change before having an argument about her past sexual partners.|$|E
2500|$|Fresh pastas do not {{expand in}} size after cooking; therefore, [...] of pasta {{are needed to}} serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and <b>lasagne).</b> It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} <b>lasagne</b> of Naples, <b>lasagne</b> di carnevale, is {{layered with}} local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with a Neapolitan ragù. <b>Lasagne</b> al forno, layered with a thicker ragù and Béchamel sauce and which {{corresponds to the}} most common version of the dish outside Italy, is traditionally associated with Emilia-Romagna.
