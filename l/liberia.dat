5|$|Upon the {{invitation}} of President William Tubman, Massaquoi returned to <b>Liberia</b> on 13 October 1946 to help him establish a university in Monrovia. She became Professor of French and Science in March 1947 at <b>Liberia</b> College, later the University of <b>Liberia</b> (UL). In 1956, she became director, then dean (1960), of the Liberal Arts College and was a co-founder of the Society of Liberian Authors. In 1962 Massaquoi founded and directed a programme for African Studies, which would evolve into the Institute of African Studies at UL.|$|E
5|$|With {{a view to}} {{enhancing}} educational {{developments in}} <b>Liberia,</b> in late 1963 and early 1964, Massaquoi spent six months in the United States on an education scholarship, visiting fine arts colleges and university departments of anthropology and sociology, mainly {{in the east and}} mid-west. In 1968, while living in Monrovia, <b>Liberia,</b> with her daughter Vivian Seton and her grandchildren, Massaquoi suffered a stroke. This pressed Seton into having the 700 pages of her mother's unpublished autobiography microfilmed, calling on the assistance of colleagues at the University of <b>Liberia.</b> Massaquoi retired from the university in the summer of 1972, receiving an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. She was also decorated as a Grand Commander of the Grand Star of Africa by the president of <b>Liberia.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1964, the {{officers}} appointed were nearly all college graduates. From 1951, {{there was a}} US military mission based in <b>Liberia</b> to assist in training the AFL. A Reserve Officers' Training Corps was established in 1956 with units at the University of <b>Liberia</b> in Monrovia and the Booker Washington Institute in Kakata. By 1978 the program had been redesignated the Army Student Training Program (ASTP) and had a total of 46 students at the University of <b>Liberia,</b> the Booker Washington Institute, and three smaller institutions.

5|$|The Armed Forces of <b>Liberia</b> (AFL) are {{the armed}} forces of the Republic of <b>Liberia.</b> Tracing its origins to a militia that was formed by the first black colonists in what is now <b>Liberia,</b> it was founded as the Liberian Frontier Force in 1908, and retitled in 1956. For {{virtually}} all of its history, the AFL has received considerable materiel and training assistance from the United States. For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U.S. advisers, though this assistance has not prevented the same generally low levels of effectiveness common to most of {{the armed forces}} in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|The Liberian Air Force was {{formally}} dissolved in 2005 {{as part of}} the armed forces demobilization programme, though it had effectively ceased to exist during the civil war.

With the reduction in strength of UNMIL ahead of its anticipated closure of operations in March 2018, these services were wound down.|$|E
5|$|The Liberian open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II.

The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E

However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or <b>Liberia.</b> An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and <b>Liberia.</b> Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E

In 1922 she accompanied her father, a diplomat, to Hamburg, Germany, where she completed her school education and started a course medicine at the University of Hamburg. In 1937 she moved to the United States for further education, studying sociology and anthropology at Lane College, Fisk University and Boston University. While in the US, she collaborated on a dictionary of the Vai language and wrote her autobiography, though a legal battle ensued over the rights to her story. She won an injunction barring others from publishing and returned to <b>Liberia</b> in 1946, immediately beginning collaboration to establish a university there, which would become the University of <b>Liberia.</b>|$|E

Its core piece is an overview on career paths and social and professional background of elites of <b>Liberia’s</b> first regular postwar government. It argues that <b>Liberia’s</b> new elite system is significantly more inclusive than previous ones, despite discernible continuities.

The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within <b>Liberia</b> {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D.
