25|$|<b>Least</b> <b>shrew</b> (Cryptotis parva) — rare in Connecticut, {{where the}} species reaches its eastern limit {{and close to}} its {{northern}} limit (it is also in central New York state); in this state, only found in coastal areas with high beach dunes and neighboring brackish marshes; all other shrews in the state have much longer tails (at least {{as long as the}} rest of their bodies). As of late 2007, the species was the only mammal listed on the Connecticut endangered species list, {{and it was the first}} mammal ever put on the list. The greatest threat facing least shrews in the state is land development along the coast, which limits the land available for the species and isolates breeding populations. Other threats are pesticides and pollutants contaminating food and habitat. The animal was first identified in Darien, Connecticut, in 1840 by Reverend James H. Linsley, but not seen again for 100 years. In 1941, George Goodwin, assistant curator of mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, found one in Westbrook at the edge of a saltgrass meadow. The animal again went without documented sightings until it was found in 1989 in coastal Middlesex County in 1989. As of 2007, this is the only documented Connecticut location of the species.|$|E
50|$|The Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> {{can swim}} well, and in captivity even seems to enjoy playing in water. Its small size {{also makes the}} Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> a phenomenal climber: it has been {{observed}} climbing up even the smooth inside corner of a glass terrarium. Its eyesight is poor, but it has very good hearing. While the Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> frequently emits sounds, much of its communication is in frequencies beyond the limits of human hearing.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its small}} size and reclusive habits, the Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> can be {{difficult}} to spot. Like shrews in general, the Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> mainly eats insects, but will also dine on carrion or any other source of protein it finds. In winter, it may occasionally seek food indoors. Because of its small size for a mammal, the Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> has an extremely high metabolic rate and must eat frequently to avoid starvation; in captivity it has been reported to eat 120 meals a day, consuming three to four times its own weight each day. The Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> is active around the clock, with occasional sleep periods of 10-50 minutes each.|$|E
50|$|Mammals that {{sometimes}} take bees include bears, <b>least</b> <b>shrews,</b> opossums, raccoons, honey badgers and skunks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Least</b> <b>shrews</b> {{are being}} used in {{research}} as emesis models, to see how delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol prevents emesis in the cannabinoid receptors. This research is especially useful for cancer patients because chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, cause nausea and vomiting.|$|R
50|$|The {{forests are}} home to a rich {{wildlife}} including Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), North American <b>least</b> <b>shrews</b> (Cryptotis parva), North American beavers (Castor canadensis) and many species of butterflies and reptiles. Larger mammals that once lived here, including jaguar (Panthera onca) and Plains bison (Bison bison bison), have now disappeared from the region. Endangered fauna found in this ecoregion include the Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis) and Attwater's prairie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri).|$|R
50|$|The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> mostly dwells in mesic grasslands, marshes, and meadows. Most shrews prefer these wet habitats, but the <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> {{will also}} inhabit dry upland regions. This species {{can be found}} in meadows, fields, and weedy areas, where the {{vegetation}} attracts its insect diet.|$|E
50|$|The female Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> has {{one or two}} litters a year, each {{typically}} {{consisting of}} 3-6 offspring. Little {{is known about the}} typical lifetime of the Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> in the wild, but in captivity some have managed to reach an age of over 2.5 years.|$|E
50|$|The Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> may {{be mistaken}} for the {{slightly}} larger Eurasian pygmy shrew (S. minutus), which is commonly found in the same areas. Besides the size difference, the two species may be distinguished by the tail and feet of the <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> being noticeably shorter in proportion to its body.|$|E
40|$|Genetically {{distinct}} hantaviruses {{have been}} identified recently in multiple species of shrews (Order Soricomorpha, Family Soricidae) in Eurasia and North America. To corroborate decades-old reports of hantaviral antigens in shrews from Russia, archival liver and lung tissues from 4 Siberian large-toothed shrews (Sorex daphaenodon), 5 Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrews</b> (Sorex minutissimus), 12 flat-skulled shrews (Sorex roboratus), and 18 tundra shrews (Sorex tundrensis), captured in the Sakha Republic in northeastern Siberia during July and August 2006, were analyzed for hantavirus RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. A novel hantavirus, named Kenkeme virus, was detected in a flat-skulled shrew. Sequence analysis of the full-length S and partial M and L segments indicated that Kenkeme virus was genetically and phylogenetically distinct from Seewis virus harbored by the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), {{as well as all}} other rodent-, soricid-, and talpid-borne hantaviruses...|$|R

50|$|The {{tropical}} small-eared shrew (Cryptotis tropicalis) is a {{very small}} mammal of the family Soricidae. The species is found in the eastern highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, and parts of Belize and Guatemala. Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> (C. parva), but it has gained species status. The relationship with the Central American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> (C. orophila) is still to be studied.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between the level of course woody debris in experimental plots of mature loblolly pine and the richness and abundance of shrews, reptiles and amphibians. Comparisons were made between plots in which all down and standing debris were removed and plots that were not treated. Removal of woody debris resulted in a week treatment effect. The capture of southeastern shrews declined through the period perhaps due to drought. The <b>least</b> common <b>shrew</b> demonstrated the strongest effects from removal. In sampling 37 species of amphibians were observed. The Carolina anole and the red salamander were captured more frequently on removal plots. No difference were found between removal and controls with regard to reptiles...|$|R
5|$|Many {{authors have}} {{described}} the prey items taken under natural circumstances. Although fish and frogs are their most common prey, they eat almost any small vertebrate. Campbell and Lamar (2004) provided an exhaustive list of species that have reportedly been preyed upon by A. piscivorus, including cicadas, caterpillars, land snails (Euglandina rosea), catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), pike (Esox ssp.), sunfishes (Lepomis ssp.), bass (Micropterus ssp.), sirens (Siren spp.), eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), brook salamanders (Eurycea spp.), Ouachita dusky salamanders (Desmognathus brimleyorum), spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus), eastern narrowmouth toads (Gastrophryne carolinensis), northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans), West Indian treefrogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis), treefrogs (Hyla spp.), true frogs (Rana spp.), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), skinks (Eumeces spp.), eastern glass lizards (Ophisaurus ventralis), ground skinks (Scincella lateralis), mudsnakes (Farancia abacura), hog-nosed snakes (Heterodon platirhinos), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis spp.), watersnakes (Nerodia spp.), crayfish snakes (Regina spp.), brown snakes (Storeria dekayi), gartersnakes and ribbonsnakes (Thamnophis spp.), other cottonmouths (A. piscivorus), rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), mud turtles (Kinosternon spp.), common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), Florida cooters (Pseudemys floridana), sliders (Trachemys scripta), eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina), Florida softshell turtles (Apalone ferox), baby American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), chickadees (Parus spp.), cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), unidentified passerines, small ducks, juvenile anhingas (Anhinga anhinga), common egrets (Ardea alba), egrets, glossy ibises and their eggs (Plegadis falcinellus), tricolor herons (Egretta tricolor), herons and their eggs, pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), short-tailed <b>shrews</b> (Blarina brevicauda), <b>least</b> <b>shrews</b> (Cryptotis parva), southeastern shrews (Sorex longirostris), eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), rice rats (Oryzomys palustris), hispid pocket mice (Perognathus hispidus), black rats (Rattus rattus), squirrels (Sciurus spp.), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) and bats.|$|R

50|$|The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> (Cryptotis parva) {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} mammals, growing to be only up to 3 inches long. The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> has a long pointed snout and a tail never more than twice the length of its hind foot. It has a dense fur coat that is either grayish-brown or reddish-brown with a white belly. Its fur becomes lighter in the summer and darker in the winter. Although similar in appearance to several species of rodents, all shrews are members of the order Soricomorpha and should not be mistaken for a member of the Rodentia order. The North American least shrew's eyes are small and its ears are completely concealed within its short fur, giving it very poor eyesight and hearing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} {{the efficiency of}} four trap types (pitfall, Sherman LFA, Victor snap and Museum Special snap traps) to capture shrews. This experiment was conducted in five inter-riverine forest blocks {{in the region of}} Kisangani. The total trapping effort was 6, 300, 9, 240, 5, 280 and 5, 460 trap-nights for the pitfall, Sherman, Victor and Museum Special traps, respectively. In total, we captured 366 shrews. The use of pitfall traps yielded the highest trapping success (4. 1) with at <b>least</b> 18 <b>shrew</b> species identified. Trapping success and the number of species collected was lower for the Sherman (0. 6, at least 11 species), Victor (0. 6, at least 8 species) and Museum Special (0. 5, at least 6 species) traps. Although Crocidura olivieri and C. denti were caught using all four trap types, captures with different trap types did not produce a sample with the same taxonomic composition. In agreement with previous studies, our results indicate that pitfall traps are the most efficient for capturing shrews: not only do they have a higher efficiency (yield), but the taxonomic diversity of shrews is also higher when pitfall traps are used...|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} {{mistaken for a}} rat or mouse and killed as vermin. In general it is {{beneficial}} to humans because its diet consists mostly of harmful insects such as cockroaches, and even house mice. It can therefore {{be considered as a}} biological pesticide. Unlike rats, population levels of house shrews remain low. Despite its use as an insect control, it can be unpopular due to the strong odour of its droppings, which it may deposit in human dwellings behind kitchen cupboards, etc. It can also take to eating human food such as meat in kitchens, or dog or cat food. It is known to occasionally kill young chicks, making it unpopular with farmers, although rats probably kill more chicks, and more quickly. The way it is said to attack chicks, by first biting a tendon, immobilizing it and then killing and eating it, could indicate that it has a venomous bite that paralyses, as at <b>least</b> two other <b>shrews</b> species have (i.e. the Eurasian water shrew and the Northern short-tailed shrew).|$|R
50|$|The {{area has}} a rich variety of wildlife; 43 species of mammals and over 70 {{species of birds}} include {{substantial}} populations of wild turkey, muskrat, beaver and gray fox. In addition small populations of <b>least</b> <b>shrew,</b> meadow jumping mouse, long-tailed weasel, striped skunk and the harvest mouse have been found. Endangered species of salamander may exist here.|$|E
50|$|The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> {{makes its}} home in burrows or shallow runways under flat stones or fallen logs. Its burrows are about 2.5 cm in diameter, from 25 cm to 1.5 m long, and seldom more than 20 cm below the ground. Most shrews are {{aggressive}} towards each other, but this species {{is a social}} creature and often cooperates in digging its burrows and often sleeps with other shrews. From 2 to 31 of these shrews will live together at a time, although it is more common to find them together in the winter months to keep warm. It will line its burrows with leaves and grass in nests {{for the purpose of}} rearing offspring. The breeding season extends from early March to late November. Females produce two or more litters each season. Each litter will consist of about three to six young, each one weighing about 0.3 g, which grow quickly and will be adult size in about one month. Litters are born 21-23 days after copulation. When first born, young are deaf, blind, and hairless. At 14 days old, they will open their eyes and have fur. By day 21, they will weigh 4-5 g and weaning will begin. The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> rarely lives more than a year. Its natural predators are owls, hawks, the red fox, the raccoon, skunks, and snakes. The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> will try to defend itself with its venomous saliva.|$|E
50|$|The Central American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> (Cryptotis orophila) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Soricidae. It {{is found in the}} {{highlands}} and mid-elevations from {{the western part of the}} northern coast of Honduras to central Costa Rica. It is found in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. It was considered to be a subspecies of C. parva until 2002.|$|E
50|$|Its diet {{consists}} of mostly small insects, such as caterpillars, beetle larvae, earthworms, centipedes, slugs, and sow bugs. It will also eat from the corpses of dead animals, and {{small amounts of}} seeds or fruits. This shrew will eat its prey whole, but when eating crickets and grasshoppers, the North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> will bite off the head of its prey and eat only the internal organs. When fighting a larger creature, it will aim for the legs and try to cripple its adversary, and will bite lizards, which are often too large for it to kill, on the tail, which then falls off and provides it with a meal while the lizard escapes. The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> will also sometimes live inside beehives and eat all the larvae. It will often share its food with other shrews. It eats more than its body weight each day and is known to store excessive amounts of food for later.|$|E
50|$|This tiny shrew {{is active}} {{at all hours}} of the day, but mostly at night. Hunting by smell and touch, the North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> digs through loose soil and leaf litter for its prey along the surface of the ground. The {{behavior}} of captive individuals suggests it can also tunnel through moist soil in search of food much like moles do. However, it mostly occupies burrows built by other mammals.|$|E
5000|$|Shrews are common: the cinereus shrew, long-tailed shrew and American {{water shrew}} are {{widespread}} in the New England region, while the North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> and southeastern shrew are common in the southeastern states. The American pygmy shrew, smoky shrew, and northern short-tailed shrew are found from the Appalachian Mountains to New England. The star-nosed mole lives throughout the Eastern U.S., while the hairy-tailed mole is more common from the Appalachians to New England in the north.|$|E
50|$|The Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> inhabits the {{northern}} taiga region, and is found throughout Siberia, in northern Europe (Finland, northern Sweden {{and parts of}} Norway) and on the islands of Sakhalin and Hokkaidō. It {{can be found in}} diverse habitats, including both coniferous and deciduous forests, open fields, and the edges of bogs. The population density appears to be fairly low throughout, though its prevalence may be underestimated in surveys since its small size lets it escape many commonly used traps.|$|E
50|$|The Eurasian <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> weighs only 1.2-4 grams {{and has a}} body {{less than}} 4 cm long, with a 2.5 cm tail. This shrew has a brown back and a light grey underside, with a fairly clear {{boundary}} in between. The color of the back varies seasonally from chocolate brown in summer to light brown in winter. The same bicolor pattern extends to the tail, which has a dark brown tuft of hair at the end. The feet are {{the same color as}} the belly, with brown heels.|$|E
50|$|The gray fox {{is found}} in Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and also around the Great Lakes region. The ring-tailed cat {{is found in}} the {{southern}} region, including in Texas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. There are many species of squirrels in the central parts of the U.S., including the fox squirrel, eastern gray squirrel, Franklin's ground squirrel, southern flying squirrel, and the thirteen-lined ground squirrel. Voles include the prairie vole, woodland vole and the meadow vole. The plains pocket gopher lives throughout the Great Plains. Shrews include the cinereus shrew, southeastern shrew, North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew,</b> and the Elliot's short-tailed shrew.|$|E
5000|$|The American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii) is the {{smallest}} species of mole. It is the only living member of the genus Neurotrichus and the tribe Neurotrichini. It {{is also known as}} Gibb's shrew mole and <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> mole. It is not closely related to the Asian shrew mole (Uropsilus in Urotrichini). The reason that it is called a [...] "shrew mole" [...] instead of being called either a [...] "shrew" [...] or a [...] "mole" [...] is because of its fur, which is a characteristic of shrews and its large head and heavy dentition, which is characteristic of moles.|$|E
50|$|Members of {{the genus}} are found mainly in Central America; the North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew,</b> C. parva, is the only species found north of Mexico. The genus occurs {{as far south as}} {{northern}} Peru and as far east as western Venezuela in South America. It is the only soricomorph genus found south of Guatemala. The limited diversity and restricted northern distribution of shrews in South America implies that the group invaded the continent relatively recently from Central America, where they are more diverse, presumably as part of the Great American Interchange. However, shrews have no fossil record in South America that would allow their arrival to be dated.|$|E
50|$|Evolutionary {{analysis}} {{seems to}} show the shrews evolved from the ancestor Crocidosorex in Europe and crossed over into the Nearctic, consisting of North and Central America, via the Bering Strait (above sea level at the time). The earliest fossils of shrews, Crocidosorex piveteaui, are from the family Soricidae and {{date back to the}} Oligocene epoch, but shrews are thought to have originated in the late Eocene (30-40 million years ago). It is debated whether four or five ancient subfamilies occurred, but only two are left today: Soricinae and Crocidurinae. Once the descendants of the Crocidosorex crossed into North America, this subfamily of Soricidae gave rise to the genus Antesorex during the Miocene. In the late Miocene, they split into Adeloblarina and Alluvisorex. From Adeloblarina, two genera, Blarina and Cryptotis, diverged during the Pliocene. The North American <b>least</b> <b>shrew</b> species, Cryptotis parva, then arose from the Cryptotis genus.|$|E
