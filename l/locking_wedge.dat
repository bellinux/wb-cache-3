2500|$|Along {{with the}} M1885 Remington-Lee and the M1892 Springfield, the M1895 Lee {{was one of}} the first {{infantry}} weapons adopted by U.S. forces to be equipped with a repeating action. [...] To operate the straight-pull mechanism, the operating handle is first pulled up at an angle to disengage the bolt and its <b>wedge</b> <b>lock,</b> then pulled sharply to the rear to extract and eject the spent case. [...] Pushing forward on the bolt handle strips a round from the magazine; as the bolt is slammed home, the bolt's <b>wedge</b> <b>lock</b> seats into place, the firing pin is cocked, and the fresh cartridge is seated in the chamber. [...] Once the M1895 is cocked, the rifle's bolt cannot be retracted unless the bolt-release lever is pushed downward. [...] This prevents opening of the action caused by an inadvertent bump or contact to the bolt handle. [...] The rifle has a safety located on the top of the receiver, which is released by pushing down with the thumb on the safety button.|$|R

It was intended for the gun to use a <b>wedge</b> <b>lock</b> and fixed ammunition, but the plans were changed already before the prototype was ordered. Blueprints and a prototype was ordered from Bolshevik Plant no. 232 in 1930. The design bureau director was N.N.Magdasijev and project leader G.N.Rafalovits. Others involved in the design were S.A.Morozov, S.A.Zalazaev, B.A.Lever, V.M.Rosenberg and V.I.Kudrjashov. The gun design was changed from submarine to destroyer weapon using separate instead of fixed ammunition and in 1932 new specifications included a change from 45 to 50 calibers and a screw breech block instead of wedge block. During test firing in 1934—35 several shortcomings were found in the gun design, particularly with the breech and loading mechanism. Because the Leningrad class destroyers that were supposed to use the guns were already under construction the 130mm B-13 gun was accepted for mass production in 1935 and the first twelve guns were finished during the same year.|$|R
40|$|Aerospace {{electronic}} boards require {{special attention to}} thermal management due to constraints such as their need to be light, small, and maintain high power densities. Also, cooling is mainly through conductive and radiative modes with minor or negligible convective cooling. Due to these particular requirements, thermal design has become an integrated part of the electronic design process {{in order to avoid}} expensive repeat prototyping and to ensure high reliability. To achieve high speed simulations, the BETAsoft code uses semi-empirical formulations and an advanced finite difference scheme that incorporates local adaptive grids. Detailed conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer is considered. Various benchmark verifications of the software simulation compared to infrared images typically prove to be within 10 % of each other. The thermal analysis of a sample avionic card in a natural convection environment is shown. Then, the individual effects of attaching metal screws to the casing, increasing radiative emissivities of the casing, increasing the conductance of the <b>wedge</b> <b>lock,</b> adding an aluminum core to the board, adding metal strips in board layers, inserting conduction pads under components, and adding heat sinks to components are demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded locking member which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a spring biased and movable locking member. The locking or latch member has ear parts received in <b>locking</b> openings where <b>wedging</b> surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the locking member is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the locking member to retain the locking member in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are placed under tension over annular rollers so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position. Novelty lies {{in the creation of a}} locking hinge which allows compact storage and easy assembly of structural members having a minimal number of parts...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [79]- 80). Printed wiring boards (PWBs) are extensively used {{in electronic}} systems. In many instances they {{are subjected to}} dynamic loads, for e. g., in aerospace and automotive applications. The behavior of PWBs to vibration and shock depends on {{the way they are}} mounted in electronic boxes. Hence, accurate modeling of the mounting is necessary to predict the dynamic behavior of PWBs. PWBs are typically supported using <b>wedge</b> <b>locks,</b> screws, bolts or edge connectors. Each mount type offers different boundary conditions. During analysis, the mounts are modeled appropriately to simulate the boundary conditions they offer. Edge connectors are usually modeled as simple supports. This thesis investigates the representation of an edge connector as a combination of linear and torsional spring (LTS) to better simulate the boundary condition. The stiffnesses of linear and torsional spring are calculated based on the geometry of the contact of the edge connector. The LTS model was tested on aluminum and fiberglass epoxy beams and plates mounted between two identical edge connectors. The validity of the model was checked by comparing the analytical behavior of the systems with their experimental behavior. These results were also compared with the behavior predicted by representing the edge connector as simple support to ascertain the gains achieved by modeling the edge connector as a combination of linear and torsional spring rather than as a simple support. Results show that the LTS model predicts the behavior of systems better than the simply supported model. It is also shown that the gains accrued by the use of LTS model depend on the width of the PWB used in the system. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{important}} potential for a development of a building system, if the present AACblock plants are completed with high performance concrete and pre-stressing technique. This can be done as a continuation of a present AAC production or in a site factory. Hybrid cooperation between AAC and concrete {{is not a new}} technology. Traditionally, AAC is covered with rendering. The wetted material is first sprayed with cement slurry after which comes lime/cement-based rendering which strengthens the wall and supplies a mechanical protection. AAC blocks can be used as infill members in concrete deck plates and concrete framed walls (Hellers, 1993), in which the shrinkage of the surrounding concrete locks completely the cured blocks into a stable composite. A good cooperation between AAC and concrete is a requirement for the pre-stressed hybrid. This combination has been investigated with reference to bond and moisture content. The interface must have sufficient bond to supply shear strength to the structural member. Also, the concrete should be suitable for pre-stressing which requires a minimum strength class K 40. Here, K 60 is applied in order to reduce creep and avoid creep failure of the AAC. A production layout for the purpose is suggested. This research consists of three parts: 1 - Hybrid concrete elements The principal formulation of hybrids, built on cooperation between two concrete materials, a weak AAC and a strong HPC poured on top, shows that this combination unites the most favourable qualities of the two concretes into a structural element with rational building technology. Load-bearing capacity is good, and the fire protection is excellent. Through pre-stressing of the structural concrete, a crack-free behaviour is guaranteed up to the service limit, and deflection from dead weight (incl. floor covering and possibly half the service load) be eliminated. The most important structural elements needed in a building system could be taken as hybrids. In drawings, different members like floor- roof- and wall members, window and door lintels are shown. 2 - Production system for hybrids AAC blocks form a bed containing the pre-stressing steel in slits and on which high performance concrete is poured. Pre-stressing brings the two concretes together. This is especially important for the shear capacity of a building member, by which extra dowels can be omitted. The pre-stressing force is anchored by plates directly against the cured AAC blocks. A special pre-stressing bed is not required. The production is arranged {{in such a way that}} necessary equipment (trays, form strips, <b>wedges,</b> <b>locks)</b> are circulated within twenty-four hours. The necessary manpower for this facility is analysed. Normally 8 men are needed per shift. A detailed conceptual production layout for a hybrid production plant is included for discussion. See figure 6. 2 (suggested production layout). 3 - Application in building The hybrid members are united at joints and through seams. Continuity over connections is achieved by filling seams with mortar grout. Reinforcement may be included to achieve ductility. By a similar method, it is possible to make connections between horizontal and vertical building members. Common connection details are shown in the report. This building method replaces the equivalent method with concrete or AAC members, and it is in fact a coordination between these two. The maximum span of floor members is up to 9 m. It makes the system suitable for modern residential house production, but also suitable for office buildings, industrial halls and other applications. See attached drawings, part 2 and part 3.
