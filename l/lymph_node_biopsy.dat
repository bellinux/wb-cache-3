25|$|Surgery {{involves}} the physical {{removal of the}} tumor, typically {{along with some of}} the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the lymph node sampling is performed by a sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neither {{sentinel}} <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsy</b> nor other {{diagnostic tests}} {{should be performed}} to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm. People with these conditions are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes or anywhere else and already have a 97% 5-year survival rate. Because of these things, sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsy</b> is unnecessary health care for them. Furthermore, baseline blood tests and radiographic studies should not be performed only based on identifying this kind of melanoma, as there are more accurate tests for detecting cancer and these tests have high false-positive rates. To potentially correct false positives, gene expression profiling {{may be used as}} auxiliary testing for ambiguous and small lesions.|$|E
25|$|Confirmation of the {{clinical}} diagnosis is done with a skin biopsy. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsy</b> is done, as well, although controversy exists around trial evidence for this procedure. Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.|$|E
30|$|Therapeutic {{considerations}} such as {{the systematic}} removal of inguinal and pelvic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in primary malignant melanoma of the vagina are uncommon; however, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis is a prognostic factor. Therefore, the detection of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis is necessary. However, considering the invasiveness of surgical intervention, operations should be limited as much as possible. In general, sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsies</b> are indicated in patients with malignant melanoma and are used frequently in other primary sites (Lens et al. 2002). The MSLT- 1 study investigated the effectiveness of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsies,</b> and we performed sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsies</b> based on this theoretical background.|$|R

25|$|Melanomas {{that spread}} usually do {{so to the}} lymph nodes {{in the area of}} the tumor before {{spreading}} elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically (lymphadenectomy) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsy</b> has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.|$|E
25|$|There {{are dozens}} of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main {{categories}} of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsy</b> {{is often}} performed, {{especially}} for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and {{tumors of the}} limbs. A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had {{a small number of}} positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} whether sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>biopsies</b> improved survival rates {{in all cases}} of malignant melanoma, a randomized, comparative trial was conducted in collaboration with 17 institutions (MSLT- 1).
