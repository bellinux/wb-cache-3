She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts {{about other people}} are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – all she can think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze."

His mother is a Pentecostal Christian and his father practices Islam. In a 2012 radio interview with Tim Westwood, he said that his father has three wives.

During an interview with Adesope of Factory 78 TV, Wizkid described his life in a nutshell. He said he formed a group called the Glorious Five with a couple of his church friends. The group managed to release an album prior to disbanding. Wizkid later met OJB Jezreel, a record producer who prevented him from recording for a year. While visiting OJB's PointBeat Studios frequently, he watched 2 Face Idibia record songs for his Grass 2 Grace album. He was also present during the recording sessions for Sound Sultan's debut album, Jagbajantis. Wizkid cited Naeto C as {{one of the people who}} mentored and coached him when he was 15 years old. Wizkid also told Factory 78 TV that his parents weren't receptive of his music from the onset. In order to gain his father's trust, he had to work hard and spend <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in the studio. Wizkid co-wrote Banky W's [...] "Omoge You Too Much", a song off The W Experience album. He also worked with Naeto C, OJB Jezreel, Ikechukwu, and M.I while developing his craft.

The critical consensus reads, [...] ""The Origins of Monstrosity" [...] {{is not as}} engrossing as its predecessor, yet several plot machinations serve {{to fill in the}} gaps." [...] Joey DeAngelis of The Huffington Post thought the episode was high quality, calling it [...] "my favorite episode of the season (or maybe even the series)." [...] He then praised many aspects of the episode, including the cast, stating, [...] "Since episode one, the show has been built on these strong female characters. It doesn't matter whether they're battling for good or evil. Lily Rabe, Jessica Lange, and Sarah Paulson are in a whole league of their own." [...] Geoff Berkshire of Zap2it called the episode [...] "overly talky...and not quite as compelling {{as the rest of the}} season so far." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "What's disappointing is that [...] "The Origins of Monstrosity" [...] is a dull and listless episode. It's easily the most boring episode this season, and it spends <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> offering origin stories for characters who either already had them or didn't particularly need them." ...|$|E
