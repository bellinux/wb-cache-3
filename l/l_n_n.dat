NMR analyses have shown that this solution contains mainly oligomeric species but also a small amount (~ 5 %) of low weight dinuclear [Fe 2 II (L n) 3] 4 + complex. The poor solubility of the reduced forms of the oligomers causes precipitation and adsorption on the electrode surface of thin films. These films exhibit an excellent stability especially when they are cycled over the iron oxidation redox system (less than 5 % loss after 80 subsequent scans). This is due to the very slow redissolution of the oxidized films...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} block {{number on the}} order-disorder {{transition}} (ODT) and viscoelastic properties were studied for linear (AB) n multiblock copolymers. A series of symmetric poly(styrene-b-isoprene) n multiblocks ((SI) n, n) 1 - 10) were synthesized by anionic polymerization, and their order-disorder transition temperatures (TODT) were located using dynamic mechanical spectroscopy. As n increases, TODT approaches an asymptotic value, consistent with random phase approximation calculations. A systematic difference between the experimental and theoretical results is attributable {{to the effects of}} fluctuations, independent of the number of blocks. Addition of up to 20 vol % of a nonselective solvent depresses TODT, independent of n. The interaction parameter at the transition, łODT, decreases with polymer volume fraction as łODT - 1. 3, consistent with previous reports for diblocks (n) 1). In contrast, the viscoelasticity of (AB) n block copolymers depends strongly on block number. A crossover frequency, öx, demarcating the transition from block/chain- and domain-dominated relaxation, scales as n- 7. 5, which is much stronger than the molecular weight dependence of the longest relaxation time for entangled homopolymers. Coherent lamellar grains were imaged for quenched and annealed (SI) n, n) 1, 6, and 10, by transmission electron microscopy. Ellipsoidal lamellar grains, with aspect ratios of 2 - 3, were recorded, independent of block number, but the grain size decreased with increasing n. These results establish the criteria for designing multiblock copolymers based on <b>ł,</b> <b>N,</b> <b>n,</b> and concentration...|$|E

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution Li-cense, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. In combinatorics, a Stirling number of the second kind,S n k {{is the number of}} ways to partition a set of n objects into k nonempty subsets. The empty subsets are also added in the models presented in the article in order to describe properly the absence of the corresponding type i of state in the system, i. e. when its “share ”. Accordingly, a new equation for partitions 0 ip,P N m type in a set of entities into both empty and nonempty subsets was derived. The indis-tinguishableness of particles (N identical atoms or molecules) makes only sense within a cluster (subset) with the size. The first-order phase transition is indeed the case of transitions, for example in the simplest interpretation, from completely liquid state to the completely crystalline state. These partitions are well distinguished from the physical point of view, so they are ‘typed ’ differently in the model. Fi-nally, the present developments in the physics of complex systems, in particular the structural relaxation of supercooled liquids and glasses, are discussed by using such stochastic cluster-based models. 0 in N 1 2, 0 <b>L</b> <b>n</b> <b>N</b> n 1 2 ty 0, n N peC...|$|E

40|$|QUOTA INTERNATIONAL SIXTH DISTRICT LEADERSHIP TRAINING THE A-B-C-'S OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE What is Parliamentary Procedure? It's a SET OF RULES for conduct at meetings, It allows EVERYONE to {{be heard}} and to make {{decisions}} without confusion! Why is Parliamentary Procedure IMPORTANT? Because it's a time-tested method of conducting business at meetings and public gatherings. It {{can be adapted to}} fit the needs of any organization. So it's important that everyone know these BASIC RULES! How do members get their say? They make motions! A motion is a proposal that the assembly take a stand or take action on some issues. Members can: Present motions (make a proposal) Second motions (express support for discussion of another member's motion) Debate motions (give opinions on the motion) Vote on motions (make a decision) There are 4 general types of motions 1. Main Motions Introduce subjects to the assembly for its consideration. They cannot be made when another motion is before the assembly they yield to privileged, subsidiary and incidental motions. (example" I move that we") 2. Subsidiary Motions Change or affect how the main motion is handled. (they are voted on before the main motion.) (example "I move the question before the assembly be amended by striking out [...] ") 3. Privileged Motions are most urgent. They concern special or important matters not related to pending business. (example " 1 move we adjourn. ") 4. Incidental Motions are questions of procedure that arise out ofother motions. They must be considered before the other motion. (example "I move to suspend the rules for the purpose of. ") How do we present a motion? 1. Obtain the floor 2. Make your motion 3. Wait for a second 4. Chair states your motion 5. Expand on your motion • 6. Putting the Question The method of Voting on a Motion depends on the situation and on the laws ofyour organization. 1. By voice aye (in favor) no (opposed) 2. By show ofhands members raise their hands for sight verification) 3. By roll call if a record is required ofeach person's vote each member answers "yes" or "no" 4. By ballot Members write their vote on a slip ofpaper This done when secrecy is desired. 5 By general consent More about Voting "Are we ready for the question? A question (motion) is pending when it has been state by the chair but not yet voted on. The last motion stated by the chair is the first pending. The MAIN MOTION is always the last voted on. • A Motion to table (lay on the table) This motion is used to lay something aside temporarily to take care ofa more urgent matter. There is always the option to "take from the table" any motion for reconsideration by the assembly A Motion to postpone indefinitely This is parliamentary strategy -it allows members to dispose ofa motion without making a decision for or against. It is useful in case of a badly chosen main motion for which either a "yes' or "no" would have undesirable consequences.
