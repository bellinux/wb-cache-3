5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|In the Vedic-era literature, {{only three}} ashramas (life stages) were mentioned, with Brahmacharya (student) {{as the first}} stage and the Grihastha (householder) as the second stage. The third stage of life, in the Vedic texts, {{combined}} Vanaprastha (retired or forest dweller) and Sannyasa (renunciation) as one ashrama. According to Soti Shivendra Chandra, a scholar at the Rohilkhand University, the separation of Vanaprastha and Sannyasa as two different stages of life is first mentioned in the Jabala Upanishad. However, Patrick Olivelle, {{a professor at the}} University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: how <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> {{it that a}} plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{a large number of}} new {{pipelines}} proposed for Alberta. These will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> approved rapidly by the Alberta Energy Regulator, so there <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> few capacity problems within Alberta.|$|R
25|$|Compared with GABAA, GABAC receptors have {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for GABA, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> longer-lasting in activity, and their responses <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> generated by lower GABA concentrations.|$|R

5|$|The gilded {{monogram}} initials on the Library punchbowl {{are perhaps}} the only current clue as to the original commissioner of the punchbowls. The initials are difficult to decipher because of partial loss of the gilt Copperplate script. Possibilities include HCA or HA, TCA or FCA over B. Several candidates have been suggested including Henry, 3rd Earl of Bathurst, and Sir Thomas Brisbane, New South Wales Governor in 1821–1825 after Lachlan Macquarie, but the most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> Henry Colden Antill (1779–1852). Antill was appointed aide-de-camp to the fifth New South Wales Governor, Macquarie who was in office 1810–1821, on his arrival in Sydney on 1January 1810. He was promoted to Major of Brigade in 1811 and retired from the British Army in 1821. Antill settled on land first at Moorebank near Liverpool and then in 1825 on his estate near Picton—named Jarvisfield in honour of Macquarie's first wife, Jane Jarvis. He was buried at Jarvisfield on 14August 1851. Antill had subdivided part of the estate in 1844, making possible {{the founding of the}} town of Picton. When the State Library acquired its punchbowl in 1926, the Antill family of Picton — Henry's antecedents — had no knowledge of the punchbowl's provenance.|$|E
5|$|The thistle {{has been}} one of the {{national}} emblem of the Scots nation since the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470. Today, it forms part of the emblem of the Scottish Rugby Union. As legend has it, an invading army had attempted to sneak up at night on the Scots. One, perhaps barefooted, unwelcome foreign soldier stumbled upon a Scots Thistle, and cried out in pain, thus alerting Scots to their presence. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of the Viking monarch Haakon IV of Norway, who had harried the coast for some years. Spiky plants such as brambles appear to have been used around forts since time immemorial, so the story, whether it factually relates to the Haakon episode or not, <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> the culmination of more than one such event over time. In some variants, it is invading English which stumble on a thistle, but the story predates this time.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 review {{stated that}} {{childhood}} obesity <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> {{the result of}} the interaction of natural selection favouring those with more parsimonious energy metabolism and today's consumerist society with easy access to energy dense cheap foods and less energy requirements in daily life.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for Burley's account, and more <b>likely,</b> <b>is</b> that the boat they found was from the H Fölsch & Co, Hamburg's 899 ton barque Iquique. She went missing after being spoken with at Cape Horn on 1 June 1883. There were 30 crew on board.|$|E
25|$|Several reviewers have {{suggested}} the show took {{inspiration from the}} formula established by Providence. Reviewers also cite the relationship between Brenneman and Daly's characters as the selling point of the show. Also <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> the physical similarities at the time between Brenneman and the lead actress in Providence, Melina Kanakaredes.|$|E
25|$|The {{generic name}} Mammomonogamus {{is derived from}} the Latin root mammo- (breast) and the Greek roots mono (single) and gamus (marriage), which most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> {{referring}} to the distinct characteristic of the male and female worm acting as a single unit through the male being joined in permanent copulation to the middle portion of the female’s body.|$|E

25|$|In various accounts, {{some doctors}} thought the rash resembled {{the pattern of}} fur on a wolf's face. More <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> that it {{is derived from the}} {{similarity}} in distribution to lupus vulgaris or chronic facial tuberculosis where the lesions are ragged and punched out and are said to resemble the bite of a wolf.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjective}} {{burden is}} an important factor that influences the passing into the nursing home (institutionalization). Particularly the care of people with dementia is associated with challenging behavior and caregiver burden. Both increases the likelihood of institutionalization. In the care of people with dementia, there is consistent evidence: The higher the caregiver burden, the more <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> the institutionalization.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} types of pulsar planets known so far. The PSR B1257+12 planets were formed out of the debris of a {{destroyed}} companion star that used to orbit the pulsar. In PSR J1719-1438, the planet most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> the companion, or what's left of it after being almost entirely blasted away by the extreme irradiation from the nearby pulsar. PSR B1620-26 b is most likely a captured planet.|$|E

5000|$|This field {{identifies}} the receiver's port and is required. Similar to source port number, if {{the client is}} the destination host then the port number will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> an ephemeral port number and if the destination host is the server then the port number will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> a well-known port number.|$|R
25|$|Uniparental disomy {{denotes the}} {{situation}} where both chromosomes of a chromosome pair are inherited from the same parent and are therefore identical. This phenomenon most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> {{the result of a}} pregnancy that started as a trisomy due to nondisjunction. Since most trisomies are lethal, the fetus only survives because it loses one of the three chromosomes and becomes disomic. Uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 is, for example, seen in some cases of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, after {{reviewing}} the research data of the study Total Platinum Concentration and Platinum Oxidation States in Body Fluids, Tissue, and Explants from Women Exposed to Silicone and Saline Breast Implants by IC-ICPMS, and other pertinent literature, the U.S. FDA reported that the data {{do not support the}} findings presented; that the platinum used, in new-model breast-implant devices, <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> not ionized, and therefore is not a significant risk {{to the health of the}} women.|$|E
25|$|The source {{models can}} be either over-determined or under-determined. An over-determined model may consist of a few {{point-like}} sources ("equivalent dipoles"), whose locations are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models {{may be used in}} cases where many different distributed areas are activated ("distributed source solutions"): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> selected. Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator.|$|E

25|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Milky Way experiences roughly 30 to 60 novae per year, but a recent examination has found the likely improved rate of about 50±27. The number of novae discovered in the Milky Way each year is much lower, about 10, which <b>likely,</b> <b>is</b> explained by gas and dust absorption by the Milky Way, that is obscuring distant novae. Roughly 25 novae brighter than about the twentieth magnitude are discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy each year and smaller numbers are seen in other nearby galaxies.|$|E
25|$|The chital was {{the first}} species of deer {{introduced}} into Australia in the early 1800s by Dr. John Harris, surgeon to the New South Wales Corps, and he had about 400 of these animals on his property by 1813. These did not survive and the primary range of the chital is now confined to a few cattle stations in North Queensland near Charters Towers and several feral herds on the NSW north coast. While some of the stock originated from Sri Lanka (Ceylon), the Indian race <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> also represented.|$|E
25|$|The {{size and}} shape of a large cotton reel, these little sweet, spiced mutton pies are a golden brown, crispy pastry with a moist, sweet inside. They can be eaten as an hors d'oeuvre, with a salad or as a dessert. They are cooked in {{patisseries}} all over the town, but their origin is far from local. Tradition has it that Lord Clive brought the recipe from India and taught it to the pastry makers of Pézenas when he was staying at the Château de Larzac in 1768. It is more <b>likely</b> <b>is</b> that his servants were responsible.|$|E
