5000|$|Much {{like the}} oral cavity, {{the upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> possess {{mechanical}} deterrents to remove microbes. Goblet cells produce mucous which traps microbes and moves {{them out of the}} respiratory system via continuously moving ciliated epithelial cells. In addition, a bactericidal effect is generated by nasal mucus which contains the enzyme lysozyme. The upper and lower respiratory tract appears to have its own set of microbiota. Pulmonary bacterial microbiota belong to 9 major bacterial genera: Prevotella, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera, Veillonella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. Some of the bacteria considered [...] "normal biota" [...] in the respiratory tract can cause serious disease especially in immunocompromised individuals; these include Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Staphylococcus aureus.

To address this issue, we have generated TRAF 4 -deficient mice. Despite widespread expression of TRAF 4 in the developing embryo, {{as well as in the}} adult, lack of TRAF 4 expression results in a localized, developmental defect of the upper respiratory tract. TRAF 4 -deficient mice are born with a constricted upper trachea at the site of the tracheal junction with the larynx. This narrowing of the proximal end of the trachea results in respiratory air flow abnormalities and increases rates of pulmonary inflammation.

40|$|Undisturbed nasal {{breathing}} {{is essential for}} normal breathing physiology as a whole. Nasal septal deformities (NSD) are well known as a factor which can remarkably and substantially {{affect the quality of}} nasal and pulmonary breathing. However, {{it is well known that}} type 5 and type 6 nasal septal deformities may cause only a moderate, unilateral nasal obstruction or none at all. The effects of nasal obstruction on the <b>respiratory</b> and cardiovascular <b>systems</b> have been well studied so far: right ventricle problems, ischemic heart diseases, sleep disorders, mucociliary clearance system disturbances, paranasal sinus pathology, have all been described as a result of impaired nasal breathing. The connection between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>systems</b> has been recognized in allergic rhinitis and asthma as well, resulting in the united airways concept. Most recently, the ostensible connection between chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and acute myocardial infarction has been said to be proven. However, the results of this study might have not been well founded since there are no direct and clear proofs that CRS as a chronic inflammatory process has anything to do with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). On the other hand, a large international study on the incidence of NSD in CRS patients, based on the Mladina classification, showed that NSD were present in a high incidence and that the most frequent deformities were types 5 (36. 18 %) and 7 (29. 92 %). The vast majority of those types 7 consisted of types 3 and (again) types 5 or types 6 (76. 32 %). The fact that in CRS patients a remarkably high incidence of type 5 septal deformity can be seen, gives rise to thinking that this factor perhaps plays a role in the onset of ACS. Acute coronary syndrome is one of the leading causes of death all over the world. Traditional risk factors such as family history, overweight body, smoking, stress, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery calcium score, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein, homocysteine, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2, as well as high-density lipoprotein functionality perhaps cannot account for the entire risk for incident coronary events. Several other potential risk factors have been identified in an effort to improve risk assessment for ACS.

However, whether HRV is causally related to the development of wheezing or HRV-associated wheeze is merely an indicator of disease susceptibility is unclear. Our aim was to study the role of HRV during infancy in the development of <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> disease during infancy and childhood. METHODS: In a population-based birth cohort, during the 1 st year of life, nose and throat swabs were collected on a monthly basis, regardless of any symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect an extensive panel of respiratory pathogens. Lung function was measured before 2 months of age. Information on respiratory symptoms was collected by daily questionnaires and electronic patient files. RESULTS: 1425 samples were collected in 140 infants. Both the presence of (single or multiple) pathogens (HRV equal to other pathogens) and increased <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> resistance were significantly associated with <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> symptoms during infancy. HRV presence during infancy was not associated with the risk of wheezing at age 4, but every HRV episode with wheezing increased the risk of wheezing at age 4 (odds ratio 1. 9, 1. 1 - 3. 5). This association weakened after adjustment for lung function (odds ratio 1. 4, 0. 7 - 2. 9). CONCLUSIONS: HRV and other viruses are associated with <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> symptoms during infancy, as well as a high presymptomatic <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> resistance.

Statistical control for maternal age, education, family size, and family living standards showed that the relationship between maternal smoking and rates of <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> illness was not significantly influenced by these factors...|$|R
40|$|Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) {{has been}} found to be {{integrated}} monoclonally in a rare skin cancer named Merkel cell carcinoma. More recently, MCPyV has been detected in the upper respiratory tract of pediatric and adult patients. However, the mode of transmission and pathogenic role of MCPyV in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> has not been determined. In this study, MCPyV was sought in the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract of adult patients admitted to the hospital. MCPyV DNA was detected in 15 (17. 24 %) out of 87 <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract samples. Most of the patients with MCPyV were over 50 years old. Nucleotide sequence of the t-antigen of MCPyV identified in respiratory secretions showed a homology to those found in Merkel cell carcinoma. In addition, phylogenetic analysis undertaken on the t-antigen sequences of Italian isolates and other MCPyVs identified in healthy and cancer tissues showed that all these isolates belonged to the same clade. Selective pressure analysis for the t-antigen revealed the presence of five sites under positive selection (omega = 4. 3), with a posterior probabilities above 0. 99. The alpha parameter of the gamma distribution was 0. 01, showing that this distribution has a characteristic L-shape and suggesting a strong nucleotide substitution rate heterogeneity across sites. This study shows that MCPyV can infect the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract, but further investigations are needed to define its pathogenic role in respiratory diseases. J. Med.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} predictors of childhood <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract illness in two generations, and predictors of adult <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> disorders in the first generation. DESIGN [...] Data on respiratory health and environmental factors from a national birth cohort study were examined from birth to 36 years. Data were also collected on {{the parents of the}} subjects and on the subjects' first born offspring from birth to eight years. Main outcome measures were: reports of <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract illness before 2 years; <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract illness of a week or more between age 20 and 36 years; regular phlegm production at 25 and 36 years; reports of wheeze or asthma at age 36 years; peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at age 36 years measured by nurses during home visits; and mothers' reports of <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> illness in first born offspring before 2 years. SUBJECTS [...] Subjects were a sample of 5362 single, legitimate births taken from all those occurring in England, Wales, and Scotland in one week in 1946, and studied regularly from birth to age 43 years. Data on the subjects' parents and on their 1676 first offspring born while they were aged 19 - 25 years were also collected. MAIN RESULTS [...] <b>Lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract illness before 2 years fell from 25 % in the population born in 1946 to 13 % in their first born offspring. In those born in 1946, poor home environment, parental bronchitis, and atmospheric pollution were the best predictors of <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> illness before 2 years, and these three factors and childhood <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> illness and later smoking were the best predictors of adult <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract problems. Risk factors for <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> illness in the offspring were manual social class, parental and grandparental <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> disease, and parental smoking. CONCLUSIONS [...] Risks for adult <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> problems accumulated in childhood through illness, poor social circumstances, and atmospheric pollution. Smoking exacerbated early life risks and was an independent risk factor. In the offspring generation, parental smoking was a risk factor for early life chest illness, together with parental illness and low social class. Reduction of prevalence in the offspring generation was probably accounted for by improvement in home circumstances, reduced atmospheric pollution, and lower rates of parental <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> illness, but current rates of smoking seem likely to prevent much further reduction in early life <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> illness, and thus in this aspect of risk for subsequent adult <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> problems. The accumulation of risk in childhood and adolescence for later adult problems implies a long time scale for the reduction of adult <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> disorders...|$|R
