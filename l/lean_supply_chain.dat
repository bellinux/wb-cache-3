The global market is putting the shipping industry under strong pressure as new trends in logistics seek new opportunities to cut unnecessary costs and players in the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management and in the intermodal transport. For this reason we performed a research on how the intermodal transport can secure efficient transport operations. The emphasis is mainly on setting up the agile port and intermodal transport model, in which all necessary subjects should be involved in a unique <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Thus we analyzed port operators, shipping lines and inland transport operators and the way they eliminate waste processes in their everyday operation procedure. Considering all important dynamic facts in the container and shipping industry and our analyses of the intermodal service through the port of Koper we propose the agile port and inland operations model suitable to improve intermodal service and to secure <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> for containerized cargo. Consequently, we {{came to the conclusion that}} some traditional subjects in the traditional <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> are not needed; while others, like customs authorities and inspection companies should be involved adequately to secure efficient organization of agile services in the ports, on the borders between different countries and at final destinations.

5000|$|Supply {{chains are}} central to the {{creation}} of fast fashion. Supply chain systems are designed to add value and reduce cost in the process of moving goods from design concept to retail stores and finally through to consumption. Efficient supply chains are critical to delivering the retail customer promise of fast fashion. The selection of a merchandising vendor is a key part in the process. Inefficiency primarily occurs when suppliers can't respond quickly enough, and clothing ends up bottlenecked and in back stock. [...] Two kinds of supply chains exist, agile and lean. In an agile supply chain the principal characteristics include the sharing of information and technology. [...] The collaboration results in the reduction in the amount of stock in the megastores. A <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> is characterized as the correct appropriation of the commodity for the product. [...] The combination of the two supply chains is called [...] "leagile".|$|E

If at the past the competition is between the company and its competitor, however this paradigm is now changing. The competition is now longer between the company and its competitor but the competition is between a company's supply chain and its competitor's supply chain. Managing a supply chain require the knowledge of what key success variables for the implementation of supply chain strategy. One of supply chain strategy is <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> strategy. The lean strategy concept matches with the company that has characteristics such as producing with high volume but less variety of products. CV.

Recently, the concept of leagility has been introduced. Research on leagility, defined as the capability of concurrently deploying the lean and agile paradigms, hinges heavily on the identification of the decoupling point, which, in turn, is enabled by postponement. Postponement strategies, however, present a cross-functional challenge for implementation. As a tactical solution to achieve leagility without postponement, we introduce transshipments, which represent a common practice in multi-location inventory systems involving monitored movement of stock between locations at the same echelon level of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Through a series of models, we establish how transshipments can be used to enhance both agility and leanness...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> with cost {{optimized}} {{production and}} logistics {{processes in the}} automotive industry have become a benchmark for other industries. Short delivery times, low inventories and high availability are parameters which assume a robust <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> In industrial practice we see, however, that in the After Sales business particularly related to the supply of automotive spare parts, that there are always unforeseen delays in delivery. In order to avoid service level losses on the focal firm level due to missing parts {{it is necessary to}} understand the risk structure on the supplier side. For this reason, a risk model for the After Sales inbound SC is developed through this work. Based on an extensive analysis of delivery data a central risk size was derived. Comprehensively researched SC risks are supplemented by After Sales specific risks derived through an empirical supplier survey. A reference network, which is methodologically based on the Bayesian theorem, to control the dynamic relationships was developed. The developed risk model allows for the identification of proactive and reactive measures by top-down and bottom-up analyzes to make <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> for after sales requirements in the best cases robust and resilient. A big advantage of the developed model is not only the ability to quantify the cause and effect of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risks but also to describe the constantly changing risk environment of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> through continuous belief updates within the model. The risk analysis in the developed model potentially reduces the delivery delay of spare parts by 65 percent and diminishes the buffer stock value by 50 percent. To achieve such improvements in the real world organizations must be able to implement measures in explicit SC risk clusters for sustainable <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> performance and inventory management. Improvements in the internal supplier processes, due to risks like prioritized series supply, or inappropriate after sales supply strategies are necessary. Utilizing the developed After Sales Risk Management Model (ASRIM) organizations will be able to implement proactive risk mitigation strategies, facilitating agile SC performance, while simultaneously reducing buffer stocks...|$|R

40|$|For as long {{as there}} have been <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> there have been disruptions, and no <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> {{logistics}} system, or infrastructure network is immune to them. Nevertheless, supply-chain disruptions have only recently begun to receive significant attention from practitioners and researchers. One reason for this growing interest is the spate of recent high-profile disruptions, such as September 11, the West Coast port lockout of 2002, and hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Another reason is the focus in recent decades on the philosophy of “lean ” <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> which calls for slimmed-down systems with little redundancy or slack. Although <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> are efficient when the environment behaves as predicted, they are extremely fragile, and disruptions can leave them virtually paralyzed. Evidently, there is some value to having slack in a system. A third reason for the growing attention paid to disruptions is that firms are much less vertically integrated {{than they were in the}} past, and their <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> are increasingly global.

It will be useful to look at <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> from the perspective of fashion retailers, as this type of research provides a fundamental framework for fashion retailers in order to adapt lean methods to more efficiently manage their supply chains. As a multi-brand fashion retailer, the case company do not do production of products by themselves and do not own any fashion brands either. The company is only focusing on their retailing operation.

This thesis analyzes and discusses how implementing lean design and <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management affect an organization’s innovation capabilities. Since lean concepts focus on low risk, short-term gradual improvement of existing processes and products {{with an emphasis}} on eliminating any and all wastes in the system, applying lean to an organization often implies difficulties in promoting innovations that involve high risks and dramatic changes. Little is known about how lean design and <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management concepts might affect an organization’s innovation capability and its responsiveness to react quickly to changes brought by radical innovations. These relationships were investigated and analyzed based on findings from two online surveys. Seventy-six and seventy-seven respondents were acquired from the two surveys, respectively. Results suggest that the stressed importance of standardization in lean design has a negative effect on an organization’s radical and architectural innovation capability. It is also shown that disruptive innovation capability will be negatively influenced by value analysis in lean design, especially in terms of how an organization ranks product attributes and allocates resources based on customer requirements. For the impact on an organization’s responsiveness to radical innovations, the findings suggest no impact from minimizing buffers in a <b>lean</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> but a positive impact from increasing supplier commitment and involvement levels...|$|E

This tool differs from supplier lean assessment tools used by many aerospace companies, which focus on an assessment of the internal lean and six-sigma capabilities of individual supplier companies, such as the extent to which they have implemented basic lean manufacturing practices. Such tools take many forms, ranging from simple diagnostic instruments to detailed assessment tools. They are often used by primes and major suppliers as part of their supplier development process.
