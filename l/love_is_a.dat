5|$|Palencia-Roth {{notes that}} critics {{have been struck}} by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; its dark mood and somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. <b>Love</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} Visions de l'Amen, Messiaen {{composed}} the song cycle Harawi, {{the first of}} three works inspired by the legend of Tristan and Isolde. The second of these works about human (as opposed to divine) love {{was the result of a}} commission from Serge Koussevitzky. Messiaen stated that the commission did not specify the length of the work or the size of the orchestra. This was the ten-movement Turangalîla-Symphonie. It is not a conventional symphony, but rather an extended meditation on the joy of human union and love. It does not contain the sexual guilt inherent in Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde because Messiaen believed that sexual <b>love</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> divine gift. The third piece inspired by the Tristan myth was Cinq rechants for twelve unaccompanied singers, described by Messiaen as influenced by the alba of the troubadours. Messiaen visited the United States in 1949, where his music was conducted by Koussevitsky and Leopold Stokowski. His Turangalîla-Symphonie was first performed in the US in 1949, conducted by Leonard Bernstein.|$|E
