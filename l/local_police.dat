5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital.

Some of these Republican witnesses were arrested by <b>local</b> <b>police,</b> who were mostly Goebel partisans.
