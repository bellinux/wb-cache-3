5|$|Grace Sherwood's {{case was}} <b>little</b> <b>known</b> until Virginia Beach {{historian}} and author Louisa Venable Kyle wrote a children's book {{about her in}} 1973. Called The Witch of Pungo, it {{is a collection of}} seven local folk tales written as fiction, although based on historical events. Sherwood's story was adapted for Cry Witch, a courtroom drama at Colonial Williamsburg, the restored early capital of Virginia.|$|E

His absence at sea, and on travels and duty with his regiment, {{kept him out}} of the general eye... at times, there was a sallowness of hue, which much increased the grave aspect... not only in the metropolis, but throughout the country, somehow, it was always said, 'He will never come to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Ali was {{strongly}} influenced by Elmo Hope, and his playing was rapid and intense, retaining a sense of rhythm even when his style became increasingly unconventional. Several recordings of his playing may exist, but only one – The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan – has been released. Ibn Ali built a reputation in Philadelphia, where he influenced musicians including John Coltrane, but he remained <b>little</b> <b>known</b> elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Mikhail Vorontsov was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Novorossiya in May 1823. Even before their arrival in Odessa, the Vorontsovs started buying up {{lands in the}} southwest of Crimea, which was sparsely populated and <b>little</b> <b>known</b> at the time. Alupka was bought in 1824 from colonel , the owner of Livadia and Oreanda. By that time, the Vorontsovs also had property in Gurzuf, Massandra, Ai-Danil, and Cape Martian.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding Aaronson's small readership, V. Gollancz {{published}} a second verse collection in 1933, titled Poems. Despite being <b>little</b> <b>known</b> {{to the general}} public, Aaronson gained a cult following of dedicated readers. His third collection, The Homeward Journey and Other Poems, was published in 1946 by Christophers, a small London publisher. Some of his works also appeared in journals and anthologies such as the 1953 Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse.|$|E
5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are <b>little</b> <b>known.</b> This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E

5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} never {{fared well}} in captivity. The oldest {{lived to be}} 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. No records are known of a captive rhino giving birth. The last captive Javan rhino died at the Adelaide Zoo in Australia in 1907, where the species was so <b>little</b> <b>known</b> {{that it had been}} exhibited as an Indian rhinoceros.|$|E
5|$|The {{botanist}} Alex George {{first described}} this species in 1996, naming it Dryandra acanthopoda. It was renamed {{to its current}} name in 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to the genus Banksia. It is <b>little</b> <b>known</b> in cultivation and its sensitivity to dieback is unclear (although highly likely).|$|E
5|$|Though <b>little</b> <b>known</b> at the time, Charles Ives's {{work of the}} 1910s {{established}} him as {{the first}} major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from those}} few {{individuals}} kept in zoos and pictured in books, the Sumatran rhinoceros has remained <b>little</b> <b>known,</b> {{overshadowed by the}} more common Indian, black and white rhinos. Recently, however, video footage of the Sumatran rhinoceros in its native habitat and in breeding centers has been featured in several nature documentaries. Extensive footage {{can be found in}} an Asia Geographic documentary The Littlest Rhino. Natural History New Zealand showed footage of a Sumatran rhino, shot by freelance Indonesian-based cameraman Alain Compost, in the 2001 documentary The Forgotten Rhino, which featured mainly Javan and Indian rhinos.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda is <b>little</b> <b>known</b> in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other species}} in genus Scytalopus, the Perijá tapaculo is secretive and {{therefore}} difficult to observe. The call and song {{differ from those}} of most other species in the genus, and the latter is composed of two short churrs repeating up to 65 times at 0.5 to 3second intervals. The diet of the species is <b>little</b> <b>known,</b> but studies of the stomach contents of seven specimens suggested that they fed exclusively on insects.|$|E

5|$|More {{recordings}} {{as leader}} ensued following Hope's return to New York, {{but they did}} little to gain him more public or critical attention. Further drug and health problems reduced the frequency of his public performances, which ended a year before his death, {{at the age of}} 43. He remains <b>little</b> <b>known,</b> despite, or because of, the individuality of his playing and composing, which were complex and stressed subtlety and variation rather than the virtuosity predominant in bebop.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Rep. William C. Kortz {{and retired}} {{manufacturer}} Joseph Vodvarka also {{ran in the}} Democratic primary, but neither remained {{for the duration of}} the race. Kortz, who was <b>little</b> <b>known</b> outside the western Pennsylvania area, dropped out of the race on January 14, 2010 after raising only $20,000 of the $2 million he sought to raise for his campaign. Vodvarka, an Allegheny County man who had been mostly overlooked throughout the race, was formally removed from the ballot in mid-April 2010 after it was revealed he failed to garner the minimum amount of signatures for a nominating petition.|$|E
5|$|The French Spaniel was <b>little</b> <b>known</b> outside France and {{neighboring}} countries {{until it was}} introduced in the Canadian province of Quebec in the 1970s. It quickly became a popular dog for hunting woodcock and grouse. The Club de l'Épagneul Français du Canada was formed in 1978 to ensure the French Spaniel would continue to meet breed standards and to pursue official recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club, by which the breed was recognised in 1985.|$|E

5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{attracted}} many reviews, {{with interest}} from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially {{the division of}} fauna and flora along what soon {{became known as the}} Wallace line, natural selection and uniformitarianism. Nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting and comprehensive account of the geography, natural history, and peoples of the archipelago, which was <b>little</b> <b>known</b> to their readers at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and as a piece of literature.|$|E
5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are <b>little</b> <b>known,</b> {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, <b>little</b> <b>known</b> in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
