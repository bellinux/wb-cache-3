50|$|The {{points on}} a compass rose were {{frequently}} labeled by the initial {{letters of the}} mariner's principal winds (T, G, L, S, O, <b>L,</b> <b>P,</b> <b>M).</b> However, from the outset, the custom also began to distinguish the north from the other points by a specific visual marker. Medieval Italian cartographers typically used a simple arrowhead or circumflex-hatted T (an allusion to the compass needle) to designate the north, while the Majorcan cartographic school typically used a stylized Pole Star for its north mark. The use of the fleur-de-lis as north mark was introduced by Pedro Reinel, and quickly became customary in compass roses (and is still often used today). Old compass roses also often used a Christian cross at Levante (E), indicating the direction of Jerusalem {{from the point of}} view of the Mediterranean sea.|$|E

Let 1 < p < ∞, z ∈ <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M)</b> sh and S be a real closed subspace of <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M)</b> sh. The metric projection Q: <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M)</b> sh − → S is defined for every z ∈ <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M)</b> sh as the unique operator Q(z) ∈ S such that ‖z −Q(z) ‖p = miny∈S ‖z −y‖p. We show the relation between metric projection and metric geometry of homogeneous spaces of the unitary group UM of M, endowed with a Finsler quotient metric induced by the p-norms of τ, ‖x‖p = τ(|x | p) 1 /p, p an even integer. The problem of finding minimal curves in such homogeneous spaces leads {{to the notion of}} uniformly bounded metric projection. Then we show examples of metric projections of this type. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let N and M be von Neumann algebras. It is {{proved that}} L p (N) does not Banach embed in <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M)</b> for N infinite, M finite, 1 ≤ p < 2. The {{following}} considerably stronger result is obtained (which implies this, since the Schatten p-class Cp embeds in L p (N) for N infinite). Theorem. Let 1 ≤ p < 2 and let X be a Banach {{space with a}} spanning set (xij) so that for some C ≥ 1, (i) any row or column is C-equivalent to the usual ℓ 2 -basis, (ii) (xi k,j k) is C-equivalent to the usual ℓ p-basis, for any i 1 < i 2 < · · · and j 1 < j 2 < · · ·. Then X is not isomorphic to a subspace of <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M),</b> for M finite. Complements on the Banach space structure of non-commutative L p-spaces are obtained, such as the p-Banach-Saks property and characterizations of subspaces of <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M)</b> containing ℓ p isomorphically. The spaces L p (N) are classified up to Banach isomorphism, for N infinite-dimensional, hyperfinite and semifinite, 1 ≤ p < ∞, p ̸ = 2. It is proved that there are exactly thirteen isomorphism types; the corresponding embedding properties are determined for p < 2 via an eight level Hasse diagram. It is also proved for all 1 ≤ p < ∞ that L p (N) is completely isomorphic to <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M)</b> if N and M are the algebras associated to free groups, or if N and M are injective factors of type IIIλ and III λ ′ for 0 < λ, λ ′ ≤ 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We prove some {{structure}} {{results for}} isometries between noncommutative L p spaces associated to von Neumann algebras. We find that an isometry T: <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M</b> 1) → <b>L</b> <b>p</b> (<b>M</b> 2) (1 ≤ p < ∞, p ̸ = 2) can be canonically {{expressed in a}} certain simple form whenever M 1 has variants of Watanabe’s extension property [W 2]. Conversely, this form always defines an isometry provided that M 1 is “approximately semifinite ” (defined below). Although neither of these properties is fully understood, we {{show that they are}} enjoyed by all semifinite algebras and hyperfinite algebras (with no summand of type I 2), plus others. Thus the classification is stronger than Yeadon’s theorem [Y 1] for semifinite algebras (and its recent improvement in [JRS]), and the proof uses independent techniques. Related to this, we examine the modular theory for positive projections from a von Neumann algebra onto a Jordan image of another von Neumann algebra, and use such projections to construct new L p isometries by interpolation. Some complementary results and questions are also presented. 1...|$|E
