50|$|The {{small town}} had only 124 plots for houses.

Regarding church and court of justice matters Haus Bürgel and Zons originally belonged together. The canon law for the parish Bürgel/Zons was governed by Brauweiler Abbey. Already in 1374 Bürgel was moved from the west banks to east banks of the Rhine, probably due to a shift of the river. Zons, the Rhine toll town of the Prince-elector of Cologne is {{regarded as one of}} the best preserved Lower <b>Rhine</b> <b>planned</b> towns of the Late Middle Ages. Until 1794 the parish Zons belonged to the Electorate of Cologne and was bordered in the south by Dormagen, an enclave ruled by the Duchy of Jülich; in the south-west by Hackenbroich, a lordship within the Electorate of Cologne; in the west by Nievenheim, a parish within the Electorate of Cologne; in the north-west by Uedesheim, another lordship within the Electorate of Cologne.

50|$|Seven Days to the River Rhine was a {{top secret}} {{military}} simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact. It started {{with the assumption that}} NATO would launch a nuclear attack on the Vistula river valley in a first-strike scenario, which would result in as many as two million Polish civilian casualties. In response, a Soviet counter-strike would be carried out against West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, with Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany and aiming to stop at the River Rhine by the seventh day. Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine. Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their own subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish forces were only expected to go as far as Germany. The Seven Days to the <b>Rhine</b> <b>plan</b> envisioned that Poland and Germany would be largely destroyed by nuclear exchanges, and that large numbers of troops would die of radiation sickness. It was estimated that NATO would fire nuclear weapons behind the advancing Soviet lines to cut off their supply lines and thus blunt their advance. While this plan assumed that NATO would use nuclear weapons to push back any Warsaw Pact invasion, it did not include nuclear strikes on France or the United Kingdom. Newspapers speculated when this plan was declassified, that France and the UK were not to be hit {{in an effort to get}} them to withhold use of their own nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|In 1817 and 1825, Bavaria and Baden signed {{treaties}} on the straightening of the <b>Rhine.</b> Initial <b>plans</b> {{were designed}} to move the river away from Speyer which led the city to lodge a protest with the Bavarian government in 1826. As a result, the characteristic bend of the Rhine at Speyer remained. But, in 1820, Speyer was unable to prevent that the redoubt on the Rhine opposite Mannheim {{could be used as}} a harbour which it feared would be to its disadvantage. This was to be the root of the city of Ludwigshafen.As of 1830, Speyer commissioned the upgrading of its own harbour at the mouth of the Speyerbach.|$|R

2500|$|The weak {{electorate}} of Brandenburg {{was especially}} {{torn apart by}} a quarrel between the Protestant and Catholic parties. The Brandenburg minister and diplomat Baron Samuel von Winterfeld influenced Gustavus Adolphus to support and protect the Protestant side in Germany. When Gustavus Adolphus began his push into northern Germany in June–July 1630, he had just 4,000 troops. He was soon able to consolidate the Protestant position in the north, however, using reinforcements from Sweden and money supplied by France at the Treaty of Bärwalde. After Swedish plundering in Brandenburg (1631) endangered the system of retrieving war contributions from occupied territories, [...] "marauding and plundering" [...] by Swedish soldiers was prohibited. Meanwhile, a Catholic army under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly was laying waste to Saxony. Gustavus Adolphus met Tilly's army and crushed it at the First Battle of Breitenfeld in September 1631.

Evidence for nemeta consists chiefly of inscriptions and place-names, which occur all across the Celtic world. Toponyms related to the word nemeton occur as far west as Galicia, Spain, as far north as Scotland, and as far east as central Turkey.

40|$|Climate change {{increases}} flood probabilities in the Rhine river basin, which complicates long-term {{flood management}} planning. This paper explores {{a method to}} evaluate the effectiveness of flood management measures for the river Rhine assuming a relatively extreme climate change scenario for the year 2050. Considered are planned measures described in the <b>Rhine</b> Action <b>Plan</b> on Floods (APF) and several additional measures, which include the restoration of abandoned meanders, a bypass around Cologne, the implementation of additional retention polders and land-use change to forest. The method includes resampling of meteorological data and a hydrological model to simulate long discharge series (10000 years), and can be considered as a process-based approach to estimate peak discharges of low-probability flood events. It is found that upstream flooding in Germany has a profound decreasing effect on the simulated peak water levels and discharges along the main Rhine branch and downstream in the Netherlands. Currently implemented and proposed measures in the APF, as well as most additional measures, seem inadequate to cope with the increased flood probabilities that are expected in the future climate change scenario. © The Authors.

5000|$|The Nemetes (Νεμῆται; Nemeter), {{by modern}} authors {{sometimes}} called Nemeti, were an ancient Germanic tribe <b>living</b> by the <b>Rhine</b> where Ariovistus had led them, the Suebi and other allied Germanic {{peoples in the}} second quarter of the 1st century BC. The Roman name for Speyer, Noviomagus Nemetum, reflects this city's status as the Nemetes' tribal capital. According to Tacitus, they were [...] "unquestionably Germanic". The name of the tribe, however, is Celtic as the name of its main town Noviomagus meaning noviios 'new' and magos 'plain', 'market' (cf. Old Irish mag 'plain'), as are those of a number of gods worshipped in their territory, including Nemetona, who is thought to have been their eponymous deity.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{long-term}} {{change in the}} Rhine river management from the 19 th century on. Since the Rhine {{is not only a}} German but also European river, this paper covers German policy on the Rhine as well as cooperation between European countries. This inquiry comes with two suggestions. First, the current river management is to remove all human intervention in nature as much as possible. The most representative one is the <b>Rhine</b> Action <b>Plan</b> which was introduced after the Sandoz catastrophe in 1986. RAP aimed not only at limiting the pollution of the Rhine, but also restoring the habitat surrounding it. This attitude toward the Rhine began to be applied to other European rivers as well. Second, the history of the Rhine river management can be characterized by the continuing tension between the Rhine as a production factor and the Rhine as part of nature, the living organism, contrary to the usual perception that the radical change in the environmental policy took place since the 1970 s. This essay tries to show how the small reformative steps, such as the German Water management law, took place and led to change in environmental policy. In German society, the environmental issue had a far broader foundation beyond the left parties, which enabled environmentalism to take root deeply in German society. ope...|$|R
