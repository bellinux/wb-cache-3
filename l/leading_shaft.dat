50|$|Although {{the origin}} of the cave is unknown, the story of the rediscovery is very well known. In August 1742 a workman dug a hole in the Butter Market to build {{footings}} for a new bench for the patrons and traders. He discovered a buried millstone and dug around it to remove it. He found a <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> down into the chalk.|$|R
50|$|The Qa'qaa Store {{was located}} at the {{southern}} end of the facility in underground bunkers. The bunker doors were sealed by IAEA officials upon being closed. Although the doors were sealed, the bunker itself was not hermetically sealed. Air ventilation <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> into the bunkers were not sealed. The high explosives subject to the controversy were the only materials under UN seal at Al Qa'qaa.|$|R
50|$|The pyramid {{stands on}} an {{artificial}} terrace cut from sloping ground.

A narrow passage and a shaft lead to a low point of about 45 metres underground.|$|R
50|$|Many county {{voters and}} landowners felt <b>shafted,</b> <b>leading</b> Ulster {{to refuse to}} pay despite a court order.

That was the beginning of what ultimately became the Catskill Park.|$|R

40|$|Monilethrix {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} of hair characterized by beaded appearance of the hair <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> to hair fragility and patchy dystrophic alopecia. In this disorder, the hair shaft has alternate widenings (nodes) and constrictions (internodes) that lead to fracture of hair shaft and varying degree of alopecia. We report an eight year old Kashmiri boy who presented with diffuse hair loss since infancy. As monilethrix is a rare disease entity which prompted us to report this case...|$|R
40|$|Components of a {{fuel pump}} of an {{aeroengine}} {{were sent to}} the laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed that the failure of the quill shaft took place by torsional overload. The seizure in the fuel pump led to excessive load on the quill <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> to failure. Analysis showed that the most probable reason for the seizure of the fuel pump is the ingression of foreign particles in the annular space between the driving gear and the front plate...|$|R
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open <b>leading</b> into the <b>shaft</b> where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, {{in particular the}} Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|R
500|$|When {{designing}} the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon {{the idea of}} flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water. Another set was designed at Cardington as an [...] "underground prison", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a [...] vertical <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the [...] "forbidding landscape added to the desolation".|$|R
50|$|Clamp-style shaft collars are {{designed}} {{to solve the problems}} associated with the set-screw collar. They come in one- and two-piece designs. Instead of protruding into the shaft, the screws act to compress the collar and lock it into place. The ease of use is maintained with this design and there is no shaft damage. Since the screws compress the collar, a uniform distribution of force is imposed on the <b>shaft,</b> <b>leading</b> to a holding power that is nearly twice that of set-screw collars.|$|R

5000|$|From 1964 to 1982, {{a tunnel}} existed under the Firth of Forth, dug by coal miners {{to link the}} Kinneil {{colliery}} {{on the south side}} of the Forth with the Valleyfield colliery on the north side. This is shown in the 1968 educational film [...] "Forth - Powerhouse for Industry". The <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> into the tunnel were filled and capped with concrete when the tunnel was closed, and it is believed to have filled with water or collapsed in places.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the site is ancient. Burial {{chambers}} dated to the Intermediate Bronze Age were discovered {{in the north of}} the modern day village, {{at the end of a}} <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> from a man-made cave carved into the northern slope of the chalk hill upon which Sheikh Dawud is situated. Potsherds dating to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods have also been collected at the site. An old quarry has been excavated, including a small area probably used as a winepress.|$|R
60|$|Soames always {{attended}} the General Meeting; {{it was considered}} better that he should do so, in case 'anything should arise!' He glanced round with his close, supercilious air at {{the walls of the}} room, where hung plans of the mine and harbour, together with a large photograph of a <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> to a working which had proved quite remarkably unprofitable. This photograph--a witness to the eternal irony underlying commercial enterprise--still retained its position on the--wall, an effigy of the directors' pet, but dead, lamb.|$|R
5000|$|When {{designing}} the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon {{the idea of}} flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water. Another set was designed at Cardington as an [...] "underground prison", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a 120 foot m vertical <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the [...] "forbidding landscape added to the desolation".|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, the Weeks Stevedoring Company {{ventured into}} a number of marine {{projects}} outside the field of stevedoring. The company performed salvage and dredging work, installed navigational aids for the United States Coast Guard, and even constructed a breakwater to protect the air <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel to Governors Island. They also became the prime contractor assigned to remove abandoned wooden vessels for the Army Corps of Engineers, work still contracted today. In 1958, Weeks purchased their first crane to be used exclusively outside the field of stevedoring, the Weeks #500.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{sepiolite}} {{of commerce}} is obtained chiefly from the plain of Eskişehir in Turkey, between Istanbul and Ankara. It occurs there in irregular nodular masses, in alluvial deposits, which are extensively worked for its extraction. It {{is said that}} in this district there are 4000 <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> to horizontal galleries for extraction of the sepiolite. The principal workings are at Sepetçi Ocağı and Kemikçi Ocağı, about 20 miles southeast of Eskişehir. The mineral is associated with magnesite (magnesium carbonate), the primitive source of both minerals being a serpentine.|$|R
5000|$|At King's Cross, {{as well as}} the {{mainline}} {{railway station}} above ground and subsurface platforms for the Metropolitan line, there are platforms deeper underground for the Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines. There were two separate escalator <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> down to the Victoria and Piccadilly lines; the Northern line was reached from the Piccadilly line. Stairs connected the Piccadilly and Victoria line platforms and from these there was a subway to platforms used by British Rail Midland City (later Thameslink) trains to [...] and an entrance in Pentonville Road.|$|R
50|$|The {{second level}} of {{underground}} (950 m, 3,200 m2, 13,000 m3) is 53 m under the courtyard. Four tunnels were bored {{into the base}} of the hill: 1. (85 m), 2. (42 m), 3. (88 m), 4. (70 m). The complex contains large tunnels (5 m high and 5.6 m wide) and four chambers. Seventy-five per cent is reinforced by concrete. There are two additional <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> to the surface, one with dimensions 3.5 m x 3.5 m (45 m) and one with diameter 0.5 m (40 m), presently used to supply electricity.|$|R
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|R
50|$|About {{the year}} 1920 during {{building}} excavation work, a whole underground maze of passageways some 1.8 m high with peaked ceilings, well preserved inside a cliff, was unearthed. The walls showed {{no trace of}} any work done with the customary striking tools, but rather they had been painstakingly hewn out of the stone with thrusting tools. Here and there, narrow <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> {{up to the surface}} had been bored, through which spoil might have been lifted in leather sacks. The apparent use of thrusting tools has given rise to the supposition that this maze of tunnels might have been the Romans’ work.|$|R
50|$|During initial {{development}} of the necropolis at Saqqara in the 2nd and 3rd Dynasties, the mastaba, a mud-brick and/or limestone superstructure built on the surface over a <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> to the actual burial chamber below ground, had an elaborate niched and fluted façade. This is called the palace serekh design. The 4th Dynasty simplified the mastaba so that those of Khufu's reign at Giza, {{as well as the}} 5th Dynasty monuments at Saqqara, have smooth sides; Niankhknum and Khnumhotep's beautifully restored structure encased in stone. The exterior has a batter angle like a fortress, the wall sloped back as it rises, except for the topmost course, which forms a vertical cornice.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{vehicles}} have a clutch and gearbox (or transmission) mounted {{directly on the}} engine, with a drive <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> to a final drive in the rear axle. When the vehicle is stationary, the drive shaft does not rotate. Some vehicles (generally sports cars, most commonly Alfa Romeos or Porsche 924s), seeking improved weight balance between front and rear, use a rear-mounted transaxle. This places the clutch and transmission {{at the rear of}} the car and the drive shaft between them and the engine. In this case the drive shaft rotates continuously with the engine, even when the car is stationary and out of gear.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of janders: one with a {{horizontal}} water wheel on a vertical axle, and the other with a vertical wheel on a horizontal axle. The horizontal janders are the older design. The force of the water would strike a simple paddle wheel set horizontally in line with the water. This then turned a runner stone balanced on the rynd atop a <b>shaft</b> <b>leading</b> directly up from the wheel. The bed stone does not turn. The problem with this type of mill was the lack of gearing. The speed of the water set the maximum speed of the runner stone which, in turn, set the rate of milling.|$|R
5000|$|The cams were {{operated}} by rotating <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> from the crankshaft {{at the back}} of the engine to the top of each cylinder row. The shaft was directly geared to one of the two camshafts, using another driven shaft to transmit power to the second camshaft on the [...] "other side" [...] of the cylinder heads. The arrangement was somewhat complex, but no more so than a pushrod-based system. A side-effect of the use of the overhead cams was that the cylinders were [...] "in-line", whereas radials typically rotated the second bank of cylinders in relation to the first in order to expose them more fully to the airflow for cooling.|$|R
25|$|As well as {{a source}} of galena, the mine near Port Gorey {{returned}} both lead and silver. Discovered by chance during a rabbit hunt in 1836, industry around this mine led to the construction of a small gauge railway and the installation of steam pumps. The mine is believed to have had a length of 2,000 feet/600m and depth of 700 feet/200m. Close to the port there were four <b>shafts</b> <b>leading</b> to the galleries. Sark's Hope shaft was the westernmost, almost {{on the edge of the}} cliff. To the East was Le Pelley shaft, excavated down to 90fathoms below sea level, then the Pump shaft and the easternmost shaft, the Prince's shaft.|$|R
