5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> in several ways. It {{is larger than}} the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture,</b> with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture.</b> Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture.</b> The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses as its bill is {{not strong enough to}} do this. Like other New World vultures, the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> flies solitarily, {{with wings}} {{held in a}} {{dihedral}} position. It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and perches on fence posts or on other low perches. When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the lesser yellow-headed {{is an example of}} static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird is believed to be somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives. The <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture,</b> like other New World vultures, has the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is basal (the {{earliest}} offshoot) to a lineage {{that gave rise}} to the turkey and greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vultures,</b> diverging around 12 million years ago.|$|R
5|$|The tail is rounded and {{relatively}} short for a vulture; {{the tip of}} the closed wing extends beyond the tail. Immature <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vultures</b> have browner plumage, a dusky head, and a white nape.|$|R
5|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vultures</b> do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, {{particularly}} around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|R
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{almost entirely}} on carrion. It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal, but is also known to hunt for food, especially small aquatic animals in marshes. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. The <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat {{is in a state of}} extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Although both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E
5|$|The front toes {{are long}} with small webs at their bases {{and are not}} adapted to grasping. The opening of the nostril is longitudinal, and the {{nostrils}} lack a septum. Like all New World vultures, the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> lacks a syrinx, and is therefore unable to make any sound other than a low hiss.|$|E
50|$|The {{turkey vulture}} forages by smell, an ability that is {{uncommon}} in the avian world, often flying {{low to the}} ground to pick up the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. The olfactory lobe of its brain, responsible for processing smells, is particularly large compared to that of other animals. This heightened ability to detect odors allows it to search for carrion below the forest canopy. King vultures, black vultures, and condors, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the turkey vulture to carcasses. The turkey vulture arrives first at the carcass, or with greater <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vultures</b> or <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vultures,</b> which also share the ability to smell carrion. It displaces the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vultures</b> from carcasses due to its larger size, but is displaced in turn by the king vulture and both types of condor, which make the first cut into the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller, weaker-billed turkey vulture access to food, because it cannot tear the tough hides of larger animals on its own. This is an example of mutual dependence between species.|$|R

5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the lesser yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar greater yellow-headed vulture in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow-headed vulture {{and has a}} shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed vulture's dark, glossy black plumage. Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow-headed vulture.

5|$|In natural settings, {{the black}} vulture eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey vulture, the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture,</b> and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The black vulture is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>vulture</b> (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (Coragyps atratus), king vultures (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
