5|$|The UAAI badge-engineered cars first {{introduced}} in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and Corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. The first generation Nova and the donor Corolla were produced at Holden's Dandenong, Victoria facility until 1994. UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned to selling only GM products. The Holden Astra and Vectra, both designed by Opel in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This {{came after the}} 1994 introduction of the Opel Corsa replacing the already available Suzuki Swift as the source for the Holden Barina. Sales of the full-size Holden Suburban SUV sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001. Also in 1998, <b>local</b> <b>assembly</b> of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia. These cars were exported to Japan and Southeast Asia with Opel badges. However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify <b>local</b> <b>assembly,</b> and reverted to being fully imported in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Local {{assemblies}} {{are organized}} into geographical regions. Regional leadership forums are representative bodies consisting of pastors and delegates from each <b>local</b> <b>assembly.</b> Every three years, each forum elects a regional committee from {{among its members}} and a regional leader from among its pastors.

Non-geographical regions, {{in the form of}} networks of local churches that share a peculiar ministry philosophy, also exist. These are normally led by the senior pastors of urban mega-churches, who network with a number of local assemblies nationwide that look to them for leadership and mentorship.|$|E
