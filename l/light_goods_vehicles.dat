40|$|AbstractThe paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> (LGV) fleet and its activity, with specific reference to operations in urban areas, and sustainability issues associated with the ever-growing use of LGVs. Traditionally these vehicles have received little attention but are becoming an ever-more important element of urban freight transport both for goods collection and delivery and for the provision {{of a wide range of}} critical services. Relevant literature from the UK and elsewhere pertaining to LGV operations and their impacts has been identified and utilised. The paper identifies the impacts of LGV operations in terms of economic, social and environmental impacts and presents the range of measures being taken by policy makers and companies to address negative impacts...|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{vehicles}} {{must pass}} the Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) scheme, a pre-registration inspection for cars and <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{that have not}} been type-approved to British or European standards. Since August 2001, there have been two levels of SVA, those being 'standard' and 'enhanced.' The standard SVA is applied vehicles such as left-hand drive vehicles, personally imported vehicles, amateur built vehicles and armoured vehicles, to name a few. Vehicles which do not fall into one of the standard SVA categories for example a vehicle of right-hand drive require enhanced SVA in addition to standard SVA inspections.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the heavy traffic at times, parking may be problematic. Due to high urban density, {{there are not many}} filling stations; Petrol in Hong Kong averages around US$2.04 per litre, of which over half the cost is taxes. It was suggested in the news that the government had deliberately impeded the use of new environmentally friendly diesel engines by allowing only <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> to be fuelled by diesel. While it cannot be determined why exactly the government does not allow private cars to be fuelled by diesel, it has been pointed out that the government does receive a tax that is 150% of the actual fuel cost. This is mostly to discourage car ownership for environmental reasons.|$|E

Shuttle services between the region's major towns and adjacent hamlets are also available via different types of vehicles, such as 4 wheel drives and <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> (LGV). As of May 2015, over 70,000 vehicles are registered with the Puntland Ministry of Works and Transport.Puntland is traversed by a 750 km north-south highway. It connects major cities {{in the northern part}} of Somalia, such as Garowe, Bosaso and Galkayo, with towns in the south. In 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority completed rehabilitation work on the central artery linking Garowe with Galkayo. The transportation body also started an upgrade and repair project in June 2012 on the large thoroughfare between the regional capital and Bosaso. Additionally, renovations began in October 2012 on the freeway linking Bosaso with Qardho. Plans are also in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main highway.Bosaso has a major seaport, which was constructed during the mid-1980s for annual livestock shipments to the Middle East. In January 2012, a renovation project was launched, with KMC contracted to upgrade the harbor. The initiative's first phase saw the clean-up of unwanted materials from the dockyard and was completed within the month. The second phase involves the reconstruction of the port's adjoining seabed, with the objective of accommodating larger ships. In 2012, a team of engineers was also enlisted by the Puntland authorities to assess the ongoing renovations taking place at the Las Khorey port. According to the Minister of Ports, Saeed Mohamed Ragge, the Puntland government intends to launch more such development projects in Las Khorey.|$|E

40|$|On 31 January 1983, {{it became}} {{compulsory}} for most drivers and front-seat passengers in vehicles with an unladen weight {{of less than}} 3 tons to wear seat-belts in the United Kingdom. This study was devised {{in order to provide}} definitive information on any changes in the injury patterns car and <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> occupants have suffered resulting from the law. Originally it was expected that this aim would be achieved by collecting data from hospitals for a year before and a year after the introduction of the law. However, it proved impossible to collect data uniformly through the hospital system on all fatally injured casualties, and, in consequence, a parallel study of injuries sustained by fatalities was undertaken using coroners' records. The methodology of the hospital and fatal studies were very similar, excepting that the latter covered only two corresponding 6 -month periods in 1982 and 1983...|$|R
30|$|Comparison of {{the traffic}} units of killed persons {{suggests}} that compared to Sweden, Finland has the highest potential for fatality reduction (64 fatalities yearly) for cars. Also, Finland has an overrepresentation of travellers in heavy goods vehicles (population risk 2.7 times that in Sweden) and <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> (population risk 2.0 times that in Sweden) and on mopeds and bicycles (population risk 1.8 times that in Sweden).|$|E

These results suggest that fatalities in counterpart units should also be considered when analysing the meaning of cars and especially heavy goods vehicles for road safety.|$|E

The data are derived from two main sources. The first source involves mass analysis of crashes involving LGVs recorded in the national British STATS 19 accident database for 1994 to 2000. The second source involves analysis from an in-depth study of LGV accidents in Britain since the late 1980 s. In total, in-depth data on almost 500 LGV crashes are considered. Three main issues are apparent. Firstly, there is an issue of crash compatibility between LGVs and passenger cars. The second issue involves restraint use among LGV occupants, since the in-depth data reveal that use is low compared with car occupants. The third issue is the implications of introducing a regulatory compliance crash test for LGVs...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 {{transport}} comprised 35. 5 {{per cent}} of total UK {{final energy consumption}} (by user). The breakdown of this demand by energy source is shown in Table 1 (BERR, 2009). The two most important users of energy are road transport (71. 7 per cent) and air transport (21. 8 per cent). Domestic shipping comprises only 3 per cent of energy consumed. Whilst the future demand for aviation remains a very significant policy issue for climate change, there appears little prospect of switching propulsion technology in aviation or shipping in the medium term and no further consideration is given to them in this Chapter. Insert Table 1 about here Electricity currently provides only 1. 2 % of the transport sector’s energy demands, although it provides {{almost half of the}} energy used by the rail sector. Traffic has grown by 13. 9 % over the period from 1997 to 2007 and is forecast to grow by a further twenty five per cent by 20251 (DfT, 2008 a). The key drivers of this growth in demand are income, employment, population and travel costs. Table 2 shows how the demand for petroleum products has varied across cars, <b>light</b> and heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> over the period 1997 - 2007 alongside the change in kilometres driven. There have been advances in engine efficiency and a shift to diesel cars which have kept the rise in energy demand at 2. 8 per cent, well below the rise in kilometres.

40|$|The Light Duty Inter-Laboratory Correlation Exercise has {{conducted}} testing at 9 test laboratories in the EU, Korea and Japan {{in order to}} demonstrate the practicality, robustness, repeatability and reproducibility of the particle emissions measurement techniques proposed by the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The exercise involved testing 16 light duty vehicles including 6 diesels equipped with wall-flow Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs), 6 conventional diesel vehicles, 3 direct injection petrol engined vehicles and one conventional, multi-point injection petrol-engined vehicle. A DPF equipped Peugeot 407 was tested at all participating laboratories to allow the inter-laboratory reproducibility of measurements to be assessed. The DPF equipped vehicles tested included 2 <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> derivatives (a Mercedes Vito and a Mazda Bongo).
