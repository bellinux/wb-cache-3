5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|She {{appeared}} in singer Courtney Love's backing band on her 2004 America's Sweetheart tour {{and returned to}} Europe. She released the 2006 album Opheliac with the German label Trisol Music Group. In 2007, she released Laced/Unlaced; the re-release of On a Day... appeared as Laced with songs on the electric violin as Unlaced. She later left Trisol to join New-York-based The End Records in 2009 and release Opheliac in the United States, where previously it had only been available as an import. In 2012, she released the album Fight <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Girl.</b> She {{played the role of}} Painted Doll in Darren Lynn Bousman's 2012 film The Devil's Carnival, as well as its 2015 sequel, Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival.|$|E

25|$|After Hazumu's {{change into}} a girl, she {{is shown in}} the anime as {{completely}} clueless about basic matters related to being a girl such as feminine modesty, how she walks, talks, and handles herself throughout the day. In the manga, this is shown to a much lesser extent and Hazumu is able to adjust to living <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> much quicker and with less direct interference from others than in the anime. In the anime, Tomari tries to teach Hazumu everything there is about being a girl, but in the manga she is very reluctant to the fact that Hazumu's sex has changed and tries to help her as little as possible in becoming more feminine. Hazumu's personality in the manga is more direct than her anime counterpart, such as when expressing outward annoyance towards her parents' eccentric behaviors, and Hitoshi's awkwardly straightforward interferences in her love life. Also, during the day at the beach in the manga version, Hazumu seeks out Asuta when she is being hit on by two guys and asserts that Asuta is her boyfriend, but in the anime Asuta takes the role of Hazumu's protector and asserts that she is his girlfriend.|$|E

500|$|In June 2010, Autumn {{released}} the acronym of her upcoming album, F.L.A.G., on her Twitter account, before revealing the full title as Fight <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Girl.</b> In her words, the meaning behind {{the title is}} [...] "about taking {{all these things that}} make women the underdogs and using them to your advantage". Based on her fictional novel, The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, the album has been described as [...] "an operatic feminist treatise set inside an insane asylum, wherein the female inmates gradually realize their own strength in numbers". On August 30, 2010, she announced that she would be undergoing jaw surgery, and recovered from it. In September 2011, she posted the full lyrics to the album's title track, [...] "Fight Like a Girl", on her Twitter account.

David met his future Seinfeld stars during that early stage of his career: he worked with Michael Richards (Kramer) on Fridays and with Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Elaine) [...] on SNL.

500|$|Written {{in the key}} of G major, [...] "Hot n Cold" [...] is a pop and dance-pop song which {{utilizes}} {{guitars and}} synthesizers. It has a length of three minutes and forty seconds (3:40), and runs at a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. The lyrics of the song address a lover of Perry whose mood swings are affecting the couple's relationship. The song opens with Perry confronting her former partner over his frequent changes of mind, singing [...] "You change your mind <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> changes clothes / Yeah you PMS like a bitch". In the chorus, she uses antonyms to describe her partner's mood changes, with the chorus of the song including the lines [...] "You're hot then you're cold / You're yes then you're no / You're in then you're out / You're up then you're down".|$|E

[...] This did not go unnoticed by her family or school friends, who often remarked that she looked and acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> A failed relationship with a boy during her teenage years convinced Harisu of the need to change her sex, and by the time she graduated from the all-boys Naksaeng High School, she was already undergoing hormone replacement therapy. It was for this reason that she was exempted from the military service usually required of males in the Republic of Korea, being rejected on the grounds of [...] "mental illness". By the end of the 1990s, Harisu had undergone breast augmentation, sex reassignment surgery, rhinoplasty, and increase of hips, having had surgery performed in Korea and Japan.|$|E

Nelson went on stating that [...] "it's tracks like the aforementioned 'Wash All Over Me' [...] that showcase the megastar's vulnerable, relatable side". Brad Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, commented that [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] was [...] "very Confessions-esque", further calling it [...] "a truly curious concoction of sound". In response to a fan of the singer, Stern agreed that it was [...] "fabulous and very emotional", and opined that [...] "the lyrics are much more intriguing than, say, taking shots of Tanqueray <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> gone wild."

500|$|While {{the roles}} of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already {{a part of the}} Tracey Ullman Show cast, the {{producers}} decided to hold casting for {{the roles of}} Bart and Lisa. Nancy Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa, but disliked the character's bland description—Lisa was described simply as the [...] "middle child"—and read for the role of Bart instead. Casting director Bonita Pietila brought Yeardley Smith in for an audition after seeing her performing in the play Living on Salvation Street. Smith was hesitant to audition for an animated series, but her agent had persuaded her to give it a try. Smith originally auditioned for the role of Bart but Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled: [...] "I always sounded too much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Pietila offered Smith the role of Lisa instead.|$|E
500|$|Smith's longest-running role is voicing Lisa Simpson on The Simpsons. She has voiced Lisa since 1987, {{beginning}} with The Simpsons shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith had initially {{been asked to}} audition {{for the role of}} Lisa's brother Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila thought her voice was too high. Smith later recalled [...] "I always sounded too much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Smith was given the role of Lisa, instead. She denies rumors that she almost turned down the role, though admits she had never planned a career in voice-over work. Pietila stated that, having seen her in Living on Salvation Street, Smith was always her preferred choice. Smith lifts her voice up slightly to perform the role. Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes, she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts. Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in [...] "Last Tap Dance in Springfield" [...] and Lisa, Jr. in [...] "" [...] (both from season 11 in 2000). Smith spends two days a week recording the show.|$|E

500|$|American Life {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, holding {{a score of}} 60/100on music review website Metacritic, based on 17 professional reviews. Billboards Michael Paoletta noted the lyrical differences from past albums such as Ray of Light positively, saying [...] "American Life relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman-in-the-mirror confrontation." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker generally responded well, saying that at its best, the album offers blunt, questing and decisive music but the weakest point was Madonna sounding <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> who's grown content {{with her husband and}} kids and the ability to hire help to do her bidding. Dimitri Ebrlich of Vibe magazine gave a positive review for American Life, saying that Madonna [...] "stayed still" [...] in the album, and commenting that [...] "This may be the first time Madonna hasn't pushed herself to explore new ground, but at least she's chosen a good place to rest." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a mixed review, stating that American Life is not a [...] "masterpiece" [...] compared to her 1992 studio album, Erotica. [...] "It's frequently self-indulgent, misguided, unpleasant, difficult to listen to, silly and humorless, but it's also consistent, uncompromising and unapologetic," [...] Cinquemani opined, ending with the deduction that American Life stood for the last time Madonna made music without the primary objective of making a hit.|$|E
500|$|Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, and Yeardley Smith {{all began}} voicing their {{characters}} on The Tracey Ullman Show. Nancy Cartwright {{was the only}} one of the group who had been trained to be a voice actor while Castellaneta had done some voice over work in Chicago. Castellaneta and Kavner had been part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask them to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, [...] "I always sounded too much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Smith was given the role of Lisa instead. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the [...] "middle child" [...] and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart who she found more fascinating because he was described as [...] "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [...] clever." [...] Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.|$|E
