25|$|The {{discovery}} by Hertz in 1887 {{that the}} incidence of ultra-violet light on a spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark, led immediately to a series of investigations by Hallwachs, Hoor, Righi and Stoletow on the effect of light, and especially of ultra-violet light, on charged bodies. It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc, if charged with negative electricity, rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra-violet light falls upon the surface; while if the surface is uncharged to begin with, it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light, the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded; this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong airblast against the surface. If however the zinc surface is positively electrified it suffers no <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> when exposed to the light: this result has been questioned, but a very careful examination of the phenomenon by Elster and Geitel has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances is due to the discharge by the light reflected from the zinc surface of negative electrification on neighbouring conductors induced by the positive charge, the negative electricity {{under the influence of the}} electric field moving up to the positively electrified surface.|$|E
6000|$|... 1209. Without endeavouring {{to allow}} for the loss which must have been {{gradually}} going on {{during the time of the}} experiment, let us observe the results of the numbers as they stand. As 1° remained in app. i. in an undischargeable state, 249° may be taken as the utmost amount of the transferable or divisible charge, the half of which is 124°.5. As app. ii. was free of charge in the first instance, and immediately after the division was found with 122°, this amount at least may be taken as what it had received. On the other hand 124° minus 1°, or 123°, may be taken as the half of the transferable charge retained by app. i. Now these do not differ much from each other, or from 124°.5, the half of the full amount of transferable charge; and when the gradual <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> evident in the difference between 254° and 250° of app. i. is also taken into account, there is every reason to admit the result as showing an equal division of charge, unattended by any disappearance of power except that due to dissipation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWild-type bovine and yeast tRNATrp are {{efficiently}} aminoacylated by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase {{both from}} beef and from yeast. Upon <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> modified {{bases in the}} synthetic transcripts, mammalian tRNATrp retains the double recognition by the two synthetases, while yeast tRNATrp loses its substrate properties for the bovine enzyme and is recognised only by the cognate synthetase. By testing chimeric bovine–yeast transcripts with tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase purified from beef pancreas, the nucleotides responsible for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> the synthetic yeast transcript have been localised in the anticodon arm. A complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> akin to that observed with the yeast transcript requires substitution in the bovine backbone of G 37 in the anticodon loop with yeast A 37 and of C 28 –G 42 in the anticodon stem with yeast U 28 –A 42.

5000|$|The 2013 {{model year}} Leaf battery {{warranty}} covers a gradual <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> {{for five years}} or 60000 mi. In Europe the battery warranty is for five years or 100000 km. Under the new warranty, Nissan will repair or replace the battery over the warranty period if it loses more than 30% of its charge capacity (below nine bars). This warranty is in addition of the original Leaf's batteries that covers defects and flaws for up to eight years or 100000 mi. But even with the new warranty, Nissan says the fix may only restore a diminished battery's capacity to nine bars out the twelve of a new car, as Nissan clarified that batteries aren't designed to last forever, and some loss of capacity is to be expected. According to Nissan, [...] "the intent of this warranty is to provide consumers with confidence that despite this normal battery capacity loss, they will be assured of a minimum level of capacity throughout the warranty period." [...] The new <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> warranty also benefits owners of the 2011/12 model year Leaf.|$|E

Slightly compressed air, similar to an automobile equipped with a turbocharger, was channeled into the cylinders in turn, closed off with the poppet valves, and then burned.

50|$|The {{function}} of this capacitor, {{known as a}} reservoir capacitor (or smoothing capacitor) is to lessen the variation in (or 'smooth') the rectified AC output voltage waveform from the bridge. There is still some variation, known as ripple. One explanation of 'smoothing' is that the capacitor provides {{a low impedance path}} to the AC component of the output, reducing the AC voltage across, and AC current through, the resistive load. In less technical terms, any drop in the output voltage and current of the bridge tends to be cancelled by <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> in the capacitor. This charge flows out as additional current through the load. Thus the change of load current and voltage is reduced relative to what would occur without the capacitor. Increases of voltage correspondingly store excess charge in the capacitor, thus moderating the change in output voltage / current.|$|E
5000|$|In the Miller cycle, {{the intake}} valve is left open {{longer than it}} would be in an Otto-cycle engine. In effect, the {{compression}} stroke is two discrete cycles: the initial portion when the intake valve is open and final portion when the intake valve is closed. This two-stage intake stroke creates the so-called [...] "fifth" [...] stroke that the Miller cycle introduces. As the piston initially moves upwards in what is traditionally the compression stroke, the charge is partially expelled back out through the still-open intake valve. Typically, this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> air would result in a loss of power. However, in the Miller cycle, this is compensated for by the use of a supercharger. The supercharger typically will need to be of the positive-displacement (Roots or screw) type due to its ability to produce boost at relatively low engine speeds. Otherwise, low-rpm power will suffer.|$|E
