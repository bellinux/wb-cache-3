5|$|In January 2011, Penn National Gaming bought Rosecroft for $10.25 million. Penn National said it {{planned to}} return live racing and {{simulcast}} wagering {{to the track}} as well as pushing for changes in Maryland gaming laws allowing slots and table games. Penn National said it was hoping to convince the state to allow slot machines at the track, even though voters did not approve Prince George's County as a gambling location. On July 28, 2011, the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to allow Penn National Gaming to secure a $1.4 million <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to cover operating losses at Rosecroft for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Penn National said it was likely to incur $2.3 million in losses through 2013.|$|E

Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and he is broke.

5|$|In June 2012, Carrols {{acquired}} 278 BK locations from Burger King {{for approximately}} $150 million. In exchange, Burger King parent, Burger King Corporation took a 28.9 {{percent stake in}} the company. The transaction involved a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> that would be used by Carrols to renovate more than 450 of its stores and a 29.7% ownership stake in the franchise going to Burger King. Additional agreements will give Carrols the right of first refusal on approximately 500 stores. If it chooses to exercise these rights, Carrols could become the dominant franchisee of Burger King in the United States with possible control of hundreds of locations in twenty states. Three months after the acquisition, Carrols saw a 37.8% increase in total sales and 8.9% same store sales with a 4.9% increase in customer traffic. As of the end of Burger King's 2012 fiscal year, Carrols operates over 575 restaurants in New York, Ohio, and eighteen other states.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} use <b>of</b> bank <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{as a source of}} corporate liquidity. Traditional explanation for <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is that they provide insurance against liquidity shocks, in much the same as way hoarding cash does. However, recent empirical research suggests that access to <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is contingent on the <b>credit</b> quality <b>of</b> the borrower as well as the financial condition of the lender. These findings suggest that <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are an imperfect substitute for cash as a source of corporate liquidity. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{hearing about}} the game's success, Bushnell decided {{there would be more}} profit for Atari to {{manufacture}} the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell's comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for Pong; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line. The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972. Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister of Economy was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy. During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis {{he did not want to}} risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E

40|$|The author models {{the choice}} between credit cards and home equity <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> (HELOCs) within a {{framework}} where consumers hold <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> as instruments <b>of</b> consumption smoothing across state and time. Flexible repayment schemes for <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> induce risk-averse consumers with sufficiently high discount rates to underinsure and hold <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> instead as a buffer, even when {{they have access to}} full and fair insurance markets. Weighing the fixed upfront fees and higher default costs of HELOCs against the advantages of low and income-tax-deductible interest payments, the author finds a threshold level of potential borrowing belowwhich consumers prefer to use credit cards exclusively. Above that threshold, consumers decide touse HELOCs and consolidate all outstanding credit card debt into them; however, a rising probability of default and the resulting loss of equity in the home will put an upper bound on the potential HELOC borrowing that will prevent full debt consolidation.

For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps.

40|$|We survey chief {{financial}} officers from 29 countries {{to examine whether}} and why firms use <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> versus non-operational (excess) cash for their corporate liquidity. We find that these two liquidity sources are employed to hedge against different risks. Non-operational cash guards against future cash flow shocks in bad times, while credit lines give firms the option to exploit future business opportunities available in good times. <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are the dominant source of liquidity for companies around the world, comprising about 15 % of assets, while {{less than half of}} the cash held by companies is held for non-operational purposes, comprising about 2 % of assets.

40|$|This paper investigates {{a unique}} dataset {{describing}} how {{public and private}} firms in Europe use <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> during the 2008 - 9 financial crisis. Our analysis emphasizes the interaction between internal funds, external funds, and real decisions such as corporate investment and employment. Among other things, we find that firms that generally face restricted access to credit (small, private, non-investment grade, and unprofitable) draw more funds from their credit lines during the crisis than their large, public, investment-grade, profitable counterparts. The terms <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> facilities changed significantly with the crisis: maturities declined, while commitment fees and interest spreads went up. Our evidence suggests that while being profitable helps firms establish credit lines, it does not monotonically lead to increased use. Instead, <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are used when internal funds (cash stocks and cash flows) decline. Looking at real-side decisions, our estimates suggest that <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> provide the liquidity "edge" firms need to invest during the crisis.

25|$|As {{the deal}} {{worked its way}} through state and federal {{regulatory}} approval, Dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt. The company obtained $1.3 billion in term loan B facilities and $500 million in revolving credit.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{evidence}} that banks with {{a low level of}} capitalization have reduced their commitment with respect to <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> after the introduction of the Basle Accord.
