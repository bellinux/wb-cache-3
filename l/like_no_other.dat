5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River.

5|$|In {{the early}} to mid 2000's the Crusaders and Brumbies had a rivalry <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>other.</b> In the space of five years, the Crusaders and the Brumbies contested three finals.

However, in 2004, the Brumbies would defeat the Crusaders in the final meeting 47-38 in a high scoring match. Likewise with the Blues, the rivalry has dwindled in recent times, with the Brumbies only sporadically title threats.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

50|$|While many city-states, kingdoms, and empires {{competed with}} one another for power and prestige, Mexico {{can be said to}} have had five major civilizations: The Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Toltec, the Aztec and the Maya.

25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} in October 1993 already {{received}} widespread attention with over 130 reports in newspapers, magazines, and radio broadcasts discussing its work in every German-speaking country. Many commentators noted its conceptual clarity {{as well as}} its international and intergenerational approach. This editorial method has made the magazine an “integrative” medium for contemporary poetry in the German language. <b>Like</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> publication, DAS GEDICHT was able to initiate a widespread debate on poetry with a broad scope of readers. The Stuttgarter Zeitung wrote that the genre poetry is setting out on a “search for the traces of a new identity” with DAS GEDICHT.|$|E
25|$|The Paris Gun was {{a weapon}} <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>other,</b> but its {{capabilities}} {{are not known}} with full certainty. This {{is due to the}} weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans {{in the face of the}} final Allied offensives. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source—not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note on the gun written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.|$|E

25|$|Any {{suggestion}} of further reading on Kant {{has to take}} cognizance {{of the fact that}} his work has dominated philosophy <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> figure after him. Nevertheless, several guideposts can be made out. In Germany, one important contemporary interpreter of Kant and the movement of German Idealism he began is Dieter Henrich, who has some work available in English. P. F. Strawson's The Bounds of Sense (1966) {{played a significant role in}} determining the contemporary reception of Kant in England and America. More recent interpreters of note in the English-speaking world include Lewis White Beck, Jonathan Bennett, Henry Allison, Paul Guyer, Christine Korsgaard, Stephen Palmquist, Robert B. Pippin, Roger Scruton, Rudolf Makkreel, and Béatrice Longuenesse.|$|E
25|$|Later, the Romans bred and {{exported}} fighting dogs to Spain, France {{and other}} parts of Europe until eventually these dogs made their way back to England. Though bull baiting and bear baiting were popular throughout the Middle Ages up to the 19th century in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, the British pitted dogs against bulls and bears on a scale <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>other.</b> In 12th century England during the feudal era, the landed aristocracy, who held direct military control in decentralized feudal systems and thus owned the animals necessary for waging war, introduced bull baiting and bear baiting {{to the rest of the}} British population. In later years, bull baiting and bear baiting became a popular source of entertainment for the British royalty. For instance, Queen Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558–1603, was an avid follower of bull and bear baiting; she bred Mastiffs for baiting and would entertain foreign guests with a fight whenever they visited England. In addition to breeding Mastiffs and entertaining foreign guests with a fight, Queen Elizabeth, and later her successor, King James I, built a number of bear gardens in London. The garden buildings were round and roofless, and housed not only bears, but also bulls and other wild animals that could be used in a fight. Today, a person can visit the Bear Garden museum near the Shakespeare Global Complex in Bankside, Southwark.|$|E

5000|$|Pepper Adams was in {{many ways}} the antithesis of {{contemporary}} baritone players Gerry Mulligan and Serge Chaloff, who favored melodic cool jazz. In contrast, Adams managed to bring the cumbersome baritone into the blisteringly fast speeds of hard bop <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>others</b> had before. [...] Gary Carner, Adams's biographer, described his style as having [...] "very long, tumbling, double-time melodic lines. And that raw, piercing, bark-like timbre." [...] Adams [...] "succeeded in elevating baritone saxophone to the level of all other solo instruments with blinding speed, penetrating timbre, distinctive sound, harmonic ingenuity, precise articulation, confident time-feel, and use of melodic paraphrase". Throughout his career, Adams consistently chose musical expression over large paychecks, as [...] "he repeatedly recalled with great satisfaction his decision to play groups focused on musical expression rather than to change his style to secure better paying jobs with now little-known white musicians". A large part of Adams' appeal was that [...] "he had the remarkable ability to blow low with enormous power and swing, becoming a hefty addition to big band reed sections. He also was an equally dominant voice in small groups, adding ferocious excitement and stamina".|$|R
