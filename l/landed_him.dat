5|$|Born in Ireland, Daily {{first began}} playing {{baseball}} professionally around the Baltimore area, often receiving more lucrative offers {{to play in}} more prominent leagues, all of which he declined, preferring {{to stay in the}} local area.

5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born {{just north}} of the border of the United States. He grew up with a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10.
