Glargine-treated cats had lower mean 12 h blood glucose concentrations on day 17 than PZI- or lente-treated cats, and all eight glargine-treated cats achieved remission compared to three PZI- and two lente-treated cats. The probability of remission was greater for cats treated with glargine than cats treated with PZI or <b>lente</b> <b>insulin.</b> In newly diagnosed diabetic cats, twice daily treatment with glargine provides better glycaemic control and higher probability of remission compared to twice daily treatment with PZI or <b>lente</b> <b>insulin.</b> Good glycaemic control soon after diagnosis is associated with increased probability of remission and should be the goal of insulin therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} glargine, protamine zinc (PZI), and lente insulins were evaluated in nine healthy cats. A 3 -way crossover study was performed and plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose were determined for 24 [*]h after a single subcutaneous injection of each insulin at 3 -day intervals. Time to {{onset of action}} did not differ between insulins. Mean time to first nadir glucose was longer for glargine (14 [*]h) relative to PZI (4 [*]h) and lente (5 [*]h). PZI was biphasic in action with nadirs at 4 and 14 [*]h with the second nadir occurring at a similar time to glargine. Nadir glucose {{did not differ significantly}} between insulin types. The duration of action was similar for glargine and PZI and was longer than that for <b>lente</b> <b>insulin.</b> Mean daily glucose after glargine and PZI were also similar and were lower than after <b>lente</b> <b>insulin.</b> Time to reach peak insulin did not differ between insulin types. Time to return to baseline insulin level for PZI was longer than glargine but did not differ significantly from lente. In conclusion, healthy cats injected subcutaneously with glargine, compared to those injected with <b>lente</b> <b>insulin,</b> have a later glucose nadir and longer duration of action. Glargine and PZI had similar durations of action in study cats but a larger study is required to obtain precise comparisons of duration of action...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin and its clinical application {{early in the}} last century dramatically improved the prospects of people with diabetes. However, the limitations of those initial, unmodified insulin preparations were quickly recognized; most notably, their relatively “short action” meant that multiple daily subcutaneous injections were required. This stimulated a concerted effort to modify the properties of insulin in order to extend the duration of its blood glucose-lowering effect, minimize dosing frequency, and decrease the burden of treatment. The first successful attempts to prolong insulin's action were achieved by modifying its formulation with additives such as protamine and zinc, culminating in the production of “intermediate-acting” neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in the 1940 s and the <b>lente</b> family of <b>insulins</b> in the 1950 s. However, NPH and <b>lente</b> <b>insulins</b> were still associated with several limitations, including considerable variability of effect and a pronounced peak in their time–action profile. In the 1980 s, the focus of research moved toward the modification of insulin itself with the aim of producing a “long-acting” insulin that would better satisfy basal insulin requirements over the entire day. Once-daily insulin glargine was the first “long-acting” insulin analog in clinical practice, followed by once- or twice-daily insulin detemir and, more recently, insulin degludec, which is now being evaluated for administration at less frequent intervals. These analogs demonstrate several benefits over “intermediate-acting” insulins, including a lower risk of both overall hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia and reduced day-to-day glucose variability, making it more feasible to achieve better fasting and overall glycemic control. Long-acting insulin analogs (insulin glargine and insulin detemir) are now firmly established as key tools in the battle against diabetes, and ongoing clinical research of insulin-based therapy should focus on treatment strategies to maximize their benefits. To date, the clinical experience with insulin degludec is limited but demonstrates it has comparable efficacy to insulin glargine...|$|R

At {{least three of}} the following were present at initial presentation: appropriate history of clinical signs consistent with diabetes mellitus, glucosuria, blood glucose greater than 15 mmol/l and fructosamine greater than 380 mu mol/l. Insulin treatment was started at a dose rate of 0. 25 - 0. 5 IU/kg body weight twice daily, with a maximum starting dose of 2 IU/ injection. Twenty-eight of the cats were classed as reaching clinical stability during the study, in 23 of these cats this was during the stabilization phase. Seven cats went into remission during the stabilization phase {{and one of the}} cats in week 56. Clinical signs of hypoglycaemia, significantly associated with a dose of 3 units or 0. 5 IU/kg or more per cat (twice daily), were observed in nine of the 46 cats during the stabilization phase and concomitant biochemical hypoglycaemia was recorded in most cases. Biochemical hypoglycaemia, recorded in 6 % of the blood glucose curves performed during the stabilization phase, was significantly associated with a dose rate of 0. 75 IU/kg or more twice daily.

The results suggest that the degree of constant hyperglycaemia and the duration of untreated diabetes are significant determining factors for the course of morphological changes. These changes are manifested äs a decrease of the glycosidases in kidney (0. 5 to 0. 6 time the age-matched controls) and äs moderate to severe enzymurias. Daily Variation of blood glucose with inadequate <b>insulin</b> <b>Lente</b> therapy caused decreased N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase and ß-galactosidase activities in kidney äs well äs enzymuria. Since such changes can be correlated with histologically visible changes in the kidney, the measurement of these enzymes in urine is a simple way of monitoring the development of kidney damage in poorly controlled diabetes.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of diabetes mellitus has risen exponentially {{in the last}} decade and an increasing number of people are using herbal supplements. Objective: We aimed to assess the relative efficacy of three promising herbs as potentially emerging alternative/adjunct treatment for diabetes. Materials and Methods: One hundred and ninety-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. A third of the animals were randomly rendered diabetic with alloxan (150 mg/kg), another third injected 50 % dextrose (5 g/kg); and the last third constituted the controls. The rats were variously administered aqueous leaf extract of Momordica foetida (500 mg/kg), Vernonia amygdalina (500 mg/kg) and Tapinanthus butungii (500 mg/kg), glibenclamide (5 mg/kg) chlorpropamide (250 mg/kg), and human <b>insulin</b> <b>lente</b> (0. 1 I. U. /kg). Results: Extract of Momordica foetida caused maximal anti-diabetic effect in six hours, Vernonia amygdalina ten hours, while Tapinanthus butungii continued to cause reduction after ten hours. The three extracts caused greater blood glucose reductions than glibenclamide in the diabetic rats, while exhibiting comparable effects with chlorpropamide and insulin. Conclusions: Tapinanthus butungii is more effective in lowering blood glucose than Momordica foetida and Vernonia amygdalina in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Leaf extract of Momordica foetida should be useful in rapidly lowering blood glucose, while that of Tapinanthus butungii in situations that require more subtle reductions and in conditions in which prolonged hypoglycaemic actions are desirable...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the {{pharmacokinetics}} and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneously injected 40 IU/ml porcine <b>lente</b> <b>insulin</b> preparation (Caninsulin, Intervet BV, The Netherlands) in diabetic cats. The pharmacological properties of the insulin in poorly controlled or untreated cats were compared with those after several weeks of treatment, to determine if improved diabetic stability altered the pharmacology of this insulin. In addition, the pharmacological properties of intravenously injected 100 IU/ml regular porcine insulin (Actrapid MC, NovoNordisk, Denmark) were measured. Serial plasma samples were collected after subcutaneous injection of porcine <b>lente</b> <b>insulin</b> from 25 diabetic cats in the first week of admission to a 12 -month diabetic treatment trial. Samples were also collected after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment, in those cats which had not achieved diabetic remission by this time. At this time, serial plasma samples were also collected from these cats after intravenous injection of porcine regular insulin. Plasma samples were assayed for glucose, anti-insulin antibodies were extracted using a PEG technique, and samples were assayed for insulin using an RIA kit with low sensitivity for endogenous feline insulin, but high sensitivity for exogenous porcine insulin in feline plasma. Caninsulin injected subcutaneously in diabetic cats led to a peak insulin concentration in plasma after 1. 7 ± 0. 1 h, and a nadir of blood glucose after 4. 1 ± 0. 3 h. Insulin and glucose concentrations returned to baseline within 12 h. There was no significant change in the onset or duration of Caninsulin action between the first week of treatment and 5 or 9 weeks of treatment. Actrapid MC injected intravenously had a peak insulin at 0. 36 ± 0. 03 h, and a nadir of blood glucose at 1. 9 ± 0. 3 h. Insulin and glucose returned to baseline within 6 h. It was concluded that Caninsulin injected subcutaneously has suitable pharmacological properties for the twice-daily treatment of diabetes mellitus in cats. In addition, Actrapid MC insulin injected intravenously has suitable pharmacological properties for injection every 4 - 6 h in diabetic cats...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} insulin treatments in diabetic cats and develop a targeted therapy for achieving long-term diabetic remission. The pharmacological effects of the glargine insulin formulation were first investigated in healthy cats and compared with the longest-acting insulin currently available for veterinary use (protamine zinc insulin, PZI) and the most commonly used insulin in Australia and the United Kingdom (lente). The effect of administering glargine once daily or twice daily in divided doses was also investigated in healthy cats. The clinical usefulness of glargine was then assessed by comparing the glycaemic control and remission probability in newly-diagnosed diabetic cats treated twice daily with either glargine, PZI or <b>lente</b> <b>insulin.</b> Two additional clinical applications (or indications) for glargine use were then identified. The treatment and outcome of administering glargine intramuscularly with or without subcutaneous glargine for the initial stabilisation of cats with diabetic ketoacidosis was studied and described. Lastly, the long-term resolution of urinary candidiasis in a diabetic cat following treatment with glargine insulin is reported. The initial studies involving healthy cats showed that glargine had a very long duration of action which was similar to PZI and significantly longer than lente. In addition, a carry-over effect was evident regardless of whether insulin was administered once or twice daily and was expected to be advantageous in treating diabetic cats with glargine (because the effects of exogenous insulin will continue until the next insulin injection, regardless of whether dosed once or twice daily). The most important finding in this thesis was made when assessing glargine’s usefulness in treating diabetic cats. In newly-diagnosed diabetic cats twice daily treatment with glargine provided better glycaemic control and increased probability of diabetic remission compared to twice daily treatment with PZI or <b>lente</b> <b>insulin.</b> The beneficial effects of glargine treatment were not confined to uncomplicated diabetes. Intramuscular glargine combined with or without subcutaneous glargine, was effective in treating cats with diabetic ketoacidosis, and of note, were the lack of mortalities. The superior glycaemic control achieved with glargine was found to be crucial in resolving urinary candidiasis in a case study and indicates another potential clinical use for glargine, although larger scale studies are required.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this research effort is the temperature driven growth of protein crystals in large batches in the microgravity environment of space. Pharmaceutical houses are developing protein products for patient care, for example, human insulin, human growth hormone, interferons, and tissue plasminogen activator or TPA, the clot buster for heart attack victims. Except for insulin, these are very high value products; they are extremely potent in small quantities {{and have a great}} value per gram of material. It is feasible that microgravity crystallization can be a cost recoverable, economically sound final processing step in their manufacture. Large scale protein crystal growth in microgravity has significant advantages from the basic science and the applied science standpoints. Crystal growth can proceed unhindered due to lack of surface effects. Dynamic control is possible and relatively easy. The method has the potential to yield large quantities of pure crystalline product. Crystallization is a time honored procedure for purifying organic materials and microgravity crystallization could be the final step to remove trace impurities from high value protein pharmaceuticals. In addition, microgravity grown crystals could be the final formulation for those medicines that need to be administered in a timed release fashion. Long lasting <b>insulin,</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>lente,</b> is such a product. Also crystalline protein pharmaceuticals are more stable for long-term storage. Temperature, as the initiation step, has certain advantages. Again, dynamic control of the crystallization process is possible and easy. A temperature step is non-invasive and is the most subtle way to control protein solubility and therefore crystallization. Seeding is not necessary. Changes in protein and precipitant concentrations and pH are not necessary. Finally, this method represents a new way to crystallize proteins in space that takes advantage of the unique microgravity environment. The results from two flights showed that the hardware performed perfectly, many crystals were produced, and they were much larger than their ground grown controls. Morphometric analysis was done on over 4, 000 crystals to establish crystal size, size distribution, and relative size. Space grown crystals were remarkably larger than their earth grown counterparts and crystal size was a function of PCF volume. That size distribution for the space grown crystals was a function of PCF volume may indicate that ultimate size was a function of temperature gradient. Since the insulin protein concentration was very low, 0. 4 mg/ml, the size distribution could also be following the total amount of protein in each of the PCF's. X-ray analysis showed that the bigger space grown insulin crystals diffracted to higher resolution than their ground grown controls. When the data were normalized for size, they still indicated that the space crystals were better than the ground crystals...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Daily {{subcutaneous}} {{injections of}} <b>lente</b> <b>insulin</b> reduced the hypertension and bradycar-dia which developed consistently in streptozotocin diabetic rats. Insulin-treated rats also became less hyperglycemic, drank less water, and gained weight faster than untreated diabetic controls. Behavior-al and tachy card lac effects elicited by electrical {{stimulation of the}} ventromedial hypothalamus while the rats were awake were similar, but attendant pressor responses were larger in those that had been treated with insulin. Under subsequent urethane anesthesia, pressor and sympathetic responses to hypothalamic stimulation, as well as pressor responses to tyramine and vasopressin, were augmented in insulin-treated rats. A generalized increase in cardiovascular reactivity caused by insulin seemed unlikely since pressor responses to norepinephrine were unaltered. Enhanced hypothalamic respon-siveness was considered due to improvement of diabetic encephalopathy rather than to direct CNS stimulation by insulin because the injected insulin had mostly dissipated by the time pressor responses were recorded. By showing that insulin treatment produced changes opposite to those occurring during induction of diabetes our results suggest that insulin can alleviate cardiovascular and hypotha-lamic dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetes.

A prospective randomised crossover study was performed in 58 predominantly non-obese patients on maximal doses of glibenclamide or metformin, or both, {{to find out if}} insulin would improve control or well being. The patients were given daily injections of up to 48 units of highly purified porcine <b>lente</b> <b>insulin.</b> Glycaemic control was improved by 15 % or more in only 18 patients; 14 others felt better but their diabetes was no better controlled. Those whose control was improved by insulin could not be distinguished by age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, or their own treatment preference. C peptide concentrations, however, did help predict the response to insulin, the fasting C peptide to glucose ratio being considerably lower in those patients whose control was better on insulin. These findings suggest that a simple insulin regimen does not necessarily lead to better glycaemic control in maturity onset diabetes. Nevertheless, a trial of insulin is often justified since it poses few practical difficulties and makes some patients feel better even if their control is not improved. A more complex regimen might improve control in more cases, but it might also be less acceptable to older patients...|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is the most}} common form of diabetes in cats. Other specific types of diabetes account for up to 10 - 20 % of feline diabetes reported from institutions. These include diseases that lead to loss of beta-cells such as pancreatic neoplasia, and conditions which cause insulin resistance such hyperadreocorticism or acromegaly. At least 75 % of cats are insulin dependent, but up to 25 % of cats can be controlled with oral hypoglycemic drugs. To date, glipizide is the only oral hypoglycemic drug with well documented efficacy. Good clinical control can be achieved in most cats with NPH, lente, ultralente or PZI insulins. NPH and <b>lente</b> <b>insulin</b> need to be administered twice daily, and in many cats, ultralente or PZI provide better control administered twice daily rather than once daily. Insulin doses should be conservative to avoid clinical hypoglycemia. Feeding does not need to be timed to insulin administration because postprandial hypoglycemia is mild and very prolonged in cats. It is important that clinical signs are used to monitor response to therapy. Fructosamine, glycated hemaglobin and urine glucose are useful adjuncts to monitoring in some cats.

Neonatal problems included congenital anomalies in 3. 6 %, somatomegaly in 24. 6 %, hypoglycemia in 26. 5 %, hypocalcemia in 17. 3 % and hyperbilirubinemia in 39. 4 %. There were nine cases (8. 2 %) of the respiratory distress syndrome, four (3. 6 %) of which were severe. These findings {{lend support to the}} importance of a policy aimed at achieving normoglycemia and fetal lung maturity before delivery, goals that are attainable without lengthy antenatal hospitalization...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a high insoluble-fiber (IF) diet {{containing}} 15 % cellulose in dry matter, high soluble-fiber (SF) diet containing 15 % pectin in dry matter, and low-fiber (LF) diet on glycemic control in 6 dogs with alloxan-induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was evaluated. Each diet contained greater than 50 % digestible carbohydrate in dry matter. A crossover study was used with each dog randomly assigned to a predetermined diet sequence. Each dog was fed each diet for 56 days. Caloric intake was adjusted weekly as needed to maintain each dog within 1. 5 kg of its body weight measured prior to induction of diabetes mellitus. All dogs were given pork <b>lente</b> <b>insulin</b> and half of their daily caloric intake at 12 -hour intervals. Mean (+/- SEM) daily caloric intake was significantly (P less than 0. 05) less when dogs consumed the IF diet vs the SF and LF diets (66 +/- 3 kcal/kg, 81 +/- 5 kcal/kg, and 79 +/- 4 kcal/kg, respectively). Serum alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly (P less than 0. 05) higher when dogs consumed the LF diet vs the IF and SF diets (182 +/- 37 IU/L, 131 +/- 24 IU/L, and 143 +/- 24 IU/L, respectively). Mean postprandial plasma glucose concentration measured every 2 hours for 24 hours, beginning {{at the time of}} the morning insulin injection, was significantly (P less than 0. 05) lower at most blood sampling times in dogs fed IF and SF diets, compared with dogs fed the LF diet.

40|$|Non-insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus (NIDDM) {{appears to be}} an heterogeneous disorder characterized by both relative insulin deficiency and impaired insulin action. The initial management of NIDDM should include patient education, dietary counselling and individualized programs of physical activity. It is only when such measures fail that drug therapy should be considered. Oral drug therapies include sulphonylurea derivatives, biguanides, among which metformin remains the only one commercialized in our country, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose. However, insulin therapy may be required to achieve adequate glycaemic control in some patients, the so-called secondary failures to oral treatment. The rationale for combining insulin and oral drug therapy derives from {{a better understanding of the}} pathophysiology of NIDDM and of the mechanisms of action of the oral drugs available: 1) type 2 diabetic patients are both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant, thus requiring quite high doses of exogenous insulin; 2) peripheral insulin delivery leads to hyperinsulinaemia which could play a role in the pathogenesis of late diabetic complications; 3) sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release directly into the portal vein and could also potentiate peripheral insulin action; and 4) metformin (by improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (by slowing down the digestion of complex carbohydrates and sucrose) are able to reduce the amounts of insulin needed to control postprandial hyperglycaemia. Numerous studies have shown that a combination of insulin and sulphonylurea is more effective than insulin alone in the treatment of patients with NIDDM after secondary failure to oral drugs, leading to better glucose profiles and/or decreased insulin needs. The available data suggest that combination therapy is most beneficial in the diabetic patient who still has residual insulin secretory capacity and that the best scheme comprises an evening injection of <b>lente</b> <b>insulin</b> and the administration of sulphonylureas before meals. Preliminary results suggested that insulin-metformin (when obesity is present) or insulin-acarbose (when post-prandial hyperglycaemia occurs) combinations might offer some favourable features for the treatment of NIDDM patients although these therapeutical approaches still require adequate evaluation in further controlled studies. The additional cost of such combined therapy should be weighed against the potential advantages of better metabolic control. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with terminal renal failure resulting from diabetic nephropathy were treated by hemodialysis with the "REDY" dialysate delivery system. Blood sugar levels are easily regulated by this dialysis (144. 5 - 158. 0 - 127. 7 mg/dl). Hemodialysis was {{performed with the}} REDY system using a DC- 7 Coil. Blood flow through the dialyser averaged 200 ml/min and {{the average length of}} dialysis was 6 hours. The patients were dialyzed at the hospital three times per week. The mean pre-dialysis values for BUN, creatinine and uric acid were 84. 3 mg/dl, 11. 6 mg/dl and 8. 9 mg/dl respectively during 30 dialyses. Similarly, post-dialysis averages for BUN, creatinine and uric acid were 49. 9 mg/dl, 7. 3 mg/dl and 4. 6 mg/dl. Case 1. A 43 -year-old man had diabetes for 16 years and had taken 20 units of <b>Lente</b> <b>Insulin</b> per day. He had proteinuria for 4 years, and edema, pulmonary congestion, nausea and vomiting for one year. He was hospitalized elsewhere and treated with salt restriction, bedrest, and diuretics. There was little improvement, however, he began dialysis on Jan. 25, 1973, in another city hospital using a general Kolff-type artificial kidney two times per week. In our clinic, the patient was started on RDT by REDY system on Oct. 20, 1973. Values for blood chemistry studies were: BUN 106 mg/dl, creatinine 9. 5 mg/dl, uric acid 17. 3 mg/dl, Na 139 mEq/L, K 4. 5 mEq/L, and fasting blood sugar 229 mg/dl. Case 2. A 50 -year-old man, diabetic since age 37 had well controlled diabetes using Diabinese (200 mg/day) and diet therapy. In July, 1973 there was a rapid onset of increasing BUN and creatinine levels. He was admitted to the hospital on Oct. 1973. The BUN was 154 mg/dl, creatinine 16. 2 mg/dl, uric acid 13. 9 mg/dl, and fasting blood sugar 150 mg/dl. Intermittent peritoneal dialysis with intraperitoneal insulin administration was performed immediately upon hospitalization. The REDY dialysis was started on Oct. 23, 1973. Patients with terminal diabetic nephropathy will be readily accepted in the future for regular dialysis treatment using the REDY system...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study was to describe the historical and clinical findings, the clinicopathological abnormalities, the occurrence and nature of concurrent diseases, the treatment and outcome of 23 dogs with diabetic ketosisketoacidosis (DK-DKA). Inclusion criteria consisted {{of the presence of}} clinical signs suggestive of diabetes mellitus (DM) along with persistent hyperglycemia, glycosuria and ketonuria during the first 24 hours of hospitalization. In nineteen dogs (83 %) DM had not been previously diagnosed. Common presenting complaints were polyuria/polydipsia (100 %), partial or complete loss of appetite (87 %), depression (87 %), vomiting (65 %) and weight loss (30 %). The most frequent physical examination findings included dehydration (61 %), depression (61 %), hypotrichosis-alopecia (39 %), palpable cranial abdominal organomegaly (26 %), pendulous abdomen (26 %), lesions compatible with superficial pyoderma (17 %), thin and hypotonic abdominal skin (17 %), and hypothermia (17 %). The most important clinicopathological abnormalities, apart from hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and ketonuria, included anemia (48 %), leukocytosis (39 %), increased activities of alkaline phosphatase (100 %), lipase (56 %) and alanine aminotransferase (52 %), hypertriglyceridemia (90 %) and hypercholesterolemia (84 %). Also, 12 dogs demonstrated hypokalemia on admission or during hospitalization. A concurrent disease was identified in 74 % of the cases while 26 % had two or more comorbidities. The latter included pancreatitis (30 %), urinary tract infections (17 %), superficial pyoderma (17 %), urolithiasis (13 %) and hyperadrenocorticism (13 %). Twenty two dogs were treated with short-acting insulin (regular or lispro) and one with intermediate-acting (<b>lente)</b> <b>insulin,</b> whereas intravenous fluid therapy was instituted in 78 % of them with potassium and phosphorus supplementation in 65 % and 9 %, respectively. Seventeen (81 %) dogs survived to be discharged, three (13 %) died during hospitalization, one (4 %) was euthanized and on two (9 %) occasions owners declined hospitalization after the first 24 hours due to financial constrains or a poor prognosis. Mean duration of hospitalization for the survivors was 5. 7 ± 2. 4 days, mean time to resolution of ketonuria was 4. 2 ± 1. 9 days and median time of rapid-acting insulin administration was 4 days (range 2 - 8 days) ...|$|E
