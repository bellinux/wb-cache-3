5000|$|Traditional <b>lap</b> <b>bars</b> {{that allow}} riders to {{experience}} so-called airtime, or negative G's, {{the sensation of}} floating above the seat, must be installed. Individual, ratcheting <b>lap</b> <b>bars</b> do not meet this requirement.|$|R

5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a <b>lap</b> <b>bar.</b> At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which are attached to the restraints.|$|E
50|$|Premier Rides {{gave the}} trains an {{overhaul}} in 2002 and replaced the restraints with <b>lap</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R

5|$|Shambhala {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars with two rows that seat two riders each {{for a total}} of 32 riders per train; each seat has its own individual lap-bar restraint. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,680 riders per hour. Riders also experience up to 3.8 times the force of gravity. The structure of the trains are colored gold and cyan, the <b>lap</b> <b>bar</b> restraints are cyan, and the seats are black.|$|E
5|$|Manta is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. Guests are secured in their seats using a locking <b>lap</b> <b>bar,</b> a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} bond {{splitting}} performance of <b>lapped</b> steel <b>bars</b> in tension. Twelve RC beams with substandard laps (<b>lap</b> length= 25 <b>bar</b> diameters) at midspan {{were tested in}} flexure. The variables examined include the bar diameter, concrete cover and three different confinement conditions at midspan, i. e. no confinement, internal steel stirrups and external Post-Tensioned Metal Straps (PTMS). The test results show that, in comparison to unconfined specimens, PTMS confinement enhances the bond strength of the <b>lapped</b> <b>bars</b> by up to 120...|$|R
5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and lighting system, with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining <b>lap</b> <b>bar.</b> The on-board audio and lighting system animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station. The lighting pattern used for the park entrance track section gives {{the effect of a}} Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Tower of Terrors {{restraint system}} {{consisted of a}} thick, rigid <b>lap</b> <b>bar</b> with hand grips mounted to the <b>lap</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1989, {{the current}} trains were first introduced. They are {{externally}} and cosmetically {{very similar to}} the originals, and still consisted of two rocket cars joined together. While still seating riders single-file, the current trains have three seats, with one person per seat, reducing each train's potential capacity from eight riders to six. The 1989 vehicles introduced the use of <b>lap</b> <b>bars,</b> but in 1998 the <b>lap</b> <b>bars</b> were replaced with a new T-bar design, rather than the square design previously used.The trains were originally painted white. In the 2009 refurbishment, the trains received new seat fabric and were repainted in a blue and gray paint scheme.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{vehicles}} on Journey to Atlantis are boats with wheels {{on the bottom}} and on the sides. Each boat carries eight passengers, arranged into four rows with two passengers each. Two <b>lap</b> <b>bars</b> secure both passengers in the row.|$|R
25|$|Fury 325 {{operates}} {{with three}} open-air, steel and fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train.

25|$|On June 30, 1995, a 14-year-old girl {{fell from}} her seat on the coaster and died. The park owner at the time, Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc., and ride manufacturer, Dinn Corporation, said she was {{switching}} seats when the accident occurred. A riding companion claimed that safety restraints (a <b>lap</b> <b>bar</b> and seat belt) had come undone on a sharp turn {{at the top of}} one of the ride's hills. But, Worlds of Fun officials claimed that witnesses had seen her remove her restraints and tried to switch seats and that there had been no malfunction, though her family disputed this. The ride was temporarily closed pending an investigation of its safety features, which resulted in new <b>lap</b> <b>bar</b> installations. Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc. and Dinn Corporation settled with the family for $200,000. This makes the Timber Wolf the only ride so far at Worlds of Fun with a fatality.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, a 20-year-old woman {{died after}} {{falling out of}} the ride. The <b>lap</b> <b>bar</b> was locked in place, but due to the woman's obesity, it proved to be ineffective. One of the old cars has been sent to the Sky Tower. This {{incident}} prompted Colossus to be closed for a year while the trains were switched out and other adjustments were made.|$|E
50|$|The trains on Teststrecke are themed to {{resemble}} racing cars and designed by Sunkid GmbH. Each train {{has a single}} <b>lap</b> <b>bars</b> to secure riders in their seats. It can operate all three at peak times, but it runs with one {{when there are no}} queues.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} looping coasters, Montezooma's Revenge uses <b>lap</b> <b>bars</b> to hold riders {{in the seats}} instead of {{conventional}} over-the-shoulder restraints found on most other steel looping roller coasters.
