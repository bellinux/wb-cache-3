5|$|During 2010 Michael Eavis {{received}} a donation from British Waterways of timber {{from the old}} gates at Caen Hill Locks in Wiltshire. This was used to construct a new bridge which was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Arabella Churchill. The following year more of the redundant <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> were used to build the Campo Pequeno amphitheatre.|$|E
5|$|The harbour {{cost more}} than {{anticipated}} and high rates were levied to repay loans, reducing any benefit the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool. In 1848 the city council bought the docks company to force down the rates. They employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel to make improvements, including new <b>lock</b> <b>gates,</b> a dredger and sluice gates designed to reduce siltation.|$|E

5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down {{to bring in a}} single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E
5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of <b>lock</b> <b>gates,</b> she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1915–1916, the German navy had {{developed}} Bruges {{from a small}} Flanders port into a major naval centre with large concrete bunkers to shelter U-boats, extensive barracks and training facilities for U-boat crews, and similar facilities for other classes of raiding warship. Bruges was therefore a vital asset in the German navy's increasingly desperate struggle to prevent Britain from receiving food and matériel {{from the rest of}} the world. The significance of Bruges was not lost on British naval planners and two previous attempts to close the exit at Ostend, the smaller and narrower of the Bruges canals, had ended in failure. On 7 September 1915, four Lord Clive-class monitors of the Dover Patrol had bombarded the dockyard, while German coastal artillery returned fire. Only 14 rounds were fired by the British with the result that only part of the dockyard was set on fire. In a bombardment on 22 September 1917, the <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> were hit causing the basin to drain at low water.|$|E
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because {{of the way}} the system of locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
5|$|Various {{fund-raising}} schemes, {{along with}} some financial support from local authorities, allowed small-scale work on the locks to continue, but the projected timescales for completion were missed. In 1983 the Manpower Services Commission, which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the United Kingdom, agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of Aldermaston Lock, its adjacent wharf, and Widmead Lock. The restoration of the Dundas Aqueduct and several smaller schemes were later added to the list. Maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route, while fund-raising activities continued. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders sponsored a workshop, which opened in Shrivenham in 1987, to create new <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> for the Crofton and Devizes flights. In 1988 the restoration of Woolhampton Lock was completed, but obstructions remained on either side. Frounds swing bridge could not be opened and the restoration of Midgham Lock had not been finished; both were completed the following year. Re-puddling of the Crofton pounds {{was carried out in}} 1989, along with the reconstruction of Midgham Bridge. Restoration of the turf-sided Monkey Marsh Lock proved difficult because of its status as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety.|$|E

5|$|In central Bristol, {{where the}} river is tidal, it is {{diverted}} from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> (designed by Jessop) and is known as the Floating Harbour. The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately entwined with Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the Floating Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} ship impact {{analysis}} on <b>lock</b> <b>gate.</b> First, the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> structure {{is determined by}} an elastic design and optimization process. Then, a nonlinear numerical analysis by finite elements is conducted to study {{the response of the}} <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> in case of ship impact. It is shown that the elastically optimized structure is not able to resist significant impacts, because of the buckling of its reinforcement elements; the gate is thus reinforced. Finally, several ship impact analyses are conducted on the reinforced gate and they highlight the influence of the stiffener dimensions and the impact zone on the structural behavior of the gate. The results of the numerical analyses underline the importance of the development of a global plastic mechanism with the purpose of dissipating a large amount of energy...|$|R
