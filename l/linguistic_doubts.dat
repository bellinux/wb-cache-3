50|$|The {{main base}} of the {{activities}} of the Congress was El Círculo Theater, especially restored for the occasion. It started with a welcome session presented by heads of State and writers. The Congress itself comprised a series of lectures and parallel cultural activities. It included a homage to the Argentine writer Ernesto Sábato. A dictionary of <b>linguistic</b> <b>doubts</b> (Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas) was introduced, and the Cervantes Institute presented a new linguistic competence certificate for Spanish as a foreign language.|$|E
40|$|In <b>linguistic</b> {{cases of}} <b>doubt</b> a {{differentiation}} {{has to be}} made between the pragmatic reflections of language by laypersons (SZ 1) and the common 'extra-communicatice' reflections by linguists (SZ 2). These structural inhomogeneities of languages are based upon (e. g. ortho-graphic) variants, 'openings', so called 'language fluctuations' or some other irregular forms that have developed historically (SZ 2 = 'objective imperfectibility' of the linguistic system). On the other hand, the competence theoretical notion of 'linguistic doubt' (of the type SZ 1) requires that speakers become aware or are aware of their lacking, constricted, or insecure knowledge in their language usage (= SZ 1 : 'subjective imperfectibility'). From a point of linguistic development, both <b>linguistic</b> cases of <b>doubt</b> can be seen as indicators for potential 'mutants' in the inheritance of linguistic forms, structures and functions. Hence, 'imperfectibility' (both as a quality of a system and as a cognitive substrate of it) is an important condition for future linguistic change...|$|R

40|$|Conceptual subtlety {{in science}} demands clarity. The {{significance}} of universality {{rests on the}} fact that concepts do not overlap with each other. Nonetheless, clarity is a target and, as such, it {{should not be confused with}} the method by which we try to attain it. The binary method (0 / 1, yes/no) is "a" method, but not "the" method. It would be fruitful to apply a "fuzzy" method in addition to - or even instead of- the binary method. Every explanation tries to approach reality, and it is obvious that reality sometimes does not display clearcut boundaries. I would rather claim that many facts of reality show fuzzy, continuous profiles. In such cases, would it not be legitimate to approach fuzzy facts from a continuous - not discrete - perspective? In the present paper I shall present some underpinnings of a continuous perspective in linguistics and the main morphological issues for which such a perspective is particularly suitable. In the literature on Morphology we often encounter hesitating, sometimes even contradictor/ explanations that fluctuate between different categorizations of certain <b>linguistic</b> units. <b>Doubt</b> of thought is an indication that "the thing meant" is not discontinuous of nature. Many categories, subcategories, etc., are not perfectly separated from one another, but they lie at different positions of a continuous scale...|$|R

The environment has different aims: on the one hand, to offer the users (teachers, learners and computational linguists) different tools and language resources to clarify the <b>linguistic</b> <b>doubts</b> they might have about the language, {{and on the other}} hand, to store information about language learners, deviations and errors as the basis for further studies in CALL and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The environment is composed of a workbench (Lentillak), two web applications (Erreus and Irakazi), several NLP tools and two databases (Errors and Deviations), and it takes in learner corpora as well as native corpora. In addition, we present the experiment we have carried out to evaluate the usefulness of the NLP tools...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of pronunciation, morphology, and syntax, <b>linguistic</b> <b>doubts</b> and uncertainties belong to the everyday business and everyday life of linguists and public speakers. Cases of lexical semantic doubts, however, have been brushed aside by post-Saussurian and all the more by post-Bloomfieldian linguists so far. This paper deals with such lexical semantic doubts and uncertainties which not only rise from language use within "parole" but are caused by a conflict of opposite or even contradictory language norms of different "langue"-varieties (e. g. the adjective positive as a medical term and in everyday colloquial language). Proceeding from an intensive discussion {{of the relationship between}} language use, language norms, and language system with special reference to Saussure, Hjelmslev, and Coseriu, the paper presents a theoretical approach to linguistically founded criticism of semantic norms by way of embedding lexical semantics into a framework of "Existenzweisen" (focusing on language use, norms, and system), "Existenzformen" (in particular norms of special discourses and varieties), and "language history and social stratification" (in particular age-based vocabularies and semantics). Finally, the paper turns this theoretic approach into practice by way of describing, explaining, and solving semantic doubts of the German word Zigeuner (gipsy). This example taken from the discourse on "political correctness" is investigated in the broader context of the word's historical, semantic, and pragmatic dimensions in different German discourses and varieties. The systematic relations between the various usages are presented {{in the form of a}} pragmatic and semantic network displaying the interconnections and borders between the meanings and gives recommendations to the word's use...|$|E
