25|$|The Woodland Dynamite Chili Cook-off is a newer {{addition}} to Woodland's cultural activities. Beginning in 1998, the cook-off has drawn a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> to try chili cooked from {{various members of}} the community. This event also includes other activities such as bounce houses, pony rides and games for the children; live music as well as other food and drink for the adults.

[...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively. Times reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark's character, praising both Martin's writing and Richard Madden's acting. Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio Forel confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya's escape, which she considered masterfully staged.|$|E

The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.|$|R

During a speech at a May 29, 2017 gathering of Philip D. Murphy supporters at a community center gymnasium, [...] "There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there who are frightened. Trump played on their fears. What we haven’t done, in my view — and this is a criticism of all us — we haven’t spoken enough to the fears and aspirations of the people we come from."

2500|$|Hatfield was {{profiled}} {{in a number}} of girls' magazines at this time and was embraced by many pre-teen and teenage girls as a role model due to the positive way she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. About this period she says: [...] "I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn’t earned it yet." [...] She gained notoriety in 1992 for saying that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties in Interview magazine. In a 1994 interview for the magazine Vox, she said she was surprised by the effect 'outing' herself had: [...] "I think there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there who don't care about sex, but who you never hear from, so I thought I should say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beef-cake hunky guys and scantily-clad models, so I thought it would be really funny to say that I didn't care about sex in a magazine that's full of sex and beauty – but no one really got the joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E
5000|$|I'd like {{to clarify}} {{comments}} published in Playboy about religious people being weak-minded. I didn't mean all religious people. I don't {{have any problem}} with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there who think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the Founding Fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do {{have a problem with the}} people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the fundamentalist fanatics are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn't accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That's what I find weak and destructive.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Griffiths, a {{researcher}} in internet psychology at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, also addressed this question, stating: [...] "There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> lonely <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there. Some <b>people</b> {{rely heavily on}} technology and end up treating it as an electronic friend, a sounding board—just writing it down {{can make you feel}} better... That doesn't change their psychological world at that moment, but creating a kinship with like-minded people can help. You're all in this virtual space together." ...|$|R

[...] When {{it comes to the}} topic of the boys getting older, the boys' father has reflected, [...] "When the boys get to 18, I'd like them to think back and think, 'O.K., I've got something in my life which is more than just what I was when I did the 'Charlie Bit Me' video." ...|$|R
60|$|James {{had spent}} the morning gazing out of his bedroom window. The last show he would see, last of so many! So she was gone! Well, she was getting an old woman. Swithin and {{he had seen her}} crowned--slim slip of a girl, not so old as Imogen! She had got very stout of late. Jolyon and he had seen her married to that German chap, her husband--he had turned out all right before he died, and left her with that son of his. And he remembered the many evenings he and his {{brothers}} and their cronies had wagged their heads over their wine and walnuts and that fellow in his salad days. And now he had come to the throne. They said he had steadied down--he didn't know--couldn't tell! He'd make the money fly still, he shouldn't wonder. What a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there! It didn't seem so very long since he and Swithin stood in the crowd outside Westminster Abbey when she was crowned, and Swithin had taken him to Cremorne afterwards--racketty chap, Swithin; no, it didn't seem much longer ago than Jubilee Year, when he had joined with Roger in renting a balcony in Piccadilly.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{scrutiny}} {{he received from}} the media, Harrison remained wary of giving live performances. After 1974, he did not tour again until 1991, when he played a series of concerts in Japan with Eric Clapton. More recently, the 1974 Harrison-Shankar tour has been recognised by some commentators as a precursor to the 1980s world music genre, popularised by Western artists such as Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel and David Byrne. Referring to critics of the tour in a 1977 BBC Radio interview, Harrison said: [...] "It's a pity that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> missed <b>out</b> on something that went above their heads." ...|$|R
50|$|Cranes of Dereham, and its {{successor}} the Fruehauf trailer company, {{was a major}} {{employer in}} the town for many decades. Cranes built nearly all the giant trailers (100 tons plus) that carried equipment such as transformers at slow speeds across the UK, usually in the livery of Wynns or Pickfords. The launch of a new trailer was treated rather {{like that of a}} ship with <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> coming <b>out</b> to see the leviathan move through the narrow streets of the town towards the A47.

40|$|While {{the biggest}} doping scandal of the 21 st century comfortably rests on two wheels, {{there is a}} gradual {{awareness}} that <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there are interested in enhancing themselves. They {{would like to be}} smarter, more self-confident, better looking, feel sexier, and run faster. The growth in the market for so-called human enhancement agents such as neuro-enhancers and anabolic steroids has been driven by a perfect marriage of manufacturers (big pharma), distributors (doctors and pharmacists) and a new generation obsessed with vanity and the defiance of age. As in other areas of substance use, we are witnessing the migration of prescription medications with tight therapeutic indications to high school kids and office executives keen to be on top of their game to get that grade or bonus. And if you can find the right doctor with a prescription pad and a flexible diagnostic mindset or a website and a credit card, accessing many of these drugs is not hard. Methylphenidate, used for the treatment of ADD/ADHD, and Modafinil, used for the treatment of the chronic sleep disorder (narcolepsy), are the most researched active agents used for cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals. But there are others, developed to treat the cognitive decline associated with dementia or developed {{on the basis of a}} theoretical understanding of the complex cognitive processes that underlie learning and memory. So can drugs make you smarter? Probably not [...] . ...|$|R

Stuart {{has said that he}} wrote the single in just fifteen minutes aboard an airplane while suffering the effects of a hangover. He later described the success of Everything Falls Apart in a mid-2000s interview as, It was a weird thing since I had just been on the Counting Crows ride, so I didn't really have any other experience other than: you release your first record, you have your first single, and it goes on MTV and it's hit! It happened to them, it happened to me, and I thought, [...] "OK! Let's go!" [...] In terms of making my life strange, it was great. There was obviously some money and I've been able to build something of a career on it. In terms of that being the thing that brought <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> to shows and created a base of an audience for me or Dog's Eye View, it didn't really happen because people knew one song and kinda went, [...] "Alright," [...] and it didn't really progress past that.
