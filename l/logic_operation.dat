When the PCMI is working in polarization preserving mode, complete subtraction is achieved. However, when the PCMI operates in non-polarization preserving mode, and the two phase conjugate beams are of nearly orthogonal polarizations to that of input polarizations, coherent addition is observed. By varying the polarization angle of the two phase conjugate outputs, continuous <b>logic</b> <b>operations</b> are achieved.

50|$|The opcode input is a {{parallel}} bus that conveys to the ALU an operation selection code, {{which is an}} enumerated value that specifies the desired arithmetic or <b>logic</b> <b>operation</b> to be performed by the ALU.

A <b>logic</b> <b>operation</b> performed on a two dimensional logic alphabet connective, with its geometric qualities, produces a symmetry transformation. When a symmetry transformation occurs, each input symbol, without any further thought, immediately changes into the correct output symbol. For example, by reflecting the symbol for NAND (viz. 'h') across the vertical axis we produce the symbol for ←, whereas by reflecting it across the horizontal axis we produce the symbol for →, and by reflecting it across both the horizontal and vertical axes we produce the symbol for ∨.
