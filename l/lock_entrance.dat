2500|$|In November 1865, the P.T. Company’s engineer, Colonel Belden, was {{reported}} to have drawn up plans and prepared cost estimates for a canal and locks to run {{on the east side of}} the falls, connecting the company’s newly completed boat basin with the lower river. [...] The locks designed by Colonel Belden would have allowed the transit of boats 170 feet long, and were to be 40 feet wide and have at least 6 feet of water over the foundation component under the <b>lock</b> <b>entrance,</b> called the “miter sill.” [...] There would be 8 feet of lift to each lock. [...] The P.T. Company did not plan to build the locks immediately, and was waiting for a time when business demand would be sufficient to support the project.|$|E

40|$|The general aim was, within {{psychiatric}} inpatient care, {{to explore}} patient and staff perceptions {{with regard to}} medication administration and <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> doors. In Study I, medication administration was illuminated according to a mini-ethnographic approach. Nurses and voluntarily admitted patients were observed and interviewed. Two central categories of patient and nurse experiences were identified, get control and leave control. In Study II, patients and nurses were interviewed about patient experiences of forced medication. Identified experiences {{were related to the}} disease, being forcibly medicated, and the drug. In Study III, the frequency of and reasons for <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> doors on Swedish psychiatric inpatient wards were investigated. Seventy three per cent of the doors were locked on a specific day. According to ward managers, doors were most often locked in order to prevent patients from escaping, provide security and safety, and because legalisation. In Study IV/V, voluntarily admitted patients/mental nurse assistants and nurses were interviewed about advantages and disadvantages about being cared for/working on a psychiatric inpatient ward with a <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> door. Most advantages mentioned by patients and staff were categorised as protection against “the outside”, secure and efficient care, and control over patients. Most disadvantages mentioned by patients were categorised as confinement, dependence on the staff, and emotional problems for patients. Most disadvantages mentioned by staff were categorised as extra work, confinement, dependence on the staff, and a non-caring environment. In conclusion, medication administration and <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> doors are perceived as connected with staff’s control and restricted freedom for patients. Increased reflection among staff about how medication administration and <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> doors are perceived by patients would increase staff’s possibilities to prevent potential experiences of coercion due to these situations among patients in psychiatric inpatient care...|$|R
50|$|The dock {{opened in}} 1810 and {{consisted}} of a <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> from the Mersey. This passage has since been closed off. The dock was rebuilt in 1868 by George Fosbery Lyster.|$|E
5000|$|... 28 June 1943 - {{attack on}} the U-boat pens at Saint-Nazaire. In the raid, the only {{serviceable}} <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> to the pens was destroyed. In this attack, six YB-40s were dispatched, and one German aircraft was claimed as destroyed.|$|E
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, the remaining southern <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> had closed and was partly filled in. The redevelopment of Tower Road over a decade later precipitated in the removal of the swing bridge and the sealing up of the southern passage.|$|E
50|$|There is {{supposedly}} a <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> leading {{directly from the}} station to the nearby Brooklyn Bridge Park. A 2008 study by Brooklyn Community Board 6 examined the possibility of creating a new entrance to the station from the park; however, it was deemed economically unfeasible.|$|R
50|$|The 'rocket' {{escalator}} {{was removed}} in May 2011, and {{what remained of}} Funland closed in July 2011. The <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> {{and a handful of}} left-over arcade games and attractions remained in a much quieter, emptier Trocadero centre with spaces at basement level for street dancers.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{to replace}} the Great Low Water Basin, the dock was {{originally}} constructed with three <b>lock</b> <b>entrances</b> from the river of 30 ft, 50 ft and 100 ft, and three passages onwards to the Great Float. This provided much expanded access to the Birkenhead dock system, which was also served by an entrance channel further south via Morpeth Dock.|$|R
50|$|The current lock {{was built}} in 1989 for yachts and {{pleasure}} craft, to conserve water in the Basin. It measures 100 ft by 30 ft and was built completely within the chamber of the former Ship <b>Lock</b> <b>entrance</b> to the basin. This measured 350 ft by 60 ft. The original gate-recesses {{and one of the}} gates remain in situ, to demonstrate the size of the former lock.|$|E
50|$|Gladstone Dock <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> {{is one of}} the two {{remaining}} operational river entrances in the northern dock system. Measuring 1070 ft long,130 ft wide and 42 ft deep; was wider, longer and deeper than the Panama Canal locks. The Panama Canal and Gladstone locks could accommodate a maximum size of container ship of 4,500-5,000 twenty-foot-equivalent units (TEUs). The lock provided maritime access to the container terminal of Royal Seaforth Dock, which opened in 1972.|$|E
50|$|It {{was already}} obvious that {{continued}} growth of business required further accommodation, and work was soon {{started on the}} South Dock Extension. This was opened in November 1907, and the Extension was further enlarged by 27 acres, that part opening on 14 July 1914. At the date of opening the new <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> for the South Dock Extenson was 1,000 feet long and 100 feet in width, the largest lock in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Jesse Hartley, {{the dock}} opened in 1848. Its purpose {{was as a}} half tide dock, [...] {{connected}} directly to the river via two <b>lock</b> <b>entrances.</b> These provided access between the Mersey and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. By the mid twentieth century, the dock was the principal hub for coastal and barge traffic in Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|The Isle of Dogs {{is formed}} from the <b>lock</b> <b>entrances</b> {{to the former}} West India Docks and the largest current meander of the River Thames and the {{southern}} part of the borough forms a part of the historic flood plain of the River Thames; and but for the Thames Barrier and other flood prevention works would be vulnerable to flooding.|$|R

50|$|The Swansea and Neath Railway {{station in}} Swansea was at Wind Street, on a viaduct; the booking office and waiting rooms {{were located in}} arches. Trains reached the station by {{crossing}} a drawbridge over the <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> to the North Dock. On 29 November 1865 a coal train ran over {{the location of the}} drawbridge when it was open for shipping, and there was a serious accident; the two men on the footplate perished.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature is}} the two alternative routes that exist around {{either end of the}} Leopoldkanaal locks just east of Zeebrugge, and the similar single track diversion around the inland end of the Boudewijnkanaal lock. This avoids delays to the tram schedule when the road bridge that the tram line normally follows is raised for boats passing under it. A similar feature exists {{at the southern end of}} Ostend station around the <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Vlotdok.|$|E
5000|$|Opened in 1851, {{the site}} was {{originally}} part of both Sandon Dock and Wellington Half Tide Dock, which connected directly to the Mersey via a narrow <b>lock</b> <b>entrance.</b> At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, Sandon Dock was redeveloped and an enlarged half tide dock created, with two larger locks built either side of the original entrance. After these access channels were sealed in March 1977, the water quality in the dock was noted to have improved.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{having two}} 45 ft <b>lock</b> <b>entrances</b> to the Mersey, the north gates were sealed with a {{concrete}} dam in 1937. The south gates are modified {{to accommodate a}} valve to admit river water. To {{the outside of the}} river entrances are two granite octagonal gatemen's shelters, also designed by Hartley. An island built of masonry, which has its own lighthouse, separates the river entrances.|$|R
50|$|First {{suggested}} in 1809, the dock {{was built by}} Jesse Hartley between 1827 and 1832, when it opened, specifically for importing timber. The dock was Hartley's first. It consisted of two <b>lock</b> <b>entrances</b> from the river. In 1854, Cato, Miller & Company built ships at Brunswick Dock. The dock was rebuilt with a southern extension in 1905 by Anthony George Lyster. The dock closed in 1975, although one lock was reopened in 1987 for small watercraft.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly afterwards, {{hundreds}} of protesters gathered outside the <b>locked</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Capitol, chanting [...] "Break down the door!" [...] and [...] "General strike!" [...] The crowds grew to thousands, surging into the Capitol. Police {{did not attempt}} to remove them. Department of Administration spokesman Tim Donovan said although protesters were being encouraged to leave, no one would be forcibly removed. Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz said he had instructed Madison Police Chief Noble Wray not to allow his officers to participate in removing demonstrators from the building.|$|R
50|$|Seaforth Dock (also {{known as}} the Royal Seaforth Dock) is a {{purpose-built}} dock and container terminal, on the River Mersey, England, at Seaforth, {{to the north of}} Liverpool. As part of the Port of Liverpool and Liverpool Freeport, it is operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. Situated at the northern end of the dock system, it is connected to Gladstone Dock to the south, which via its <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> provides maritime access to Seaforth Dock from the river.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} larger vessels, the 30 ft and 50 ft lock entrances and passages were combined into an 80 ft system and deepened, between 1926-9. [...] This meant {{the removal of}} a river <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> and an access channel to the Great Float, in order to reconstruct the remaining facilities. At the same time, a bascule bridge and a swing bridge were constructed over two remaining passages. The dock was arranged so that the whole dock {{could be used as}} a lock.|$|E
50|$|Local Member of the UK Parliament, Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot of Margam Castle, {{recognised}} that improved transportation could stimulate industrial growth. As local MP {{he introduced}} a Bill in 1834 which approved the set-up of the Aberavon Harbour Company {{to develop the}} port facilities. A further Act in 1836 authorised the diversion of the river into a new channel to enable a new dock to be constructed by the renamed Port Talbot Dock Company in Rice Mansel Talbot's honour. Completed in 1837, it is considered the first major docks in South Wales, ahead even of developments at Cardiff Docks. The <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> was enlarged in 1874.|$|E
25|$|Open {{units are}} {{psychiatric}} units {{that are not}} as secure as crisis stabilization units. They are not used for acutely suicidal persons; the focus in these units is to make life as normal as possible for patients while continuing treatment {{to the point where}} they can be discharged. However, patients are usually still not allowed to hold their own medications in their rooms, because of the risk of an impulsive overdose. While some open units are physically unlocked, other open units still use <b>locked</b> <b>entrances</b> and exits depending on the type of patients admitted.|$|R
50|$|Jamestown Harbour is also {{surrounded}} by 5 heritage waterways, which are: ①Poplar Dock and its sole ancillary structure, ②the Poplar Dock <b>Entrance</b> <b>Lock.</b> Both are Grade II listed. ③Blackwall Basin and its two ancillary structures, ④the Blackwall Basin <b>Entrance</b> <b>Lock,</b> and ⑤the Blackwall Basin Graving Dock. All three are Grade I listed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hexagonal}} Victoria Tower, {{consisting of}} six clock faces, is located between the now disused <b>lock</b> <b>entrances.</b> The tower {{was based on}} an 1846 design by Philip Hardwick and built by Jesse Hartley in 1847-8 using irregular shaped granite blocks. The tower is inscribed with the date of its construction: '1848'. South of the former river entrance is the former Dock Master's Office, also built by Hartley in 1848 using masonry in the Cyclopean style. The tower's bell provided tidal and weather warnings to shipping. Although Grade II listed, the buildings are now disused and derelict.|$|R
50|$|As built (1912) {{the dock}} {{consisted}} of a main basin 1100 ft square, with two arms to the northwest and south west of approximately 1250 by 375 ft long by wide; a total enclosed area of 55.5 acre. The design incorporated space for two further arms on the east side, mirroring the western arms. The entrance lock was 840 by 90 ft split by lock gates into sections of 320 and 540 ft; the lock had 28 ft of water depth at ordinary spring tides. At the entrance where two jetties extending 650 ft into the river, forming a guiding shape for the <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> - the eastern jetty {{was intended to be}} used for passenger services, whilst the western jetty found initial use as a coal loading point.|$|E

5000|$|Machinery on the dock, {{including}} capstans and {{the lock}} gates were worked by hydraulic power. The dock incorporated {{its own power}} supply, consisting three 20 by 6 ft (long by diameter) boilers supplying a [...] steam engine which powered both the hydraulic system via a hydraulic accumulator at , {{as well as being}} able to pump mains water around the dock. The works also required the resiting (1864) of the goods line and sidings of the North Eastern Railway's (NER) Hull and Selby Line; when complete the dock included a connection to the NER, and had doubled track or wider rail sidings on both quays, with the rails crossing the <b>lock</b> <b>entrance</b> by a hydraulically operated swing girder bridge. The dock's sidings were connected to the NER's system west of the dock.|$|E
