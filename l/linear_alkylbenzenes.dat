40|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes,</b> LAB, {{formed by}} the Alel 3 or HF catalyzed {{alkylation}} of benzene are common raw materials for surfactant manufacture. Normally they are sulphonated using S 03 or oleum to give the corresponding linear alkylbenzene sulphonates In > 95 % yield. As concern has grown about {{the environmental impact of}} surfactants,' questions have been raised about the trace levels of unreacted raw materials, <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes</b> and minor impurities present in them. With the advent of modem analytical instruments and techniques, namely GCIMS, the opportunity has arisen to identify the exact nature of these impurities and to determine the actual levels of them present in the commercial linear,alkylbenzenes. The object of the proposed study was to separate, identify and quantify major and minor components (1 - 10 %) in commercial <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes.</b> The focus of this study was on the structure elucidation and determination of impurities and on the qualitative determination of them in all analyzed linear alkylbenzene samples. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, (GCIMS) study was performed o~ five samples from the same manufacturer (different production dates) and then it was followed by the analyses of ten commercial <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes</b> from four different suppliers. All the major components, namely linear alkylbenzene isomers, followed the same elution pattern with the 2 -phenyl isomer eluting last. The individual isomers were identified by interpretation of their electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectra. The percent isomer distribution was found to be different from sample to sample. Average molecular weights were calculated using two methods, GC and GCIMS, and compared with the results reported on the Certificate of Analyses (C. O. A.) provided by the manufacturers of commercial <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes.</b> The GC results in most cases agreed with the reported values, whereas GC/MS results were significantly lower, between 0. 41 and 3. 29 amu. The minor components, impurities such as branched alkylbenzenes and dialkyltetralins eluted according to their molecular weights. Their fragmentation patterns were studied using electron impact ionization mode and their molecular weight ions confirmed by a 'soft ionization technique', chemical ionization. The level of impurities present i~ the analyzed commercial <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes</b> was expressed as the percent of the total sample weight, as well as, in mg/g. The percent of impurities was observed to vary between 4. 5 % and 16. 8 % with the highest being in sample "I". Quantitation (mg/g) of impurities such as branched alkylbenzenes and dialkyltetralins was done using cis/trans-l, 4, 6, 7 -tetramethyltetralin as an internal standard. Samples were analyzed using. GC/MS system operating under full scan and single ion monitoring data acquisition modes. The latter data acquisition mode, which offers higher sensitivity, was used to analyze all samples under investigation for presence of linear dialkyltetralins. Dialkyltetralins were reported quantitatively, whereas branched alkylbenzenes were reported semi-qualitatively. The GC/MS method that was developed {{during the course of this}} study allowed identification of some other trace impurities present in commercial LABs. Compounds such as non-linear dialkyltetralins, dialkylindanes, diphenylalkanes and alkylnaphthalenes were identified but their detailed structure elucidation and the quantitation was beyond the scope of this study. However, further investigation of these compounds will be the subject of a future study...|$|E

40|$|Selected sodium salts of {{functionalized}} {{fatty acids}} {{were subjected to}} Curie-point pyrolysis and their pyrolysis products subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in order to study the thermal dissociation mechanisms of lipid moieties in bio- and geomacromolecules. Pyrolysis of the sodium salts of hydroxy and keto acids yields in each case a methylketone as the major product, which is generated via a concerted, six-membered ring rearrangement triggered by the functionality in the alkyl chain. The thermal dissociation of alkylbenzene and alkylthiophene moieties proceeds mainly via hydrogen abstraction at the - and -carbon atoms, followed by -scission. The ratios of the main product pairs, i. e. styrene/toluene and vinylthiophene/ 2 -methylthiophene, are largely controlled by radical mobility during pyrolysis. The major fragmentation pathway of monounsaturated alkyl chains is -cleavage adjacent to the double bond. The identification of both Z and E isomers of alkenes in the pyrolysates demonstrates that the initial stereospecifity of the double bond is not retained during pyrolysis. The formation of <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes</b> from non-phenylic precursor moieties (e. g. diunsaturated fatty acids) shows that specific alkylbenzenes in Curie-point pyrolysates are not always derived from monoaromatic precursors.

The mobility of PCBs was assessed using solutions of 0. 5 mol L 1 CaCl 2 and 25 mg L 1 <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzenes</b> sulfonate (LAS). Ultrasound-assisted pressurized solvent extraction (US-PSE) was utilized for compound separation from the solid matrix. Compounds were determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The biosolids, containing a background PCB concentration about 300 lg kg 1, were spiked with the analytes at 300 mg kg 1 to obtain a clearer determination of their behavior when the biosolid was mixed with soil. In biosolid-amended soils, an increase was observed in the extractability of PCBs with increasing incubation time, which may be attributed to organic matter breakdown. The leaching column study showed that CaCl 2 was unable to mobilize the PCBs from the biosolid to the soil, whereas LAS mobilized these compounds within the time scale implicit in the experiment (30 d). The most mobilized congeners in the columns corresponded to those with the greatest molecular weight (hexa- and heptachlorinated), probably due to the higher hydrophobicity of these compounds. Results indicate that the presence of important concentrations of LAS in biosolids could mobilize PCBs from soil to the freatic level.

All treatment presented in this research were performed in triplicate by using sonication bath at 30 °C, 40 kHz, 50...|$|R
40|$|Two {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) were operated at high sludge {{retention time}} (SRT) (between 30 and 75 d) in parallel to a conventional {{activated sludge plant}} (CASP) conducted at SRT = 10 d. The fate of <b>linear</b> <b>alkylbenzene</b> sulfonate (LAS), nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPnEO, n = 1 − 15), nonylphenoxy carboxylates (NPnEC, n = 1 − 2), and nonylphenol (NP) in these systems was investigated. All systems were very efficient in the removal of LAS (around 99...|$|R
