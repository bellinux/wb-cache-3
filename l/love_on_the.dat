5|$|Harold Brighouse's play Hobson's Choice {{takes place}} in the Salford of 1880, and the 1954 film version was shot in the town. Walter Greenwood's 1933 novel <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dole was set in a fictional area known as Hanky Park, said in the novel to be near Salford, but in reality based on Salford itself. A more modern fictional setting {{influenced}} by the area is Coronation Streets Weatherfield. The Salford of the 1970s was the setting for the BAFTA award winning East is East. Salford was featured in the second series of the Channel 4 programme The Secret Millionaire, screened in 2007. Salford is also home to the theatre venue Studio Salford.|$|E

5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the ball at their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of the ball at the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. The attempt was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. The attempt was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of {{the ball on the}} ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The attempt was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E

25|$|Rivette's {{difficulties}} in securing financial backing for his films {{during the late}} 1970s {{led him to a}} business partnership with Pierre Grise Productions and producer Martine Marignac. The company was the chief distributor and financier for all his subsequent films. Their first film, 1984's <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ground, again concerned a theatrical group and the blurring of fiction and reality.

25|$|One of the {{surviving}} myths in which Zephyrus features most prominently is that of Hyacinth. Hyacinth was a very handsome and athletic Spartan prince. Zephyrus {{fell in love with}} him and courted him, and so did Apollo. The two competed for the young man's love, but he chose Apollo, driving Zephyrus mad with jealousy. Later, catching Apollo and Hyacinth throwing a discus, Zephyrus blew a gust of wind at them, striking Hyacinth in the head with the falling discus. When Hyacinth died, Apollo created the hyacinth flower from his blood. Apollo was furious, but Eros protected Zephyrus, as the act was committed in the name of <b>love,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that the wind god served Eros forever.|$|E

25|$|Nate Davis {{passed for}} 326yards and four touchdowns, {{but it was}} the Cardinals’ defense that {{repeatedly}} came up with the big plays {{in the second half of}} a 35–23victory over the Midshipmen. Davis passed for 215yards in the first half, including touchdowns of 61yards to Dante <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second play of the game and 30yards to Briggs Orsbon late in the second quarter. Love, who tied a school record with his eleventh game of at least 100yards receiving, also rushed for a touchdown and caught a go-ahead 8yard touchdown pass from Davis midway through the third quarter. After Love’s second touchdown catch put Ball State ahead 28–23, Navy threatened to take the lead again late in the third period. Shun White, who set a Navy rushing record with 348yards and three touchdowns in the previous week, was stopped at the 3yard line, and quarterback Jarod Bryant, who ran for Navy’s first two touchdowns, was held for no gain on fourth down, giving the ball back to the Cardinals. Ball State then put the game out of reach with a 97-yard drive, scoring the clinching touchdown on a 35-yard pass from Davis to Darius Hill early in the final period. The game was nationally televised on ESPN and earned a 1.2 Nielsen rating, making it the best regular season national television rating for a Mid-American Conference home game since 2005.|$|E

She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in The Day Will Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.|$|E
