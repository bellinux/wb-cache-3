Afterward, the domestic partnerships provisions of District law were incrementally expanded.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-December 2014, Congress {{passed an}} omnibus {{spending}} bill (nicknamed the [...] "CRomnibus" [...] - a portmanteau of omnibus and continuing resolution) {{that ended the}} federal ban on medical marijuana, but that also included a <b>legislative</b> <b>rider</b> targeted at D.C.'s Initiative 71. The rider's final language barred the use of funds to [...] "enact any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution of any schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or any tetrahydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes." [...] The final language notably solely used the phrase [...] "enact" [...] rather than [...] "enact or carry out." [...] Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said that [...] "she was told by Democratic budget negotiators that the omission was made on purpose to give city leaders a chance to argue that in moving forward, the District is only carrying out, and not enacting, the measure." [...] Norton reiterated this point in an Initiative 71 questions and answers section on her House Web site.|$|E

We {{recommend}} that the Pacific Salmon Commission, along with the participating management agencies of the PST process, develop an implementation plan {{by the end of}} this current meeting cycle for the Expert Panel Report’s Peer Reviewed recommendations, especially the creation of a funding strategy for the “Grand Experiment. ” We view this implementation plan as a critical step in protecting and conserving our shared salmon resource. It will help ensure the protection of the CWT recovery program as an effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation tool for harvest management programs coastwide, and it is a crucial step in protecting the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in salmon recovery. The need for this Expert Panel Report regarding the coded wire tag recovery program arose from the unilateral implementation of a mass marking and mark selective fishing program for hatchery produced Chinook and coho salmon. These programs have since been federalized through a <b>legislative</b> <b>rider</b> on federal appropriations bills, without benefit of Congressional hearings or research into the real costs of mass marking and mark selective fishing. The unilateral implementation of a mass marking and mark selective fishing program for hatchery Chinook an...|$|E

See <b>legislative</b> <b>riders</b> in France.|$|R

40|$|On July 31, 1995, {{in passing}} H. R. 2099, the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriation Bill for FY 1996, the House {{approved}} numerous <b>legislative</b> <b>riders,</b> or provisions in bill language, which would prohibit EPA from spending FY 1996 funds {{on a number}} of regulatory and enforcement activities. In passing H. R. 2099 on September 27, 1995, the Senate did not accept the House-passed riders but did include several other riders. On November 2, 1995, the House approved a motion to instruct the House conferees to strike the 17 major House-passed riders...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to golden parachutes, CEOs often negotiate for personal side payments {{in connection with}} the sale of their firms. Side payments differ from golden parachutes in that they are negotiated ex post in connection with a specific acquisition proposal, whereas golden parachutes are part of the executive’s employment agreement negotiated when she is hired. While side payments may benefit shareholders by countering managerial resistance to an efficient sale, they {{can also be used to}} redistribute merger proceeds to management. This Article highlights an overlooked distinction between pre-merger golden parachutes and merger side payments. Similar to a <b>legislative</b> <b>rider</b> attached to a popular bill, management can bundle a side payment with an acquisition that is desired by target shareholders. Thus, even if shareholders would not have approved the side payment for purposes of ex ante incentives, they may support the payment as part of a take-it-orleave-it merger vote. Because side payments are bundled into merger transactions, voting rights cannot adequately protect shareholders against rent extraction. My analysis helps explain empirical results, which show that target CEOs sometimes bargain away shareholder returns in exchange for personal side payments. I conclude with legal reforms to help unbundle side payments from the broader merger vote...|$|E
50|$|Post-election {{conditions}} also {{permitted the}} resolution of conference deadlocks over several other reauthorizations, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a moratorium on internet taxation, and authority for satellite television systems to carry network programming. The last of these was enacted {{as one of the}} few <b>legislative</b> <b>riders</b> to be included in the omnibus appropriation bill. Failure to resolve policy disagreements, however, doomed several other reauthorizations, including the 1996 welfare reform and a highway bill, although the latter had also been delayed by demands in the Senate for assurances about the role to be played by minority conferees. Finally, a ban on assault weapons expired when the House declined to act on a measure renewing it.|$|R
50|$|In <b>legislative</b> procedure, a <b>rider</b> is an {{additional}} provision added to a bill or other measure under the consideration by a legislature, having little connection with {{the subject matter of}} the bill. Riders are usually created as a tactic to pass a controversial provision that would not pass as its own bill. Occasionally, a controversial provision is attached to a bill not to be passed itself but to prevent the bill from being passed (in which case it is called a wrecking amendment or poison pill).|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of appending substantive provisions to appropriations bills {{has become a}} favorite tool of the legislative trade in recent years. Congress has employed appropriations riders to dictate the outcome of public policy issues ranging from abortion to oil development in pristine wilderness areas. Riders have been used with particularly destructive effect to circumvent long-standing environmental policies, especially those involving the use {{of natural resources and}} public lands. In many cases, the policies affected were the result of decades of activity in Congress and in the courts, and retain broad public and <b>legislative</b> support. Appropriations <b>riders</b> have also allowed these significant changes in policy to be made without public input or legislative accountability. The policy changes implemented through the appropriations process would likely not survive the scrutiny of natural resources committees and full floor debate. Appropriations riders have mandated dramatic changes in these carefully brokered policies, with highly disruptive effects on the long-term management and the sustainability of the public lands and natural resources. This Article explores several recent environmental riders and proposed riders, and their likely long-term effects. In particular, it focuses on the effects of the 1995 Rescissions Act [...] specifically the Emergency Timber Salvage Rider 3 [...] on the management of natural resources within federal forest lands in the Pacific Northwest. In an attempt to provide relief to communities dependent on logging of public lands, this rider undermined decades of land management planning and overturned policies developed through extended litigation and negotiations between industry, environmentalists, state and local governments, and the executive branch of the federal government. The cumulative environmental effects of the rider are likely to persist long after the 2 ̆ 2 emergency 2 ̆ 2 indicated by the rider has passed. Yet, because of the abbreviated nature of the appropriations process, neither the public nor the legislators who voted on the timber rider were aware of its potentially far-reaching consequences. This Article argues that the appropriations process is an ill-suited vehicle for formulating major changes in policy and establishing national priorities. Indeed, the repeated abuse of the process to force executive action and, curtail judicial oversight has created a serious crisis. This Article examines several possible remedies, including the possibility of stricter judicial scrutiny of legislation passed by rider, as well as the enactment of line-item veto legislation and legislation that would give congressional germaneness rules (limiting the subject matter of provisions that can be appended to a bill) the force of law. Such legislation may be {{a step in the right}} direction; however, it may raise constitutional challenges, and, in any event, none of these options would go far enough to prevent future legislative subterfuge. Moreover, as a practical matter, the fact that an interest is,deemed a 2 ̆ 2 right 2 ̆ 2 does not necessarily preclude erosion of that right through appropriations riders. ...|$|R
