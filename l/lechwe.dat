5|$|Other notable mammal {{species in}} the zoo's {{collection}} include oriental small-clawed otters, Asian lions, meerkats, sun bears, Sumatran tigers, giant anteaters, binturong, African wild dogs, Grévy's zebras, greater one-horned rhinoceros, banteng, red river hogs, swamp wallabies, striped skunks, pygmy hippopotamus, Scottish wild cats, Malayan tapirs, white-faced saki monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs, cottontop tamarins, geladas, chinese gorals, red panda, Siberian musk deer, Nile <b>lechwe,</b> grey kangaroo and Barbary macaques.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the diverse}} bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum {{concentration}} is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, sitatunga, and <b>lechwe</b> occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, bongo and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain goats and takin live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the Barbary sheep and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication of goats and sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.|$|E
50|$|Some species, such as <b>lechwes,</b> {{pursue a}} lek {{breeding}} system, where the males gather on a lekking ground and {{compete for a}} small territory, while the females appraise males and choose one with which to mate.|$|R
5000|$|Desierto de Kalahari: an area {{based on}} Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa, where mostly animals from Central Africa, India and the Caribbean are found. This section {{includes}} white rhinoceros, Grant's zebras, blue wildebeests, <b>lechwes,</b> Cape buffalo, black crowned cranes, sarus crane, dromedary, black rhinoceros and flamingos.|$|R
50|$|Males are {{an average}} of 165 cm long and 100 - 105 cm tall at the shoulders, and weigh between 90 and 120 kg, while females are {{an average of}} 135 cm long, 80 - 85 cm tall at the shoulders, and weigh 60 - 90 kg. Nile <b>lechwes</b> live an average of 10 to 11.5 years, and most uncommonly 19 years.|$|R
25|$|In Nile <b>lechwe,</b> {{a unique}} form of marking is {{seen with the}} start of mating. The male bends {{his head to the}} ground and urinates on his throat and cheek hair. He then rubs his {{dripping}} beard on the female's forehead and rump.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt had {{recently}} returned from his African safari, having seen, admired and shot large numbers of animals. He was scornful of Thayer's theories, which he described as [...] "phantasmagoria", and the writer as [...] "a well meaning and ill-balanced enthusiast". Thayer's suggestion that the white markings {{on the body of}} the harnessed bush buck are meant to resemble [...] "flecks of water shine" [...] is dismissed as wild, with the observation from personal experience that bush buck spend little time in watery places, while the [...] "situtunga or <b>lechwe,</b> which lack the spots" [...] spend more. Roosevelt does not refrain from harshness: he describes the camouflaged flamingo theory as [...] "probably the wildest" [...] of [...] "all the wild absurdities to which Mr. Thayer has committed himself".|$|E
2500|$|African elephants, white rhinos, and giraffe {{are joined}} by zebras, Grant's gazelle, and {{ostriches}} in this area. [...] African cranes, bontebok, <b>lechwe</b> and scimitar oryx also live here. The zoo finished enlarging the elephant exhibit in 2006; it now features a pool that allows elephants to submerse and bathe.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2006, {{the park}} opened [...] "La Plaine Africaine" [...] ("The African plain"), {{an area where}} 130 {{different}} animals - some belonging to rare and protected species - live in freedom on 2.5 acre. The African plain is divided into five parts. The savannah part, where Ankole-Watusis, the Nile <b>lechwes,</b> guineafowls and black crowned cranes can be seen, is the largest. It communicates with the part reserved for giraffes. A wet land houses many breeds of birds, including pelicans and flamingos, and lemurs on an island. An adjacent enclosure is reserved for crocodiles, which are allowed to go out only escape during hot weather. At {{the east end of}} the plain, a pavilion houses the boses for antelopes, and some sandy enclosures adorned with rocks and stumps, where live yellow mongooses, porcupines, sand cats, and bat-eared foxes and turtles. Other areas in reconstruction in 2010 spring, host servals, leopards and lions.|$|R
500|$|Excluding the cephalophines (duikers), tragelaphines (spiral-horned antelopes) and the neotragines, most African bovids are gregarious and territorial. Males {{are forced}} to {{disperse}} on attaining sexual maturity, and must form their own territories, while females {{are not required to}} do so. Males that do not hold territories form bachelor herds. Competition takes place among males to acquire dominance, and fights tend to be more rigorous in limited rutting seasons. With the exception of migratory males, males generally hold the same territory throughout their lives. In the waterbuck, some male individuals, known as [...] "satellite males", may be allowed into the territories of other males and have to wait till the owner grows old so they may acquire his territory. Lek mating, where males gather together and competitively display to potential mates, is known to exist among topis, kobs, and <b>lechwes.</b> The tragelaphines, cattle, sheep, and goats are gregarious and not territorial. In these species, males must gain absolute dominance over all other males, and fights are not confined to territories. Males, therefore, spend years in body growth.|$|R
40|$|The {{beautiful}} sandstone {{building with}} its clock tower, Oregon pine floors and slate staircases {{was the first}} building to be completed {{on the campus of}} what was then the Transvaal University College (TUC). The foundation stone was laid on 3 August 1910. At the opening in August 1911, General Jan Smuts expressed the hope that the TUC would one day be to this country what Oxford was to England. Today, the staircase still features an exquisite stained glass window of the original TUC coat of arms. Designed by a student of Sir Herbert Baker, Percy Eagle, the building boasts different styles including elements of Cape Dutch and Neo-Romanesque. In recognition of its beautiful architectural style, the building was proclaimed a National Monument in 1968. The fountain {{in front of the building}} was redesigned in 1990 with two red <b>lechwes</b> (antelopes) sculpted by Coert Steynberg and sponsored by Dr Anton Rupert and his wife. Initially the building housed almost the entire University. Today it accommodates the UP Archives, Department of UP Arts, Mapungubwe Museum and the Van Tilburg collection. 5 coloured digital photos of the Old Arts Building created using a Canon EOS 350 D Digital Camera.

2500|$|The kob {{resembles the}} impala but is more robust. However, males are more robust than females and have horns. Males have {{shoulder}} heights of [...] {{and an average}} weight of [...] Females have shoulder heights of [...] and weigh on average [...] The pelage of the kob is typically golden to reddish-brown overall, but with the throat patch, eye ring, and inner ear being white, and the forelegs being black at the front. Males get darker as they get older. Those of the white-eared kob (K. k. leucotis), which {{is found in the}} Sudd region (the easternmost part of their range), are strikingly different and overall dark, rather similar to the male Nile <b>lechwe,</b> though with a white throat and no pale patch from the nape to the shoulder. Both sexes have well-developed inguinal glands that secrete a yellow, waxy substance, as well as preorbital glands.|$|E

50|$|The Upemba <b>lechwe</b> (Kobus anselli) is {{a species}} of {{antelope}} found only in the Upemba wetlands in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was described in 2005, after analysis of 35 museum specimens collected in 1926 and 1947-8. It was previously overlooked due to its similarity to the <b>lechwe</b> K. leche, especially the black <b>lechwe</b> subspecies K. l. smithemani. Some authorities treat the Upemba <b>lechwe</b> as a subspecies, K. l. anselli, of the <b>lechwe.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Cape <b>lechwe,</b> or Venter's <b>lechwe,</b> (Kobus venterae) is an {{extinct species}} {{similar to the}} red <b>lechwe,</b> Kobus leche. It was {{described}} by Robert Broom from a frontlet and horn core from Haagenstad (now known as Florisbad), which Broom believed to be an intermediate form between <b>lechwe</b> and waterbuck. However others have failed to find justification for separating the species from Kobus leche.|$|E

50|$|Even {{during the}} dry season the {{floodplains}} sustain a great deal of wildlife including grazing African buffalo, wildebeest, and elephants, zebras, and giraffes, with hippopotamus and crocodiles in the waters. There are many antelopes such as waterbucks, pukus, elands, and <b>lechwe,</b> the Bangwelu Swamp in particular being home to black <b>lechwe</b> (Kobus leche smithermani), tsessebe, and sitatunga while the Kafue Flats have large groups of Kafue <b>lechwe</b> and Burchell's zebra.|$|E

50|$|The Nile <b>lechwe</b> {{typically}} {{occur in}} shallow waters bordering deeper swamps, {{where the water}} is 10 - 40 cm deep. Nile <b>lechwe</b> are endemic to South Sudan and Ethiopia. In South Sudan, {{the majority of the}} population occurs in the Sudd swamps, and in the Machars near the Ethiopian border in smaller numbers. In Ethiopia occurs in the southwest, in Gambela National Park, but in very less numbers possibly due to human settlement and habitat degradation. The habitat of the Nile <b>lechwe</b> has been severely affected by civil wars, human displacement and resettlement, firearm attacks and increased hunting. Even its seasonal movements were restricted due to large populations of cattle in and around its range. The Nile <b>lechwe</b> population in the Sudds, however, remained somewhat stable throughout this period.|$|E
50|$|The Kafue <b>lechwe</b> (Kobus leche kafuensis), an {{antelope}} specialised {{for living}} in the marshy conditions of the flats, is endemic to the area. There were estimated to be 250,000 <b>lechwe</b> living on the Kafue Flats in 1931, {{one of the highest}} animal carrying capacities in the world at 11,000 kg per km2.|$|E

50|$|By 2005 {{the number}} of <b>lechwe</b> was {{estimated}} to have fallen to 38,000, a number which remained mostly stable until the next census completed in 2009. The declining numbers of Kafue <b>lechwe</b> {{has been attributed to}} the building of the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam and subsequent change in intensity and timing of flooding as well as illegal poaching and the pressures of rising numbers of people and cattle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lechwe</b> {{are found}} in marshy areas where they eat aquatic plants. They use the knee-deep water as {{protection}} from predators. Their legs are covered in a water-repellant substance which allows them to run quite fast in knee-deep water. <b>Lechwe</b> are diurnal. They gather in herds which can include many thousands of individuals. Herds are usually all of one sex, but during mating season they mix.|$|E
