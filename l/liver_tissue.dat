5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} <b>liver</b> <b>tissue</b> through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried <b>liver</b> <b>tissue</b> confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the <b>liver</b> <b>tissue</b> architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{measure the}} {{expression}} of NOB 1 in <b>liver</b> cancer <b>tissues,</b> and to investigate the relationship between NOB 1 and clinicopathological features of liver cancer. MethodsA total of 48 liver cancer samples were collected from the patients who underwent liver cancer surgery in our hospital from February 2011 to May 2015, and 22 samples of cirrhotic <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> and 22 samples of normal <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> were collected as controls. The immunohistochemical SP method {{was used to measure}} {{the expression of}} NOB 1 in different tissues, and the relationship between the expression of NOB 1 and clinicopathological features was analyzed. The chi-square test was applied for comparison of categorical data between groups. ResultsThe expression of NOB 1 in <b>liver</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> was significantly higher than that in cirrhotic <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> and normal <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> (72. 9 % vs 36. 4 %/ 31. 8 %; P= 0. 004 and 0. 001), while the expression of NOB 1 showed no significant difference between cirrhotic <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> and normal <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> (P＞ 0. 05). The patients with a tumor diameter of ＞ 5 cm had a significantly higher positive rate of NOB 1 than those with a tumor diameter of ≤ 5 cm (χ 2 = 4. 355, P= 0. 037), and the patients with Edmondson grade Ⅲ/Ⅳ tumor had a significantly higher positive rate of NOB 1 than those with Edmondson grade Ⅰ/Ⅱ tumor (χ 2 = 5. 127, P= 0. 024). The expression of NOB 1 in <b>liver</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> was not correlated with age, sex, presence or absence of microvascular invasion, presence or absence of lymph node metastasis, and clinical TNM stage (all P＞ 0. 05). ConclusionNOB 1 is highly expressed in <b>liver</b> cancer <b>tissues.</b> The expression of NOB 1 is closely related to tumor size and Edmondson grade, and can be used as an important tumor marker for liver cancer...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To quantitatively {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} p 16 hypermethylation on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatocirrhosis using a meta-analysis of available case-control studies. METHODS: Previous studies have primarily evaluated the incidence of p 16 hypermethylation in HCC and corresponding control groups, and compared the incidence of p 16 hypermethylation in tumor <b>tissues,</b> pericancer <b>liver</b> <b>tissues,</b> normal <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> and non-tumor <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> with that in other diseases. Data regarding publication information, study characteristics, and incidence of p 16 hypermethylation in both groups were collected from these studies and summarized. RESULTS: Fifteen studies, including 744 cases of HCC and 645 non-tumor cases, were identified for meta-analysis. Statistically significant odds ratios (ORs) of p 16 hypermethylation were obtained from tumor <b>tissues</b> and non-tumorous <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> of HCC patients (OR 7. 04, 95 % CI: 3. 87 %- 12. 78 %, P < 0. 0001), tumor tissues of HCC patients and healthy <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> of patients with other diseases (OR 12. 17, 95 % CI: 6. 64 %- 22. 31 %, P < 0. 0001), tumor tissues of HCC patients and <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> of patients with non-tumorous liver diseases (OR 6. 82, 95 % CI: 4. 31 %- 10. 79 %, P < 0. 0001), and cirrhotic <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> and non-cirrhotic <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> (OR 4. 96, 95 % CI: 1. 45 %- 16. 96 %, P = 0. 01). The pooled analysis showed significantly increased ORs of p 16 hypermethylation (OR 6. 98, 95 % CI: 4. 64 %- 10. 49 %, P < 0. 001) from HCC tissues and cirrhotic tissues.

The present study investigated the clinicopathological significance of a possible metastasis regulator Six 1 in HCC patients who were undergone hepatectomy. Seventy-two pairs of RNA and 103 pairs of protein from tumour and adjacent nontumour <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> of HCC patients were examined. About 85 and 60 % of HCC tumour tissues were found to overexpress Six 1 mRNA and protein, respectively, compared with nontumour <b>liver</b> <b>tissues.</b> No Six 1 protein was detected in HCC nontumour <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> and normal <b>liver</b> <b>tissues.</b> Increased Six 1 protein expression in HCC patients was significantly correlated with pathologic tumour-nodemetastasis (pTNM) stage (P 0. 002), venous infiltration (P 0. 004) and poor overall survival (P 0. 0423).

TTV DNAs in sera migrated in sizes ranging from 2. 0 to 2. 5 kb. TTV DNAs in <b>liver</b> <b>tissues,</b> however, migrated at 2. 0 to 2. 5 kb {{as well as at}} 3. 5 to 6. 1 kb. Both faster- and slower-migrating forms of TTV DNAs in the liver were found to be circular and of the full genomic length of 3. 8 kb. TTV DNAs migrating at 2. 0 to 2. 5 kb, from either serum or <b>liver</b> <b>tissues,</b> were sensitive to S 1 nuclease but resistant to restriction endonucleases, and therefore, they were single-stranded.

25|$|Hepatitis is {{inflammation}} of the <b>liver</b> <b>tissue.</b> Some people have no symptoms whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Hepatitis may be temporary (acute) or long term (chronic) depending on whether it lasts for less than or more than six months. Acute hepatitis can sometimes resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or rarely result in acute liver failure. Over time the chronic form may progress to scarring of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effects of Qushi Huayu Decoction (QSHYD), a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine, in prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats. Methods: Forty Wistar male rats were used to establish the NAFLD model by subcutaneous injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) for 4 weeks (twice weekly) along with high-fat and low-protein diet for 2 weeks. After two-week administration, the rats were randomly divided into four groups: untreated group, high-dose QSHYD group, medium-dose QSHYD group and low-dose QSHYD group. Another six rats were used as normal control. After 2 -week treatment, the following indexes were detected: (1) liver pathology; (2) contents of serum adiponectin (ADP) and liver triglyceride (TG); (3) concentrations of liver FFA, adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR 2), malonyl-coenzyme A (malony 1 -CoA), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase- 1 (CPT- 1). Results: Compared with the normal group, there were physiological changes associated with hepatic steatosis and inflammation in <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> in the untreated group as observed by oil red O staining and HE staining. The TG, FFA, malony 1 -CoA, FAS, and ACCase concentrations in <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> in the untreated group were elevated significantly. While the contents of ADP in serum and AdipoR 2, CPT- 1 and AMPK in <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> in the untreated group were decreased markedly. The pathological damages in each QSHYD-treated group were significantly less {{than those in the}} untreated group. The TG and FFA contents in <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> in each QSHYD-treated group were significantly decreased. The FAS, ACCase and malonyl-CoA concentrations in <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> of the high QSHYD-treated group were reduced markedly as compared with the untreated group. High- and medium-dose of QSHYD could significantly increase ADP content in serum and AMPK, CPT- 1 and AdipoR 2 contents in <b>liver</b> <b>tissues.</b> Conclusion: QSHYD can affect the ADP-FFA pathway by increasing the content of serum ADP, which may be one of its important mechanisms in preventing and treating NAFLD in rats...|$|R

Viramidine, however, has useful properties of less erythrocyte-trapping and better liver-targeting than ribavirin. The first property is due to viramidine's basic amidine group which inhibits drug entry into RBCs, and the second property is probably due to increased concentration of the enzymes which convert amidine to amide, in <b>liver</b> <b>tissue.</b> Viramidine is in phase III human trials and may one day be used in place of ribavirin, at least against certain kinds of viral hepatitis.

The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are {{present on the}} surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans. On the surface, they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried green coffee bean. Such compounds form a wax-like cover {{on the surface of the}} coffee bean (200 to 300mg lipids/100g dried green coffee bean) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further, such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides, linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids), palmitic acid (30% to 35% of total free lipids), and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans).

2500|$|Lipophilicity of the statins is {{considered}} to be quite important since the hepatoselectivity of the statins is related to their lipophilicity. [...] The more lipophilic statins tend to achieve higher levels of exposure in non-hepatic tissues, while the hydrophilic statins tend to be more hepatoselective. The difference in selectivity is because lipophilic statins passively and non-selectively diffuse into both hepatocyte and non-heptatocyte, while the hydrophilic statins rely largely on active transport into hepatocyte to exert their effects. High hepatoselectivity is thought to translate into reduced risk of adverse effects. It has been reported that the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) is important for the hepatic uptake of hydrophilic statins such as rosuvastatin and pravastatin.

GEP protein staining was observed in tumor cytoplasm, and the GEP protein levels of the HCCs were also significantly higher than those of the nontumor <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> and normal <b>livers</b> (P < 0. 001). The majority of HCCs demonstrated up-regulation of GEP protein compared with their adjacent <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> [79 (71. 8 %) of 110]. Positive correlation of GEP RNA with protein levels was observed in HCCs (P < 0. 01). Strong GEP expression was associated with large HCCs, venous infiltration, and early intrahepatic recurrence (P < 0. 05). Functional studies on the HCC cell line Hep 3 B demonstrated that reduction of GEP protein levels resulted in decreased cell proliferation rates, tumor invasion ability, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and tumorigenicity in nude mice (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: GEP is an important factor for HCC growth, invasion, and metastasis. GEP has the potential to serve as a tumor marker and therapeutic target. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Repeated electroacupuncture (EA) {{stimulation}} {{is known}} to stimulate {{the activity of the}} hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and to enhance the circulation level of estrogen in the ovariectomized rats. To explore the source of the increased circulation estrogen, the extragonadal aromatization was detected. Methods Female rats were divided into five groups: 1) intact (INT), 2) intact with EA in specific points (INT+EA), 3) ovariectomized (OVX), 4) ovariectomized with EA in specific points (OVX+EA) and 5) ovariectomized with EA in non-specific points (OVX+C). Radiometric assay, Western blot and RT-PCR were adopted to determine the extragonadal aromatization in subcutaneous abdominal (SA) adipose and <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> of rats. The blood concentrations of estrogen, testosterone and corticosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results The aromatase activities of the SA adipose and <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> in the OVX+EA rats increased significantly (p Conclusion Both the subcutaneous abdominal adipose and the <b>liver</b> <b>tissues</b> contributed to the effects of electroacupuncture on the extragonadal aromatization to promote the blood concentrations of estrogen in the ovariectomized rats. </p...|$|R
