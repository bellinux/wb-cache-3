5|$|As {{part of his}} {{diplomatic}} duties, Peckham {{wrote to}} Llywelyn, and in those letters the archbishop continued his criticisms of the Welsh people, this time condemning their laws as contrary to both the Old and New Testament.

5|$|Hand {{served as}} {{a federal judge in}} the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924. He dealt with fields of common law, {{including}} torts, contracts, and copyright, and admiralty law.

Most of Hand's early cases concerned bankruptcy issues, which he found tiresome, and patent <b>law,</b> <b>which</b> fascinated him.|$|E

The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Caesar {{began to}} prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a <b>law</b> <b>which</b> allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This {{transformed}} the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.|$|E
5|$|Succession {{was largely}} governed by male-preference cognatic primogeniture, under which sons inherit before daughters, and elder {{children}} inherit before younger ones {{of the same}} gender. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, announced at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011 that all 16 Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to abolish the gender-preference rule for anyone born after {{the date of the}} meeting, 28 October 2011. They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic – a <b>law</b> <b>which</b> dated from the Act of Settlement 1701. However, since the monarch is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the <b>law</b> <b>which</b> prohibits a Roman Catholic from acceding to the throne remains. The necessary UK legislation making the changes received the royal assent on 25 April 2013 and was brought into force in March 2015 after the equivalent legislation was approved in all the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
