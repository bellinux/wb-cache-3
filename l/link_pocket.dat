40|$|Increasingly {{employers}} use virtual {{teams to}} leverage business knowledge that can solve {{day to day}} business problems and create new business opportunities. Consequently, according to Bridgstock, graduates increasingly require virtual teamwork skills such as communication, negotiation and collaboration. The project presented here has researched and trialled {{the role of a}} well-designed interactive scenario in developing graduate attributes related to working with others, using virtual business entities across four faculties. One innovative outcome from this has been the scoping and linking of cross-faculty virtual developments into an overarching structure which is easily navigable and engaging for the net generation learner, and capacity building for the university. For clarity, that scaffolding or framework ‘city’ has been called Virtualopolis. This has the potential to <b>link</b> <b>pockets</b> of innovation across the university in the area of experiential learning and virtual work-integrated learning (WIL), the term expolred by Walsh within the context of Briggs 2 ̆ 7 constructive alignment. The prototype workteam scenario has multiple applications, with capacity to be a hurdle requirement, assessment item or training activity depending on the needs of the faculty’s WIL. By developing the online framework or model Virtualopolis, work-integrated teams assessment can be linked across different business entities, and used as skills preparation for experiential learning units such as internships, professional experience and workplace-based projects university-wide. This model has exciting possibilities of transferability across the higher education sector in the linkage of innovative virtual scenarios to reduce developmental costs, assessment tools/resources targeted specifically to graduate attributes, and virtual teamwork capacity building. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{presentation}} of alternatives for sustainable land development in Hamilton Proper, a planned unit development currently being built in Hamilton County Indiana by Mansur Development Corporation. The basic assumption in this study is that developments targeted at the upper income market can incorporate sustainable development techniques while maintaining profit potential characteristic of developments that do not include sustainable techniques. The research and case studies examined in this project illustrate that sustainable developments are energy efficient and environmentally sensitive when compared to more traditional developments. Also, sustainable developments can be cost effective and marketable. After considering the developer's goals for the development and several issues, the project focused on two [...] land use and density. Particular emphasis is on the viability and cost effectiveness of the techniques used to address the issues because providing realistic alternatives is an important aspect of this project. The result is four proposals that are recommended to achieve a more sustainable development. One, develop "pockets" within Hamilton Proper that combine residential, retail, office, recreation and open space land uses. Two, <b>link</b> <b>pockets</b> together by transportation systems with an emphasis on non-vehicular systems. Three, develop higher density housing types throughout the project while preserving the image of prestige. Four, increase density by utilizing different site planning techniques such as clustering and zero lot line. What can be gleaned from this study is that planned unit developments can incorporate alternative techniques that {{have a significant effect on}} energy consumption and less impact on the environment while remaining cost effective and marketable.

40|$|Periodontal probing depth is {{a measure}} of {{periodontitis}} severity. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model <b>linking</b> true <b>pocket</b> depth to both observed and recorded values of periodontal probing depth, while permitting correlation among measures obtained from the same mouth and between duplicate examiners' measures obtained at the same periodontal site. Periodontal site-specific examiner effects are modeled as arising from a Dirichlet process mixture, facilitating identification of classes of sites that are measured with similar bias. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the model's ability to recover examiner site-specific bias and variance heterogeneity and to provide cluster-adjusted point and interval agreement estimates. We conclude with an analysis of data from a probing depth calibration training exercise.

25|$|The 82nd {{airborne}} {{still had}} not gained control of the bridge across the Merderet by June 9. Its 325th GIR, supported by several tanks, forced a crossing under fire to <b>link</b> up with <b>pockets</b> of the 507th PIR, then extended its line west of the Merderet to Chef-du-Pont. The 505th PIR captured Montebourg Station northwest of Sainte-Mere-Èglise on June 10, supporting an attack by the 4th Division. The 508th PIR attacked across the Douve River at Beuzeville-la-Bastille on June 12 and captured Baupte the next day. On June 14 units of the 101st Airborne linked up with the 508th PIR at Baupte.|$|R

Savic - Berglund found that in homosexual men and heterosexual women, the blood flowed to areas involved in fear and anxiety, whereas in heterosexual men and homosexual women, it tended to flow to <b>pockets</b> <b>linked</b> to aggression. When looking at hemisphere differences, the right hemisphere was found to be slightly larger than the left in heterosexual men and homosexual women, whereas those of homosexual men and heterosexual women were more symmetrical.|$|R

With portable computers, high-speed telecommunications <b>links,</b> and wireless <b>pocket</b> communications devices, many employees can work almost anywhere {{at least some of the}} time. The potential impact on transportation is enormous, with a recent study reporting that traffic delays can be reduced 10 % for each 3 % of the workers who telework. This study examines the potential for telework to make efficiency, cost, and safety improvements to the transportation system of Alabama. The study examines the infrastructure to support telework in Alabama and makes recommendations of future actions to take advantage of telework in planning Alabama’s transportation system of th...|$|R

However, Link is stronger than he looks and fights back. The police then arrive, having been called by Gail, who had seen Link enter the premises shortly after their argument. Shelter is arrested and dragged off to jail. Gail then confesses that she is an undercover reporter, Louise Bain, and that she had been doing research into homelessness to write a proper article on it, rather than a false one drawn up by The Sun, which Ginger had derisively referred to earlier as unfairly portraying homeless people as conmen. Upset at the hurt that she has caused Link, Louise gives him a large handful of notes from her wallet before getting into a car with her friend and driving away. Watching her go, <b>Link</b> sadly <b>pockets</b> the money and questions to himself whether justice was really done since Shelter will get a roof over his head, a warm bed and three meals a day in prison, but he will not. Deciding to make another fresh start, he packs up his few belongings and decides to leave Camden.|$|R
50|$|Lost Land of the Tiger is {{a three-part}} nature {{documentary}} series {{produced by the}} BBC Natural History Unit which follows a scientific expedition to the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. The expedition team {{is made up of}} specialist zoologists, explorers and the BBC crew. Together, they explore wilderness areas from the lowland jungles to high-altitude slopes, in search of rare animals and plants. The focus of the expedition is to investigate the status of the tiger in Bhutan, where little is known of the cat's distribution or population density. Evidence of a healthy population of tigers would elevate Bhutan's importance as a sanctuary for this endangered species. It would also support tiger conservationist Dr. Alan Rabinowitz's proposal for a vast protected corridor <b>linking</b> the fragmented <b>pockets</b> of tiger habitat which lie to the south of the Himalayas.|$|R
40|$|The new dinucleating redox-active ligand (LH 4), bearing two redox-active NNO-binding <b>pockets</b> <b>linked</b> by a 1, 2, 3 -triazole unit, is {{synthetically}} readily accessible. Coordination to two equivalents of PdII {{resulted in}} the formation of paramagnetic (S=inline image) dinuclear Pd complexes with a κ 2 -N,N′-bridging triazole and a single bridging chlorido or azido ligand. A combined spectroscopic, spectroelectrochemical, and computational study confirmed Robin–Day Class II mixed-valence within the redox-active ligand, with little influence of the secondary bridging anionic ligand. Intervalence charge transfer was observed between the two ligand binding pockets. Selective one-electron oxidation allowed for isolation of the corresponding cationic ligand-based diradical species. SQUID (super-conducting quantum interference device) measurements of these compounds revealed weak anti-ferromagnetic spin coupling between the two ligand-centered radicals and an overall singlet ground state in the solid state, which is supported by DFT calculations. The rigid and conjugated dinucleating redox-active ligand framework thus allows for efficient electronic communication between the two binding pockets...|$|R

Such {{conditions are}} relevant as adverse conditions may develop, such as surging due to entrapment and compression of entrapped air pockets. Operational {{issues such as}} structural damage, geysering {{and the return of}} conveyed water to grade, among others, have been <b>linked</b> to air <b>pocket</b> entrapment. This chapter presents results from the experimental investigations of pres-sure surges caused by sudden air pocket entrapment. Steady flow was supplied in a pipeline {{in such a way that}} pressurized flows existed at the upstream end while the downstream end experienced free surface flow due to free discharge conditions at the downstream end. A combination of flow rates and slopes resulted in several gradually varied flow profiles at the discharge, with various volumes of atmospheric air at the discharge end. By suddenly closing the downstream discharge valve, an air pocket was en-trapped and surges were recorded. To emulate conditions in which surge relie...|$|R
5000|$|Morlun's race, the Ancients, is {{a central}} focus of the 2006 novel Spider-Man: The Darkest Hours by Jim Butcher, which is set after Morlun's first death but before his resurrection and return (as well as prior to {{subsequent}} revelations about his true nature and origin as revealed in Spider-Verse). In the novel, Spider-Man confronts Mortia, Thanis and Malos, other beings like Morlun, who seek revenge {{for the death of}} their fellow Ancient. With Doctor Strange unable to help Spider-Man directly due to the Ancients' role in the natural order of things meaning that he could call in greater dangers if he used his powers against them, Spider-Man is forced to team up with the Rhino- who was initially hired by the other Ancients to help them before they attempted to feed on him after he accidentally hit them in a fight- and Black Cat to defeat them. Spider-Man also speculates that the Ancients' powers are based primarily on their concentration, with them being vulnerable during feeding because their attention is more focused- based on information provided by Dex, Morlun's old servant, who explains that Morlun insisted on privacy when he fed- hence why Ezekiel was able to make Morlun bleed when he punched Morlun just as Morlun had begun to feed on Peter; Morlun succumbed to Peter's blows after Peter injected himself with radiation because he was panicking at the unexpected turn of events. With this strategy in mind, Peter, Black Cat and Rhino were able to get the drop on the Ancients by separating them and striking them each individually while they were occupied by feeding on one of the three, rendering them unconscious long enough for Spider-Man to trap the Ancients in three unique gems, each one <b>linked</b> to a <b>pocket</b> prison dimension, that Doctor Strange indirectly gave him for this purpose.|$|R
