5|$|After his {{election}} to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent {{advocate for the}} interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> by championing such causes as disarmament and Welsh nationalism. His persistence in doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. An immensely popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities. In 1966, after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan {{with the loss of}} 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, for fear that an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more.|$|E
25|$|Slavery is a {{crime against}} {{humanity}} though it is not considered genocide. There are examples of forced labor being used to execute Jews during the holocaust by the Extermination through <b>labour</b> <b>policy</b> of Nazi Germany but in general slavery is not considered genocide. However, there are slave labor systems which have killed millions of people due to inhumane treatment and war was waged in order to capture people so they could be enslaved, two particularly infamous examples being the Atlantic and the Arabian slave trades which some refer to as the Maafa or the Black Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|The Barrow-in-Furness UK Parliament {{constituency}} {{first came}} into existence during the 1885 United Kingdom general election, with David Duncan of the Liberal Party becoming the first MP for the town. The seat was won by the Conservative Party in 1892, before being won {{for the first time}} by Labour in 1906. In the subsequent forty years the seat swung between Conservative and Labour, but since 1945 it has been generally considered a Labour safe seat. In 1983, the constituency was expanded to include several commuter towns such as Dalton-in-Furness and Ulverston and was renamed Barrow and Furness. It was subsequently won by the Conservatives, with the victory attributed to Labour's stance against the nuclear-powered submarines that were being constructed in Barrow. Following a change in <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> the party won Barrow and Furness in 1992. John Woodcock has been the MP for the constituency since the 2010 general election.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> in the Czech republic. In the theoretical part the labour market is defined {{and the issue of}} unemployment is decribed. Further, <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> in the Czech republic are described, especially its tools. In the practical part data on unemployment and usage of <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> tools are analysed. Finally, efficiency of the <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> in the Czech republic is evaluated. <b>Labour</b> market <b>policies</b> in the Czech republic are efficient, because costs on unemployed persons are in comparisom with expenditure on <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> high. <b>Labour</b> market <b>policies</b> in the Czech republic also focuse on vulnerability groups on the labour market as young persons or persons with low skills...|$|R

500|$|Boyack {{said that}} as leader, she would {{campaign}} on better funding for healthcare, improvements to childcare, education and youth employment opportunities, and the devolvement of power to local government. She backed the scrapping of the Trident programme. She wanted to reform Council tax, which had been frozen since the SNP {{came to power in}} 2007, and suggested the existing eight tax bands should be redrawn. She would allow local authorities to raise a tourism tax, while environmentally friendly power firms and bus companies would be created to raise public funds. She supported establishing a consensus on whether or not to have full tax devolution, but had [...] "reservations" [...] about the prospect of devolving further taxes to Holyrood. She favoured devolving welfare benefits to Scotland. She told STV's Stephen Daisley that she wished [...] "to make Scottish Labour a force in Scottish politics again". After publishing a list of social justice-themed policies, she announced plans to establish a commission similar to the Social Justice Commission created by UK Labour leader John Smith in 1994, which had helped shape <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> in areas such as employment and welfare.|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has been}} a campaigner on {{equality}} issues and violence against women throughout her political career. Following the SNP Government's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence she was {{a key figure in}} Better Together, the cross-party movement that sought to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Lamont believes that Labour lost the 2011 election because it had lost its direction, and initiated a review of Scottish <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> on issues like devolution and the party's commitment to free universal public services. Her work won her accolades at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, for Political Impact of the Year in 2012 and Debater of the Year in 2013. In Parliamentary debates she was perceived by commentators such as The Scotsmans Andrew Whitaker as being an effective opponent to First Minister Alex Salmond, but others, including Richard Seymour of The Guardian, criticised her for clumsiness during television interviews. Lamont resigned as Labour leader in October 2014, making the announcement in a Daily Record interview in which she claimed that senior figures within the UK Labour Party had undermined her attempts to reform the Scottish party, and treated it [...] "like a branch office of London".|$|E

Tamesberger (2015) {{pointed out that the}} active <b>labour</b> market <b>policy</b> helps young people in particular to move out of an out-of-labour status.|$|R
500|$|With the {{majority}} of the Free State's revenues derived from the export of rubber, a <b>labour</b> <b>policy</b> (known by critics as the [...] "Red Rubber system") was created to maximise its extraction. Labour was demanded by the administration as taxation. This created a [...] "slave society" [...] as companies became increasingly dependent on forcibly mobilising Congolese labour for their collection of rubber. The state recruited a number of black officials, known as capitas, to organise local labour. However, the desire to maximise rubber collection, and hence the state's profits, meant that the centrally-enforced demands were often set arbitrarily without considering the numbers or the welfare of workers. In the concessionary territories, the private companies which had purchased a concession from the Free State administration were able to use virtually any measures they wished to increase production and profits without state interference. Treatment of labourers (especially the duration of service) was not regulated by law and instead was left to the discretion of officials on the ground. ABIR and the Anversoise were particularly noted for the harshness with which officials treated Congolese workers. The historian Jean Stengers described regions controlled by these two companies as [...] "veritable hells-on-earth".|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{was elected}} to lead the Scottish Labour Party in December 2011 {{following}} the resignation of Iain Gray, who stepped down {{in the wake of}} the party's second consecutive defeat by Alex Salmond's Scottish National Party in the 2011 Scottish Parliament general election. She was the first leader to take charge of the entire Scottish Labour Party, previous leaders having only had responsibility for Labour's MSPs at Holyrood, and she initiated a review of <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> on issues such as devolution and the party's commitment to free universal public services. The Scotsmans Euan McColm wrote that although Lamont was given greater autonomy over Labour in Scotland, her Westminster colleagues [...] "restrained" [...] her attempts to develop a devolution policy, and her debate on universal benefits resulted in the SNP portraying her as [...] "a politician dedicated to seizing from the people that which was rightfully theirs". Her leadership was further harmed by a controversy over the 2013 Falkirk candidate selection, in which the trade union Unite allegedly tried to engineer the selection process in the Falkirk constituency; an investigation into the matter was led from London rather than Edinburgh. Lamont also led the party through the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, during which Labour joined the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in the Better Together campaign, an alliance of parties that campaigned for a [...] "No" [...] vote. Lamont herself had a relatively low profile during the period prior to the poll, while Labour's association with the Conservatives was viewed as a betrayal among its traditional supporters.|$|E
2500|$|On three {{occasions}} the Labour Party, when in opposition, {{has been}} significantly influenced by CND {{in the direction}} of unilateral nuclear disarmament. Between 1960-1961 it was official Party policy although the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell opposed the decision and succeeded in quickly reversing it. In 1980 long time CND supporter Michael Foot became Labour Party leader and in 1982 succeeded in changing official <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> in line with his views. After losing the 1983 and 1987 general elections Labour leader Neil Kinnock persuaded the party to abandon unilateralism in 1989. In 2015 another long time CND supporter, [...] Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour Party, although the official <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> has not changed as yet in line with his views.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{election}} of John Smith as Labour Party leader in 1992, <b>Labour</b> <b>policy</b> towards the Convention - which had been against it {{before and during the}} 1992 General Election - began to change in favour of incorporation.

This was followed by the Labour Party Conference in October 1993 which agreed in a two-stage policy whereby the Convention would be incorporated into law followed by the enactment of a Bill of Rights. It was planned to entrench Convention rights using a [...] "notwithstanding clause" [...] similar to that in Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which would have led to the Convention prevailing over legislation passed by Parliament unless stated otherwise.

30|$|Active <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> play an {{important}} role in this endeavour. There is a long tradition of extensive use of active <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> in Denmark, and active <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> have been maintained during the Great Recession. With the increase in unemployment this means that there has been a volume increase in active <b>labour</b> market <b>policies.</b> The flipside of this is an expenditure increase, but so far it has been possible to accommodate this since there has been some fiscal space. This points to the importance of creating fiscal space in “good times” to be able to accommodate negative shocks. While it in the current situation may be difficult to find policy measures which significantly can boost job creation, it is important to maintain the active focus of <b>labour</b> market <b>policies</b> to prevent an increase in long-term and thus structural unemployment.|$|R
