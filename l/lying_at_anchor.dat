5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, <b>lying</b> <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> in Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} {{only by the}} 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot {{that belonged to the}} Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline, and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E

Hood sent his advice boat, the Sarah, after the sloop, and had Maxwell sail Centaur in pursuit of the schooner. After a pursuit of some , Centaur captured the schooner, {{which turned out to be}} the privateer Ma Sophie, out of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 45 men, and was armed with eight guns, which she had jettisoned during the chase.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, September 4, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, adelantado of La Florida, {{set sail}} from the harbor of St. Augustine, and {{coasting}} north, came upon four vessels <b>lying</b> <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> off {{the mouth of}} a river. These were Jean Ribault's flagship, the Trinity, and three others of his ships, which the Frenchman had left {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns because they were too large to pass the bars in safety. One of them was flying the Admiral's flag, another the flag of the Captain. Menéndez recognized at once that the French reinforcements had arrived before him, and called a council of his captains to consider what action should be taken.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November Rochambeau sent {{a message}} to Loring's {{squadron}} requesting that he be allowed to safely evacuate the port and return with his men to France. Loring refused, and so on 20 November the French general instead concluded a peace treaty with Dessalines, the terms of which insisted that the French garrison and population had to evacuate the port within ten days. Loring was informed of the terms of the agreement and although Rochambeau was ready to depart on 25 November, his ships crammed with thousands of refugees, the British squadron blocked all of the escape routes. On 30 November, as Haitian soldiers took possession of the vacated batteries and forts that protected the harbour, Rochambeau was still prevaricating, his ships <b>lying</b> <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> directly under the guns of the forts. Orders were given to the Haitian garrisons to make preparations to fire heated roundshot at the French in order to burn their ships to the waterline should the squadron still be in the harbour following the deadline. Concerned with the delay, Loring ordered Captain Bligh to enter the harbour and offer terms of surrender to Rochambeau.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November 1918, Campania was <b>lying</b> <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> off Burntisland in the Firth of Forth. A sudden Force 10 squall caused the ship to drag anchor. She {{collided}} first with {{the bow of the}} nearby battleship , and then scraped {{along the side of the}} battlecruiser [...] Campanias hull was breached by the initial collision with Royal Oak, flooding her engine room and shutting off all main electrical power. The ship then started to settle by the stern, and sank some five hours after breaking free. The ship's crew were all rescued by neighbouring vessels. A Naval Board of Inquiry into the incident held Campanias watch officer largely responsible for her loss, citing specifically the failure to drop a second anchor once the ship started to drift.|$|E
500|$|By April 29, militia mobilizing in the {{countryside}} had learned of the battles at Lexington and Concord. [...] Nearly 700 men mustered at Fredericksburg, and decided to send a messenger to Williamsburg to assess the situation before marching on the capital. [...] Peyton Randolph advised against violence, and George Washington, a longtime leader of the Virginia militia, concurred. [...] In response to their advice, the Fredericksburg militia voted by a narrow margin not to march. [...] However, militia {{from other parts of}} the colony did march to Williamsburg. [...] The Hanover County militia, led by Patrick Henry, voted on May 2 to march on Williamsburg. [...] Henry dispatched a small company to the home of Richard Corbin, who was the Deputy Collector of the Royal Revenue in Virginia, in a bid to force him to pay for the powder from Crown revenue in his possession; [...] the remainder of the Hanover County militia, numbering about 150, marched toward Williamsburg, arriving about [...] away on May 3.

500|$|The {{ship was}} {{initially}} assigned {{as the leader}} of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September–November 1933. After refitting at Portsmouth between 3 September and 23 October, Duncan led most of her flotilla to the China Station, arriving at Hong Kong on 3 January 1935. The next few years were spent [...] "showing the flag" [...] around the Far East, and visiting Japan, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Thailand and Malaya. The ship was under repairs between 14 December 1936 and 4 January 1937 from damage sustained when testing refuelling at sea techniques. She was in Shanghai during the Japanese invasion of 1937 and evacuated British civilians to Woosung, together with the sloop [...] On 28 October 1938, Duncan was struck by the Greek steamer Pipina whilst <b>lying</b> <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> at Foo Chow, China. The ship was repaired and given a refit at Hong Kong between 31 October and 14 January 1939. She was lightly damaged when struck by a high-speed target at Wei Hai Wei, China, in July 1939.|$|E
500|$|In {{anticipation}} of the start of Britain's involvement in the French Revolutionary War after the execution of King Louis XVI, Agamemnon was recommissioned on 31 January 1793. [...] She was placed {{under the command of}} Captain Horatio Nelson, and after provisioning joined the fleet <b>lying</b> <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> at the Nore. She subsequently sailed to join the Mediterranean fleet under Vice-Admiral Hood, which was blockading the French port of Toulon. On 27 August the town of Toulon declared its allegiance to the Royalist Bourbon cause, and Hood's fleet moved in {{to take control of the}} naval dockyard and the 30 French ships of the line that were in the harbour. After capturing 19 of the ships, Agamemnon was sent to Naples to ask King Ferdinand IV for reinforcements with which to secure the town; he agreed to provide 4,000 men. When the revolutionary army, commanded by Napoleon Buonaparte, launched its assault against Toulon, the troops proved insufficient to hold it, and they were forced to abandon the town. Later in the autumn, Agamemnon fought the inconclusive Action of 22 October 1793 against a French frigate squadron off Sardinia.|$|E

Other fittings were to be sold by the ton.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1808 Spear was {{transferred}} to take command of the sloop HMS Goree, aboard which he continued in the West Indies. While <b>lying</b> <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> off Marie-Galante on 22 April 1808, two brigs were spotted sailing northwards. Spear determined that they were enemies after they made no response to his private signal, and set off in pursuit. The two brigs, mounting 16 guns each and so constituting the superior force, hauled up and fired on Goree, badly damaging her sails and rigging, and disabling her. They were then forced to flee when another British ship, the 14-gun [...] arrived on the scene. Goree had one man killed and four wounded in the brief engagement, while the two brigs had combined losses of eight killed and twenty-one wounded. The brigs were later discovered to be the French Pylade and Palinure. The Palinure was later captured, causing Sir Alexander Cochrane to write in his report [...] "the last of the two [...] which were so gallantly beaten by His Majesty's sloop Goree." [...] On his return to Marie-Galante Spear came ashore to be received by the entire garrison drawn up presenting arms, drums playing a march and fifes playing Rule, Britannia!. Cochrane wrote a personal letter to Spear saying [...] "I am sorry that the spirit and gallantry displayed by yourself, officers, and crew, did not meet with the success which you all so evidently deserved". Though the action was unsuccessful and therefore not gazetted, the Admiralty acknowledged Spear's deed by confirming the appointment of his acting second-lieutenant Thomas Clack.|$|E
