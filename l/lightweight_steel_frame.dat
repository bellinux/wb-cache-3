40|$|Development {{of steel}} frame modular {{buildings}} is gaining increased popularity and support throughout Europe. Due to flexibility in construction and good long-term performance, <b>lightweight</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures are often preferred solutions, {{for instance in}} partitions and suspended ceilings {{as well as for}} load-bearing elements. In many applications the steel frame structure are required, indirectly or directly, to have a certain fire resistance performance. There is still knowledge to be gained in order to accomplish efficient rules for assessment of the behaviour of lightweight steel frames in fire situations. The lack of such rules creates a disadvantage for the elements since they will require additionally costly protection measures, or to perform expensive fire tests. The problem is more pronounced for load-bearing structures. This makes design by testing a rather inefficient method. Therefore, it is important to develop economical design rules at elevated temperature for possible implementation in Eurocode 3. The main objectives of the thesis is to evaluate FE-models for analysis of thin-walled steel columns and to compare the results with experiments at room temperature and at elevated temperatures. The main contribution of the work is to recommend the design model for a possible implementation in Eurocode 3, Part 1 - 2. The design model includes possibility of flexural and torsional-flexural failure mode. It contemplates thermal deflection, reduced yield strength and elastic modulus and is evaluated on studs with a constant temperature (symmetric heating) and with a temperature gradient (unsymmetrical heating). Constant temperature distribution is assumed along studs in both cases. Godkänd; 2004; 20070126 (ysko) </p...|$|E
40|$|My {{design project}} is {{situated}} on block K 6 {{in the city}} of Venice and I have chosen a location right above a canal to design a waterfront Bar/Nightclub. The Masque, Bar in Venice is aimed at the backpacker and younger Venetian locals. It is decorated in an almost retro/art deco style. The main facade of the building features the simplified shape of the Carnivale mask; which plays a large cultural role in Venetian theatre and entertainment. The abstract mask on the façade has eyes, a mouth and on top of the face; is a tall structure which represents the pluming feathers on the traditional mask. The building design is composed of two major structural components. First is the main building, a cube like structure constructed of rigidly braced steel frames. These frames support both concrete and timber flooring. The exterior is clad with thin marble to allow the penetration of light into the building. Copper is used to clad selected parts of the exterior to highlight and outline the features on the façade. The main building contains two levels, the ground level and the first level. The second structural component is a <b>lightweight</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structure supported from the canal bed, using a steel compressive tube. The lateral forces are balanced using truss bracing, supported from the main building. This lightweight structure houses the VIP section, which contains two levels. Overall, the building contains four levels; two for general public access and two for VIP exclusives. The ground level contains a jetty/wharf where patrons access the building via marine transport. Marine transportation is the preferred method of travel. It also contains a considerable amount of dance floor space and bar space and amenities block.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the behaviour of <b>lightweight</b> <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> (LSF) unrestrained floors, protected with gypsum board ceilings, in five standard fire resistance tests. Parameters investigated {{in this test}} series were joist spacing, number of gypsum board layers in the ceiling membrane, floor cavity insulation and presence of concrete topping in the sub-floor. The fire resistance of LSF floors appears to be essentially governed by the ability of gypsum board to remain in place under fire exposure; other factors are of secondary importance. Retrospective numerical thermal-structural simulations of these tests show good agreement with measured temperature and deformation histories. The development of floor deflections is governed by the thermal bowing of steel joists except for the last one or two minutes in the tests, when "run-away" deformations develop due {{to the formation of}} inelastic hinges near mid-span. Evaluation of bending moment resistance of heated joists using current design provisions for cold formed steel structures, adjusted to account for the deterioration of strength and stiffness of steel at elevated temperatures, leads to conservative and fairly accurate predictions of fire resistance...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Frame</b> {{technology}} (LSF) employs pro les made by thin {{steel and}} manufactured by cold forming. This technology {{dates back to}} the mid- 1800 s and today the exibility of the industrialized production enables innovations and bene ts in the use of it: buildings can be designed with a very high level of detail, using the precision of the industrial design or on-demand production. Each pro le in Cold Formed Steel (CFS) is designed and built for a speci c purpose and industrial nishing follows the work of the designer, without imposing constraints, such as modularity and mass production. The manufacturing of cold-formed steel rods is made by pro ling, or press bending. The use of CAD/CAM solutions for the design and the production promote the di usion of pro ling during LSF processing. The CFS rods can be produced of whatever length (even all of di erent lengths) from the same sheet metal strip and without interrupting or slowing down the processing. Furthermore, shapes and pro les can be many and di erent. The manufacturing is highly customizable, just so the changes in shapes and pro les are carried out in compliance with the UNI EN 1090 and meet the tolerances required by law. Design a building with the LSF system requires attention to seve- ral issues. The CFS is a real system and a ects the calculation of the structures so, a correct approach to the project is crucial. The collaboration between designer, structural engineer, engineering, manufacturer, and con- struction company can’t be underestimated. The quality of the project and of teamwork allow to realize low cost buildings in a short time and with high performance. These design principles also allow the development for an accurate sustainability analysis. Thanks to the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), all kinds of processing can be described in terms of energy and CO 2 emission costs. This analysis can be performed right from the ma- terials production and construction elements. The research focuses on the project and the buildings even during the phase of use, consider main- tenance and theorize the disas-sembly operations (or demolition) and recycling (or reuse) of the constituent parts of the buildings. Some early data collected, even about the end of life of buildings (case studies), show the advantages associated with dry machining in terms of savings in economic and environmental costs in comparison with buil- dings constructed with traditional technologies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract New methods, {{techniques}} and tools {{for the building}} industry are constantly being developed and improved and launched on the market. The problem in the building industry development {{is not that the}} products are not good enough. The problem is instead that the existing construction companies do not choose to use these innovations, instead they continue to employ the technologies they already possess and master. This leads {{to the fact that the}} construction industry is, in the public eye, beeing seen as a conservative industry. AquaVilla is a company that basically produces houseboats. In order to be able to expand they now want to launch their frame system, Casabona. Casabona consists of a <b>lightweight</b> <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> integrated with the EPS-insulation, making it ideal for houses on the water. To allow the company to grow they now wants to introduce the frame system in houses on land. The purpose of this report is to find the problems or difficulties which may arise during the launch of a new product in an industry perceived as beeing conservative. In addition, we make a comparison between different framing systems where the advantages and disadvantages of respective framing systems is presented. All this is done in order to find out what chances a new framing system like Casabona has to establish itself on the market. The goal of this report is to get a greater understanding of how the construction industry looks on new products. In order to arrive at the analyses and the results we achieved, we first made a field study at Aquavillas production plant in Västervik. During our visit we gained a deeper understanding of how the Casabonas system is built up. We then began to study the litterature about steel structures in General. After that we read about two big companies on the Swedish market, Lindab and Gyproc who seperatly manufacture framing systems similar to Casabona. When we had gained a broader understanding of steel, we began to interview the companies operating in the construction industry in Halmstad. The interviews gave us a greater insight about what designers, installers and architects thought about steel constructions. The conclusion that we can draw from our results and our analyses is that Casabona has a good chance to enter the Swedish market. With a successful product Aquavilla will also acquire a strong brand and reach out to customers even easier. The report will cover 3 different framing system that we have reviewed and compared.

A novel approach was presented for the seismic HSE index of LSF systems using the simultaneous incorporation of the non-linear analysis results and the correction coefficient describing the seismic geotechnical effects. The presented seismic HSE index accurately demonstrates the seismic performance of the LSF structures. Additionally, a two-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained using the results of the FE model, and a non-linear relationship was obtained to predict the seismic damage index. Finally, the proposed seismic HSE index was validated using statistical analyses, indicating that the proposed method does not yield a significant difference compared to the ANN results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Framing</b> (LSF) {{system has}} been {{proposed}} as an economical system that is earthquake resistant. Due to the lightness of LSF structures, the seismic performance of middle-rise buildings has been improved. Nowadays, various numerical-analytical methods have been proposed for seismic assessment of conventional structures. Using scientific and statistical standards, this article provides two new methods for calculating the damage index of LSF structures. Once this index is determined, a correct understanding of structural behavior is obtained and the retrofitting criteria are drawn. The modified relationship method is based on Papadopoulos relationship which is modified using modification factors of seismic geotechnics. From another viewpoint, non-linear static {{analysis was used to}} calculate the criteria of this relationship. To detect the limit of the first failure and destruction of the entire structure, the formation of plastic hinges in columns is considered. Material properties were defined according to the performed experimental studies. To give a qualitative simple and functional damage index, the functional method was given {{in the form of a}} qualitative method with statistical analysis and collection of different views. Using this method is very simple and meantime offers suitable accuracy. With a numerical study on three LSF models there were made clear that the difference of the new method and the amended method of Papadopoulos is approximately 5 %. This shows that the given qualitative method is suitable to be used in broad terms. Since the damage index of light steel structure for Model 1 and Model 3 are between 0. 4 and 0. 8, it is necessary to rehabilitate these structures using the modified method and the proposed qualitative damage index...|$|R

40|$|This thesis covers {{research}} in the floor vibration field. Although <b>lightweight</b> <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> constructions have been in focus, many results are applicable to floors in common {{and to some extent}} also to vibrations in general. Whether a floor is treated as "good" or "bad" by the occupants is an interaction of a) the dynamic properties of the floor and of b) human vibration perception. Both these factors are covered. Two <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> floors were tested in laboratory condition with respect to its dynamic. Modal testing was used to obtain the modal parameters, i. e. natural frequencies, damping and mode shapes. Both floors were tested for numerous set-ups where for example the effect of different supports, top layers, ceiling joists and simulated partitions were investigated. For one of the floors, subjective opinions were collected for correlation with the measured data. The research of floor dynamic has lead to a creative new method that utilizes strategically positioned small pieces of visco-elastic material to increase the damping of the floor. It was found out that this economic and proportionally easy method significantly increases the damping for some specific type of modes. The human vibration sensitivity was tested in a new developed motion simulator. Absolute threshold values for single sinusoidals were tested in the frequency range of 5 - 31. 5 Hz. For validation of the test setup, the results were compared with data from other similar studies. The obtained thresholds agreed satisfactorily with previously reported results. More innovated tests were performed concerning multiple frequency signals of two to five discrete frequency components. The results show that a signal's composition in terms of number of frequency components and their mutual amplitude relation significantly affect the subjective perception. Therefore, {{it can be argued that}} multiple natural frequencies of a floor should be considered when it comes to design rules. This is in opposition to many floor design criteria of today since these often rely upon the fundamental frequency only. A prediction model, where the acceptance is calculated as a function of the frequency weighted total acceleration amplitude in combination with the fundamental frequency is suggested. The presented model does take into account the presence of possible multiple response frequencies. Godkänd; 2006; 20061205 (haneit...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} houses of <b>lightweight</b> timber or <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> {{construction}} being built over {{recent years has}} increased significantly. These buildings have low thermal mass and {{may be subject to}} large temperature fluctuations and particular overheating during the summer and this problem is set to get worse with the changing climate. Researchers have been investigating the use of PCMs (phase change materials) for improving thermal mass in lightweight buildings and found them to be effective. However, until recently, various problems have prevented products from entering the commercial market. In the last few years microencapsulated paraffin PCMs have been developed that are easy to use and building products are now available to buy containing these materials. Although there is significant academic research relating to PCMs for thermal buffering in lightweight buildings, {{there is a lack of}} field trials and case studies of PCMs in buildings in use. There is also a lack of information and guidance for designers and building owners. Recommendations are made for further research to discover the viability of uptake for PCM wallboard technology and the provision of information about the benefits of the products to the public and industry professionals...|$|R
25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, <b>lightweight,</b> tubular <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single wheel suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the body builder Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' engine / gearbox unit went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|R
