40|$|Abstract—Networks {{based on}} Ethernet {{bridging}} scale poorly as bridges flood the entire network repeatedly, and several schemes {{have been proposed}} to mitigate this flooding problem; however, none have managed to eliminate flooding completely. We present Automatic Integrated Routing (AIR) as the first routing protocol that eliminates flooding by assigning <b>prefix</b> <b>labels</b> to switches and building a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The DHT maps host identifiers to the <b>prefix</b> <b>labels</b> of the switches through which they connect to the network. Each switch is assigned a <b>prefix</b> <b>label</b> using neighbor-to-neighbor messages. <b>Prefix</b> <b>labels</b> denote {{the locations of the}} switches in the network, and the <b>prefix</b> <b>labels</b> of any two switches automatically determine one or multiple routes between them. The DHT stores the mapping between the name of a host and its network location (<b>prefix</b> <b>label)</b> in a scalable fashion, with any one switch storing only a fraction of all the mappings. In contrast, prior approaches using DHTs to resolve host names incur the communication and storage overhead introduced by an underlying link-state routing protocol. Results using packet-level traces of Internet traffic demonstrate that AIR attains performance gains of orders of magnitude over Ethernet bridging and prior DHT-based schemes. I...|$|R

This thesis applies unsupervised morpheme induction method, based on the statistical behavior of words, to induce morphemes for word segmentation. The morpheme cache for the purpose is based on the Dirichlet Process (DP) and stores frequency information of the induced morphemes and their occurrences in a Zipfian distribution. This thesis uses a number of empirical, morpheme-level grammar models to classify the induced morphemes under the <b>labels</b> <b>prefix,</b> stem and suffix. These grammar models capture the different structural relationships among the morphemes. Furthermore, the morphemic categorization reduces the problems of over segmentation. The output of the strategy demonstrates a significant improvement on the baseline system.

The <b>prefix</b> <b>labeling</b> scheme can determine all the four basic relationships fast if the XML tree is shallow. However, if the XML tree is deep, the prefix scheme is inefficient since the prefix is long. Furthermore, the prefix_label is repeated by all the siblings (only the self_labels of these siblings are different). Thus in this paper, we propose the P-Containment and P-Prefix schemes which can determine all the four basic relationships faster no matter what the XML structure is; meanwhile P-Prefix can reduce the redundancies in the <b>prefix</b> <b>labeling</b> scheme...|$|R

As {{it is the case}} with monolingual dictionaries, it is becoming increasingly common to find morphological elements in bilingual dictionaries. Presenting such elements in a bilingual context, however, raises questions as to representations of meaning, translation selection and choice of examples. We show a comparison of the treatment of productive prefixes of Italian in 5 bilingual dictionaries-French was the target language in three of them, English in the other two. This comparison shows the differences in the treatment of prefixation and its coverage. First, we notice that not all the prefixes are represented in these dictionaries, and that some lexical elements are <b>labelled</b> as <b>prefixes</b> even if this status is contested. In terms of treatment, we examine in particular aspects of polysemy and of multiple translations. Regarding the polysemy of some prefixes, many dictionaries simply avoid marking the difference, while others add specific sense indicators. The most frequently used method for presenting the translation of prefixes, however, is through examples. In analysing these examples, we notice the inadequacy of certain translation equivalents, especially from a productive point of view. There is a noticeable absence of any information on the productivity of these constructional elements. From the perspective of understanding neologisms and sometimes even producing them, this lack of precision is regrettable...|$|R

The resulting calculus (k-Clusters Tableaux) is effective for automated proofs, applicable to a wide range of modal logics, and adaptable to many search heuristics.

It is shown that the proposed routing scheme is deadlock- and livelock-free. The approach is extended to multicasting in which the multicast packet is first forwarded up the tree to the longest common prefix (LCP) of destinations in the multicast.

40|$|Abstract With {{the growing}} {{importance}} of XML in data exchange, much research tends {{to provide a}} compact labeling scheme and a flexible query facility to extract data from dynamic XML trees. In this paper, we first propose GRP, namely GRoup based <b>Prefix</b> <b>labeling</b> scheme. Compared to the previous labeling schemes, the total size of labels in GRP is much shorter. Experiment results with synthetic and real life data show {{that the size of}} labels with GRP is about 2 %- 10 % of that with the previous labeling scheme. Based on GRP, we further propose GRJ (GRoup based structural Join), a structural join algorithm. GRJ is similar to the hash join algorithm in RDBMS and needs to scan the join data only twice. Furthermore, unlike other structural join algorithms, GRJ can perform efficiently without dependency on the join data sorted or indexed, for the data in the dynamic XML trees are usually unsorted. Finally our experiments show that GRJ is efficient in supporting structural joins on the context of dynamic XML trees. ...|$|R
40|$|We present  Multi-root  Automatic Incremental Routing (MAIR), an {{efficient}} routing approach for  mobile  ad hoc networks (MANET). MAIR  has a low routing stretch (ratio of selected path to shortest path length) and provides multiple paths to each destination. Every node is assigned multiple <b>prefix</b> <b>labels</b> {{with respect to}} multiple roots in the network. The roots are distributed in the network such that the paths calculated {{from each of the}} root labels are as disjoint as possible from each other. The labels of a node are stored distributively in hash tables at ``anchor nodes" across the network. Data packets are routed using the distributed hash table (DHT) lookup and longest prefix match with neighbor labels. This eliminates the need to maintain large routing tables in the nodes, which substantially reduces the routing state at each node. A region of interest (ROI) is formed around each active source-destination pair using the node labels. The nodes in the ROI maintain the most recent mapping of the node identifier  of a destination to its labels. This reduces the route establishment delay for the nodes inside ROI as the need for DHT lookup is reduced. ...|$|R

The commu-nications for such systems will typically be over wireless links and may require that the robots form an ad hoc network and communicate on a peer-to-peer basis.

In this paper, we consider a subclass of this problem in which the initial and final topologies are trees, and the movement restrictions are given {{in terms of the number}} of edges in the graph that must be traversed.

Our topology reconfiguration algorithm uses the concept of <b>prefix</b> <b>labelling</b> and routing to move nodes through the network while maintaining network connectivity.

The sequences that are fixed are precisely those that describe themselves — every term t is equal to the number of previous terms that are smaller than t. In addition, we provide an easy way to enumerate all these self-describing sequences by organizing them in a Catalan tree with a specific <b>labelling</b> system. <b>Prefix</b> ordered sequences and rooted labelled trees The following connection between prefix ordered sequences and rooted labelled trees is well known and we briefly mention only the instance which is useful for our considerations. Let A be the set of finite integer sequences a = (a 0, a 1, [...] .) with the property that 0 ≤ ai ≤ i, for all indices. We order the sequences in A by the prefix relation, i. e., (a 0, a 1, [...] .,an) ≼ (b 0, b 1, [...] ., bm) if n ≤ m and ai = bi, for i = 0, [...] ., n. The sequences in A can be organized in a rooted labelled tree T which reflects the prefix order relation. The root of the tree T is labelled by 0. Every vertex that is at distance n from the root has n + 2 children labelled by 0, 1, [...] ., n, n+ 1 (see Figure 1). The vertices whose distance to the root is n form the n-th level of the tree T, which is also called the n-th generation. For every vertex v at the level n in the tree T there exist a unique path of length n from the root to v. The labels of the vertices on this path form a unique sequence (a 0, a 1, [...] .,an) in A that corresponds to the vertex v and this sequence is called the full name of v. The correspondence v ↔ the full name of v provides a bijection between the vertices in T and the sequences in A. Under this bijection, the vertices from the n-th generation in T correspond to the sequences of length n + 1 i...|$|R

40|$|In many European countries, {{a variety}} of {{different}} organic certification logos and schemes is found in the market. In the countries of the European Union (EU), the new mandatory EU logo for organic food was introduced in July 2010, so that other organic logos can only be used in addition to the mandatory EU logo. Within the CERTCOST project, consumer perceptions, preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) regarding different organic certification logos were investigated. The seven study countries were Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom. The overall objective was to give recommendations for actors in the organic sector regarding the use and promotion of organic certification logos. Firstly, an inventory study was conducted in shops with an organic food range in autumn 2008 to get insights into the spectrum of different organic certification logos in the market and the extent of price differences among products with different organic logos. The analysis showed that the importance of different kinds of logos differed considerably between the study countries. Only a few significant price differences between products with and without certain organic logos were found. Secondly, consumer perceptions, preferences and WTP regarding different organic logos as well as consumer views on a mandatory EU logo were investigated by a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods of consumer research (focus group discussions conducted in spring 2009, choice experiments and structured interviews conducted in early 2010). The results revealed that consumers had a low level of factual knowledge about organic production standards and the organic control system. Nevertheless, consumers clearly preferred certain organic logos more than others. Different kinds of organic logos were preferred across the countries. In Denmark and the Czech Republic, consumers were willing to pay a considerably higher price premium for the governmental logo than for the other tested logos. In Germany, a high WTP was recorded for the logo of the farmers’ association Demeter and the governmental logo. In Italy, the old EU logo reached the highest WTP. In Switzerland, the logo of the farmers’ umbrella organisation Bio Suisse was clearly preferred. In Turkey, consumers were willing to pay the highest price premium for the logo of the certification body Ecocert. In the UK, the WTP was the highest for the logos of the Soil Association and the certification body ‘Organic Farmers & Growers’. In all countries, products without a logo just <b>labelled</b> with the <b>prefix</b> ‘organic’ were not trusted. The introduction of a mandatory EU logo was generally welcomed by the participants.
