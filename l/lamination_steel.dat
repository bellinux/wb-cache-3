40|$|Abstract—For {{electrical}} machine designers, {{core loss}} data are usually {{provided in the}} form of tables or curves of total loss versus flux density or frequency. These can be used to extract the loss coefficients of the core loss formulas. In this paper, three currently available formulas are discussed and compared with the loss data supplied by <b>lamination</b> <b>steel</b> manufacturers. It is found that the dynamic hysteresis loop {{plays an important role in}} the total loss calculation, especially at high flux densities and high frequencies, and the loss coefficients should change with frequency. A new modified formula is proposed to represent the coefficient changes. The new curve is applied to the measured manufacturer’s data, with acceptable accuracy.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a double-gap axial field permanent magnet (PM) dc motor whose double-layer armature wave winding is constructed of copper strips. It investigates {{the performance of}} two machines using powder iron and <b>lamination</b> <b>steel</b> materials as armature teeth. Tests are conducted to evaluate the motor torque and speed curves {{as well as their}} efficiency under different loads. Finite element analysis (FEA) and equivalent circuit models are used to determine the levels of the magnetic saturation in the motors; calculate torque, inductance, and electromotive force (EMF); and determine the distribution of losses in the machine. The results show that the powder iron armature machine has lower back EMF and torque constants, and is less efficient than the steel laminations machine, which is due to the lower permeability and saturation flux density of the powder iron material...|$|E

Under Dr. Pillay’s direction, the Consortium is striving to understand the mechanisms involved in core losses in <b>lamination</b> <b>steels</b> at high frequencies, high induction levels and under non-sinusoidal excitation, and is developing new algorithmic expressions for accurately predicting core losses under these contemporary conditions as well as creating new test methodologies to confirm these predictions.|$|R

40|$|Two {{new models}} for {{specific}} power losses in cold-rolled motor <b>lamination</b> <b>steel</b> are described together with procedures for coefficient identification from standard multifrequency Epstein or single sheet tests. The eddy-current and hysteresis loss coefficients of the improved models {{are dependent on}} induction (flux density) and/or frequency, and the errors are substantially {{lower than those of}} conventional models over a very wide range of sinusoidal excitation, from 20 Hz to 2 kHz and from 0. 05 up to 2 T. The model that considers the coefficients to be variable, {{with the exception of the}} hysteresis loss power coefficient that has a constant value of 2, is superior in terms of applicability and phenomenological support.

40|$|The {{design of}} fast ramped superferric magnets with {{repetition}} {{rates in the}} order of 1 Hz requires reliable software tools to calculate the complex 3 D magnetic field quality as well as the impact of eddy currents and hysteresis losses.

We present a methodical study of these problems based on ANSYS calculations for simplified dipole models. The results of this analysis are compared with recently published results obtained by different special codes, i. e. an integral and the FIT method. The time dependencies of the eddy current power due to longitudinal magnetic field component at the yoke ends, the transient field distribution in the yoke volume and the total eddy current loss are investigated, using identical geometries with the same magnetic and electric properties of the <b>lamination</b> <b>steel</b> as used by the other codes.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of core losses in hydro generators is invaluable {{as it has}} implications of monetary value to both machine designers and utilities. For machine designers to meet the maximum acceptable total loss design targets, accurate loss estimation techniques are important to avoid the penalty of the extra losses generated. On the other hand, increase in the demand for electricity requires utilities to increase the output of their hydro generators {{as an alternative to}} building new stations, which is a more cost efficient option. Therefore, accurate prediction of core losses and their distribution, as part of the uprate studies, is key for any proposed uprate to determine the machine’s hot spots and core capability. This will permit the increase in machine rating without compromising its life time. This study is towards an accurate quantification of core losses and their distribution in hydro generators stators for uprate studies. The emphasis is on understanding the distribution of rotational flux in the generator stator core, rotational core loss measurements in <b>lamination</b> <b>steel,</b> and core loss estimation including both the rotational and non-sinusoidal flux density components. This entails 2 D electromagnetic finite element modelling, validation and simulation of hydro generators, which are subsequently used for the analysis. The distribution of rotational flux was found to be dependent on the stator dimensions and material BH curve operating point. Moreover, the associated rotational core losses resulted in a non-uniform distribution of losses in the stator, with higher localized losses {{at the back of the}} tooth. This new distribution of core losses is important in the thermal modelling to determine the distribution of hotspots in the machine. In this work, the numerical analysis provides an understanding of what is happening in the machine beyond the current measurement capability in the real machine. The experimental measurements performed also support the numerical results in the loss estimation...|$|E

Results. The developed method gives possible to make calculation of the flux density and influence of skin effect {{in different parts of}} the magnetic cores of distribution transformer, where are used mix of grain oriented (GO) and non grain oriented (NGO) steels. Was determinate the general basic conditions for the calculation of flux density in the laminations from grain and non grain oriented steels of the magnetic core: the strength of magnetic field for the laminations of particular part of mixed core is the same; the sum of the magnetic fluxes in GO and NGO steels in particular part of mixed core is equal with the designed magnetic flux in this part of mixed core.
