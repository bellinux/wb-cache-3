However, by the principle of Fourier decomposition, m(t) can be expressed as the sum {{of a number of}} sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of [...] 1+m(t) with c(t) as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier c(t) is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of m at fi there are two sidebands at frequencies fc + fi and [...] fc - fi. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation m(t) to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal Fourier transform of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation m(t) having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fig.</b> 2 for completeness).|$|E

In the currently installed DCP network, massive alert relies on radio frequency broadcasting to distribute messages. The popular use of cell phones gave rise to a plethora of applications which greatly improve public dissemination. In particular, it is possible to generate specific alerts, that is, warning messages targeting a specific region at delivery time [2]. Therefore, the only additional information required is location, which {{does not need to be}} fixed, since most modern cell phones are integrated to GPS units [38] or access their position using GPRS [39]. DTR-ADS is a cell phone delivery message system which implements an alert server, a mechanism for users to visualize the entire network map status, and a way to register their location and receive alerts. The emulation version associates a circular zone around each DCP. Every time an alert is issued to that specific alert radius, all pertinent users receive a warning either through a Short Message Service (SMS, [40]) or an interaction with the phone alert software as described in this section.|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{deformation}} of nano-grained metals is explored from three aspects: computation under a recently developed microstructural evolution algorithm; mechanics modelling for the cooperative insertion-rotation process under the 9 -grain cluster model; and {{molecular dynamics simulation}} for fast isochoric stretching under large deformation. Recently, experiment of rolling nano-crystalline copper at room temperature to an elongation of 5100 % was reported [1]. Nano-grain metals of such small grain sizes deform mainly by neighboring grains sliding pass each other with insignificant distortion in the grain shape. We adopted a structural evolution algorithm to simulate the process. Accommodation mechanisms such as grain boundary diffusion, sliding and grain rotation control the kinetics of the process. Actual deformation minimizes the plastic dissipation and stored strain energy for representative steps of grain neighbor switching. Numerical simulations based on these principles are given for a representing cell composed of 200 non-uniform grains. The deformation process is portrayed in the snapshots shown in the <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fig.</b> 1, while the straight line in the log-log plot on the right indicates an inverse power dependence (- 2. 61) of the strain rate on the grain size under a sustained stress. 20 40 60 80 100 12...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Truth Diagrams, TDs, {{are a new}} {{diagrammatic}} notation for proposi-tional logic. TDs provide: (1) {{representations of}} logical states of affairs and re-lations; (2) operators on such relations; (3) {{a test of the}} validity of derivations. A proof of one of de Morgan’s laws is given as an illustration of TDs. Truth Diagrams (TDs) were invented as part of a programme of research on the Representational Epistemic approach to the study of how notational systems encode knowledge and the potential cognitive benefits that novel codifications of knowledge may confer [1 - 3]. The core principle of the approach claims that effective representa-tional systems should directly encode the fundamental conceptual structure of their knowledge domains, using coherent notational schemes. TDs were designed as a further test of this idea. The purpose here is simply to give an informal overview of TDs by describing the derivation of one of de Morgan’s laws: –(PvQ) | – –P&–Q.

40|$|This is {{a sequel}} to the two {{previous}} books on dissections by the author [1 - 2] (both reviewed in this newsletter no. 44, September 2003). In the first book shapes (e. g. a square) were cut to separate (polygonal) pieces and puzzled together again to form another shape (e. g. a triangle). In the second book, extra constraints were introduced. Some of the vertices of the pieces were connected so that they form one or possibly more chains. Two connected pieces can only rotate in the plane around their joined vertex. The present book is a logical sequel. Now the pieces are connected along edges. Although the shapes are two-dimensional, one needs a third dimension to flip the pieces along the connecting hinges. Take for example a rectangular {{piece of paper that}} is twice as wide as it is high. Folding it along a vertical line in the middle, one obtains a double layered square; folding it along a horizontal line in the middle gives a double layered rectangle that is four times as wide as high.
