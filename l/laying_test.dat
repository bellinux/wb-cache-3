40|$|THE HIGH LEVEL of {{efficiency}} of broiler producers {{today is the}} result of improved feeding, management and breeding practices. In the main, this im-provement has been effected in the broiler progeny, not in the performance of the parent stock. Yet costs in a broiler enter-prise are determined, not only by the efficiency of broiler progeny, but also by the performance of the parent flock, par-ticularly its rate of egg production, feed efficiency and hatchability. Specific knowledge concerning the relative im-portance of parent and progeny perform-ance determining profitability of a strain or cross seems to be lacking. Strain and Nordskog (1962) concluded that broiler weight and broiler feed conversion were the most important factors determining net income in the Maine Random Sample Broiler tests. Egg production in the par-ent flock was of little importance. Nord-skog (1960), using egg <b>laying</b> <b>test</b> data, found that egg production was the most important single factor affecting income. However, both of these reports were based on phenotypic correlations between traits...|$|E

At Brycedale the tests all indicated resistance to chlorfenvinphos, and RET and ELT indicated resistance to amitraz and emerging resistance to cypermethrin. At Sunny Grove, B. decoloratus was resistant to cypermethrin using SLIT and exhibited emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos with SLIT and to cypermethrin with both RET and ELT. At Welgevind, resistance was recorded against chlorfenvinphos (SLIT) and against cypermethrin (ELT), and emerging resistance against permethrin (RET). The results obtained with RET and ELT were generally comparable, but often differed from those obtained with SLIT. Resistance could be detected within 7 days with ELT compared to 42 days with RET and 60 days with SLIT...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the extent of acaricide resistance in the eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province 1 -, 2 - and 3 -host ticks were collected from cattle at 59 dip-tanks over a period of 2 years. These ticks were tested for resistance against 3 compounds, namely amitraz, cypermethrin and chlorfenvinphos. The Shaw Larval Immersion Test detected emerging resistance to amitraz in Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus at 2 dip-tanks and resistance at a 3 rd. It also revealed resistance in this tick to cypermethrin at 1 dip-tank and emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos at 8 dip-tanks and resistance at 2. Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi was susceptible to amitraz and cypermethrin at all dip-tanks, but showed emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos at 7 dip-tanks and resistance at 4. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus was susceptible to amitraz and chlorfenvinphos at all dip-tanks and demonstrated emerging resistance to cypermethrin at 1. With the exception of R. (B.) microplus, in which emerging resistance to amitraz was detected at 1 dip-tank by the Reproductive Estimate Test, all 3 tick species at all dip-tanks at which sufficient numbers of ticks had been collected were susceptible to the 3 acaracides in both the Egg <b>Laying</b> <b>Test</b> and the Reproductive Estimate Test.

40|$|Five {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} period from September to June over a period of six years. Three breeds (New Hampshires, White Leghorns, and White Plymouth Rocks) which had just finished the yearly <b>laying</b> <b>test</b> were used in this study. The controls were kept under the natural short-daylength and the experimental groups were exposed to 14 -, 16 -, 20 - or 24 -hours of light. All of the hens used were artificially inseminated weekly with 0. 02 ml. of pooled semen obtained from New Hampshire males maintained under natural daylength. The control groups (natural daylength) always manifested the highest fertility, showing highly {{significant differences between the two}} groups of the experimental and the control in two out of five trials. Although there were no significant differences among the greater part of the lighted groups, longer daylength did not bring a desirable effect on fertility. Hatchability in the control group was also higher than that in the experimental. Generally, daily light for hens may give rise to undesirable effects upon embryonic development of the eggs produced by them. Percentages of unhatched eggs including early dead germs were low in the majority of the control groups. From these data it was concluded that fertility and hatchability of eggs from the hens raised under the natural short-daylength were higher than those from the hens exposed to longer than the natural daylength. Consequently artificial longer daylength for hens may unfavorably affect these traits...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} ticks, {{and to some}} extent tick-borne diseases, over much of South Africa is {{currently}} dependent on acaricides and will probably remain so for the foreseeable future. Resistance to these chemicals by ticks thus poses a major threat to the livestock industry especially as these chemicals constitute an ever-diminishing resource with fewer being discovered and the cost of their development becoming prohibitive. In order {{to determine the extent of}} acaricide resistance in the eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province one-, two- and three-host ticks were collected from cattle at 58 dip-tanks over a period of 2 years. The one-host tick selected was Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, the two-host tick Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi and the three-host tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. The ticks were tested for resistance to three compounds, namely amitraz, cypermethrin and chlorfenvinphos. The Shaw Larval Immersion Test detected emerging resistance to amitraz in the one-host tick R. (Boophilus) microplus at two dip-tanks and resistance at a third. It also revealed resistance in this tick to cypermethrin at one dip-tank, and emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos at eight dip-tanks and resistance at two. The two-host tick R. evertsi evertsi was susceptible to amitraz and cypermethrin at all dip-tanks, but showed emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos at seven dip-tanks and resistance at four. The three-host tick R. appendiculatus was susceptible to amitraz and chlorfenvinphos at all dip-tanks and demonstrated emerging resistance to cypermethrin at one. With the exception of R. (Boophilus) microplus, in which emerging resistance to amitraz was detected at one dip-tank by the Reproductive Estimate Test, all three tick species at all dip-tanks at which sufficient numbers of ticks had been collected, were susceptible to the three acaracides in both the Egg <b>Laying</b> <b>Test</b> and the Reproductive Estimate Test. Thus despite its fairly long and widespread use in the eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province very little or no resistance to amitraz was detected in three tick species regularly encountered on cattle in this region, namely R. (Boophilus) microplus, R. evertsi evertsi and R. appendiculatus. On the other hand resistance to chlorfenvinphos was detected in both R. (Boophilus) microplus and R. evertsi evertsi at a number of dip-tanks even though it, or other organophosphorous-based compounds, had probably not been used for tick control in the region for a number of years. The localities at which ticks were collected had already been mapped and the localities at which acaricide resistant ticks were encountered were mapped during this study. The three tick species that were targeted for acaricide resistance testing were widespread throughout the study region, but no pattern of geographic distribution for the acaricide resistant strains of these species that were detected, emerged. The rapidity of selection for acaricide resistance appeared to be closely related to the life cycles of the three ticks and the number of days that they theoretically would spend annually on their preferred host animals. Thus a greater number of acaricide resistant strains were encountered amongst the one-host tickR. (Boophilus) microplus and the two-host tick R. evertsi evertsi than the three-host tick R. appendiculatus. The fist two ticks both complete more than one life cycle a year and hence spend a longer time on their cattle hosts than the three-host tick R. appendiculatus, which completes only one life cycle a year and in addition is a rapid feeder in all its stages of development. To counter selection for acaricide resistance it is proposed that regular testing for resistance should be carried out, and that as soon as emerging resistance is detected in ticks on cattle at a particular dip-tank, that the acaricide in use at that dip-tank should be changed to a compound belonging to a completely different group of chemicals.

40|$|Abstract: The {{voluntary}} counselling and <b>testing</b> <b>lay</b> counsellors are not {{employees of}} the City of Johannesburg at Region F, but rather receive stipend money as an incentive from the non-governmental organisations. The voluntary counselling and <b>testing</b> <b>lay</b> counsellors seem to be unhappy and dissatisfied about their functions as demonstrated by their irregular attendance at the voluntary counselling and testing sites. It became difficult for the voluntary counselling and testing clients to access the voluntary counselling and testing service {{in the absence of}} the voluntary counselling and <b>testing</b> <b>lay</b> counsellors as they had to wait in the long queues in order to be attended to by the professional nurses. In most instances, the voluntary counselling and testing clients decided rather to leave the clinics without being attended to. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of the voluntary counselling and <b>testing</b> <b>lay</b> counsellors and professional nurses with regard to voluntary counselling and testing services offered in the City of Johannesburg at Region F. To address the problem a contextual, qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive phenomenological, research design was used in this study. A purposive sampling method was used. Individual, in-depth, phenomenological, semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data. The interviews were directed by two open-ended research questions. A model of trustworthiness with four components namely, credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability was followed. An open coding, qualitative data analysis method was used. The ethical considerations were taken into account. The results from the analysis of the transcriptions were described. Three main themes (1) lack of appropriate counselling rooms, (2) increased workload and staff shortages (3) lack of motivation and support and their related sub-themes in table 3. 1 were identified and conceptualised within the existing literature and concluding statements were made.

40|$|The {{trial was}} started by {{importing}} GDR chicken from Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany and indigenous Cameroon fowl by collecting eggs from villages in the Western highland area of Cameroon hatched at the Institute of Animal and Veterinary Research, Mankon (Cameroon). The males of the base population were subjected to fattening test (body weight performance) up to 12 weeks of age. Approximately 10 percent of the birds were slaughtered at 12 weeks of age to determine gizzard, feet, head, liver, heart and dressed yield as the percent of the liveweight. The hen were tested for egg production up to 72 weeks of age and traits such as egg number, body weight at 20, 30, 36, 42, and 72 weeks, shank length at 20, 30 and 42 weeks, egg quality, survival age, age at sexual maturity, feed intake and abdominal fat were measured. First generation chicks were then produced by mating the parent generation using artificial insemination to produce a stock which comprised of eight genotype groups (DlNN; DLNO; LDNN; LDNO, LONN; LONO; DANN; and DANO). The cockerels were subjected to fattening test and egg production of pullets was recorded following the procedure as in the parent generation. Results from fattening test in the parent generation indicated that the Dahlem both normal feathered and naked neck had higher body weight at hatch than the local fowl. At 12 weeks of age, the Dahlem naked naked neck males had higher body weight dressed percentage than the Dahlem normal feathered and the indigenous fowl (normal feathered). Traits such as gizzard, head, liver and heart percentage were unimportant since no significant difference were observed among the three-genotype groups. Results from <b>laying</b> <b>test</b> (Parent generation) indicated that the Dahlem Red both naked neck and normal feathered laid eggs than the indigenous fowl. The Dahlem (both naked neck and normal feathered) had higher feed intake and feed efficiency than the indigenous chicken. Indigenous fowl came into lay (Sexual maturity) later than the Dahlem birds but had lower mortality and higher yolk percentage. Eggs of Dahlem layer had higher albumen and yolk height {{than that of the}} local fowl. No differences were observed among genotypes for yolk colour, shell percentage and egg breaking strength. Indigenous hens had higher abdominal fat percentage than the Dahlem hens. Results on body weight in the first generation, revealed that Dahlem naked neck chicks had body weight at hatching. Local x Dahlem naked neck crossbreds had highest 12 weeks body weight and carcass yield. Heterosis for 12 weeks body weight was positive in both naked neck and normal feathered type. Local x Dahlem crossbreds, both normal feathered and naked neck types had higher 12 weeks body weight than its reciprocal cross. Results on egg production performance (G 1) revealed that local x Dahlem crossbreds produced highest number of eggs (233 eggs) than local naked neck (142 eggs). Dahlem normal feathered hens produced higher egg mass (12. 8 kg) than local naked neck hens (6. 7 kg). Highest feed consumption was observed for in the Dahlem normal feathered genotype group (0. 27) and it was lowest for local naked neck genotype group (0. 16). Crossbreds attained earkier sexual maturity than the pure breeds. Positive heterosis was observed for egg number and egg mass in both naked neck and normal feathered genotypes. Normal feathered local x Dahlem crossbreds produced higher egg number than its reciprocal cross but it was reverse for the naked neck type. Similar pattern was observed for egg mass also. Difference in feed efficiency was not found between reciprocal crosses of normal feathered types while local x Dahlem crossbred had higher feed efficiency among the naked neck type. An appreciable improvement in body weight and egg production traits was observed on crossing ICF with German Dahlem Red. Positive heterosis was observed for body weight in cockerels, egg number and egg mass. Reciprocal effects were variable between the normal feathered and naked neck genotypes for most of the traits. Effect of necked neck gene was consistent in improving body weight, carcass yield and egg weight...|$|E
40|$|Tick {{resistance}} to acaricides {{is an increasing}} problem in South Africa and poses a real economic threat to the livestock and veterinary pharmaceutical industries. New acaricides are extremely expensive to develop so the present acaricides {{should be seen as}} an ever-diminishing resource, which should be protected by all means possible. The main objective {{of the study was to}} detect the levels of tick {{resistance to}} acaricides at selected commercial and communal farms in South Africa. Also to compare the in vitro adult and larval test methods and to investigate acaricide management strategies which may increase the lifespan of the presently used acaricides. To meet these objectives a field survey (February 2000 to August 2001) was carried out at selected communal and commercial farms in the Eastern Cape and Northwest Provinces of South Africa to monitor levels of field tick resistance to acaricides. The larvae were originally obtained from engorged female A. hebraeum, B. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus and R. evertsi evertsi. The larvae were tested against different concentrations of amitraz, chlorfenvinphos and cypermethrin using the Shaw Larval Immersion Test (SLIT). Mortality dose data were subjected to probit analysis using a BMDP statistical package. Factors of resistance (FOR) were calculated by comparing the larval response of ticks from the field, which had been exposed to acaricides, with baseline data from very susceptible laboratory strains of ticks, on the basis of the LC 50 values. On the communal farms high levels of tick resistance were detected to cypermethrin as well as partial resistance to chlorfenvinphos whilst no resistance was detected against amitraz. On the commercial farms, however, ticks were equally resistant to amitraz, cypermethrin and chlorfenvinphos. The populations of B. decoloratus on these farms had developed higher levels of resistance to the test acaricides than the equivalent R. evertsi evertsi, R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum populations. Higher levels of tick resistance to amitraz was observed on commercial farms than on communal farms, however, there was no significant differences in tick resistance to chlorfenvinphos and cypermethrin at both the commercial and communal farms. It was surmised that inappropriate use of acaricides might have resulted in higher tick resistance to the currently available acaricides on the commercial as well as the communal farms. Correct acaricide usage may solve this problem to a limited extent. Comparative in vitro tests were also carried out on the larvae and adults of B. decoloratus to determine the susceptibility of this tick to different concentrations of the currently used acaricides, (amitraz, chlorfenvinphos and cypermethrin) at three commercial dairy farms, (“Brycedale”, “Sunny Grove” and “Welgevind”) near East London in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Resistance of field strains of B. decoloratus were determined using the SLIT and the Adult Immersion Test (AIT) as the latter test took into account factors such as oviposition assessment and reproductive ability. At “Brycedale”, resistance to amitraz and chlorfenvinphos was detected with the AIT method. Emerging resistance to amitraz and resistance to chlorfenvinphos were also detected at “Brycedale” with the SLIT method. At “Sunny Grove” resistance was detected to cypermethrin and at “Welgevind” resistance was detected to chlorfenvinphos with the SLIT whilst no resistance was detected using AIT. It would appear that the B. decoloratus populations tested on these dairy farms were more resistant to chlorfenvinphos than to amitraz or cypermethrin. Variable results were obtained using the SLIT, the Reproductive Estimate Test (RET) and the Egg <b>laying</b> <b>Test</b> (ELT). Nearly 50 % of the dairy farms sampled showed resistance to chlorfenvinphos and the majority had susceptible B. decoloratus populations to both amitraz and cypermethrin. “Brycedale” had a serious resistance problem whilst “Sunny Grove” and “Welgevind” dairies had much less resistance problems. At “Brycedale”, the SLIT, RET and ELT methods all recorded resistance to amitraz and chlorfenvinphos whilst cypermethrin resistance was also detected with the ELT. At “Sunny Grove”, the SLIT detected emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos and resistance to cypermethrin while the other two test methods were negative. At “Welgevind” the SLIT detected resistance to chlorfenvinphos and the ELT resistance to cypermethrin whilst the RET did not detect any resistance at “Welgevind”. In general there was a good correlation between the RET and the ELT whilst in many cases there was poor correlation between the SLIT and the two AIT methods (RET and ELT). From this study it would appear that the ELT was a good method to detect resistance within seven days, as opposed to the 42 days required for the RET and the 60 days for the SLIT. The ELT and the RET could possibly be used as screening methods to detect acaricide resistance on farms whilst the SLIT would remain the test of choice for National surveys. In addition the ELT is less costly and does not require sophisticated equipment for field testing for resistance, compared with other in vitro test methods. This method, however, still needs to be validated and standardized for use in South Africa and the rest of Africa where tick control is important.

Three experiments show that similar hindsight effects occur when people evaluate the predictability of scientific results—they tend to believe they "knew all along " what the experiments would find. However, the hindsight effect was reduced by forcing people to consider how the research could otherwise have turned out. Implications for the evaluation of scientific research by lay observers are discussed. In an era of reduced public support and increased public scrutiny of scientific research, psychologists are under increasing pressure to make certain that their work is viewed as both important and informative.

60|$|In {{the first}} week of our acquaintance, the {{electric}} telegraph and, particularly, submarine cables, and the methods, machines, and instruments for <b>laying,</b> <b>testing,</b> and using them, formed naturally the chief subject of our conversations and discussions; as it was in fact the practical object of Jenkin's visit to me in Glasgow; but not much of the week had passed before I found him remarkably interested in science generally, and full of intelligent eagerness on many particular questions of dynamics and physics. When he returned from Glasgow to Birkenhead a correspondence commenced between us, which was continued without intermission up to the last days of his life. It commenced with a well-sustained fire of letters on each side about the physical qualities of submarine cables, and the practical results attainable in the way of rapid signalling through them. Jenkin used excellently the valuable opportunities for experiment allowed him by Newall, and his partner Lewis Gordon, at their Birkenhead factory. Thus he began definite scientific investigation of the copper resistance of the conductor, and the insulating resistance and specific inductive capacity of its gutta-percha coating, in the factory, in various stages of manufacture; and he was the very first to introduce systematically into practice the grand system of absolute measurement founded in Germany by Gauss and Weber. The immense value of this step, if only in respect to the electric telegraph, is amply appreciated by all who remember or who have read something of the history of submarine telegraphy; but it can scarcely be known generally how much it is due to Jenkin.|$|R

This especially impacts on translational elements of clinical trials, which can require {{detailed analysis of}} thousands of tissue samples. We tested whether crowdsourcing – enlisting help from the public – is a sufficiently accurate method to score such samples. Methods: We developed a novel online interface to train and <b>test</b> <b>lay</b> participants on cancer detection and immunohistochemistry scoring in tissue microarrays. Lay participants initially performed cancer detection on lung cancer images stained for CD 8, and we measured how extending a basic tutorial by annotated example images and feedback-based training affected cancer detection accuracy. We then applied this tutorial to additional cancer types and immunohistochemistry markers – bladder/ki 67, lung/EGFR, and oesophageal/CD 8 – to establish accuracy compared with experts. Using this optimised tutorial, we then <b>tested</b> <b>lay</b> participants’ accuracy on immunohistochemistry scoring of lung/EGFR and bladder/p 53 samples. Results: We observed that for cancer detection, annotated example images and feedback-based training both improved accuracy compared with a basic tutorial only. Using this optimised tutorial, we demonstrate highly accurate (> 0. 90 area under curve) detection of cancer in samples stained with nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane cell markers. We also observed high Spearman correlations between lay participants and experts for immunohistochemistry scoring (0. 91 (0. 78, 0. 96) and 0. 97 (0. 91, 0. 99) for lung/EGFR and bladder/p 53 samples, respectively). Conclusions: These results establish crowdsourcing as a promising method to screen large data sets for biomarkers in cancer pathology research {{across a range of}} cancers and immunohistochemical stains...|$|R
40|$|Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) {{has a high}} {{ecological}} value due to the long and intensive flowering {{as well as its}} favorable impact on soil fertility. In addition, as a typical catch crop, it provides the possibility of a second harvest on arable land in moderate European regions. However, in Europe demand for buckwheat kernels as food is low. Therefore, the question arises whether cultivation of this plant could be promoted by using it as animal feed. In the current experiment, the extent to which buckwheat is consumed by <b>laying</b> hens was <b>tested</b> in conjunction with potential effects on egg yield and quality. Three groups of laying hens (n= 13 per group) were fed a layer diet containing either 40...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} are {{presented}} results from the investigations of some peculiarities {{in the process of}} soldering on small topological forms in PCBs. The investigation is dedicated to the surface mount technology and deals with lead contained and lead free solder alloy pastes. Attention is paid on the implementation of contact pads with lead free surface finish. For this purpose are used galvanic deposited coatings and different solders. The results are obtained when using temperature profiles of typical production process at regimes, recommended by the solder paste vendors. In the experiments are implemented specially developed <b>test</b> <b>lay</b> outs and samples, manufactured from PCB material. Predominantly are investigated the processes of solder wetting in atmospheric surrounding...|$|R

Delivery of HTS by lay providers may help close this testing gap, while also increasing uptake and acceptability of HIV testing among key populations and other priority groups. Methods 50 National HIV testing policies were collated from WHO country intelligence databases, contacts and testing program websites. Data regarding lay provider use for HTS was extracted and collated. Our search had no geographical or language restrictions. This data was then compared with reported data from the Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting (GARPR) from July 2015. Results Forty-two percent of countries permit lay providers to perform HIV testing and 56 % permit lay providers to administer pre-and post-test counseling. Comparative analysis with GARPR found that less than half (46 %) of reported data from countries were consistent with their corresponding national HIV testing policy. Conclusions Given the low uptake of lay provider use globally and their proven use in increasing HIV testing, countries should consider revising policies to support <b>lay</b> provider <b>testing</b> using rapid diagnostic tests...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{was written}} {{in the context of a}} joint {{research}} group, which developed a framework for finding and providing the best-fit web service for a user. The problem of the research group <b>lays</b> in <b>testing</b> their developed framework sufficiently. The framework can either be tested with test data produced by real web services which costs money or by generated test data based on a simulation of web service behavior. The second attempt has been developed within this scientific paper in the form of a test data generator. The generator simulates a web service request by defining internal services, whereas each service has an own internal graph which considers the structure of a service. A service can be atomic or can be compose of other services that are called in a specific manner (sequential, loop, conditional). The generation of the test data is done by randomly going through the services which result in variable response times, since the graph structure changes every time the system has been initialized. The implementation process displayed problems which have not been solved within the time frame. Those problems are displaying interesting challenges for the dynamical generation of random graphs. Those challenges should be targeted in further research...|$|R
40|$|The foamed asphalt {{concept has}} been around since the 1950 's. Rising oil prices have created a renewed {{interest}} in this process. The purpose of this project was to construct an asphalt base using the foamed asphalt process and to evaluate its performance. A 4. 2 mile length of Muscatine County road A- 91 was selected for the research project. Asphalt contents of 4. 5 % and 5. 5 %, moisture contents of 70 % and 90 % of optimum, and fog, single chip, and double chip seal coats were used in various combinations to <b>lay</b> 9 <b>test</b> sections of 4 -inch foamed asphalt base. After five years of service and evaluation, several conclusions can be made concerning the performance of the foamed asphalt bases: (1) the foamed asphalt process can work as shown by the excellent performance of Sections 2 and 3; (2) foamed asphalt base requires a well compacted subgrade and a road profile suitable for good drainage of water [...] test section failures were mostly due to a poor subgrade and subsurface moisture; and (3) when the base is placed in two or more lifts, extreme care must be exercised to insure adequate bonding is achieved between lifts. Any future research with foamed asphalt should include various asphalt depths in order to determine a thickness/strength relationship for foamed asphalt...|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} {{plasters}} of historic buildings {{may be of}} great importance in order to even propose these mortars in restoration and ensure a perfect compatibility between ancient and modern materials. The plasters designed by Gaetano Cima, the most important sardinian neoclassic architect, are {{a prime example of}} how carefully chosen materials together with the accuracy of the <b>laying</b> and <b>testing</b> on site rise to products of special quality and durability. From the analysis of historic buildings in the city of Cagliari, the subject of recent restorations, {{it is clear that the}} durability of these products is greatly reduced also with the choice of mortars generally premixed that in the mix design approach those traditional. In this case the mode of execution as regards in particular the beating techniques, compaction, counterbore and, of course, timing plays a critical role. In the present work we considered samples of plaster attached to one of the most significant buildings in Cagliari, the Nuovo Spedale Civile. Microscopic, microstructural and chemical investigations of these samples were performed in order to identify the constitutive materials and techniques of realization. Information obtained from these investigations have led to a critical reading of writings that are part of the so-called “Carte del Cima”. In particular we highlighted some similarities and differences from the original formulations that have not had decisive influence on the durability of the mortars...|$|R
