5000|$|<b>Latte</b> macchiato differs {{significantly}} from caffè <b>latte</b> in several ways. First, in a <b>latte</b> macchiato, espresso {{is added to}} milk, rather than milk to espresso as in a caffè <b>latte.</b> Second, a <b>latte</b> macchiato features more foam, rather than simply hot milk. A <b>latte</b> macchiato often uses only half an espresso shot or less. Finally, a <b>latte</b> macchiato is often a [...] "layered" [...] drink, rather than being mixed as in a caffè <b>latte.</b>|$|R

5|$|After a long {{discussion}} {{about how the}} episode should end, the writers decided {{that they did not}} want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of the}} episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking <b>lattes.</b> The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC <b>Lattès,</b> for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E

5000|$|Caffè <b>latte</b> or caffè e <b>latte</b> {{is often}} called simply <b>latte,</b> which is Italian for [...] "milk", in English-speaking countries; it is espresso with steamed milk, {{traditionally}} topped with froth created from steaming the milk.

A <b>latte</b> is also commonly served in a tall glass; if the espresso is slowly poured into the frothed milk from {{the rim of the}} glass, three layers of different shades will form, with the milk at the bottom, the froth on top and the espresso in between.
