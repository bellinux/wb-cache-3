40|$|INTRODUCTION. <b>Liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> (PT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{non-destructive}} testing methods for detecting surface discontinuities in nonporous solid materials. This method has shown good results when looking for defects in details made of any nonporous materials including glass, ceramics, plastic, magnetic or nonmagnetic metals or alloys. Penetrant materials and check samples are the main tools for PT. The samples are used to estimate the performance of penetrant materials and to evaluate the sensitivity of the testing technology. AIM OF THE PAPER. The paper aims to evaluate the discontinuity parameters, such as cracks, in non-metal samples to determine the feasibility of using these samples to assess the sensitivity of the testing technology. METHODS. Discontinuity parameters in non-metallic check samples were determined using a microscope, and then the data was statistically processed in accordance with GOST 8. 736 - 2011 "Multiple direct measurements. Methods of measurement results processing. Main principles". RESULTS. The conducted study has showed that samples made of non-metallic material can be used to estimate the performance of penetrant families, as well as to assess <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> sensitivity since the cracks in samples are virtually straight...|$|R
40|$|Induction {{thermography}} is {{an active}} thermal testing technique based on generation of eddy currents in an electrically conducting material. The technique found successful applications for surface crack detection in various industrial branches, with the general aim of searching for alternatives to magnetic particle or <b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing.</b> Due to its fast and contactless operation this nondestructive thermographic testing technique shows a high potential for the fully automated testing of steel components. This contribution presents a prototype application of induction thermography in surface crack inspection of railway wheels. The flexibility of camera based solutions and the proven sensitivity of induction thermography to surface defects are {{the basis for a}} demonstrator for thermographic testing developed in Fraunhofer IZFP. In connection with the infrared camera and the inductor moved by a robot, fully automated testing of complex shapes is performed. A proper combination of signal and image processing algorithms allows automated and robust defect detection. The technique works generally without application of any surface treatment. Results of inspection of different railway wheels are presented...|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} metal joining process. The {{discontinuities}} and anomalies encountered {{in this type of}} welded joint differ from those of a conventional fusion weld. The discontinuities present in FSW are oriented in a different direction due to the unique formation process involved and are dispersed over the welded region widthwise as well as thicknesswise. The process of detection, evaluation, and characterization of these discontinuities is a challenging aspect, as no specific area is identified as a probable zone of discontinuities. In this study, typical discontinuities that are encountered during the FSW process were intentionally induced and then subjected to different types of nondestructive investigation. The methods and techniques adopted were <b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing,</b> radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, and eddy current testing. The interaction of these discontinuities and study of their response to different nondestructive testing (NDT) methods/techniques are presented in this paper. The eddy current technique appears to be most effective and simple NDT tool for identifying most of the discontinuities. However, a combination with other methods such as radiography is helpful in characterizing these discontinuities...|$|R
50|$|Lack of fusion is {{the poor}} {{adhesion}} of the weld bead {{to the base}} metal; incomplete penetration is a weld bead that does not start {{at the root of}} the weld groove. Incomplete penetration forms channels and crevices in the root of the weld which can cause serious issues in pipes because corrosive substances can settle in these areas. These types of defects occur when the welding procedures are not adhered to; possible causes include the current setting, arc length, electrode angle, and electrode manipulation. Defects can be varied and classified as critical or non critical. Porosity (bubbles) in the weld are usually acceptable to a certain degree. Slag inclusions, undercut, and cracks are usually unacceptable. Some porosity, cracks, and slag inclusions are visible and may not need further inspection to require their removal. Small defects such as these can be verified by <b>Liquid</b> <b>Penetrant</b> <b>Testing</b> (Dye check). Slag inclusions and cracks just below the surface can be discovered by Magnetic Particle Inspection. Deeper defects can be detected using the Radiographic (X-rays) and/or Ultrasound (sound waves) testing techniques.|$|R

40|$|The need {{to examine}} {{materials}} and system components without compromising their integrity has spurred the development of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. NDE can range from a simple visual inspection of a surface to the measurement of physical properties of materials. The most prominent methods of NDE currently in use include ultrasonic testing, eddy current examination, x-ray radiography, neutron radiography, magnetic flux leakage <b>testing,</b> and <b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing.</b> Many of these fields are well developed {{in terms of their}} abilities to detect and characterize flaws within a sample. When nondestructive testing (NDT) was first introduced, the practice consisted of comparison between signals and standards. The standards were generated from a defined set of machined samples incorporated with desired flaws. The testing method was applied to these samples to yield reference signals. Thus when NDT was applied to a component, the resulting signal was compared to the reference signals to determine whether this component was acceptable in a go - no go sense. This type of testing was just a comparison of signals to set points. There was little extraction of the flaw information present in the signal, and the NDT personnel performing the testing often did not understand the physics underlying the generation of the signals...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a laser ultrasonic system applied to the detection and characterization of stress corrosion cracks and welding discontinuities in stainless steel is reported. A 50 mJ long pulse laser coupled with a confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer and the synthetic aperture focusing technique are used to enhance weak discontinuity related signals. First, stainless steel plates containing stress corrosion cracks with widths of less than 0. 03 mm (1. 2 7 10 - 3 in.) and depths ranging from 0. 5 to 5 mm (0. 02 to 0. 2 in.) are tested. Both longitudinal and shear waves are used in synthetic aperture focusing technique processing to detect and characterize these cracks from the surface opposite cracking. Images at the breaking surface reconstructed by shear waves provide very detailed structures of branched tight cracks, which are comparable to results obtained by <b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing.</b> This excellent imaging {{is linked to the}} presence of crosslike features appearing in B-scans that are interpreted and explained. Secondly, a welded stainless steel plate is tested and various weld discontinuities with sizes of about 1 mm (0. 04 in.) are detected. Although the material strongly attenuates ultrasound in this case, laser ultrasonics combined with the synthetic aperture focusing technique successfully detects, locates and sizes these discontinuities. These results are compared with those obtained by X-ray computed tomography. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

50|$|NDT methods may {{rely upon}} use of {{electromagnetic}} radiation, sound, and inherent {{properties of materials}} to examine samples. This includes some kinds of microscopy to examine external surfaces in detail, although sample preparation techniques for metallography, optical microscopy and electron microscopy are generally destructive as the surfaces must be made smooth through polishing or the sample must be electron transparent in thickness. The inside of a sample can be examined with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons or terahertz radiation. Sound waves are utilized {{in the case of}} ultrasonic testing. Contrast between a defect and the bulk of the sample may be enhanced for visual examination by the unaided eye by using liquids to penetrate fatigue cracks. One method (<b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing)</b> involves using dyes, fluorescent or non-fluorescent, in fluids for non-magnetic materials, usually metals. Another commonly used NDT method used on ferrous materials involves the application of fine iron particles (either liquid or dry dust) that are applied to a part while it is in an externally magnetized state (magnetic-particle testing). The particles will be attracted to leakage fields within the test object, and form on the objects surface. Magnetic particle testing can reveal surface & some sub-surface defects within the part.Thermoelectric effect (or use of the Seebeck effect) uses thermal properties of an alloy to quickly and easily characterize many alloys. The chemical test, or chemical spot test method, utilizes application of sensitive chemicals that can indicate the presence of individual alloying elements. Electrochemical methods, such as electrochemical fatigue crack sensors, utilize the tendency of metal structural material to oxidize readily in order to detect progressive damage.|$|R

The focus was {{on the use of}} advanced materials with high performance in high concentrations (greater than 8 N) and high temperatures of nitric acid employed in the dissolver. The commercially available materials like SS 316 l, titanium, Ti – 5 % Ta, and Ti – 5 % Ta – 1. 8 % Nb were tried and the corrosion behavior of these materials was studied in detail. It was also decided to try out Zircaloy – 4 as the material of construction due to its excellent corrosion resistance in nitric acid environment. The specifications were stringent and the geometrical configurations of the assembly were very intricate. On accepting the challenge of fabricating the dissolver, NFC made different fixtures for electron beam (EB) welding and TIG welding.
