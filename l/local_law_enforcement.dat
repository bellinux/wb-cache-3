5|$|Efforts made {{by local}} {{authorities}} in the Cluj-Napoca district {{at the end of}} the 1990s to reform the protection of children's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b>|$|E

During filming, Joseph Bruce was harassed {{by a police}} officer due to <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement's</b> classification of Juggalos as a gang.|$|R
50|$|Also in {{the late}} 1950s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had to finally admit that {{organized}} crime in America is real, because of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's embarrassment over the <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement's</b> uncovering of the 1957 Apalachin Meeting. Thus, the FBI began to employ all types of surveillance against mobsters.|$|R
5|$|Morrow also demanded {{consistency}} from <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials. In 1921, {{he removed}} the Woodford County jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 {{for information leading to}} the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged. Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. <b>Local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials claim no recollection of the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E
5|$|By 2009, the P90 was {{in service}} with {{military}} and police forces in over 40 countries. In the United States, Houston Police Department was the first <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agency to adopt the P90, acquiring it for their SWAT team in 1999. In 2003, the Houston SWAT team {{became one of the}} first agencies in the country to use the weapon in a shootout. By 2009, the P90 was in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies in the United States, including the Secret Service and Federal Protective Service. In response, the National Rifle Association added the P90 and PS90 to its NRA Tactical Police Competition standards, allowing law enforcement agencies to compete in the event using either weapon.|$|E

5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were more active, and were more directly under the eye of <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving {{reforms in the}} judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b> Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Huie's {{interview}} with Bryant and Milam was explosive. Their brazen admission {{that they had}} murdered Till caused prominent civil rights leaders to push the federal government harder to investigate the case. Till's murder contributed to congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957: it authorized the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> issues when individual civil rights were being compromised. Huie's interview, in which Milam and Bryant said they had acted alone, overshadowed inconsistencies in earlier versions of the stories. As a consequence, details about Collins and Loggins and others who had possibly been involved in Till's abduction and murder, or the subsequent cover-up, were forgotten, according to historians David and Linda Beito.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a congressionally chartered, federally {{supported}} non-profit {{corporation that}} serves as the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF). CAP is a volunteer organization with an aviation-minded membership that includes people from all backgrounds, lifestyles, and occupations. It performs three congressionally assigned key missions: emergency services, which includes search and rescue (by air and ground) and disaster relief operations; aerospace education for youth and the general public; and cadet programs for teenage youth.

CAP also performs non-auxiliary missions for various governmental and private agencies, such as <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> and the American Red Cross. The program is established as an organization by Title 10 of the United States Code and its purposes defined by Title 36.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began {{to believe that the}} fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.|$|E
5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by <b>local</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b> Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E
