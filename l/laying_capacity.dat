40|$|Snail {{intermediate}} host {{control is a}} widely canvassed strategy for schistosomiasis control in endemic countries. While there have been increasing studies on the search for potent molluscicides in the past years, the use of nanoparticulate agents as molluscicides is yet to gain wide attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the molluscicidal potential of curcumin-nisin poly lactic acid (PLA) entrapped nanoparticle (CurNisNp) against Biomphalaria pfeifferi, a snail {{intermediate host}} for Schistosoma mansoni. CurNisNp formulated by double emulsion method was tested against the young adults, < 1 week, 1 - 2 -week old juveniles, 1 day (blastula) and 7 day-old (hippo-stage) egg masses of B. pfeifferi. Mortality in the different stages was determined after 96 -h of exposure at varying concentrations (350, 175, 87. 5, 43. 75 and 21. 88 ppm). The sub-lethal effects of CurNisNp on the hatchability of the 7 -day-old egg masses and egg <b>laying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the young adult snails were determined. The CurNisNp diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential and drug entrapment efficiency were 284. 0 ± 17. 9 nm, 0. 166 ± 0. 03, - 16. 6 ± 2. 45 mV and 35. 0 % respectively. The < 1 week old juveniles and the 1 -day-old egg stage (blastula) of B. pfeifferi with LC 50 277. 9 ppm and 4279. 5 ppm were the most susceptible and resistant stages to the drug respectively. CurNisNp was also observed to cause significant reductions (P< 0. 05) in egg hatchability and egg <b>laying</b> <b>capacity</b> with strong negative correlation between egg <b>laying</b> <b>capacity</b> and concentration (r = - 0. 928; P< 0. 05). This study showed that CurNisNp has molluscicidal activities on different developmental stages of B. pfeifferi.

Normally, a hen lays eggs continuously for about 72 weeks, thereafter the <b>laying</b> <b>capacity</b> decreases. This protocol describes the extraction of total IgY from egg yolk {{by means of a}} precipitation procedure (PEG. Polson et al. 1980). The method involves two important steps.

40|$|The {{mosquito}} midgut plays {{a central}} role in the sporogonic development of malaria parasites. We have found that polyclonal sera, produced against mosquito midguts, blocked the passage of Plasmodium falciparum ookinetes across the midgut, leading to a significant reduction of infections in mosquitoes. Anti-midgut mAbs were produced that display broad-spectrum activity, blocking parasite development of both P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites in five different species of mosquitoes. In addition to their parasite transmission-blocking activity, these mAbs also reduced mosquito survivorship and fecundity. These results reveal that mosquito midgut-based antibodies have the potential to reduce malaria transmission in a synergistic manner by lowering both vector competence, through transmission-blocking effects on parasite development, and vector abundance, by decreasing mosquito survivorship and egg <b>laying</b> <b>capacity.</b> Because the intervention can block transmission of different malaria parasite species in various species of mosquitoes, vaccines against such midgut receptors may block malaria transmission worldwide...|$|E

The observations were performed in a flock of 55, 000 commercial layers (50, 000 Lohmann White and 5, 000 Lohmann Brown). At the age of 30 weeks, Lohmann White layers exhibited a number of growths (at an average of 60 hens per week, representing 0. 1 % of the flock) in the region of leg toes on a daily basis over 28 weeks that regressed during the remaining flock production period. Gross and histological investigations identified the lesions as keratoacanthomas. PCR analysis was negative for avian leukosis virus (ALV) and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV).

40|$|Lake Victoria, {{like other}} large lakes in the world, is a shared {{resource}} and forms an international boundary between Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. It {{is the second}} largest fresh water lake {{in the world with}} an area of 69, 0000 Km 2, a convoluted shoreline of 4800 Km and a volume of 2, 700 km 3. The lake lies {{in one of the most}} populous regions in the world, serving as a source of livelihood for some 30 million people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania who depend on it for fisheries, transport, power generation, biodiversity conservation, tourism, recreation, agricultural, industrial and domestic needs. Current estimates put the annual fish catch between 400, 000 and 500, 000 metric tonnes generating some US$ 300 - 400 million. In Kenya about 90 % of the total fish landed is from this lake. Its fishery directly employs about 100, 000 people but more than 2 million people are involved in other indirect activities. The invasion of this strategic water body by the worlds worst aquatic weed, water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes in the early 1990 s posed a serious challenge to the widely acknowledged biological control strategy. In its native range in the Amazonian Brazil, its natural enemies keep the weed in check. The most important of these are two Curculionidae weevils, Neochetina eichhorniae and N. bruchi. While control has been attained with remarkable success elsewhere in the world using these agents, no information is available on the biology, population dynamics and their impact on water hyacinth in the Lake Victoria Basin. These studies were therefore aimed at quantifying and filling these information gaps. The mean fecundity of the two weevils was recorded as 290 and 237 eggs per female laid over a period of 16 weeks, with an adult longevity of 98 and 112 days for Neochetina bruchi and N. eichhorniae respectively. A two-way analysis of variance showed there was significant difference between the egg <b>laying</b> <b>capacities</b> of the two weevil species (p= 0. 002). The survival rate of the two species was significantly different (p< 0. 05) for all life stages except for larvae to pupa. There was no significant interaction between the species and the method of egg setting (p< 0. 05). These studies were conducted in an open laboratory at KARI, Kibos. The impact of these weevils on water hyacinth was evaluated at 3 satellite ponds each in the riparian districts of Busia, Kisumu and Nyando. The parameters evaluated were fresh weight, number of ramettes, petioles, feeding scars, percent damaged petioles, laminar area and petiole length. The comparative field survival of the weevils was evaluated by recording the number of adults, eggs, larvae and pupae recovered at every site. A sample size of 18 plants was used at every site, with sampling conducted once every month for 12 calendar months at Okana (Kisumu) and Otho (Nyando). Data for Budalangi (Busia) was taken for six months only. The percent damaged petioles were consistently higher with an increase in the number of larvae (the most destructive stage) at all the sites. These weevils are effective biological control agents and for maximum results, they should be used synergistically for the control of water hyacinth in the Lake Victoria Basin...|$|R
