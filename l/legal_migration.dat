[...] The restavek tradition is perpetuated by widespread tolerance for the practice throughout Haiti.

40|$|Peer-reviewedThis paper {{presents}} a protocol {{for the protection}} of mobile agents against external replay attacks. This kind of attacks are performed by malicious platforms when dispatching an agent multiple times to a remote host, thus making it reexecute part of its itinerary. Current proposals aiming to address this problem are based on storing agent identifiers, or trip markers, inside agent platforms, so that future reexecutions can be detected and prevented. The problem of these solutions is that they do not allow the agent to perform <b>legal</b> <b>migrations</b> to the same platform several times. The aim {{of this paper is to}} address these issues by presenting a novel solution based on authorisation entities, which allow the agent to be reexecuted on the same platform a number of times determined at runtime.

Like in any country rather sparsely populated, sub-Saharan peoples are prone to migrate even if the low rural population density weakens the effect. Moreover, as the populations have got younger during the 90 s because of a demographic transition far from being completed, their migration rate to rich countries should have risen. Young men are swifter indeed to leave their countries. <b>Legal</b> <b>migrations</b> have admittedly increased but in proportion to sub-Saharan population.

5000|$|It {{was only}} in 1997 that two Presidential decrees {{introduced}} the first regularization program in Greece. Presidential decrees 358/1997 and 359/1997 were ill-designed, mismanaged, and {{made it difficult for}} migrants to be successfully regularized, but they laid the first foundations for an institutional framework in Greece that tried to actually deal with immigration in a way that went beyond deportation. A New Law on Aliens introduced in 2001 concentrated on short-sighted regulation of migration through restrictive <b>legal</b> <b>migration</b> channels, and a larger regularization program and more comprehensive policy framework to deal with immigration in the long term. There were some benefits to this law, such as the right to be informed in a language one understood while in detention, and obligatory nine-year education for migrant children. However, certain aspects of the law, such as the need to renew visas every year, neglected the needs of local labor markets to fill positions in a relatively short time, and almost completely ignored the fact that many immigrants would still try to migrate illegally. Lawful residence of migrants who had not already been in Greece before 2001 was very difficult under this law. The immigration law was also still discriminatory regarding citizenship acquisition and made distinctions between co-ethnic returnees and [...] "foreigners" [...] or [...] "aliens". In 2004 the government decided to issue permits of two-year duration, as opposed to one-year, which cut down on time and monetary costs of applying for a visa, but there were still many issues with regularization. The small number of work permits, their limited duration, and the general policy orientation of the Greek government was not conducive to creating sustainable immigration policy.|$|E
