5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E

30|$|Consequently, FVB {{students}} with other school profiles are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> wish to study (Chi square =  22.23, p =  0.000).

In addition, gender effects can be identified. Therefore, according to literature (e.g., Neuenschwander 2012; Schmid and Gonon 2011 a, b) and the official statistics (FSO 2013 c), male FVB students more <b>likely</b> wish <b>to</b> study than female FVB students (who are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or <b>to</b> do both; Chi Square =  19.68, p =  0.000).

Moreover, no significant effects of migration background were found (Chi Square =  3.74, p =  0.154). Finally, there are significant effects regarding to the educational background of the FVB students’ parents: FVB students who have parents with an academic degree are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> wish to study than FVB students who have no parents with an academic degree (Chi Square =  10.26; p =  0.006).|$|R
25|$|There are {{multiple}} misconceptions {{in regards to}} poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low socioeconomic status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families. It {{is not an issue}} of value, but more so a problem of access. A parent from a lower socioeconomic class is likely to have more factors than a parent from a wealthy socioeconomic class that may affect their involvement with their child’s education. For instance a person living in poverty is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their child’s education. The teachers, faculty, and administrators of the schools have to take these real-life factors into consideration.|$|E
25|$|Measured {{against the}} Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2010, Allestree {{falls within the}} top 5% least {{deprived}} with Derby as a whole being in the top 25%.

At the 2001 census the unemployment rate was lower at 3.6% than the English average of 5.8%, with 25.67% of those being long-term unemployed compared with {{the national average of}} 30.26%. Allestree residents are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> within the city centre than other areas of the city and tend to travel further for work than other wards. The main employers within the ward are the University of Derby, which employs around 3000 people, and the shops and businesses within Park Farm.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{may often}} do types {{of work that}} natives are largely unwilling to do, {{contributing}} to greater economic prosperity for {{the economy as a}} whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity. Research indicates that immigrants are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment. Further, some studies indicate that higher ethnic concentration in metropolitan areas is positively related to the probability of self-employment of immigrants.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the intentions of Honduran medical students to emigrate or <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a rural setting, and their association with parental education. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, analytic study at a Honduran medical school. Student participants completed a structured questionnaire, which assessed their intentions <b>to</b> emigrate or <b>work</b> in a rural setting after finishing medical school and {{the highest level of}} education achieved by their parents. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their respective 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: Of 868 surveys distributed, 564 were completed. The mean age of the participants was 21 (standard deviation 3) years, and 62. 2 % were female. Of the respondents, 16. 6 % intended <b>to</b> emigrate <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and 11. 2 % intended <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a rural setting. Higher paternal education (i. e., technical, university and postgraduate training) was associated with a higher rate of intention to emigrate. Students whose fathers underwent postgraduate education were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a rural setting. For maternal education, only the postgraduate level was associated with the outcomes in some of the tested models. CONCLUSION: The frequency of students intending to emigrate was relatively low. However, the frequency of students being willing <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in rural settings was also low. Students whose parents had higher levels of education were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>work</b> abroad and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a rural area. These factors should be considered in medical schools' selection processes to improve retention and ensure adequate distribution of physicians...|$|R
25|$|Mearsheimer's {{first book}} Conventional Deterrence (1983) {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how decisions to start a war depend on the projected outcome of military conflict. In other words, how do decision makers' beliefs about the outcome of war affect {{the success or failure of}} deterrence? Mearsheimer's basic argument is that deterrence is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> when the potential attacker believes that a successful attack will be unlikely and costly. If the potential attacker, however, has reason to believe the attack will likely succeed and entail low costs, then deterrence is likely to break down. This is now widely accepted to be the way the principle of deterrence works. Specifically, Mearsheimer argues that the success of deterrence is determined by the strategy available to the potential attacker. He lays out three strategies. First, a war-of-attrition strategy, which entails a high level of uncertainty about the outcome of war and high costs for the attacker. Second, a limited-aims strategy, which entails fewer risks and lower costs. And, third, a blitzkrieg strategy, which provides a way to defeat the enemy rapidly and decisively, with relatively low costs. For Mearsheimer, failures in the modern battlefield are due mostly to the potential attacker's belief that it can successfully implement a blitzkrieg strategy in which tanks and other mechanized forces are employed swiftly to effect a deep penetration and disrupt the enemy's rear. The other two strategies are unlikely to lead to deterrence failures because they would entail a low probability of success accompanied by high costs (war of attrition) or limited gains and the possibility of the conflict turning into a war of attrition (limited aims). If the attacker has a coherent blitzkrieg strategy available, however, an attack is likely to ensue, as its potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks of starting a war.|$|E

500|$|The state officially {{labeled the}} All-China Women's Federation an NGO in 1995. Yet how {{applicable}} the term NGO {{is to the}} ACWF has been contested, given the ACWF’s long and continuing relationship with the CPC. Some leaders in the women’s movement opposed the ACWF attending an NGO forum in Manila in 1993 {{because they did not}} believe that it met the criteria of an NGO. Even the ACWF hesitates using the term NGO within China because it has been linked to anti-government groups, although it has embraced the title internationally. International donor agencies generally are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with NGO's, so the classification of an NGO has helped the ACWF obtain financing from international organizations. [...] Others believe that the ACWF classifies as an NGO because it has separated itself from the government in recent years, and still others believes that ACWF could be classified as a NGO if the definition was broadened. [...] Those is support of this modified stance believe that complete separation from the government would be impossible and harmful to the ACWF. The ACWF continues to have internal and external debates about the NGO title.|$|E
