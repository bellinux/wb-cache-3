Therefore, the students wishing to study abroad under the Erasmus+ programme are asked to get their learning agreements approved by their departments before application to the host institution. The signatures on the <b>learning</b> <b>agreement</b> assure the exchange students that their credits will be recognised and incorporated into their transcript of records as courses taken abroad. To ensure the recognition, the students are also asked to prepare a document of course equivalence in which the courses to be taken abroad and those they will be considered equal with after the mobility period are shown. This document, which is signed by the student {{and the members of}} the recognition committee of the department composed of the head of department, the Erasmus+ coordinator and the staff member responsible for course equivalence, and signed and stamped by the dean following a discussion in the faculty board, is a guarantor for the student in question showing that the courses to be taken abroad will be recognised as shon on the document.|$|E

30|$|The {{discussion}} {{during the}} focus group was initiated by asking teachers to have read in advance {{a case study of}} a Finnish learner, Rosa, who had already undertaken an ECVET mobility in Iceland as part of her programme of tourism studies in Finland (Finnish Board of Education 2012). The discussion focused in particular on what was needed to be done before, during and after the mobility, and what implications it raised for the professional knowledge of teachers. Guiding customers from different countries while using a foreign language herself were some of the reasons used to determine the learning outcomes chosen, as well as developing competence in organising various horse-riding events in Iceland. In accordance with ECVET principles and procedures, a Memorandum of understanding was concluded with an Icelandic educational institution in the tourism industry.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with identifying ways of facilitating “meaningful disagreement” amongst students in interprofessional online discussion forums. It builds on previous research that identified a trend toward polite agreement and only limited evidence of disagreement in this setting. Given the suggestion that disagreement indicates a deeper level of engagement in group discussion and therefore leads to deeper learning, {{our aim was to}} critique the pedagogical approach adopted by analyzing whether we were promoting a particular interprofessional discourse amongst students that favored agreement and therefore limited potential <b>learning.</b> <b>Agreement</b> in this context has been conceptualized as a form of online interprofessional “netiquette” existing amongst participants. Findings suggest that creating an online context for critical discourse is challenging; however, the careful construction of learning outcomes, trigger material/resources and learning activities, as well as attention to students' stage of study and life experience, can provoke the desired effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For many Australian {{institutions}} {{issues about}} the equivalence {{of standards and}} quality of educational provision with overseas partners is of increasing importance. The topic of quality in such partnerships encompasses ways to regulate and control new and existing partnerships {{in the provision of}} higher education, while achieving growth in student numbers, and in ways that are affordable by students, and remains sustainable in terms of the demands on providers while delivering consistency in the learning outcomes. This paper considers a case study of two Malaysian partnerships with an Australian university through which five undergraduate and postgraduate degrees are offered. The case study examines how an institutional quality assurance system scheme has been adapted to become relevant in other contexts, and in a variety of partnering models, and how this is evidenced and evaluated. To ensure positive outcomes, RMIT and its partners evidence the quality of their programs through a Teaching and <b>Learning</b> <b>Agreement</b> which spells out the responsibilities of each partner and indicates where the evidence can be found t...|$|E
40|$|The study investigates how {{agreement}} between leaders' and their team's perceptions influence intervention outcomes in a leadership-training intervention {{aimed at improving}} organizational <b>learning.</b> <b>Agreement,</b> i. e. perceptual distance was calculated for the organizational learning dimensions at baseline. Changes in the dimensions from pre-intervention to post-intervention were evaluated using polynomial regression analysis with response surface analysis. The general pattern of {{the results indicated that}} the organizational learning improved when leaders and their teams agreed on the level of organizational learning prior to the intervention. The improvement was greatest when the leader's and the team's perceptions at baseline were aligned and high rather than aligned and low. The least beneficial scenario was when the leader's perceptions were higher than the team's perceptions. These results give insights into the importance of comparing leaders' and their team's perceptions in intervention research. Polynomial regression analyses with response surface methodology allow three-dimensional examination of relationship between two predictor variables and an outcome. This contributes with knowledge on how combination of predictor variables may affect outcome and allows studies of potential non-linearity relating to the outcome. Future studies could use these methods in process evaluation of interventions...|$|E

This presentation will give attendees {{an overview of}} the former binary higher education system in South Africa; the differentiated funding; the cooperative education foundations of current Universities of Technology and Comprehensive Institutions and the existing quality imperatives pertaining to work integrated learning. A comparison will be made with regard to the specific quality imperatives of, among others, the Higher Education Quality Authority and international best practices pertaining to work integrated learning. These include: stakeholder-inclusivity regarding curriculum design and development; the obligation to place students where work-integrated learning is part of the curriculum; effective management and coordination; provision of adequate infrastructure; <b>learning</b> <b>agreements</b> clarifying the outcomes and the roles and responsibilities of the institution, students, mentors and employers; mentoring of students; effective communication; regular and systematic monitoring of progress of students; and academic as well as workplace based assessment.

40|$|Active {{learning}} is a popular concept for motivating learning. Learning agreements are one strategy towards this goal. They {{can be used to}} aid the students to take ownership of their learning and in becoming more active in a course. Learning Agreements are especially useful tools for scaffolding learning in courses with a focus on developing the professional competencies of students, such as in Open Ended Group Projects, Work Integrated Learning or other authentic learning contexts. Such educational contexts are complex and we have found it necessary to scaffold student learning using agreements based on professional competencies. This has led to a pedagogical framework, which has found successful application in a number of contexts. This framework has been built based on discussions with students, and has involved the development of a supporting wiki which contains descriptions of the different professional competencies involved in the <b>learning</b> <b>agreement.</b> The IT based framework has been iteratively developed together with the students taking the course in the fall of 2015.

40|$|Over recent years, {{a central}} concern of {{policy has been}} to drive up post- 16 {{participation}} rates in full-time education and {{address the needs of}} young people not in education, employment or training (NEET). As a result, young people who enter work which is classified as 'without training' at 16 / 17 have largely been ignored. However, the decision to Raise the Participation Age (RPA) for continuing in learning for all 17 -year olds from 2013 and for all 18 -year olds from 2015 in England, together with a growing unease {{about the impact of the}} current recession on youth unemployment rates, have revived interest in the 'jobs without training' (JWT) group. This paper draws on the findings from two studies: first, a qualitative study in two contrasting local labour markets, of young people in JWT, together with their employers and parents; and second, an evaluation of the <b>Learning</b> <b>Agreement</b> Pilots (LAP), which was the first policy initiative in England targeted at the JWT group. Both studies reveal a dearth of understanding about early labour market entrants and a lack of policy intervention and infrastructure to support the needs of the JWT group throughout the UK. From this, it is concluded that questionable assumptions have been made about the composition and the aspirations of young people in JWT, and their employers, on the basis of little or no evidence. As a consequence, a policy 'quick fix' to satisfy the RPA agenda will not easily be achieved. If the decision to raise the participation age is adopted also by the Welsh and Scottish parliaments, similar challenges may have to be faced...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{candidate}} experience {{in order to understand}} more deeply aspects of the development in work based research. Delphi technique was chosen as an approach in order to capture a range of experience and data, to inform how we may best support candidates on practice based doctorates. Many such programmes include a stakeholder <b>learning</b> <b>agreement</b> between the candidate, the university and the employer organisation with the common aim to bring about transformational and sustainable change. Our research to date indicates a disparity within the agreement in the level of stakeholder participation. Where the organisation stakeholder is not fully engaged and involved in supporting the research, there is a potential threat to the effectiveness of any change outcome. Current practice based doctoral research participants were invited to relate to a range of temporal themes in their research project cycle, for example: setting up the project; implementing the project; changes/ contingency planning within the project; project completion and post completion. Of particular interest in relation to the above was the availability of resources and how they were used within the project life cycle. In this respect, resources are deemed to include, human, material, time, personal and organisational culture influence. The allocation, manipulation and distribution of such resources can be understood in terms of power relationships. The paper presents our experience and reflections from two iterative Delphi cycles and proposes a final stage of greater integration with existing academic resources within the professional doctorate programme. The study has enabled the researchers to gain a new understanding of how power may operate in a work based research project through the experience of undertaking the Delphi approach. Furthermore, by thinking about affordances of the project life cycle, it may help us to better understand needs and strategy for the curriculum in order to more effectively support candidates through their transformational learning experience. The consequences of such change might have implications for participation and power distribution within the management and leadership of doctoral work base research projects...|$|E
