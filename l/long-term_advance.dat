40|$|Abstract. – The {{effective}} Coulomb {{interaction between}} globular proteins is calculated {{as a function}} of monovalent salt concentration cs, by explicit Molecular Dynamics simulations of pairs of model proteins in the presence of microscopic co and counterions. For discrete charge patterns of monovalent sites on the surface, the resulting osmotic virial coefficient B 2 is found to be a strikingly non-monotonic function of cs. The non-monotonicity follows from a subtle Coulomb correlation effect which is completely missed by conventional non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory and explains various experimental findings. A more fundamental understanding of the interactions between nano-sized biomolecules is critical to the <b>long-term</b> <b>advance</b> of modern biomedical research [1]. The best strategy for a predictive calculation is to study simple coarse-grained models where effects can be clearly separated and approximations can be systematically tested. While for micron-sized colloidal particles such coarse-grained models have led to a quantitative understanding of the effective interactions [2], the challenging question is how far this concept can be transferred to nano-particles. A particular issue is the aggregation and crystallization of globular proteins in solution...|$|E
40|$|The <b>long-term</b> <b>advance</b> in {{the timing}} of bird spring {{migration}} in the Northern Hemisphere is associated with global climate change. The extent to which changes in bird phenology reflect responses to weather conditions in the wintering or breeding areas, or during migration, however, remains to be elucidated. We analyse the relationships between {{the timing of}} spring migration of 9 species of trans-Saharan migratory birds across the, Mediterranean, and thermal and precipitation anomalies in the main wintering areas south of the Sahara Desert and in North African stopover areas. Median migration dates were collected on the island of Capri (southern Italy) by standardized mist-netting during 1981 to 2004. High temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa (Sahel and Gulf of Guinea) prior to northward migration (February and March) were associated with advanced migration. Moreover, birds migrated earlier when winter rainfall in North Africa was more abundant. The relationships between relevant meteorological variables and timing of migration were remarkably consistent among species, suggesting a coherent response to the same extrinsic stimuli. All these results were obtained while statistically controlling for the long-term trend towards the earlier timing of spring migration across the Mediterranean that has been documented in previous analyses of the same dataset, a trend that was confirmed by the present analyses. In conclusion, our results suggest that thermal conditions in the wintering quarters, as well as rainfall in North African stopover areas, can influence interannual variation in migration phenology of trans-Saharan migratory birds, although the ecological mechanisms that causally link meteorological conditions to the timing of migration remain a matter of speculation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recognizing useful {{modular robot}} {{configurations}} composed {{of hundreds of}} modules is a significant challenge. Matching a new modular robot configuration to a library of known configurations is essential in identifying and applying control schemes. We present three different algorithms {{to address the problem}} of (a) matching and (b) mapping new robot configu-rations onto a library of known configurations. The first method solves the problem using graph isomorphisms and can identify configurations that share the same underlying graph structure, but have different port connections amongst the modules. The second approach compares graph spectra of configuration matri-ces to find a permutation matrix that maps a given configuration to a known one. The third algorithm exploits the unique structure of the problem for the particular robots used in our research to achieve impressive gains in performance and speed over existing techniques, especially for larger configurations. With these three algorithms, this paper presents novel solutions to the problem of configuration recognition and sheds light on theoretical and practical issues for <b>long-term</b> <b>advances</b> in this important area of modular robotics. Results and examples are provided to compare the performance of the three algorithms and discuss their relative advantages. I...|$|R

In addition technology managers are under increasing pressure to produce better results more productively. A resulting trend is greater use of external relationships and resources to achieve the needed technological accomplishments with greater efficiency. There are innumerable alternatives for combining internal and external corporate resources (primarily personnel and equipment) to obtain the needed advanced technologies. Also the decision on how to acquire advanced soft technologies, typically labor intensive, may depend on the learning and forgetting inherent in the personnel using the technologies, the amount of technology capacity needed per period, and the resulting cost implications.
