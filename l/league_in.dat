40|$|This article {{develops}} a contest model to compare social welfare <b>in</b> homogeneous <b>leagues</b> <b>in</b> which all clubs maximize identical objective functions with mixed <b>leagues</b> <b>in</b> which clubs maximize different objective functions. We show that homogeneous <b>leagues</b> <b>in</b> which all clubs are profit maximizers dominate all other <b>leagues.</b> Mixed <b>leagues</b> <b>in</b> which small-market clubs are profit maximizers and large-market clubs are win maximizers (type-I mixed leagues) {{are dominated by}} all other leagues. From a welfare perspective, large-market clubs win too often in (purely) win-maximizing and type-I mixed leagues; whereas, small-market clubs win too many games <b>in</b> (purely) profit-maximizing <b>leagues</b> and <b>in</b> mixed <b>leagues</b> <b>in</b> which largemarket clubs are profit maximizers and small-market clubs are win maximizers (type-II mixed leagues). These results have important policy implications: Social welfare will increase if clubs are reorganized from non-profit member associations to profit-maximizing corporations. Moreover, we show that revenue sharing decreases (increases) social welfare <b>in</b> mixed (homogeneous) <b>leagues...</b>|$|R
