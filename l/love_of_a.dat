5|$|The Bhagavata Purana and the Kathasaritsagara continue, that on {{advice of}} Shiva, Rati assumes {{the form of}} Sambara's kitchen-maid Mayavati and awaits her husband's arrival in Sambara's house. Sambara is foretold that the reborn Kama would be his destroyer. Sambara finds out that Kama was born as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and his wife Rukmini. He steals the child and throws him in the ocean, where the child is {{swallowed}} by a fish. This fish is caught by fishermen and sent to Sambara's kitchen. When the fish is cut, the child is found by Mayavati, who decides to nurture him. The divine sage Narada reveals to Mayavati that she was Rati and the child was Kama and she was to rear him. As the child grew up, the motherly love of Mayavati changes to the passionate <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wife. The reborn Kama resents her advances, as he considers her his mother. Mayavati tells him the secret of their previous births as narrated by Narada {{and that he was}} not her son, but that of Krishna and Rukmini. Mayavati trains Pradyumna in magic and war and advises him to kill Sambara. Pradyumna defeats Sambara and slays him. He returns to Dvārakā, Krishna's capital with Mayavati as his wife, where they are welcomed.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poor girl, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In Match Point, Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E
