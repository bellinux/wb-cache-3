500|$|With {{the score}} at 2/65, Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss {{directly}} downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as [...] "miraculous" [...] because Tallon {{had to reach}} so low, so quickly, {{in order to take}} the catch. Another dive to stop a leg glance resulted in a severely bruised <b>left</b> <b>little</b> <b>finger.</b> Tallon conceded 16 byes [...] in the second innings, more than 8% of England's score. Australia won the Test by 409 runs, and nursing his finger, Tallon was rested for both tour matches between the Tests, which were against Surrey and Gloucestershire, which were won by ten wickets and an innings respectively. In his place, Saggers scored 12, took nine dismissals and conceded 31 byes in four innings.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{sustaining}} {{an injury}} from a catching error, Tallon {{was selected for}} the First Test at Trent Bridge. He took four catches, including two difficult ones to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} the second innings. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, which was converted into an eight-wicket victory. The teams moved on to Lord's and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings. Tallon made 53 and helped the tail to [...] "wag" [...] and recover from a position of 7/258. Tallon did not concede a bye in England's first innings of 215 and his diving was estimated to have saved around 40runs. One of the three catches he took stood out; it came when Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as [...] "miraculous" [...] because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to take the catch. Another dive to stop a leg glance resulted in a severely bruised <b>left</b> <b>little</b> <b>finger.</b> However, Tallon also conceded 16 byes in England's total of 186. Australia won the Test, and Tallon was rested ahead of the next Test to allow his finger to recover.|$|E
2500|$|While {{handwriting}} analysts did not definitively link Heirens's handwriting to the [...] "Lipstick Message", police {{claimed that}} his fingerprints matched a print discovered {{at the scene}} of the Frances Brown murder.

Furthermore, a fingerprint of the <b>left</b> <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> also allegedly connected Heirens to the ransom note with nine points of comparison. As Heirens's nine points of comparison were loops, this could also provide a match to 65% of the population. At the time Heirens's supporters pointed out the FBI handbook regarding fingerprint identification required 12 points of comparison matching to have a positive identification.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Chicago, he turned over the {{photographs}} of the revealed prints on the note to Sergeant Thomas Laffey, the Chicago Police Department's fingerprint expert. After his examination he stated to the press that they were [...] "...so incomplete {{that it is impossible}} to classify them." [...] Despite checking these [...] "incomplete" [...] prints with everyone arrested between January 1946 and June 29, 1946, he was unable to find a match even though William Heirens was previously arrested and fingerprinted on May 1, 1946 on a weapons charge. Heirens was arrested for burglary on June 26, 1946; three days later Sergeant Laffey announced a nine-point comparison match to Heirens <b>left</b> <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> with one of the prints. Then a match was announced between Heirens and the second print. In a news conference State's Attorney Tuohy declared that [...] "there could be no doubt now" [...] about the suspect's guilt but then incongruously also stated that they didn't actually have enough evidence to indict Heirens.|$|E
40|$|Several {{previous}} studies have investigated the gender difference of the fingerprint features. However, regarding to the statistical significance of such differences, inconsistent results have been obtained. To resolve this problem {{and to develop a}} method for gender determination, this work proposes and tests three fingertip features for gender determination. Fingerprints were obtained from 115 normal healthy adults and comprised of 57 male and 58 female volunteers. All persons were born in Taiwan and were of Han nationality. The age range was 18 - 35 years. The features of this study are ridge count, ridge density, and finger size, all three of which can easily be determined by counting and calculation. Experimental results show that the tested ridge density features alone are not very effective for gender determination. However, the proposed ridge count and finger size features of <b>left</b> <b>little</b> <b>fingers</b> are useful, achieving a classification accuracy of 75 % (P-value< 0. 001) and 79 % (P-value< 0. 001), respectively. The best classification result of 86 % accuracy is obtained by using ridge count and finger size features together. This paper closes with a discussion of possible future research directions...|$|R

2500|$|After Burroughs {{graduated}} from Harvard, his formal education ended, except for brief flirtations with graduate study {{of anthropology at}} Columbia and medicine in Vienna, Austria. He traveled to Europe and became involved in Austrian and Hungarian Weimar-era LGBT culture; he picked up young men in steam baths in Vienna and moved in a circle of exiles, homosexuals, and runaways. There, he met Ilse Klapper, a Jewish woman fleeing the country's Nazi government. The two were never romantically involved, but Burroughs married her, in Croatia, against the wishes of his parents, {{to allow her to}} gain a visa to the United States. She made her way to New York City, and eventually divorced Burroughs, although they remained friends for many years. After returning to the United States, he held a string of uninteresting jobs. In 1939, his mental health became a concern for his parents, especially after he deliberately severed the last joint of his <b>left</b> <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> at the knuckle to impress a man with whom he was infatuated.

40|$|Tactile signals on a {{hand that}} serves as {{movement}} goal are enhanced during movement planning and execution. Here, we examined how spatially specific tactile enhancement is when humans reach to their own static hand. Participants discriminated two brief and simultaneously presented tactile stimuli: a comparison stimulus on the <b>left</b> thumb or <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> from a reference stimulus on the sternum. Tactile stimuli were presented either during right-hand reaching towards the <b>left</b> thumb or <b>little</b> <b>finger,</b> or while holding both hands still (baseline). Consistent with our previous findings, stimuli on the left hand were perceived stronger during movement than baseline. However, tactile enhancement was not stronger when the stimuli were presented on the digit that served as reach target, thus the perception across the whole hand was uniformly enhanced. In experiment 2, we also presented stimuli on the upper arm in half of the trials to reduce the expectation of the stimulus location. Tactile stimuli on the target hand, {{but not on the}} upper arm, were generally enhanced, supporting the idea of a spatial gradient of tactile enhancement. Overall, our findings argue for low spatial specificity of tactile enhancement at movement-relevant body parts, here the target hand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Our {{non-invasive}} brain computer interface uses EEG {{signals and}} beta frequency bands over sensorimotor cortex to control cursor movement horizontally (i. e., one-dimension). The main {{goal of this}} study is to help people with sever motor disabilities (i. e., Spinal cord injuries) and provide them a new way of communication and control options by which they can move the cursor in one dimension. In this study, offline analysis of the data collected was used to make the user able of controlling the movement of the cursor horizontally (i. e., one dimension). The data was collected during a session in which the user selected among two targets by thinking and moving either the right hand <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> or the <b>left</b> hand <b>little</b> <b>finger.</b> The Adaptive-Network based fuzzy inference system algorithm was examined for the classification method with some parameters. In the offline analysis, the method used showed a significant performance in the classification accuracy level and it gave an accuracy level of more than 80 %.
