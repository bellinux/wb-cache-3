Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). It was generally assumed that Nichols would become the AEC's Director of Military Application, but while Nichol's relationship with the AEC was cordial and the commissioners were impressed with his administrative skills, it also became clear that Nichols did not agree with the commissioners' concept of the Director of Military Application as a staff rather than a <b>line</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{authority}} and {{position of the}} design management function has a large influence on what the design manager does {{in his or her}} daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function: design management as <b>line</b> <b>function,</b> design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a [...] "line function" [...] is directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited {{authority and}} the need to consult line managers and staff.

50|$|The lateral {{line system}} is {{necessary}} to detect vibrations made by prey, and to orient towards the source to begin predatory action. Fish are able to detect movement, produced either by prey or a vibrating metal sphere, and orient themselves toward the source before proceeding to make a predatory strike at it. This behavior persists even in blinded fish, but is greatly diminished when lateral <b>line</b> <b>function</b> was inhibited by CoCl2 application. Cobalt chloride treatment results in the release of cobalt ions, disrupting ionic transport and preventing signal transduction in the lateral lines. These behaviors are dependent specifically on mechanoreceptors located within the canals of the lateral line.|$|E
