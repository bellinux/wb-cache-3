The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing <b>liver</b> <b>damage</b> also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, {{it has been suggested}} that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.|$|E

5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of <b>liver</b> <b>damage</b> in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the <b>liver,</b> <b>damage</b> by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown the {{pathogenic}} effects of grains cultivated in the endemic areas of Keshan disease and selenium is effective {{in the prevention of}} this disease. In this study, <b>liver</b> <b>damages</b> induced by feeding grains from an endemic area (endemic diet), and the effects of selenium and α-tocopherol supplement were examined. After 3 months on the endemic diet, the amounts of serum enzymes were significantly increased when compared to controls (animals receiving diet from a non-endemic area). Liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase and choline esterase) were also found to be altered in the serum, further suggesting <b>liver</b> <b>damages</b> in animals on an endemic diet. Supplement of the endemic diet with selenium or α-tocopherol reversed the changes in serum enzymes. Increase in lipid peroxidation in the liver of animals on the endemic diet was observed when compared to that in control animals. Selenium and α-tocopherol supplements prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation in the liver by the endemic diet. Semi-quantitative histochemical analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase in liver tissue showed that the livers of animals on an endemic diet were more sensitive to ischemic damages in vitro. Supplementation of the endemic diet with either selenium or α-tocopherol reduced the sensitivity to ischemic damages. The results suggest that increased lipid peroxidation in the liver of rats on an endemic diet may be responsible for <b>liver</b> <b>damages</b> and elevation of serum enzymes. Restoration of glutathione peroxidase activity by selenium supplement or an increase in the content of α-tocopherol in the liver can prevent lipid peroxidation in animals on an endemic diet and thus provide the protective effects against <b>liver</b> <b>damages.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory failure and death. Indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison.

5|$|During HBV infection, {{the host}} immune {{response}} causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although <b>liver</b> <b>damage</b> is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E

5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in <b>liver</b> <b>damage</b> and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.|$|E

Objective : to prove the hepatoprotector effect of polifenol in green tea by measuring serum ALP level as indicator of <b>liver</b> <b>damaged</b> in Wistar rat given chloramphenicol. Methods : This true experimental use The Post Test Control Group design. The population of this experiment werw obtained from healthy female Wistar Rats, about 7 - 9 weeks old and ± 125 gram in weight, which divided randomly into three groups and ten rats in each group. The Control group (K) was only given physiologic NaCl in 21 days. The first treatment group (P 1) and the second treatment group (P 2) were given Chloramphenicol 25 mg/kg weight on the sixth day up to 21 th day. But before, since on first day up to 21 th day, P 2 group was given boiled water of green tea 165 mg twice a day. On the 22 th day, we took the rat’s blood from abdominal vein to measure the level of serum ALP.

The diabetes model in rats was induced with a single injection of Streptozotocin-(60 mg/kg) dissolved in citrate buffer (0. 05 mole). The high glucose level of 250 mg/dl is defined as the diabetic criterion. The extract was administered orally (150 mg/kg/day). The exercise program was six weeks of aerobic exercise, 5 times a week with 50 - 55 of maximal oxygen consumption.
