Methods and Results: Neutralized cell-free culture supernatants containing active bacteriocins, and antibiotics were tested with the agar diffusion test and the disc-diffusion method, respectively. The tested intestinal strains showed high sensitivity to most antibiotics except for streptomycin and oxacillin. Nisins A and Z (8 <b>lg</b> per <b>well)</b> had similar activity spectra and inhibited all Gram-positive intestinal bacteria at different levels (except Streptococcus salivarius), with bifidobacteria (except Bifidobacterium breve and Bif. catenulatum), Collinsella aerofaciens and Eubacterium biforme being the most sensitive strains, {{but they were not}} active against Gram-negative bacteria. Surprisingly, none of the tested strains were inhibited by pediocin PA- 1 (16 <b>lg</b> per <b>well).</b> Conclusion: Pediocin PA- 1 which is very active against Listeria spp. and other food pathogens did not inhibit major intestinal species in the human intestine in contrast to both nisins A and Z. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our data suggest that pediocin PA- 1 has potential to inhibit Listeria within the intestinal microbiota without altering commensal bacteria...|$|R

Unfortunately, drilling {{results show that}} the reservoir is thin, deeply buried (below 5000 m) and mix lithologies. Pre-stack inversion and fluid identification is implemented in this area. The feasibility and validity of pre-stack inversion for this kind of reservoir is tested, since that application of pre-stack inversion in this area is for the first time. A new rock physics model is used for estimating rock velocities and elastic attributes, and cross-plots of Poisson's ratio (σ) again LambdaRho (λρ) is found to be more favorable for lithofacies identification. Then, pre-stack inversion which uses seismic data with careful amplitude processing is performed to predict the reservoir. The inversion results agree and tie with most wells, suggesting that the pre-stack inversion is viable process for this complex lithological reservoir prediction in the area...|$|R

However, these companies do not realize that they need to have a mobile strategy in place, just like their IT strategy. Mobile technology is a new paradigm for businesses. The mobile device is emerging as a powerful sales channel and marketing medium, which these businesses must strategize and plan for. Companies need to be equipped with a framework within which they can develop marketing initiatives through mobile technologies. The world is reaching a point where developing a viable mobile strategy is an imperative for small and large businesses to enable their long term growth and sustenance. Recently, the iPhone and its app store have created a vibe in industry with almost 1 billion mobile apps being downloaded from the iphone app store by July 2009. However, many marketers still doubt iPhone's reach to a larger, and, more importantly, a targeted audience. Also, there is increasing complexity with a variety of architectures, platforms and processes being adopted by each player, for example: iPhone App store, Blackberry App world, Palm's App Catalog, Microsoft's Windows Mobile Marketplace, Nokia's ovi, Google Android Market and more in the pipeline by various players in the market ecosystems, mainly device manufacturers-Samsung, <b>LG,</b> Motorola-as <b>well</b> as service providers - AT&T, T-Mobile and 02, to name a few.

40|$|Visual {{quality is}} one of the major factors that {{determine}} the market value of field pea (Pisum sativum L.). Breeding for improved visual quality of pea seeds is currently a challenging task, because of the complexity and lack of sound genetic knowledge of the traits. The objectives of this research were to characterize the genetic basis and identify the genomic regions associated with four key visual quality traits (cotyledon bleaching in green pea, greenness in yellow pea, and seed shape and seed dimpling in both green and yellow types) in field pea. Biochemical and gene expression profiling to understand the molecular basis of post-harvest cotyledon bleaching in green pea was also addressed. Two F 5 : 6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations (90 lines from Orb X CDC Striker cross, and 120 lines from Alfetta X CDC Bronco cross) were developed and evaluated for visual quality traits in two locations in Saskatchewan, Canada in 2006 and 2007. The four quality traits evaluated all displayed a continuous range of expression with moderate to high heritability. Two genetic linkage maps utilizing 224 markers (29 simple sequence repeat (SSR) (from Agrogene) and 195 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)) and 223 markers (27 SSR and 196 AFLP) were constructed for the Orb X CDC Striker population and the Alfetta X CDC Bronco population, respectively. Multiple quantitative traits (QTL) mapping detected major QTLs on linkage group (LG) IV and <b>LG</b> V, as <b>well</b> as location- and year-specific QTLs on LG II and LG III associated with green cotyledon bleaching resistance. Nine QTLs controlling yellow seed lightness, three for yellow seed greenness, 15 for seed shape and nine for seed dimpling were detected. Among them, 5 QTLs located on LG II, LG IV and LG VII were consistent in at least two environments. The QTLs and their associated markers will be useful tools to assist pea breeding programs attempting to pyramid positive alleles for the traits. The bleaching resistant cultivar CDC Striker had a slower rate of chlorophyll degradation in cotyledons and a higher carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio in seed coats than the bleaching susceptible cultivar Orb when seed samples were exposed to high intensity light. An oligo-nucleotide microarray (Ps 6 kOLI 1) was utilized to investigate the gene expression profiles of CDC Striker and Orb seed coats at different developmental stages. It clearly indicated that the expression of genes involved in the production and accumulation of secondary metabolites was significantly different between these cultivars. The results of both biochemical and gene expression studies suggested the bleaching resistance in CDC Striker was not due to the accumulation of chlorophyll pigments in the cotyledons, but rather due to the ability of seed coats to protect them from photooxidation. Accumulation of specific carotenoids which could bind with the reaction center protein complex more effectively and accumulation of phenolic secondary metabolites which could enhance the antioxidant properties and structural integrity of the seed coats may lead to the bleaching resistant phenotype. Therefore, breeding green pea cultivars with higher seed coat antioxidant properties would improve both visual and nutritional quality. This research has provided several insights into molecular approaches to improve field pea visual quality for food markets...|$|R

There is continuous interaction and communication between the flora and the gut-associated lymphatic tissue determining many aspects of host immunity and metabolism. The digestive tract's immune system {{is often referred to}} as gut-associated lymphoid tissue and works to protect the body from invasion. However, it is well-established that influenza virus much more easier attached to mucous membranes of upper respiratory tract in condition of decreased functions of local immunity, which probably accompanies with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Objectives: This article discusses about pathophysiology reaction of large intestinal cavity microbiota by the means of determination its species composition and populational level with evaluation of dysbiotic abnormalities level in young Caucasian patients infected with influenza A and influenza B in Ukraine. Study design: Cohort variant of observational study enrolled 109 young Caucasian race persons were born since 1986 till 1995 in western Ukraine (Eastern Europe, Chernivtsi region, traditionally called Bukovina) which were infected with influenza A and B during 2011 - 2012 autumn-winter-spring seasons. Fresh samples of stool, vein blood, and nasopharyngeal swabs were investigated by means of serological reactions, PCR, bacteriological and mycological methods. Statistical analysis performed due to “Biostat” PC programme with evaluation of average error and P-value with purpose to appreciate confident valuable changes between two investigated groups. Findings: In 51 (46. 8 %) patients A/H 3 N 2 /Pert/ 16 / 2009 virus was diagnosed, in 44 (40. 4 %) patients – A/H 3 N 2 /Victoria/ 361 / 2011 subtype and in 14 (12. 8 %) young patients causative agent of influenza had determined virus B/Visconsin/ 1 / 2010 by molecular biologic assay – PCR (polymerase chain reaction. Alterations in influenza A and influenza B infected patients the intestinal micoflora pronounced and included increased bacterial density and a higher incidence of opportunistic flora accompanied by decreased normal microflora activity. The level Bifidobacterium declined to 5. 12 ± 0. 08 vs 9. 17 ± 0. 19 lg CFU/g, Lactobacillus – to 6. 14 ± 0. 08 vs 8. 51 ± 0. 24 lg CFU/g respectively. Meanwhile the complete elimination of indigenous Enterococci simultaneously with appearance of haemolytic enterococci strains in high level – 8. 66 ± 0. 06 <b>lg</b> CFU/g as <b>well</b> as peptostreptococci (8. 90 ± 0. 08 lg CFU/g) noticed.

Conclusion: Young Caucasian patients were borne in period of 1986 - 1995 and infected with A/H 3 N 2 /Pert/ 16 / 2009, A/H 3 N 2 /Victoria/ 361 / 2011 and B/Visconsin/ 1 / 2010 in 2011 - 2012 cold seasons had manifested typically moderate and mild clinical form of influenza accompanied with dysbiotic alterations of large intestinal microbiota. Since first days of influenza onset the clinical course in patients presented objective and laboratory data of that, logically explained as the pathophysiologic reaction by means of interaction between virus-induced immune dysfunction and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.

40|$|Introduction. It {{is known}} that {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) generated in vivo by cell aerobic metabolism cause multiple damage in different cell organelles and kill not only obligate anaerobes and microaerophilles, but also aerobes. ROS generated by phagocytes and representatives of normal microflora are {{an important component of}} macroorganism defense from most pathogens, which is explained by their ability to damage different biological structures. ROS have high reactivity and let us use them in vitro as effective biocides. Hydrogen peroxide is widely used in many industries, in particular, in medicine and veterinary as antiseptic and disinfectant agent due to its safety for environment and broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity including sporeforming bacteria. However, in the recent years certain decrease of background sensitivity of microorganisms to hydrogen peroxide and occurrence of resistant strains of pathogenic microorganisms to this agent has been noted. The aim of this work is to carry out a comparative study of antimicrobial activity of hydrogen peroxide, peroxydisuccinic acid (PDSA), monoperoxysuccinic acid (MPSA), and mixture of PDSA and hydrogen peroxide (Н 2 О 2). Materials and methods. The substances of peroxydisuccinic acid (PDSA) and monoperoxysuccinic acid (MPSA) were prepared by well known methods. The following test-strains were used to assess antimicrobial activity of the agents: Staphylococcus aureus АТСС 25923, Escherichia coli АТСС 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa АТСС 27853, Pseudomonas aeruginosa АТСС 9027, Basillus сereus АТСС 10702, Basillus сereus АТСС 96, Basillus subtilis АТСС 6633, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 4636, Candida albicans АТСС 885 / 653, and Candida albicans АТСС 10231. All disinfectant agents were diluted in distilled water at 40 ºС and stirred. The microbial burden was 2 ∙ 109 CFU/ml of the medium, and for kinetic studies 105 CFU/ml of the medium, it was standardizing according to McFarland standard. Microorganisms’ resistance to disinfectant agents was determined by seeding of the diluted cell suspension on agar medium after their incubation with MPSA, PDSA, Н 2 О 2, and also after MPSA generation in the reaction between PDSA and Н 2 О 2, and seeding of the cell suspension with exclusion of these factors was taken as control. 18 - 24 -hour microorganism culture was taken into work. Mueller-Hinton agar and MPA were used for bacteria. Sabouraud agar was used for Candida albicans. Agar well diffusion method was applied. Determination of antimicrobial activity of the agents were carried out on two layers of solid medium in Petri dishes. In kinetic study of microorganism’s death rate due to incubation period with peroxide solution tested, the bactericidal action was stopped with 5 % sodium thiosulfate sterile solution. All studies were carried out in 3 replicates. In statistical analysis methods, significance level P was equal to 0. 95. Student’s test was used for statistical processing of the data obtained. Results and discussion. It has been found that treatment of S. aureus АТСС 25923, E. coli АТСС 25922 test-strains for 60 min with 3 % (and even 6 % Н 2 О 2 for E. coli) does not cause total death of microorganisms. The fact of resistance of sporeforming cultures B. cereus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans to hydrogen peroxide should be noted, in 60 min of their incubation with 6 % Н 2 О 2, the number of viable cells decreased from 5. 0 to 1. 58 <b>lg</b> CFU/ml, as <b>well</b> as to 3. 00 (to 1. 84 for 120 -min exposition) and 1. 65 lg CFU/ml, respectively. However, pretreatment of test-stains by 5 - fold diluted mixture of 3 % Н 2 О 2 and 1 % PDSA for 60 min caused total death of S. aureus and E. сoli, and decreased the number of viable cells of B. cereus sporeforming cells and relatively resistant to hydrogen peroxide cultures of P. aeruginosa и C. albicans from 5. 00 to 1. 34 and 0. 95 lg CFU/ml, respectively, and in 120 min to their total death Conclusions. The study have determined that antimicrobial effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by interaction of hydrogen peroxide and peroxydisuccinic acid (PDSA) mixture in the synergistic system is many times higher and faster achievable than hydrogen peroxide or peroxydisuccinic acid only. We have determined the principles of optimum conditions for ROS generation by choice of respective concentrations of peroxydisuccinic acid and hydrogen peroxide. ROS demonstrate high biocidal activity and short lifetime, which allows us to consider the combination of hydrogen peroxide and peroxydisuccinic acid as a promising means for development of a highly efficient disinfectant with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and without a tendency to accumulate in the environment...|$|R
