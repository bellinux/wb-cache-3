5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of the air traffic control transmissions associated with the flight. The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a <b>legal</b> <b>proceeding</b> concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 air traffic control audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act. Several key minutes of the air traffic control audio {{can be found on the}} Toronto Star web site.|$|E

25|$|In many {{legal systems}} - both common law and civil law - it is normal {{practice}} for the courts to award legal costs against a losing party, with the winner becoming entitled to recover an approximation of what it spent in pursuing its claim (or in defense of a claim). The United States is a notable exception to this rule, as except for certain extreme cases, a prevailing party in a US <b>legal</b> <b>proceeding</b> does not become entitled to recoup its legal fees from the losing party.|$|E

25|$|Negotiation {{can take}} {{a wide variety of}} forms, from a trained {{negotiator}} acting on behalf of a particular organization or position in a formal setting to an informal negotiation between friends. Negotiation can be contrasted with mediation, where a neutral third party listens to each side's arguments and attempts to help craft an agreement between the parties. It can also be compared with arbitration, which resembles a <b>legal</b> <b>proceeding.</b> In arbitration, both sides make an argument as to the merits of their case and the arbitrator decides the outcome. This negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard-bargaining negotiation.|$|E

Jinnah's mother and first wife both died during his absence in England.
