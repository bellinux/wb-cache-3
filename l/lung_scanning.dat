In 312 consecutive patients with at least one segmental perfusion defect on the initial perfusion scan, classification of both the initial and the final <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> allowed us to study alteration in scan classification. Changes in pulmonary perfusion were assessed scintigraphically in a subgroup of 64 patients with proven pulmonary embolism. Among 79 patients with an initial high-probability <b>lung</b> <b>scan,</b> the final scan remained high probability in 77 whereas it became non-diagnostic and normal in one patient each. The <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> classification did not change in any of the 233 patients who initially had a non-diagnostic scan.

The aim of our study was to evaluate V 9 /Q 9 lung scans in a large cohort of PVOD and idiopathic or heritable PAH patients. V 9 /Q 9 lung scans from 70 patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 56 patients with confirmed or highly probable PVOD were reviewed in a double-blind manner.

Arterial hypoxemia and perfusion impairment recovered in parallel, both in the acute phase after embolism (7 days) and later up to 1 year. The great majority of recovery occurred within the first month after embolization. Radiographic signs compatible with PE tended to decrease early and disappeared almost completely after 30 days.

Combined ascending radionuclide venography and <b>lung</b> perfusion <b>scan</b> was performed in all patients. Patients with evidence of pulmonary perfusion defects underwent ventilation <b>lung</b> <b>scan.</b> Results: Radionuclide venography-detectable DVT was noted in 744 patients, of whom 521 (70 %) had suprapopliteal DVT. Of patients with DVT, 294 (39. 5 %) showed a high-probability <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and 135 (18. 1 %) had an intermediate-probability <b>lung</b> <b>scan.</b> Overall, 47 % of patients with a high-probability scan had no clinical manifestations suggestive of PE. Conclusion: PE occurs frequently in Indian patients with symptomatic DVT. Increasing awareness will provide us with clearer ideas about the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in Asian countries...|$|R
