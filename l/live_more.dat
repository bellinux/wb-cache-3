5|$|At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics {{reported}} that 13.9% of Hamersley's residents used public transport {{to get to}} work. This was a sizable jump from 8.5% in the 2006 census, and was higher than the north-western metropolitan average of 13.1%. Public transport usage was highest (16.8%) in the section of Hamersley closest to the train station, and lowest (8.3%) in the Vickers Street section to the southeast, where many residents <b>live</b> <b>more</b> than 10 minutes' walk from the nearest bus stop.|$|E

5|$|Fewer than 3% {{of people}} <b>live</b> <b>more</b> than {{fourteen}} years. Disease features {{significantly associated with}} reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as heart problems, diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival. While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced {{when compared to the}} healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} British {{football}} {{stars of the}} late 20th century, Baxter drank to excess, {{and at one point}} was said to be consuming three bottles of Bacardi a day. Scotland teammate Dave Mackay unsuccessfully advised him to train harder and <b>live</b> <b>more</b> sensibly. Baxter often got falling-down drunk the night before a match, but this did not seem to hamper his play, and team managers took little notice of his drinking. After retiring from football Baxter became a pub licensee, an unsuitable career for a problem drinker. At the age of 55 he needed two liver transplants in four days, and promised to quit drinking.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, where he {{received}} marginal care. He had lost , was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned as white as snow.

In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to <b>live</b> <b>more</b> than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.|$|E

5|$|In the wilderness, males seldom {{live longer}} than 10 to 14 years, as {{injuries}} sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their life span. In captivity they can <b>live</b> <b>more</b> than 20 years. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and {{a small number of}} adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are active primarily at night (nocturnal), although sometimes at twilight (crepuscular).|$|E

Many students choose to ride the bus, as many <b>live</b> <b>more</b> than eight to twenty {{miles away from the}} campus. The average time to reach the school by a school bus is one hour even for students who live relatively close to the school because some buses must make multiple stops; other students choose to carpool or drive themselves to school.|$|E

25|$|Many {{single-celled}} organisms called phytoplankton live in {{oceans and}} lakes. When certain conditions are present, {{such as high}} nutrient or light levels, these organisms reproduce explosively. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an algal bloom. Blooms can cover hundreds of square kilometres and are easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely <b>live</b> <b>more</b> than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.|$|E

He is now in Circa and Yoso with Sherwood.|$|E
25|$|Sidewinders have an {{extraordinarily}} accelerated lifecycle, with natural life expectancies of females {{of about five}} years. Males may live quite a bit longer (maximum known natural lifespan of 13 years). Sidewinders can <b>live</b> <b>more</b> than 20 years when well fed in captivity (even females). Thus, energetics apparently factor heavily into natural female mortality, whereas predation might be the primary pressure on males. In the wild, females often die of exhaustion after giving birth, but the lives of sidewinders are also cut short by predation, diseases, and vehicle encounters.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} from France he had {{invested}} in a scheme, or perhaps scam, for gold-mining in Scotland, which he still remembered bitterly twenty-five years later. During a low point in his finances, in July 1601 Nicholas wrote to the Secretary of State Robert Cecil acknowledging the annuity of £40, but asking permission to retire from London and <b>live</b> <b>more</b> cheaply in the countryside. He explained that he had trained apprentices who now competed {{with him in the}} private painting market. Hilliard asked that Cecil employ his son as a clerk, because he could not keep him in his own trade.|$|E
