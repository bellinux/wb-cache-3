All of these linear representations can be useful for visualising data, but none should be used to determine kinetic parameters, as computer software is readily available that allows for more accurate determination by nonlinear regression methods.|$|E

The upper oceanic crust with the <b>low</b> <b>S</b> wave velocity anomaly may reduce the shear strength of the plate boundary thrust, as fault damaged zones with a considerably <b>low</b> <b>S</b> wave velocity make faults weak.

Study design. We have studied 573 mother/newborn pairs, 169 wife/husband couples with repeated spontaneous abortion and 34 fertile wife/husband couples. Results. In mother/newborn pairs, the analysis of joint mother/infant ACP 1 distribution has shown a deficit of pairs with the mother having low ACP 1 S isoform concentration and the infant having high S isoform concentration, and an excess of pairs with the mother having high S isoform concentration and the infant having <b>low</b> <b>S</b> isoform concentration. In RSA couples there is an excess of couples in which the wife has <b>low</b> <b>S</b> isoform concentration and the husband has high S isoform concentration and a deficit of couples in which the wife has high S isoform concentration and the husband has <b>low</b> <b>S</b> isoform concentration.

40|$|Restricted Access. The {{effects of}} shear rate (S) and {{magnetic}} field applied normal to the cholesteric helical axis are studied {{on the basis}} of the continuum theory for steady state flow. For twisted HBAB and MBBA the variation of the apparent viscosity (η) with S is found to be opposite, leading one to speculate the possible postponement of the roll instability threshold in HBAB by the addition of chiralic impurities. At <b>low</b> <b>S</b> a sufficiently strong, magnetic field can pro- foundly influence η, though at high S the shear dominates. At <b>low</b> <b>S</b> for general asymmetric solutions the oscillations of η with pitch are analytically shown to be strongly influenced by the value of the twist angle at the centre when the pitch is of the order of the sample thickness. This consideration could be important in flow experiments on long pitch cholesterics...|$|E
40|$|Teleseismic {{body waves}} from {{broadband}} seismic stations {{are used to}} investigate the crustal and uppermost mantle structure of Stromboli volcano through inversion of the receiver functions (RFs). First, we computed RFs in the frequency domain using a multiple-taper spectral correlation technique. Then, the nonlinear neighbourhood algorithm was applied to estimate the seismic shear wave velocity of the crust and uppermost mantle and to define the main seismic velocity discontinuities. The stability of the inversion solution was tested using a range of initial random seeds and model parameterizations. A shallow Moho, present at depth of 14. 8 km, is evidence of a thinned crust beneath Stromboli volcano.

40|$|To {{study the}} deep {{structure}} of Iceland, we conducted S receiver function analysis for almost 60 local broad-band seismograph {{stations of the}} Hotspot, ICEMELT and SIL networks. The structure was investigated separately for the central region of Iceland containing the neovolcanic zone and two peripheral regions {{to the east and}} west. S-to-P converted phases from upper-mantle discontinuities were detected by stacking recordings of several tens of teleseismic events. The analysis reveals previously unknown details. Magnitude and depth extent of the <b>low</b> <b>S</b> velocity anomaly in the upper mantle beneath Iceland are much larger than reported in earlier studies. Clear S-to-P converted phases are obtained from the discontinuity at a depth of 80 ± 5 km, separating the high-velocity mantle lid from the underlying <b>low</b> <b>S</b> velocity layer. This discontinuity can be interpreted as a chemical boundary between dry harzburgite in the upper layer and wet peridotite underneath. Beneath peripheral parts of Iceland, we detect a boundary at a depth of 135 ± 5 km with S velocity increasing downwards. This boundary may correspond to the onset of melting in wet peridotite at a potential temperature of around 1400 °C. Models of melting induced by CO 2 are not incompatible with our observations. The seismic data demonstrate effects that may be caused by azimuthal anisotropy in the upper mantle.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A field study was conducted on 'Texas Grano 1015 Y' onions (Allium cepa L.) grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Treatments included two soil types (clay and loam), five maturities from beginning of bulbing throughout the bulbing process, and two S rates (O kg S/ha and 22. 4 kg S/ha). Laboratory analysis included pyruvic acid concentration for pungency measurement, percent dry matter, and sucrose, glucose, and fructose concentrations. Maturity influenced all variables tested. Percent dry matter (DM) generally decreased as bulbs m, 7 taFed (9. 1 to 697 o DM) with a slight increase at maturity (7 4110 DM). Enzymatically developed pyruvic acid concentrations ranged from 3. 13 to 4. 03 limol-g-I fresh wt. However, the first harvest had a pyruvic acid content of 5. 54 AMOI-G-I fresh wt. There was an increasing trend of pyruvic acid over the bulbing process. Total sugars tended to increase beginning with the second maturity (39. 3 to 46. 5 mg-g-I fresh wt.). However, sucrose decreased during the last two sampling dates resulting in a corresponding increase in glucose and fructose. The S fertility treatment had no effect on any of the factors measured. The only influence by soil type was sugar concentration, with the loam field producing onions higher in glucose. A greenhouse study was also conducted to test the effects of S fertility on onion pungency. Cloned plants were used to avoid genetic variation between treatments. The <b>low</b> <b>S</b> treatment (2 ppm) produced onions with a pyruvic acid concentration of 1. 9 gmol. g- 1 fresh wt. and the high S treatment (123 ppm) onions contained 5. 5 timol-g-I fresh wt. of pyruvic acid. However, bulb weight was greatly reduced by the <b>low</b> <b>S</b> treatment. Sugars were also slightly higher in onion bulbs from the <b>low</b> <b>S</b> treatment.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the S, Se, Cu and La contents through a complete stratigraphic {{section of the}} Bushveld Complex. The principle aim was to determine which phases controlled these elements. S, Se and Cu show positive correlations, but these elements do not correlate with La. In most cases, the concentration of S, Se and Cu in rocks containing greater than 800 ppm S can be modeled by segregation of a Fe–Ni–Cu sulfide liquid from a fractionating magma. As the magma evolved, Se and Cu were depleted by the continual segregation of sulfide liquid and the S/Se and S/Cu of the rocks increased. The Se/Cu ratio is higher in the more evolved rocks, which suggests that Se has a slightly lower partition coefficient than Cu into sulfide liquid (1, 200 versus 1, 700). The Lower and lower Critical Zone of the complex contains on average only 99 ppm S. The <b>low</b> <b>S</b> content of these rocks has led some authors to suggest that these rocks do not contain cumulate sulfides, {{despite the fact that}} they are moderately enriched in PGE. These samples fall along the same trend as the S-rich samples on the S-versus-Se plot and the S/La and Se/La ratios are greater than the initial magmas suggesting that despite the <b>low</b> <b>S</b> contents cumulate sulfides are present. Three models may be suggested in order to explain the <b>low</b> <b>S</b> content in the Lower and Critical Zone rocks: (a) the sulfides that were present have migrated away from the cumulate pile into the footwall or center of the intrusion; (b) the magma was saturated in sulfides at depth and during transport some sulfides lagged in embayments; (c) the rocks have lost both S and Se at high temperature. The first two models have important implications for exploration...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Prognostic evaluation of Auer IV DNA histograms {{with respect to}} the high versus <b>low</b> <b>S</b> + G 2 /M fraction, obtained by image cytometry on consecutive breast cancer imprint preparations. RESULTS: When studying recurrence-free survival (n = 136), the prognostic value of S + G 2 /M was found to vary with time: it was negligible before the median time to relapse (1. 5 years) but thereafter statistically significant, in both univariate and multivariate analysis. The same pattern was found when overall survival was used as the end point; the effect was delayed to about the median time until death (three years). Tumors with a <b>low</b> <b>S</b> + G 2 /M fraction were smaller and more often estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-positive than those with a high S + G 2 /M fraction.
