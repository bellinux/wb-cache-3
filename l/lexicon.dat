The general purpose subjectivity <b>lexicons</b> are useful for the reviews which are not associated with the specific domain. The studies conducted in the recent past have focused on the generation of general purpose <b>lexicons</b> by utilizing the existing web resources, such as online documents, dataset of user feedbacks and different <b>lexicons.</b> In such <b>lexicons</b> range of semantic scores associated with each word is between − 1 and + 1.|$|R

40|$|A word's {{sentiment}} {{depends on}} the domain {{in which it is}} used. Computational social science research thus requires sentiment <b>lexicons</b> that are specific to the domains being studied. We combine domain-specific word embeddings with a label propagation framework to induce accurate domain-specific sentiment <b>lexicons</b> using small sets of seed words, achieving state-of-the-art performance competitive with approaches that rely on hand-curated resources. Using our framework we perform two large-scale empirical studies to quantify the extent to which sentiment varies across time and between communities. We induce and release historical sentiment <b>lexicons</b> for 150 years of English and community-specific sentiment <b>lexicons</b> for 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit. The historical <b>lexicons</b> show that more than 5 % of sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity during the last 150 years, and the community-specific <b>lexicons</b> highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different communities.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a procedure {{to convert the}} PAROLE-SIMPLE monolingual <b>lexicons</b> into bilingual interrelated <b>lexicons</b> where each word sense of a given language {{is linked to the}} pertinent sense of the right words in one or more target <b>lexicons.</b> Nowadays, SIMPLE <b>lexicons</b> are monolingual although the ultimate goal of these harmonised monolingual <b>lexicons</b> is to build multilingual lexical resources. For achieving this goal it is necessary to automatise the linking among the different senses of the different monolingual <b>lexicons,</b> as the production of such multilingual relations by hand will be, as all tasks related with the development of linguistic resources, unaffordable in terms of human resources and time spent. The system we describe in this paper takes advantage of the SIMPLE model and the SIMPLE based <b>lexicons</b> so that, in the best case, it can find fully automatically the relevant sense-to-sense correspondences for determining the translational equivalence of two words in two different languages and, in the worst case, {{it will be able to}} narrow the set of admissible links between words and relevant senses. This paper also explores to what extent semantic encoding in already existing computational <b>lexicons</b> such as SIMPLE can help in overcoming the problems arisen when using monolingual meaning descriptions for bilingual links and aims to set the basis for defining a model for adding a bilingual layer to the SIMPLE model. This bilingual layer based on a bilingual relation model will be the basis indeed for defining the multilingual language resource we want PAROLE-SIMPLE <b>lexicons</b> to become...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} sentiment analysis in an informal setting in multiple domains and in two languages. We {{explore the influence of}} using background knowledge in the form of different sentiment <b>lexicons,</b> as well as the influence of various lexical surface features. We evaluate several different feature set combination strategies. We show that the improvement resulting from using a two-layer meta-model over the bag-of-words, sentiment <b>lexicons</b> and surface features is most notable on social media datasets in both English and Spanish. For English, we are also able to demonstrate improvement on the news domain using sentiment <b>lexicons</b> as well as a large improvement on the social media domain.

5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui <b>lexicon,</b> double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui <b>lexicon</b> reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Samin {{people are}} a group of Javanese speakers. However, the Javanese they use is a little {{different}} from the common Javanese in some ways. For example, they use some distinctive <b>lexicons</b> such as rukunan ‘husband/wife’, pondhokan ‘house’, turun ‘child’, and so on. This article discusses the distinctive <b>lexicons</b> in the Samin community to explain why they use such unique <b>lexicons.</b> The discussion employs the framework of anthropological linguistics studying linguistic facts in a broad sociocultural context. The findings reveal that the use of distinctive <b>lexicons</b> by the Samin community is not coincidental, but related to their perspectives on viewing things labeled by the lexicons; how they do so is influenced by the Saminism ideology. In addition, it is also revealed that in some instances, for the Samin community, the <b>lexicons</b> are not just labels that mark something, but also tools to interpret something...|$|R
40|$|Generic {{sentiment}} <b>lexicons</b> {{have been}} widely used for sentiment analysis these days. However, manually constructing sentiment <b>lexicons</b> is very time-consuming and it may not be feasible for certain application domains where annotation expertise is not available.

5|$|Edward Ullendorff {{considered}} the German orientalist Hiob Ludolf (1624–1704) {{to be the}} founder of Ethiopian studies in Europe, thanks to his efforts in documenting the history of Ethiopia and the Ge'ez language, as well as Amharic. The Ethiopian monk Abba Gorgoryos (1595–1658), while lobbying the Propaganda Fide in Rome to become bishop of Ethiopia following his Catholic conversion and expulsion of the Jesuits by Ethiopian emperor Fasilides, collaborated with Ludolf – who never actually visited Ethiopia – and provided him with critical information for composing his Historia Aethiopica and its Commentaries. The ethnically-Ethiopian Portuguese cleric António d'Andrade (1610–1670) aided them as a translator, since Abba Gorgoryos was not a fluent speaker of either Latin or Italian. After Ludolf, the 18th-century Scottish travel writer James Bruce, who visited Ethiopia, and German orientalist August Dillmann (1823–1894) are also considered pioneers {{in the field of}} early Ethiopian studies. After spending time at the Ethiopian royal court, Bruce was the first to systematically collect and deposit Ethiopian historical documents into libraries of Europe, in addition to composing a history of Ethiopia based on native Ethiopian sources. Dillmann cataloged a variety of Ethiopian manuscripts, including historical chronicles, and in 1865 published the <b>Lexicon</b> Linguae Aethiopicae, the first such <b>lexicon</b> to be published on languages of Ethiopia since Ludolf's work.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} learning factored probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing from data containing sentences paired with logical-form meaning representations. Traditional CCG <b>lexicons</b> list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content.

In this paper, we introduce factored <b>lexicons,</b> which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG <b>lexicons,</b> along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance benefits greatly from the lexical factoring. ...|$|R
