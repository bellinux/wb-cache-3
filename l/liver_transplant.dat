40|$|In {{experimental}} animals {{inhibition of}} T cell co-stimulation immediately after organ transplantation effectively prevents rejection. We investigated whether {{the expression of}} co-stimulatory molecules is enhanced in cadaveric <b>liver</b> <b>transplants,</b> whether their expression {{is influenced by the}} transplantation procedure, and whether variation in expression between <b>liver</b> <b>transplants</b> is related to the occurrence of acute rejection. Expression of CD 80, CD 86 and the macrophage marker CD 68 were determined by immunohistochemistry in biopsies from 40 clinical <b>liver</b> <b>transplants</b> obtained at different time-points during the transplantation procedure, and in normal liver tissue obtained from 10 human livers. Expression of CD 80 and CD 86 on Kupffer cells was graded by comparison with CD 68 -staining. In a subgroup CD 80 and CD 86 mRNA was quantified by real-time detection polymerase chain reaction. CD 86 was expressed in all <b>liver</b> <b>transplants</b> and normal <b>livers</b> on the majority of Kupffer cells. CD 80 was absent or sporadically expressed in normal liver tissue, but in 18 of 40 <b>liver</b> <b>transplants</b> at least one-quarter of Kupffer cells expressed CD 80. CD 80 - and CD 86 -mRNA and protein expression in <b>liver</b> <b>transplants</b> did not change during the warm ischaemic and reperfusion phases of the transplantation procedure. CD 80 -expression on Kupffer cells varied strongly between individual donor livers; this variation was, however, not significantly related to the occurrence of acute rejection after transplantation. In conclusion, in nearly half of cold-preserved cadaveric <b>liver</b> <b>transplants</b> an increased proportion of Kupffer cells express CD 80 at the time of transplantation in comparison with normal liver tissue. The expression was not further induced by warm ischaemia and reperfusion. However, the observed variation in CD 80 -expression between <b>liver</b> <b>transplants</b> is not a accurate predictive measure for acute rejection...|$|R

5|$|More than 40% {{of people}} with {{cirrhosis}} develop hepatic encephalopathy. More {{than half of those}} with cirrhosis and significant HE live less than a year.

5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a <b>liver</b> <b>transplant.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1â€“2), it indicates that a <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a <b>liver</b> <b>transplant.</b> Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E

5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> {{is often}} the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue.
