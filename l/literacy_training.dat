The peasant society of Russia in 1917 was largely illiterate making it difficult to reach them through printed agitprop. [...] Lenin created the People’s Commissariat of Enlightenment to spearhead the war on illiteracy. Instructors were trained in 1919, and sent to the countryside to create more instructors and expand the operation into a network of illiteracy centers. New textbooks were created, containing Bolshevik ideology to indoctrinate the newly literate members of Soviet society, and the <b>literacy</b> <b>training</b> in the army was expanded.|$|E

40|$|Information <b>literacy</b> skills <b>training</b> has, {{especially}} {{over the}} last decade, become a core function of academic libraries and librarians throughout the world. The growing number of expensive electronic information sources that libraries subscribe to makes it essential for them to justify this expense by ensuring that their users are effectively trained in {{how to use the}} databases. The University of South Africa, as a large distance education institution, has a significant amount of remotely situated students, which makes proper information <b>literacy</b> skills <b>training</b> even more important, since this then empowers them to use the library’s resources wherever they are. The University of South Africa (Unisa) Library has its main campus in Muckleneuk, Pretoria. Over the past decade or more, information <b>literacy</b> skills <b>training</b> has been a core function of this library, and has proved to be very successful. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give an overview of the different types of training conducted by the Unisa Library, both for staff and students, looking specifically at how (training methods, format of material etc), for whom (target groups) and by whom (trainers/presenters) the various types of training are conducted, and the frequency of the different types of training. Training of this kind, particularly since it usually involves large groups of staff and/or students, obviously presents Unisa’s librarians with many challenges as well as opportunities.
