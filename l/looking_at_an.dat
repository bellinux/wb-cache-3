5|$|Shared gaze {{occurs when}} two {{individuals}} are simply <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> object. Shared gaze {{is the lowest}} level of joint attention.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E
5|$|Whilst at a {{boot camp}} trip with Steph and Fernando, Steph {{believes}} Gilly has feelings for Sarah, and is unaware his feelings are for her. During the trip, after Steph, Fernando and Gilly leave, Sarah is {{killed in a}} tragic parachute jump. Gilly writes a poem for Steph, and in it, offends Fernando. When Steph reads it she is angry at Gilly, who tells her it is Rhys who has the feelings for her. Fernando punches Rhys as Gilly convinces Steph {{he had nothing to}} do with the poem. In order to make Steph jealous, Gilly kisses Cheryl who is trying to make Calvin jealous. Despite using him, Cheryl develops true feelings for Gilly. Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson) works out that Gilly is in love with Steph. However, Gilly denies it, saying that he loves Cheryl. Cheryl catches Gilly <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> engagement ring, which Fernando has bought for Steph. She assumes the ring is for her and tells everyone in The Dog in the Pond that she and Gilly are getting married. Gilly reluctantly goes along, not wanting to hurt her feelings. Cheryl notices the growing closeness between Gilly and Steph and confronts him. On discovering he is in love with Steph, she breaks off their engagement, at the same time Steph and Fernando break up. Gilly goes travelling with Zoe and Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst). Steph, after being told about Gilly's feelings for her, rushes after him to admit her love just as Gilly leaves. Gilly returns on 5 March with his girlfriend Jem. Steph is upset when he proposes to Jem. Steph admits her feelings to Gilly, but he decides to stay with Jem. Rhys tells Jem that Gilly still loves Steph causing them to split up. Gilly and Steph finally confess their true feelings to each other and begin a relationship.|$|E

Note that the chromaticity diagram is a tool to specify how the human eye will experience light with a given spectrum.

25|$|By {{the same}} reasoning, this {{statement}} is evidence that (2) if something is not black then {{it is not a}} raven. But since (as above) {{this statement is}} logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> apple.|$|E

This means that the goods have already been sold off, usually to a trader or dealer on a private, behind-the-scenes basis before they {{have had a chance to}} be offered at the auction sale. These goods are rarely in single lots – photocopiers or fax machines would generally be sold in bulk lots.|$|E

25|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> {{image of}} oneself with the front-back axis flipped {{results in the}} {{perception}} of an image with its left-right axis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, your right hand remains directly opposite your real right hand, but it is perceived as the left hand of your image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image is actually front-back reversed, which is an effect similar to the hollow-mask illusion. Notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object.|$|E
25|$|While {{waiting for}} their turn in the {{electric}} chair, Makley and Pierpont carved a pair of revolvers from large bars of soap, and blackened them with shoe polish. On September 22, 1934, the two used these props to attempt an escape. They assaulted a guard and freed Clark from his cell nearby. Before they had gone far, Clark, who was not <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> imminent death sentence, lost his nerve and retreated to his cell. Moments later, armed guards arrived and shot Makley and Pierpont. Makley, hit in the thorax and abdomen, died on the scene. Pierpont was seriously wounded, but survived and was later executed. Makley's death certificate states that internal hemorrhaging from these wounds caused his death. He is buried in the Sugar Ridge Cemetery in Leipsic, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further {{broken down into}} simple and complex: simple impressions and ideas, and complex impressions and ideas. Hume states that “simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation,” while “the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts.” When <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> apple, a person experiences a variety of color-sensations, which Hume sees as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation again being a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions {{can be broken down}} into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thereby referred to as being simple.|$|E

25|$|General Electric (GE) stated {{it would}} not offer the GP7000 engine on the aircraft, and that {{previous}} contracts for the GEnx on the original A350 {{did not apply to}} the XWB. Engine Alliance partner Pratt & Whitney seemed to be at odds with GE on this, having publicly stating that it was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> advanced derivative of the GP7000. In April 2007, Airbus former chief executive Louis Gallois held direct talks with GE management over developing a GEnx variant for the A350 XWB. In June 2007, Airbus's chief operating officer John Leahy indicated that the A350 XWB would not feature the GEnx engine, saying that Airbus wanted GE to offer a more efficient version for the airliner. Since then, the largest GE engines operators, which include Emirates, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and ILFC have selected the Trent XWB for their A350 orders. In May 2009, GE said that if it were to reach a deal with Airbus to offer the current 787-optimised GEnx for the A350, it would only power the -800 and -900 variants. GE believed it can offer a product that outperforms the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB, but was reluctant to support an aircraft competing directly with its GE90-115B-powered 777 variants.|$|E
500|$|The {{attention}} of the FDA triggered belligerent responses from Reich, who called them [...] "HiGS" [...] (hoodlums in government) and the tools of red fascists. He developed a delusion that he had powerful friends in government, including President Eisenhower, who he believed would protect him, and that the U.S. Air Force was flying over Orgonon {{to make sure that}} he was all right. On 29 July 1952 three inspectors arrived at Orgonon unannounced. Sharaf writes that Reich detested unannounced visitors; he had once chased some people away with a gun just for <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> adjacent property. He told the inspectors they had to read his work before he would interact with them, and ordered them to leave.|$|E
500|$|According to Saunders, {{increased}} {{energy efficiency}} tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, {{increased energy efficiency}} makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the microeconomic level (<b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption. That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the macroeconomic level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and [...] macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use.|$|E

500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E
