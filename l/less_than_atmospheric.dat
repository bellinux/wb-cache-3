25|$|At {{pressures}} <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>atmospheric</b> pressure, {{the composition}} of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures, and at pressures less than 70torr (9.333kPa), there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture. While vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical, pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research. In this technique, a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6% azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.|$|E
25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} {{suggests}} a plausible explanation of whistle operation. Within the cavity is an off-center vortex.

25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>atmospheric</b> pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} process used {{in these}} operations is vacuum distillation—essentially boiling it to leave impurities behind. In desalination, atmospheric pressure is reduced, thus lowering the required temperature needed. Liquids boil when the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature. Effectively, liquids boil at a lower temperature, when the ambient <b>atmospheric</b> pressure is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> usual <b>atmospheric</b> pressure.

50|$|Vacuum {{distillation}} is {{a method}} of distillation whereby the pressure above the liquid mixture to be distilled is reduced to less than its vapor pressure (usually <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>atmospheric</b> pressure) causing evaporation of the most volatile liquid(s) (those with the lowest boiling points).

40|$|Wave fronts {{distorted}} by atmospheric turbulence {{are well known}} to demonstrate both spatial and temporal coherence. The duration of the latter depends on the magnitude and distribution of wind velocities in the atmosphere and typically has a value at visible wavelengths close to 10 m for a good observing site.

Consequently, imagery acquired at cadences close to, or <b>less</b> <b>than,</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> coherence time will clearly show temporal correlation in their wave front distortions.

5000|$|Vacuum is space void of matter. The word {{stems from}} the Latin {{adjective}} vacuus for [...] "vacant" [...] or [...] "void".

In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure.

If a good source of cooling water is not available, cooling towers may be used to reject waste heat to the atmosphere. A large river or lake can also be used as a heat sink for cooling the condensers; temperature rises in naturally occurring waters may have undesirable ecological effects, but may also incidentally improve yields of fish in some circumstances.|$|E

The analysis revealed a limit {{combination of}} the initial parameters at which the pressure along the whole length of one side of the wedge becomes <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> pressure.
