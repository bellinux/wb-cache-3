5000|$|In 2011, Ford {{introduced}} a new <b>LPG</b> <b>system</b> to the Falcon, marketed as [...] "EcoLPI" [...] the system features liquid injection {{as opposed to the}} vapour set up used in the previous E-Gas system. The new injection set up is accompanied by new light weight pistons and rings, a higher compression ratio of 12.0:1 and other modifications that improve power and economy. The power has risen 27% from [...] to [...] at 5000 rpm and torque has risen 10% from 374 Nm to 409 Nm at 3250 rpm. These figures virtually match the petrol version for power and torque when running on 95 octane fuel. In addition to the power gains, fuel use has dropped by around 15% while moreover the peak power of 198 kW is reached at just 5000rpm, versus 6000rpm for the faster revving, therefore a faster, when on RON95-98, petrol variant. The petrol variant, however, starts to produce just over 200kW at 5000rpm when ran on RON98, peaking at 212kW at 6000rpm.

40|$|LPG作為車用替代燃料，除了能使能源的使用更加多元化之外，因其具有較汽油引擎更低的排氣污染特性，在環保意識高漲的今日，愈加受到重視。本文主要可分為三大部分：第一部份主要討論汽車引擎改用LPG燃料系統對性能及排放廢氣之影響，根據實驗顯示，混合器口徑對引擎性能影響很大。而在適當的混合器匹配下，引擎使用LPG燃料系統的馬力輸出約比汽油引擎小了 6 ~ 7 ﹪左右，廢氣污染的多寡主要取決於空燃比，LPG燃後廢氣之THC及OFP較汽油低。此外LPG引擎較一般汽油引擎更提前的點火角是必要的，但太過提前會使引擎啟動困難、性能下降。 第二部分主要對LPG廢氣中HC的成分作分析，由採樣分析結果得知，LPG廢氣之HC一部份由未燃氣所組成，與汽油燃後廢氣作碳數分布比較，得知汽油燃燒後成分碳數分布較廣，而LPG主要集中於低碳部分。在臭氧生成物方面，乙烯及丙烯為LPG燃後成分中主要提供者。 第三部份為LPG動態模式之發展，由結果得知空燃比的延遲主要由混合器後進氣道以及進氣歧管的延遲所構成。To use Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) as an {{alternative}} fuel is a excellent method to wildly utilize the world energy source. As the LPG vehicles have lower emissions than the gasoline vehicles,people who care about environment are concerned on this characteristic. This paper presents three major parts: The first is the discussions {{of the effects of}} LPG engine performance and emission. According to the results of our experiments,the throttle size of mixer strongly influences the engine performance. Based on the prosperity mixer,the LPG engine presents 6 ~ 7 ﹪power less than the gasoline engine power,Air-to-Fuel ratio strongly effects the emission,the total hydrocarbon and total OFP of the LPG emission is less than that of gasoline. Otherwise,it is necessary to have an early spark angle on LPG engine,but the more early angle will cause the difficulty of engine start. The second part is concerned on the HC components of the LPG emission,according to our analysis of emission samples,unburned LPG {{is an important part of}} the LPG HC emission. Using carbon numbers to compare with gosoline emission,we find that gosoline HC components distribute widely,but LPG emission components focus on low carbon number components. Ethylene and Propene present the major parts of the emission Ozone forming potential. The third part is establishing the model of LPG engine fuel system,and compare with the real engine state. We find that fuel system has almost no effect on <b>LPG</b> <b>system</b> characteristics,A/F total delay is caused by the mixture manifold delay and the intake manifold delay. 第一章 緒論 1. 1. 前言………………………………………………………… 1 - 1 1. 2. 文獻回顧…………………………………………………… 1 - 3 1. 3. 研究目的…………………………………………………… 1 - 5 第二章 LPG系統與實驗設備 2. 1.

LPG {{was introduced to the}} intake air stream (as a secondary fuel) by using a low pressure fuel injector situated upstream of the turbocharger. LPG substitutions were test mode dependent, but varied in the range of 14 - 29 % by energy. The engine was tested over a 5 point test cycle using ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD), and a low and high LPG substitution at each test mode. The results show that LPG fumigation coerces the combustion into pre-mixed mode, as increases in the peak combustion pressure (and the rate of pressure rise) were observed in most tests. The emissions results show decreases in nitric oxide (NO) and particulate matter (PM 2. 5) emissions; however, very significant increases in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were observed. A more detailed investigation of the particulate emissions showed that the number of particles emitted was reduced with LPG fumigation at all test settings - apart from mode 6 of the ECE R 49 test cycle. Furthermore, the particles emitted generally had a slightly larger median diameter with LPG fumigation, and had a smaller semi-volatile fraction relative to ULSD.

Unfortunately, the investigation of LPG in internal combustion engine among researcher still have a gap in research. Thus, in this study a 1 -Dimensional simulation CAMPRO 1. 6 L engine model using GT-Power is developed to predict the performances of engines that using LPG as a fuel for internal combustion engine.

40|$|International audienceAIM: The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyse the effects of {{training}} performed on a rotating, motorised platform (the Huber/SpineForce device from <b>LPG</b> <b>Systems,</b> Valence, France) intended to improve, postural control and muscle function. SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy adults (divided into a sedentary group and an active group) took part in a two-month training programme (involving three sessions a week) on the SpineForce whole body rehabilitation device. METHOD: Instrumental assessment of postural control (on a Satel platform) and muscle function (on a Cybex Norm) was performed before and after training. Postural control in various conditions was measured using a position parameter (the mean anteroposterior position of the centre of foot pressure [CoP]) and two stability parameters (maximum CoP displacement and CoP sway area). Assessment of the muscle function was performed during knee and spine extension and featured maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), root mean square (RMS) and neuromuscular efficiency (MVIC/RMS) measurements. RESULTS: For static postural control, we observed a more forward CoP position in the maximum backward inclination condition (p< 0. 01) and a decrease in maximum CoP displacement in the "eyes closed on foam" and "maximum anterior inclination" conditions. In this latter condition, a lower CoP sway area was also noted (p< 0. 01). In terms of muscle function, a greater MVIC for knee extension was observed in the sedentary group only (p< 0. 05). These changes were not correlated with each another (p< 0. 05). However, the value of the pretraining maximum CoP displacement predicted its final value (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that static postural control responds to training on a Huber((R)) /SpineForce rehabilitation device. It seems probable that a population with a low initial level of physical activity would benefit most from training on this type of device. This training could notably be applied to elderly or disabled people and especially those with sensorimotor disabilities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{report a}} {{distributed}} multifunction fiber sensing network based on weak-fiber Bragg gratings (WFBGs) and long period fiber grating (<b>LPG)</b> assisted OTDR <b>system.</b> The WFBGs are applied for temperature, strain and vibration monitoring at key-positions, and the LPG {{is used as}} a linear filter in the system to convert the wavelength shift of WFBGs caused by environmental change into the power change. The simulation results show {{that it is possible to}} integrate more than 4472 WFBGs in the system when the reflectivity of WFBGs is less tha...|$|R
500|$|... 2010 saw {{the arrival}} of the E3 HSV range which brought with it a raft of {{interior}} changes shared with the VE Series II upgrade of HSV's donor vehicle, the Holden Commodore, such as the new Holden iQ audio/infotainment system and safety features such as Side Blind zone alert. It also brought HSV's Enhanced Driver Interface (EDI) system to the Senator, a system that constantly streams real-time vehicle dynamics and performance information to the touch screen in the centre console. The exterior remained mostly unchanged from the E2 model apart from the move to a 20" [...] forged alloy that was available in Dark Stainless or Gloss Black. The LS3 was upgraded to [...] with the fitment of the E2 GTS' bi-modal exhaust system. The E3 was also available with the upgraded 6-piston brakes from the GTS and had the option of a modern <b>LPG</b> fuel <b>system</b> called LPI (Liquid Propane Injection) to help reduce the running costs.|$|R
40|$|LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) has {{for long}} {{been used in}} {{passenger}} cars. Presently, <b>LPG</b> sup-ply <b>systems</b> have also attracted considerable at-tention for heavy duty use. LPG can be applied in these engines combining port fuel injected LPG with a direct injection of diesel. These engines equipped with a port fuel injection (PFI) system suffer from the problems of poor brake thermal efficiency and high HC emissions. In this investigation a butane-diesel pre-mixed blend is injected directly (DI) into the cylinder. For direct injected butane, hydrocarbon emis-sions {{were found to be}} an order of magnitude lower than for port fuel injected butane. Furthermore, the experiments have shown that nitric oxides are not negatively affected compared to the diesel baseline. At a butane mass fraction of one-third and a 6 bar IMEP load point, smoke emissions decreased by 50 %. Because a high combustion efficiency is retained, fuel cost savings can be significant, at more than 6 percent...|$|R
