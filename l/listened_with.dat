5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E

Impressed by Marie, he <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> {{uncertainty}} to the family's accusations but took possession of the soup, the sugar water and the eggnog that Anna Brun had put aside. Then the gardener revealed that Marie had given him arsenic with which to make rat-poison paste in December as well as January. Strangely, the paste could be found all over the house, untouched by the rats.|$|E

"On us who {{saw these}} {{phenomenon}} {{for the first}} time the impression will not easily be forgotten...We felt necessarily carried back to a time when the schistus on which we stood was yet at the bottom of the sea, and when the sandstone before us was only beginning to be deposited, in the shape of sand or mud, from the waters of the supercontinent ocean... The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far back into the abyss of time; and whilst we <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> earnestness and admiration to the philosopher who was now unfolding to us the order and series of these wonderful events, we became sensible how much further reason may sometimes go than imagination may venture to follow."

40|$|Based on {{cognitive}} load theory {{this study investigated}} the effect of simultaneous written presentations on comprehension of spoken English as a foreign language. Learners` language comprehension was compared while they used 3 instructional formats: <b>listening</b> <b>with</b> auditory materials only, <b>listening</b> <b>with</b> a full, written script, and <b>listening</b> <b>with</b> simultaneous subtitled text. <b>Listening</b> <b>with</b> {{the presence of a}} script and subtitles led to better understanding of the scripted and subtitled passage but poorer performance on a subsequent auditory passage than <b>listening</b> <b>with</b> the auditory materials only. These findings indicated that where the intention was learning to listen, the use of a full script or subtitles had detrimental effects on the construction and automation of listening comprehension schemas...|$|R

500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 17, 1918, {{following}} the closing {{argument for the}} prosecution (the defendants waived argument), Landis instructed the jury. The lead defense counsel objected to {{the wording of the}} jury charge several times, but Haywood believed it to have been fair. After 65minutes, the jury returned with guilty verdicts for all of the remaining accused, much to their shock; they had believed that Landis's charge pointed towards their acquittal. When the defendants returned to court on August 29, Landis <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> patience to the defendants' final pleas. For the sentencing, according to Richard Cahan in his history of Chicago's district court, [...] "mild-mannered Landis returned a changed man". Although two defendants received only ten days in jail, all others received at least a year and a day, and Haywood and fourteen others received twenty years. A number of defendants, including Haywood, obtained bail during the appeal; even before Haywood's appeals were exhausted, he jumped bail and took ship for the Soviet Union. The labor leader hung a portrait of Landis in his Moscow apartment, and when Haywood died in 1928, he was interred near John Reed (who had died of illness in Moscow after the Bolshevik Revolution) in the Kremlin Wall—they remain the only Americans so honored. President Calvin Coolidge commuted the sentences of the remaining incarcerated defendants in 1923, much to the disgust of Landis, who issued an angry statement. [...] After leaving his judgeship, Landis referred to the defendants in the Haywood case as [...] "scum", [...] "filth", and [...] "slimy rats".|$|E
500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really difficult for me to figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we get this thing to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E

[...] During the drop there was an audible crack indicating that his neck was broken.

2500|$|Other composers {{offered more}} melodic {{variants}} of Futurist music, notably Franco Casavola, who was active {{with the movement}} {{at the invitation of}} Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and Arthur-Vincent Lourié, the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five Synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony, while Formes en l'air was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, Leo Ornstein gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the Daily Sketch newspaper [...] "one <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joffre sent {{a copy of}} {{his plan}} to GHQ and asked Millerand to lobby the British Government. [...] Hearing at last that Sir John was willing to co-operate, Joffre arrived for a meeting with French at (2pm on 5 September). [...] According to Spears' account, he {{explained}} his plan (in French), ending by clasping his hands together tightly enough to hurt them and begging [...] "Monsieur le Maréchal, c'est la France qui vous supplie" [...] ("Field Marshal, France is begging you"). [...] Sir John <b>listened</b> <b>with</b> tears rolling down his reddening cheeks and, unable to find the words in French, replied [...] "Damn it, I can't explain. [...] Tell him that all that men can do our fellows will do". [...] When Murray protested that the BEF could not be ready as soon as Joffre hoped, Joffre replied that Sir John's word was good enough for him. Joffre and Gamelin recorded Joffre's words slightly differently in their memoirs, as: [...] "il y a que l'honneur de l'Angleterre" [...] ("the honour of England (sic) is at stake"), but Spears' account more closely matches the contemporary diaries of Wilson and Clive, and so is in Prete's view more likely to be correct. Although Joffre had dealt tactfully with Sir John (he later claimed in his memoirs that his visit to Melun had simply been to congratulate Sir John on his willingness to co-operate), {{at a time when he}} sacked three of his own army commanders (including Lanrezac), ten corps commanders, and thirty-eight divisional commanders— Neillands writes that [...] "one cannot help wonder" [...] whether French would not have suffered the same fate had he reported directly to Joffre. Joffre believed at the time that the BEF were technically under his orders and that French's uncooperativeness was because the British government were too weak to insist that he obey orders. [...] French was conscious that he was Joffre's senior in rank and had more combat experience.|$|E
