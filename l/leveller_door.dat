50|$|Each car has an {{enclosed}} operator cab at each end. This allows the most flexible system for managing operations, but prevents travel between cars except at stations. Each car also has separate <b>doors</b> for station <b>level</b> and track level access. In normal operations the track <b>level</b> <b>doors</b> (equipped with stairs) are unused.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the LRV's {{which had}} both {{high and low}} <b>level</b> <b>doors,</b> the PCC's had only low <b>level</b> <b>doors</b> and were limited to street level boarding. As a result, all major {{stations}} on portions {{of the system that}} were shared by PCC's and LRV's(these being South Hills Village, Washington Junction, Castle Shannon, South Hills Junction, and all stops north of the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel) had both high and low platforms to accommodate both types of cars.In 1993, the Overbrook Line was shut down between Castle Shannon and South Hills Junction due to the deteriorated conditions of the track, bridges, walls, and other infrastructure. With that, routes 47 and 47S were suspended, and the 47D was reduced to a short shuttle between Drake and Castle Shannon, where riders would be required to transfer to route 42S, 42L, or a bus to continue to downtown.|$|R

50|$|A lack of {{pressurization}} in the stairwell, {{the absence}} of fire-stopping on service shafts, and few self-closers installed on upper <b>level</b> <b>doors</b> had allowed toxic smoke to penetrate the 3rd to 16th floors and asphyxiate {{many of the people}} residing there. A particularly large number of fatalities occurred on the 11th floor, including those of several children.|$|R
50|$|Finer {{control over}} the {{temperature}} experienced {{can be achieved by}} choosing a higher level bench for those wishing a hotter experience or a lower level bench for a more moderate temperature.

50|$|The Aegerter Barn {{is unusual}} for having an {{overhang}} around all four {{sides of the}} structure, a feature perhaps relating to Aegerter's Swiss heritage. Aegerter or his forebears had emigrated from Bern Canton, in Switzerland, where overhangs in barns are common. Overhangs protect lower <b>level</b> <b>doors</b> from the elements. It is the only such barn in Linn County.|$|R
5000|$|It has a tower {{that was}} built in 1070. It {{originally}} had no ground <b>level</b> <b>door,</b> and the entrance was through a door on the roof. Parishioners had to access the room by climbing a ladder. The walls of the church are five feet thick {{and it was a}} refuge for residents during attacks by the French who had sailed up Newtown Creek. A [...] "3 pound" [...] parish gun which was inscribed 'Schawflet' was kept in the tower until 1779.|$|R

50|$|The {{name comes}} from the way a {{potential}} client accesses the flat. This is generally achieved by walking through an open <b>door</b> at street <b>level</b> and then {{up a flight of}} stairs to a second closed door which has a door bell containing a girl's name. The client rings the bell to gain access. From the street <b>level</b> <b>door</b> to the main building there is often a visible hand crafted sign reading 'model' to indicate that it is indeed the entrance to one or more walk-ups.|$|R

5000|$|The lower {{three levels}} of the tower served as the living {{quarters}} for the keepers and his assistants complete with kitchen, living room and bedrooms. The tower was designed to withstand flooding from storm surges that accompany strong hurricanes by making {{the entrance to the}} tower on the third floor, accessible by an outdoor stairway (the ground <b>level</b> <b>door</b> was later added in the 1930s). [...] This was tested in 1871 when a strong storm submerged the station. The lighthouse and its keepers survived but the lamp oil and their drinking water were spoiled by the flood.|$|R
5000|$|Partially due to {{previous}} legal struggles, the performances at 122 Second Avenue were largely publicized {{by word of}} mouth. The theatre had no sign, in fact only the street <b>level</b> <b>door</b> was labeled [...] "122 Delivery Entrance." [...] There were weekly listings of the productions in the Village Voice, but an address or a phone number was never advertised. Only members could attend shows, and {{to become a member}} one had to go to 122 Second Avenue in person. While this procedure may seem unorthodox, by 1967 there were an estimated three thousand members. Furthermore, in 1967 La MaMa E.T.C. received not-for-profit status.|$|R

50|$|The main {{doors of}} {{vertical}} wood planks slide along overhead tracks and are curved {{to conform to}} the circular form of the barn. A smaller door, located in the left sliding door, permits access without opening the larger entrance. There is another main <b>level</b> <b>door</b> {{on the east side of}} the barn, without a ramp.The lower level, unlike the main floor, contains windows spaced at regular intervals. These windows, inserted in the new foundation at the time that the barn was moved, were taken from the original foundation. The west facing door, located on this level, also slides on an overhead track. On the south side a fire door was added during the recent rehabilitation to satisfy fire codes.|$|R
50|$|The 1972 {{models were}} {{very similar to the}} 1971 models, with the only change being the rear view mirror was glued to the {{windshield}} rather than bolted to top of the cab, and metal or vinyl-covered flat door panels were no longer available; all trim <b>level</b> <b>door</b> panels were molded plastic with integral armrests and wood grain inserts on Cheyenne and Sierra trim levels. For restoration, {{it should also be noted}} that the door and window cranks were slightly longer due to the molded plastic door panels, and the vent windows were now secured with a single screw on the inside of the door, thus differentiating it from the 1971 model year.|$|R
