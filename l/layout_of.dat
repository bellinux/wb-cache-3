5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev invented {{the table to}} illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in {{the properties of the}} elements. The <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the table has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.|$|E
5|$|An American design, , {{authorized}} in 1905 {{and laid}} down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, , were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the main battery, dispensing with Dreadnoughts wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect of race preparation is grooming the course to provide a surface for skate-skiing and setting tracks for classic events. This takes into account snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the equipment used for these functions. Also key is the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> grooming and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.|$|E

5|$|Bolliger & Mabillard took {{approximately}} {{six months}} to design SheiKra and four years to complete the entire project. After Busch Gardens Tampa Bay announced SheiKra, the park contracted with Bolliger & Mabillard so that the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the roller coaster could not be reproduced for several years. In 2009, after the deal expired, Happy Valley Shanghai built an identical copy of SheiKra called Diving Coaster.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought style {{battleship}} built in the French Navy; the previous Magenta-class ships were barbette ships, a type of ironclad battleship. Brennus {{formed the basis for}} the subsequent group of five broadly similar battleships built to the same design specifications, begun with Charles Martel, though they reverted to the armament <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the earlier Magentas which saw the main guns distributed in single turrets in a lozenge pattern.|$|E

5|$|Faur√©'s {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass.

40|$|We present two {{abstract}} {{models of}} puzzles, permutation puzzles and cyclic puzzles, {{which can be}} modelled as puzzle graphs. Based on these models, we implement two puzzle generators and produce various <b>layouts</b> <b>of</b> the puzzles using graph drawing algorithms. Using these puzzle generators we can create new puzzles. Further, we can create new user interfaces of a puzzle by applying different layout algorithms. We implement a method for constructing symmetric <b>layouts</b> <b>of</b> puzzles, as symmetry {{is the most important}} aesthetic criteria for the puzzle layout...|$|R
