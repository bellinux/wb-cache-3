2500|$|<b>Clubmosses</b> (<b>Lycopodiaceae)</b> - {{mountain}} <b>clubmoss</b> (Huperzia selago) ...|$|R
50|$|Huperzia australiana is {{a species}} of small {{terrestrial}} plant, a firmoss or tassel fern, in the <b>Lycopodiaceae</b> (<b>clubmoss)</b> family. It is native to Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|This {{family is}} {{distinguished}} from <b>Lycopodiaceae</b> (the <b>clubmosses)</b> by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types. They are sometimes included {{in an informal}} paraphyletic group called the [...] "fern allies". S. moellendorffii is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name Selaginella was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species Selaginella selaginoides, which turns out (with the closely related Selaginella deflexa) to be a clade that is sister to all other Selaginellas, so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in Selaginella, with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera.|$|R
40|$|Diphasiastrum alpinum (L.) Holub have {{recently}} been discovered on acidic clay spoil from the Carboniferous Lower Coal Measures at Stoneyhill, Telford, Shropshire, v. c. 40. H. se/ago and L. clavatum occur elsewhere in Shropshire but D. alpinum has not {{been reported in the}} county since 1726. Stoneyhill was open-cast for coal and clay and abandoned in the mid 1960 s. Colonization by plants has occurred, with the clubmosses behaving as colonists in moss and lichen dominated communities. The possible origins of these three species in close association at a lowland site are discussed. INTRODUCTION AND OBSERVATIONS <b>Clubmosses</b> (<b>Lycopodiaceae)</b> are found on heaths, moorlands and montane grasslands, and are usually associated with upland areas. The discovery in 1983 / 84 of Huperzia selago, (L.) Bernh. ex Schrank & Mart., Lycopodium clavatum L., and Diphasiastrum alpinum (L.) Holub at a lowland site at Stoneyhill, Telford, Shropshire, v. c. 40, is thus of great interest...|$|R
