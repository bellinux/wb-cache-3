Exquisite as were the tones, enchanting as were the originality of his variations and the perfect harmony of his composition, it was nevertheless extremely difficult to resist smiling at the contortions of his face and figure. Now, his body bending to the strain, he was at one moment with his violin raised in the air, and the next instant with the <b>lower</b> <b>nut</b> almost resting upon his foot. At length, by well-proportioned degrees, the air died away into the original soft cadence; and the player, becoming completely entranced in his own performance, finished by sinking back on the sofa, with his bow and violin raised over his head. Vivian would not disturb him by his applause. An instant after, Mr. Beckendorff, throwing down the instrument, rushed through an open window into the garden.|$|E

The fruit wall is differentiated into epicarp (derivative of outer tissues of inferior ovary, the tissues of receptacular origin) and the pericarp itself (mesocarp and the endocarp derivating from the ovary wall). The epicarp consists of two zones: epidermis and subepidermal zone. Two-four layers of larger sclerenchymatous cells represent the mesocarp.

50|$|The biwa, {{particularly}} the satsuma biwa is another Japanese instrument {{which is known}} for its sawari. The make of the instrument is such that the strings are stopped by pulling them between frets that are raised centimeters from the neck of the instrument, allowing the player to create the desired sawari effect at each fret. Sawari was first found in the biwa, and this quality was a desirable trait that biwa players wanted to reproduce in the shamisen. Thus, players began to use oversized plectrums for the shamisen instead of the fingers, and the 1st string was purposely laid <b>lower</b> at the <b>nut</b> of the instrument so that it purposely vibrated against the wood of the instrument, producing the desired buzzing sound quality.|$|R
40|$|Fierce {{boundary}} fights between Oecophylla smaragdina colonies {{were previously}} {{identified as the}} major factor limiting ant populations and the efficiency of ants as biological control agents. In {{order to determine the}} feasibility and effect ofpreventing boundary fights between colonies, experiments with full-, semi- and no-isolation of existing antcolonies in cashew plantations were done in 1996 and 1997. In a related experiment, ant colonies were transplanted from native vegetation to a cashew orchard. Trees with ant colonies which were fully isolated from other colonies were significantly less damaged by the main insect pests and produced significantly higher yield than those with ant colonies which were partly isolated or were not isolated. That was because fighting events between fully isolated ant colonies were eliminated, and the populations of these colonies were high throughout the cashew flowering and fruiting period. Trees in which O. smaragdina colonies were transplanted suffered little damage by the main insect pests and produced high quality nuts and panicles. However, trees which were protected by pesticides produced <b>lower</b> quality <b>nuts</b> and panicles, because these trees suffered damage by the tea mosquito bug, Helopeltis pernicialis, and the mango tip borer, Penicillaria jocosatrix. It is suggested that O. smaragdina colony isolation, combined with ant transplantation, is an effective means both to achieve high ant populations in cashew plantations and to obtain a high yield...|$|R

5000|$|Torrone is a {{traditional}} winter and Christmas confection in Italy and many varieties exist. They differ from the Spanish version in that a <b>lower</b> proportion of <b>nuts</b> {{is used in the}} confection. Traditional versions from Cremona, Lombardy, range widely in texture (morbido, soft and chewy, to duro, hard and brittle) and in flavor (with various citrus flavorings, vanilla, etc., added to the nougat) and may contain whole hazelnuts, almonds and pistachios or only have nut meal added to the nougat. Some commercial versions are dipped in chocolate. The popular recipes have varied with time and differ from one region to the next. Torrone di Benevento from Benevento, Campania, sometimes goes by the historic name Cupedia, which signifies the crumbly version made with hazelnuts. The softer version is made with almonds. The Torrone di Benevento is considered to be the oldest of its kind since it predates Roman times and was widely known in the territories of Samnium [...] Although originally resembling sticky paste, it now differs only marginally from the varieties of Torrone di Cremona. Abruzzo, Sicily and Sardinia also have local versions that may be slightly distinct from the two main denominations from Lombardy and Campania.|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological and {{clinical}} {{studies have indicated}} that nut consumption could be a healthy dietary strategy to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and related cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this review is to examine the potential mechanisms of action of nuts addressing effects on glycemic control, weight management, energy balance, appetite, gut microbiota modification, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function and blood pressure with a focus on data from both animal and human studies. The favourable effects of nuts could be explained by the unique nutrient composition and bioactive compounds in nuts. Unsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids) present in nuts {{may play a role in}} glucose control and appetite suppression. Fiber and polyphenols in nuts may also have an anti-diabetic effect by altering gut microbiota. <b>Nuts</b> <b>lower</b> serum cholesterol by reduced cholesterol absorption, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and increased bile acid production by stimulation of 7 -α hydroxylase. Arginine and magnesium improve inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial function and blood pressure. In conclusion, nuts contain compounds that favourably influence glucose homeostasis, weight control and vascular health. Further investigations are required to identify the most important mechanisms by which nuts decrease the risk of T 2 DM and CVD...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} one year effect of two dietary {{interventions}} with MeDiet on GL and GI in the PREDIMED trial. Methods. Participants were older subjects {{at high risk}} for cardiovascular disease. This analysis included 2866 nondiabetic subjects. Diet was assessed with a validated 137 -item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The GI of each FFQ item was assigned by a 5 -step methodology using the International Tables of GI and GL Values. Generalized linear models were fitted to assess the relationship between the intervention group and dietary GL and GI at one year of follow-up, using control group as reference. Results. Multivariate-adjusted models showed an inverse association between GL and MeDiet + extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) group: β = - 8. 52 (95 % CI: - 10. 83 to - 6. 20) and MeDiet + Nuts group: β = - 10. 34 (95 % CI: - 12. 69 to - 8. 00), when comparing with control group. Regarding GI, β = - 0. 93 (95 % CI: - 1. 38 to - 0. 49) for MeDiet + EVOO, β = - 1. 06 (95 % CI: - 1. 51 to - 0. 62) for MeDiet + Nuts when comparing with control group. Conclusion.

5000|$|The three strings are {{traditionally}} made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. They are stretched between the pegs {{at the head}} of the instrument, and a cloth tailpiece anchored at the end of the rod which protrudes on the other side of the body. The strings are stretched across the dō, raised from it by means of a bridge, or koma (駒), which rests directly on the taut skin. The lowest string is purposefully laid <b>lower</b> at the <b>nut</b> of the instrument, so that it buzzes, creating a characteristic timbre known as sawari (somewhat reminiscent of the [...] "buzzing" [...] of a sitar, which is called jivari). The upper side of the dō (when on the player's lap) is almost always protected by a cover known as a dō kake, and players often wear a little band of cloth on their left hand to facilitate sliding up and down the neck, known as a yubikake. The head of the instrument known as a tenjin may also be protected by a cover. The material of the strings will depend on the skill of the player. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or 'tetron' strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Individuals with hypertension are at increased risk of stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Although the etiology of essential hypertension has a genetic component, lifestyle factors such as diet play an important role. Reducing dietary salt is effective in lowering blood pressure in salt-sensitive individuals. Insulin resistance and altered glucose metabolism are common features of hypertension in humans and animal models, with or without salt sensitivity. Altered glucose metabolism leads to increased formation of advanced glycation end products. Insulin resistance is also linked to oxidative stress, and alterations in the nitric oxide pathway and renin angiotensin system. A diet rich in protein containing the semiessential amino acid, arginine, and arginine treatment, lowers blood pressure in humans and in animal models. This {{may be due to the}} ability of arginine to improve insulin resistance, decrease advanced glycation end products formation, increase nitric oxide, and decrease levels of angiotensin II and oxidative stress, with improved endothelial cell function and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study demonstrated that the DASH diet, rich in vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products; low in fat; and including whole grains, poultry, fish and <b>nuts,</b> <b>lowered</b> blood pressures even more than a typical North American diet with similar reduced sodium content. The DASH diet is rich in protein; the blood pressure-lowering effect of the DASH diet may be due to its higher arginine-containing protein, higher antioxidants and low salt content...|$|R
40|$|Xenia is a {{phenomenon}} usually associated with phenotype characters controlled by a single recessive gene. The genotype of pollen donor directly determines the phenotype of fruits or seeds harvested from female recipients. Kopyor coconut is a unique coconut mutant and its formation {{is an example of}} xenia, since the genotype of the pollen donor determines the phenotype of the harvested nuts. The objectives of this research were to evaluate xenia in two types of kopyor coconuts (i. e. Kalianda Kopyor Tall and Pati Kopyor Dwarf), determine effects of homozygous KK normal and heterozygous Kk Kopyor coconut ratio, and effects of homozygous KK normal coconuts removal from mix population on yield of Kopyor nuts. For Kalianda Tall Kopyor coconut, field observations were conducted at three kopyor coconut plantations in Kalianda district, Lampung Selatan, Lampung-Indonesia while observations of Pati Dwarf Kopyor were conducted at Tayu district, Pati, Central Java-Indonesia. In both regions, coconut provenances were mapped using GPS and sub-samples were taken based on determined criteria. For each sampled tree, observations were recorded for the following variables: nut yield and yield components. The quantitative data were subjected to t-test statistical analysis to evaluate the significant differences among the observed parameters. Results of this experiment showed the presence of more homozygous KK normal coconuts among provenances of Kalianda Tall heterozygous Kk Kopyor coconut resulted in <b>lower</b> harvested kopyor <b>nuts</b> than the expected value. Moreover, removal of homozygous KK normal coconuts from a mixed coconut population increased yield of kopyor nuts.

40|$|Mild {{water stress}} was imposed on bearing {{macadamia}} trees in through-draining lysimeters at various phenological stages. Water was withheld until a xylem water potential (Ψx) of – 1. 5 to 2. 0 MPa was reached, this being maintained by partial water replenishment at 2 -day intervals. Flowering, nut set, nut development, yield, and quality responses were assessed to identify critical, stress-sensitive stages. Stress during nut maturation was particularly detrimental to both yield and quality, although stress during floral {{development and the}} premature nut drop also had adverse effects. Low yields were due to reduced nut number and smaller <b>nuts.</b> <b>Lower</b> photosynthesis (c. 2 μmol CO 2 /m 2. s) at – 1. 5 MPa would account for reduced yield and poorer quality during nut maturation when energy demands of active oil accumulation are high. Stress at floral initiation was generally not detrimental. Overall, stress restricted growth. The rate of girth growth was significantly lower when stress was applied during the dormant floral initiation stage. When stress coincided with normal periods of vegetative growth, flushing was delayed until after re-watering when greater foliage production was stimulated. Judiciously imposing mild stress {{may be used to}} manipulate macadamia phenology, although it may not necessarily conserve water. Further refinement would be needed to develop stress manipulation as a practical and reliable management tool to achieve higher yields. Water should be applied to alleviate stress during critical stages of nut development and maturation. Mild stress after the current crop is mature, however, is unlikely to be detrimental to macadamia yield or quality. It may, in fact, be beneficial through manipulation of flushing patterns that influence yield...|$|R
40|$|Appetite suppressants {{may be one}} {{strategy}} {{in the fight against}} obesity. This study evaluated whether Korean pine nut free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) work as an appetite suppressant. Korean pine nut FFA were evaluated in STC- 1 cell culture for their ability to increase cholecystokinin (CCK- 8) secretion vs. several other dietary fatty acids from Italian stone pine nut fatty acids, oleic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and capric acid used as a control. At 50 μM concentration, Korean pine nut FFA produced the greatest amount of CCK- 8 release (493 pg/ml) relative to the other fatty acids and control (46 pg/ml). A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial including 18 overweight post-menopausal women was performed. Subjects received capsules with 3 g Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) nut FFA, 3 g pine nut TG or 3 g placebo (olive oil) in combination with a light breakfast. At 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes the gut hormones cholecystokinin (CCK- 8), glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), peptide YY (PYY) and ghrelin, and appetite sensations were measured. A wash-out period of one week separated each intervention day. CCK- 8 was higher 30 min after pine nut FFA and 60 min after pine nut TG when compared to placebo (p < 0. 01). GLP- 1 was higher 60 min after pine nut FFA compared to placebo (p < 0. 01). Over a period of 4 hours the total amount of plasma CCK- 8 was 60 % higher after pine nut FFA and 22 % higher after pine nut TG than after placebo (p < 0. 01). For GLP- 1 this difference was 25 % after pine nut FFA (P < 0. 05). Ghrelin and PYY levels were not different between groups. The appetite sensation "prospective food intake" was 36 % <b>lower</b> after pine <b>nut</b> FFA relative to placebo (P < 0. 05). This study suggests that Korean pine nut may work as an appetite suppressant through an increasing effect on satiety hormones and a reduced prospective food intake. © 2008 Pasman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background:  Betel nut (BN) or Areca nut (AN) chewing habits {{on its own}} or {{with other}} {{ingredients}} including chewing tobacco are highly prevalent in many South East Asian countries as well as among the migrants from these countries residing around the world. The major alcaloid arecoline in betel nut {{has been found to}} carcinogenic and to be associated with a range of health risks, including negative effects on pregnancy outcomes.  It is also reportedly associated with nutritional deficiencies including lower folate status among men and women. Pregnancy imposes stress on folate stores because of increased requirements for growth of maternal tissues, the fetus and the placenta.  Folate deficiency during pregnancy is a major public health concern as it is associated with many adverse health outcomes including neural tube defects, low birth weight, preterm birth, delayed maturation of the nervous system, growth retardation and megaloblastic anemia. Aim: To evaluate the association between betel nut use and folate status among pregnant women in Matlab, Bangladesh. Design: A secondary analysis of data from the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Intervention in Matlab (MINIMat) trial.   A sub sample of pregnant women aged 14 - 50 years and living in the study area Matlab with available serum folate measurements (N= 730) was included in this study. Outcome variable was folate level and folate deficiency and the independent variable was betel nut consumption.  Logistic regression analysis and analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were done. Results were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Two-thirds (63 %) of the women consumed betel nut and 17 % had folate deficiency. Women who consumed betel nut combined with  chewing  tobacco were 2. 57 {{times more likely to have}} folate deficiency (OR = 2. 57; 95 % CI = 1. 23 - 5. 36; p = 0. 012;) and  betel nut consumption 2 - 3 times/day was significantly associated with folate deficiency among users (OR = 2. 51; 95 % CI = 1. 07 – 5. 92; p = 0. 035). Mean serum folate levels were significantly <b>lower</b> among betel <b>nut</b> users as compared to non-users. Conclusion: Betel nut consumption combined with chewing tobacco is associated with lower serum folate level or folate deficiency among pregnant women in Matlab in Bangladesh. Strategies are needed for prevention and control of betel nut consumption in order to prevent adverse health outcomes. There is a need of more knowledge regarding betel nut use and other combined substances to distinguish their individual effects on folate deficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Nutrition)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Motivation: The {{metabolic}} syndrome {{is characterized by}} a group of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that includes obesity, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance or non-insulin dependant diabetes mellitus, pro-thrombotic state and pro-inflammatory state. The NHANES I 11 study showed the prevalence of this syndrome to be 24. 0 % in men and 23. 4 % in women in the USA. These figures translate to more than 47 million US residents having the {{metabolic syndrome}}. In the THUSA (acronym for Transition and Health in the Urbanization of South Africans) study in South Africa it was found that 12 % and 28. 4 % of men and women, respectively, of the black population of the North West Province had three or more disturbances characterizing this syndrome. Therefore, it is evident that the metabolic syndrome is a health problem not only for developed countries but also for developing countries. As a result, this syndrome has been identified as a target for dietary therapies {{to reduce the risk of}} CVD and type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse association between nut consumption and coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality in different population groups. Nut consumption may not only offer protection against heart disease, but also increase longevity. Recently, the benefits of nuts consumption were acknowledged by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration when they approved a qualified health claim that eating nuts (1. 5 ounces/day ≈ 42. 8 g/day) may reduce the risk of CHD. In this regard, the most comprehensively studied mechanism involved the favourable lipid <b>lowering</b> effects of <b>nuts.</b> There is, however, a lack of data in the literature regarding the effect of nuts on the metabolic syndrome. Objective: The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of a high walnut diet and a high unsalted cashew nut diet on markers of the metabolic syndrome in humans. In order to provide a foundational body of evidence for the aforementioned, a secondary objective included conducting a systematic review that investigates the effects of nuts on the lipid profile. Methods: The main project consisted of a controlled feeding trial with a parallel, randomized controlled study design on participants having the metabolic syndrome. Sixty-four subjects having this syndrome (29 men, 35 women) with a mean (±SD) age of 45 ± 10 y and who met with the selection criteria were all fed a 3 -week run-in control diet. After this period, participants were grouped according to gender and age and then randomized into three groups, namely, those that received a controlled feeding diet including walnuts (20 % energy (E), 60 - 100 g/day; protein:carbohydrate:fat= 18 : 42 : 40 %E). or unsalted cashew nuts (20 %E 66 - 1 15 g/day; protein:carbohydrate:fat=l 9 : 44 : 37 %E) or no nuts (protein:carbohydrate:fat= 20 : 47 : 33 %E) for 8 weeks. The participants' physical activity and weight were maintained for the duration of the study. For the systematic review. human intervention trials that investigated the independent effects of nuts on lipid concentrations were included. Medline and Web of Science databases were searched from the start of the database to August 2004 and supplemented by cross-checking reference lists of relevant publications. These papers received a rating based upon the methodology as it appeared in the publication. No formal statistical analysis was performed due to the large differences in study designs of the dietary intervention trials. The main outcome measures for the systematic review, were percentage differences between treatment and control groups for total blood cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triacyglycerols (TG). Results: Regarding the main objective, we found that both the walnut and unsalted cashew nut intervention diets had no significant effect on the lipid profile, serum fructosamine, insulin, insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood pressure and serum uric acid concentrations when compared to the control dict. All three groups experienced highly significant increases in serum insulin concentrations when comparing the baseline to end (P< 0. 05). In turn, insulin resistance increased while insulin sensitivity decreased in all three groups. Plasma glucose concentrations increased significantly in the cashew nut group compared to the control group (P< 0. 05). By contrast, serum fructosamine was unchanged in the cashew nut group while the control group had significantly increased concentrations of this short-term marker of glycaemic control. The literature search for the systematic review yielded 41 5 publications. After screening, 23 nut studies were included in the review with most of these studies including heart-healthy diets. The majority of the studies were short (4 - 6 weeks) with only one study lasting 6 months. The number of subjects in most of the studies was sufficient to study the effects on TC and LDL-C but not for HDL-C and TG. The results of three almond (50 - 100 g/day), two peanut (35 - 68 g/day), one pecan nut (72 g/day) and four walnut (40 - 84 g/day) studies showed convincing evidence for a lipid lowering effect of TC between 2 - 1 6 % and LDL-C between 2 - 19 %, when compared to their control diets. Currently, there are indications from inadequately designed intervention studies that hazelnuts (lg/day/kg body weight) and pistachios (20 %E) may have a lipid lowering effect. At this stage the evidence for macadamia nuts is less convincing. Furthermore, it is apparent that the components in nuts further reduce TC and LDL-C concentrations beyond the effects predicted by equations based solely on dietary fatty acid profiles. Conclusions: In the controlled feeding trial, subjects displayed no improvement in the markers of the metabolic syndrome after following a walnut or unsalted cashew nut diet compared to a control diet while maintaining body weight (8 weeks). Finally, we suspect that the dramatic increase in insulin resistance may have masked the protective effects of the walnut and cashew nut diets in our subjects with the metabolic syndrome Further research is warranted before a consensus can be reached. From the systematic review it was concluded that the consumption of ≈ 50 - 100 g (≈ 1. 5 - 3. 5 servings) of nuts five or more times/week as part of a heart-healthy diet with total fat content (high in mono- and /or polyunsaturated fatty acids) of ≈ 35 % of energy may significantly decrease TC and LDL-C in normo- and hyperlipidemic individuals. Recommendations: A similar nut controlled feeding trial with some form of calorie restriction, should be done on participants having the metabolic syndrome. Future research should use randomized controlled studies with larger sample sizes and longer duration to investigate the effects of nuts on HDL-C and TG concentrations. Also, studies should investigate the effects on the lipid profile of mixed nuts and those individual nuts not yet considered. In addition, the unique nutrient and non-nutrient composition of nuts requires further research in order to elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for the LDL-C lowering effectDoctora...|$|R
