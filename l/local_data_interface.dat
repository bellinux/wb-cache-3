40|$|Depending {{mostly on}} voluntarily sent {{spontaneous}} reports, pharmacovigilance studies are hampered by low {{quantity and quality}} of patient data. Our objective is to improve postmarket safety studies by enabling safety analysts to seamlessly access a wide range of EHR sources for collecting deidentified medical data sets of selected patient populations and tracing the reported incidents back to original EHRs. We have developed an ontological framework where EHR sources and target clinical research systems can continue using their own <b>local</b> <b>data</b> models, <b>interfaces,</b> and terminology systems, while structural interoperability and Semantic Interoperability are handled through rule-based reasoning on formal representations of different models and terminology systems maintained in the SALUS Semantic Resource Set. SALUS Common Information Model at the core of this set acts as the common mediator. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through one of the SALUS safety analysis tools, namely, the Case Series Characterization Tool, which have been deployed on top of regional EHR Data Warehouse of the Lombardy Region containing about 1 billion records from 16 million patients and validated by several pharmacovigilance researchers with real-life cases. The results confirm significant improvements in signal detection and evaluation compared to traditional methods with the missing background information...|$|R

The distributed <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> is used to access molecular-orbital integral arrays stored in distributed memory.

40|$|The {{microcomputer}} {{is finding}} an increasing {{role on the}} hospital patient floor to aid the collection, management and display of the patient's medical data. The data collected by the nursing staff on the microcomputer is stored locally on floppy disks and forms the initial basis for a computerized nursing assessment. The data, however, is permanently maintained at a central site using a mainframe database management system. This paper reports the development of methods which allow the nursing staff (using the same microcomputer used for <b>local</b> <b>data</b> collection) to <b>interface</b> with the mainframe database and send or retrieve components of the patient's record. The microcomputer interface allows the nursing staff to retrieve and view the patient's previous visit records using the same screen format used to input and display the current assessment. As data from the current visit is entered, the current data is compared with the relevant data from the previous visits. Significant deviations are detected and the nurse is alerted. The data can then be displayed for comparisons...|$|R
40|$|A DRAM {{communicates}} with a {{processing unit}} via two interfaces: a <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> and a command interface. In today 2 ̆ 7 s DRAMs, {{also known as}} synchronous DRAMs (SDRAMs), both interfaces use a clock {{to communicate with the}} processing unit. The clock times the communication between the processing unit and the SDRAM on both the <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> and the command interface. We propose a self-timed DRAM. The self-timed DRAM introduces more flexibility into the DRAM interface by eliminating the clock. The command <b>interface</b> and the <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> each communicate with the processing unit using a handshake protocol rather than a clock. This thesis presents the <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> between the self-timed DRAM and the processing unit. The proposed <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> is self-timed. The self-timed <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> allows the DRAM to deliver data to or accept data from the processing unit as the processing unit demands rather than on a schedule set from the command <b>interface.</b> The self-timed <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> is designed using GasP circuits and micropipeline circuits. The design is simulated in 180 nm CMOs process technology using hspice. This thesis presents the effects of width mismatch on the self-timed <b>data</b> <b>interface.</b> The micropipeline is slightly faster than the GasP. Also, the thesis compares the self-timed DRAM <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> with synchronous DRAM for the data burst rate...|$|R

30|$|The {{supplier}} <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> (c_ 5) ranks third, {{and before}} the SCADA modules (fourth and fifth, respectively), although the supplier <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> has a lower interference degree than the SCADA modules. This {{can be explained by}} the impact location of the failing IT components. The supplier <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> influences the first process step, in contrast to the SCADA modules, which influence later process steps. Therefore, an interesting insight is that the impact location in the production network is an important factor because the supplier <b>data</b> <b>interface’s</b> restriction causes production failures in all subsequent process steps of our smart factory example. Further, the SCADA module for the sewing machines has a partial backup, which reduces its threat potential.|$|R
