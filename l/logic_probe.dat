40|$|Abstract- LogiScope {{is based}} on the concept of a Logical Analyzer. A Logic Analyzer is an {{instrument}} which is electronic in nature, which captures and displays signals from a digital circuit. After which the Logic Analyzer will convert the captured data into various timing diagrams and graphs, etc. according to the data input from the logical or digital circuit. The Logic Analyzers have advanced triggering capabilities, which are useful to a user when he needs to see the timing and frequency relationships between many signals in a digital system. After the data is captured from the digital circuit, the results can be displayed in several ways, from showing the waveforms or state forms and even graphs to any complex form. The digital circuit is connected to any device running an Android OS or a computer {{with the help of the}} LogiScope Board via a USB connector. The <b>logic</b> <b>probes</b> on the LogiScope Board can be connected to various points on the digital circuit to get the input and display it in the form of a graph. When the input is fetched from the circuit, the LogiScope Application on the device will output the waveform in the form of a graph. Thus, this application will act as a portable circuit debugger, which will help in debugging any complex circuit with the help of a device having the LogiScope Application and the LogiScope Board...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{practicals}} form {{an essential}} component in any electronics or electrical engineering course. Many students choose to study engineering by means of distance education. Providing such students with effective and manageable practical experience {{has always been a}} significant challenge for those involved in providing distance education. Our university has employed an experimental electronics kit for teaching laboratory skills to distance-education students over the past several years. The chief limitation of the early kit was the inability to use it for performing AC experiments without an additional AC signal generator and an oscilloscope. We now supply distance-education students with the original components pack, and an additional “HELP” kit which contains the signal generator, PC-oscilloscope, a basic multimeter, <b>logic</b> <b>probe,</b> software and documentation. The combined kits allow these students to perform basic DC and AC electronics experiments at home in both freshman and sophomore electronics courses. A more recent development is introducing a small robot platform intended to enhance the student experience and interest in electronics and mechatronics, while still covering the basic skills necessary for the engineer-in-training. Distance-education students receive an updated experimental kit containing the robot, other equipment and components to allow them to complete a fuller suite of practical exercises in electronics in their first two years of study. Within this paper, we present these developments in our HELP kit and also make comparisons between on-campus and off-campus performance...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rise}} of highly {{interactive}} and intelligent product-systems it becomes increasingly more difficult for design researchers to understand and predict the impact, meaning and value of their designs for society. As the meaning of these products is often created in interaction, design researchers learn about their designs, and the user acceptance or rejection, only after product launch. Valuable insights and inspiration for design researchers are not incorporated in the design process, but come as an afterthought. Probing is a useful technique to inform and inspire design researchers, allowing them to gain early insights in their designs. The nature of most probing techniques is to record, analyze and understand current ‘static’ situations (i. e. ethnography), and to obtain information or inspiration for design researchers. Recent technological developments offer opportunities to probe in ‘dynamic’ i. e. changing or emerging, situations, and to merge analysis with design synthesis. This conceptual paper discusses different probing techniques through their fundamental characteristics: informing, inspiring, observational, experiential, static, dynamic etc. We further argue that 1) it is <b>logic</b> that <b>probes</b> with different characteristics fit different phases of the design process 2) dynamic, inspiring, Experiential Probes are more desired when initiating innovation for societal transformation...|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} problem There have been, I am afraid, {{almost as}} many answers to the question what is logic? as there have been logicians. However, if logic {{is not to be}} an obscure &quot;science of everything&quot;, we must assume {{that the majority of the}} various answers share a common core which does offer a reasonable delimitation of the subject matter of <b>logic.</b> To <b>probe</b> this core, let us start from the answer given by Gottlob Frege (1918 / 9), the person probably most responsible for modern logic: the subject matter of logic is &quot;truth&quot;, and especially its &quot;laws &quot; 1. How should we understand the concept of &quot;laws of truth&quot;? The underlying point clearly is that the truth/falsity of our statements is partly a contingent and partly a necessary, lawful matter: that &quot;Paris is in France &quot; is true is a contingent matter, whereas that &quot;Paris is in France or it is not in France &quot; is true is a necessary matter (let us, for the time being, leave aside the Quinean scruples regarding the delimitation of necessarily true statements). Logic,then, should focus on the statements that are true as a matter of law (i. e. necessarily), or, more generally, the truth of which &quot;lawfully depends &quot; on some other statements (i. e. which are true as a matter of law provided these other statements are true) ...|$|R
40|$|Conflict Alerts for {{aircraft}} in holding patterns are often missed or in error due to fact that holding trajectories are not modeled in Conflict Alert or Conflict <b>Probe</b> <b>logic.</b> In addition, a controller in one sector {{may not know}} when aircraft are holding in a neighboring sector. These factors can lead to an increased potential for loss of separation while aircraft are flying in holding patterns. A holding function for conflict probe applications has been developed and tested with air traffic data from Fort Worth Center. The holding function automatically determines when an aircraft enters a holding pattern, builds a holding region around the pattern and then probes the region for conflict with other traffic. The operational concept of use assumes that air traffic controllers are very busy during periods when aircraft are in holding and therefore don't have time to manually enter information which defines a holding pattern and activates conflict probing. For this reason, it is important the holding function automatically detect aircraft in holding and compute a holding region for conflict analysis. The controller is then alerted if other aircraft are predicted to fly through the holding region at the holding altitude...|$|R
40|$|Background: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a common}} reproductive endocrine disorder associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and metabolic disturbances and a genetically heterogeneous disease. Intima-media thickness (IMT) is an indicator of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to determine the relation between IMT and PCOS in women. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 44 PCOS patients and 44 healthy women. Data collection included lipid profiles, blood pressure, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and common and internal IMT of carotid artery which were measured in studied subjects. IMT was measured by a radiologist using a linear 12 MHz ultrasound <b>probe</b> (<b>LOGIC</b> S 6, GE) in carotid setting. Results: IMT of common carotid artery (56. 8 ΁ 7. 6 in cases versus 49. 8 ΁ 7. 3 in controls), internal carotid artery (56. 9 ΁ 6. 03 in cases versus 49. 6 ΁ 6. 9 in controls), and both common and internal carotid artery (56. 6 ΁ 6. 7 in cases versus 49. 7 ΁ 6. 9 in controls) were significantly higher in PCOS patients than healthy women (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: In summary, results demonstrated that carotid artery thickness as a risk for premature atherosclerosis in patients with PCOS is higher than healthy subjects. And hence care and monitoring of PCOS women with these risk factors sounds to be important and necessary...|$|R
40|$|Interacting random {{field of}} probabilities links Kolmogorov law 0 - 1 and Bayesian probabilities observing Markov {{diffusion}} process under Yes-No actions of random impulse. These objective probabilities measure virtual probing impulses processing the interactions in observable process. The impulse observation increases each posteriori correlation reducing conditional entropy measures from finite uncertainty up to certainty of real impulse. The reduced entropy conveys probabilistic causality with time course and temporal memory in collecting correlations, which interactive impulse innately cuts exposing hidden process entropy. The natural cut of this entropy reveals information {{hidden in the}} correlation connections. Inside the merging probing impulse emerges reversible microprocess with yes-no conjugated entangled entropy, curvature and logical complexity. Within the impulse time interval, entanglement starts before its space is formed and ends with beginning the space during reversible relative time interval being small part of impulse time interval. Merging impulse curves and rotates the impulse interactive actions in microprocess whose space interval measures this transitive movement. The cutting entropy sequentially converting to information memorizes the <b>probes</b> <b>logic</b> in Bit, participating in next probe conversions and encoding which memorizes information causality.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar as características clínicas e evolução dos pacientes com câncer e suspeita de TVP submetidos à USD e a sua sensibilidade. MÉTODOS: Estudamos 96 pacientes. A mediana da idade foi de 58 anos, sendo que 73 eram do sexo feminino. A USD foi realizada pelo mesmo radiologista em equipamentos digitais (logiq- 500 -GE e HDI 5000 -Phillips), com transdutores lineares de alta freqüência e, quando indicado, convexo de 3, 5 mHz, utilizando-se modo B e Doppler. RESULTADOS: Sessenta e sete pacientes (69, 8 %) evoluíram a óbito, sendo que apenas quatro (4, 1 %) tiveram exame negativo para TVP e a causa do óbito relacionado a TEP. Quarenta e dois pacientes (43, 8 %) não apresentavam TVP à USD, enquanto 33 (34, 4 %) apresentaram-na, sendo que os demais (21, 8 %) tinham TVP antiga ou trombose superficial. Considerando-se a evolução como padrão ouro e qualquer diagnóstico de TEP desses pacientes causado por TVP, a sensibilidade da USD foi de 95, 9 %. Encontramos correlação estatisticamente significativa entre a presença de TVP e o estadiamento da {{neoplasia}} ao diagnóstico (p PURPOSE: To evaluate Doppler Ultrasound (DUS) in oncology patients {{suspected of}} having Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) and correlate findings with their clinical characteristics and outcome. METHODS: A study was made with 96 consecutive oncology patients submitted to DUS suspected to have DVT between May 2001 and April 2002. The same radiologist examined 73 women and 23 men, with a median age of 58 years, using DUS equipment, with high frequency linear and convex <b>probes</b> (<b>logic</b> 500 - GE and HDI 5000 - Philips). RESULTS: In 42 (43. 8 %) patients the DUS was considered normal, in 33 (34. 4 %) DVT was diagnosed and 21 of them had superficial or previous deep venous thrombosis or non conclusive studies. Considering clinical evaluation (and death by PE as caused by DVT) as the gold standard, DUS sensitivity was of 95. 9 %. There was a statistically significant correlation between DVT and tumor stage {{at the time of}} initial diagnosis and patient's survival rate (p< 0. 05). There was no correlation between DVT and gender, age, type of malignancy, stage of disease at the time of DVT diagnosis and different treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that in cancer patients DUS has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of DVT and that DVT diagnosis in these patients correlates with a shorter overall survival. Since there are no reliable clinical predictors to identify cancer patients with DVT, DUS should be performed whenever DVT is suspected...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{demonstrated}} the cascading of two photonic AND logic gates by using two symmetric semiconductor GaAs microring resonators. In addition, we have developed a new, low-cost method for fabricating glass microring resonators. In {{the first part of}} this work, we discuss the properties of microring resonators and describe the fabrication of semiconductor microring resonators by the research team of which I was a member. In the experiments on cascaded logic gates we launched one probe and pump beam into different input waveguides, respectively. The first ring works as a AND <b>logic</b> gate for <b>probe</b> and pump beams. The output beam from the first ring goes to the second ring. The second ring also work as a AND logic gate using the second pump to switch the beam coming from the first ring. We successfully demonstrated cascading two photonic logic gates by using two symmetric semiconductor GaAs microrings. In the second part of this work, we extended our prior work on the fabrication of semiconductor microrings in a clean room to a purely mechanical method of glass microring fabrication. Many laboratories, including ours, lack the expensive facilities needed for the lithographic fabrication of microrings. And, a low-cost, high yield method of fabrication may have significant application in the development of disposable microring sensors. We have built up a complete mass=production capability based on glass capillary pulling and micro-polishing to fabricate glass microrings, because there were no available off-the-shelf systems available from industry at affordable prices. This method of producing highly polished glass micro-resonators has many advantages, such as fast fabrication (≦ 6 weeks), high yield (≧ 50 %) (percentage of devices w/o cracks on edge), low cost (no need to use costly facilities in a clean room), mass production (800 ~ 1200 devices per batch). The surface quality of glass resonators should be excellent because capillaries were made at high temperature ≧ 1000 ℃ and devices were polished by suspension slurry of 70 nm colloidal silica. Further measurements that are beyond our current capability are needed for final verification. If some fabrication steps could be optimized in the future, we estimate that the fabrication time could be within 2 weeks, the yield rate would be higher than 90 %, and the number of devices per batch could be more than 1, 200. This innovative method opens a new path for microresonator fabrication at low cost and in fast mass production. In sensor applications where low cost and mass production could be important, our work is an important first step to making microring sensors inexpensive, if further work in characterizing them can be done. Glass microresonators can play a key role, for example, in gas sensors, chemical sensors, liquid sensors, biological sensors, and vibration sensors. Two appendices in this thesis list the most significant sub-systems of the whole system we designed and built for producing glass microring resonators. Designs and engineering drawings are also listed in Appendices...|$|R
