40|$|<b>L-ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (AsA-Pal-Enz) was {{synthesized}} {{by using}} an immobilized lipase from Aspergillus niger. A comparison of antioxidative effects between L-ascorbic acid (AsA) and AsA-Pal-Enz was determined in terms of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical–scavenging. The {{results indicate that the}} AsA-Pal-Enz was effective in preventing lipid oxidation, while the antioxidative activity in authentic AsA-Pal was lower. The activity of AsA-Pal-Enz was very stable than AsA-Pal standard during heating...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} complexes of <b>L-ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (ASCP) and urea (UR). This evaluation involved differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), a solubility test, a 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging test, and a mushroom tyrosinase inhibition assay. Physicochemical evaluation revealed that ASCP/UR complexes form at a molar ratio of 1 / 12. The solubility test revealed that ASCP/UR complexes had increased solubility compared to ASCP. The DPPH radical scavenging test and mushroom tyrosinase inhibition assay revealed that the activity of ASCP/UR complexes was not impaired by complex formation. These results are probably due to the tetragonal crystal system of UR changing to a hexagonal crystal system and interaction with the alkyl group of ASCP...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the appearance of reaction mixtures being shaken of linoleic acid (LA) and various buffers containing alcohol and the peroxidation of LA were examined at 37 ℃ with L-ascorbic acid (AsA) or <b>L-ascorbyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (AP) as catalysts. With AsA, the transparency of the reaction mixture increased with {{the suppression of the}} peroxidation. Of the alcohols tested, 1 -propanol was the best for transparency of the reaction mixture and for suppression of LA peroxidation; EtOH was less potent, and MeOH, the least. The reaction mixture was turbid at low concentrations of alcohol. With AP, the appearance of the reaction mixture was similar to that with AsA, but AP suppressed the peroxidation of LA much more distinctly. This may suggest that AP reaches the surface of the LA effectively, even when the reaction mixture is turbid, and then retards LA peroxidation...|$|E
