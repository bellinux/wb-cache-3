40|$|Neuronal {{migration}} disorders {{can now be}} recognised by MRI. This paper reports {{two families}} in which the mothers had subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> and four of their children had either similar heterotopia (two girls) or severe pachygyria or lissencephaly (two boys). <b>Laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> was more evident on MRI T 2 weighted images. The patients had mild to severe epilepsy and mental retardation depending {{on the extent of}} cortical abnormalities. In these families, subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia,</b> pachygyria, and lissencephaly seem to share the same X linked or autosomal dominant gene. No chromosomal abnormalities, especially of chromosome 17, could be identified. For appropriate genetic counselling of the family of a child with lissencephaly or subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia,</b> MRI should be performed in parents or siblings with mental retardation or epilepsy...|$|E

40|$|X linked {{subcortical}} <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> and lissencephaly syndrome (XSCLH/ LIS) is {{an intriguing}} disorder of cortical development, which causes classical lissencephaly with severe mental retardation and epilepsy in hemizygous males, and subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (SCLH) associated with milder mental retardation and epilepsy in heterozygous females. Here we report an exclusion mapping study {{carried out in}} three unrelated previously described families in which males are affected with lissencephaly and females with SCLH, using 38 microsatellite markers evenly distributed on the X chromosome. Most of the X chromosome was excluded and potential intervals of assignment in Xq 22. 3 -q 23 or in Xq 27 are reported. Although the number of informative meioses did not allow a decision between these two loci, {{it is worth noting}} that the former interval is compatible with the mapping of a breakpoint involved in a de novo X;autosomal balanced translocation 46,XX,t(X; 2) (q 22;p 25) previously described in a female with classical lissencephaly. In addition, haplotype inheritance in two families showed a grandpaternal origin of the mutation and suggested in one family the presence of mosaicism in germline cells of normal transmitting males...|$|E
40|$|The {{brains of}} {{individuals}} with developmental dyslexia have neocortical neuronal migration abnormalities including molecular layer <b>heterotopias,</b> <b>laminar</b> dysplasias, and periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNH). RNA interference (RNAi) of Dyx 1 c 1, a candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, disrupts neuronal migration in developing embryonic neocortex. Using in utero electroporation, we cotransfected cells in the rat neocortical ventricular zone (VZ) at E 14 / 15 with short hairpin RNA vectors targeting Dyx 1 c 1 along with either plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein or plasmids encoding monomeric red fluorescent protein only. RNAi of Dyx 1 c 1 resulted in pockets of unmigrated neurons resembling PNH. The pattern of migration of transfected neurons was bimodal, with approximately 20 % of the neurons migrating {{a short distance from}} the VZ and another 40 % that migrated past their expected lamina. Approximately 25 % of the transfected brains had hippocampal pyramidal cell migration anomalies. Molecular layer ectopias, which were not related to injection site artifacts, were also seen in 25 % of the animals. These results support the hypothesis that targeted disruption of the candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, Dyx 1 c 1, results in neuronal migration disorders similar to those seen in the brains of dyslexics...|$|R
40|$|The 1 - 3 -bis-chloroethyl-nitrosurea (BCNU) -treated rats {{represent}} a good model of cortical dysplasia (CD), as proved {{by the presence}} of some histological alterations similar to those observed in human CD, including cortical thinning, <b>laminar</b> disorganization, and <b>heterotopia.</b> The cortical cytoarchitectonics of BCNU-treated rats has been widely investigated by means of histological procedures, immunocytochemistry, and in situ hybridization techniques, implying the sacrifice of the animals. With the aim of identifying brain alterations in vivo to have the possibility of performing longitudinal studies, we used both conventional T(2) -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). Though the T(2) -weighted MRI showed the gross anatomical landmarks of BCNU-treated rats, only following Mn(2 +) administration T(1) -weighted MRI did reveal the brain cytoarchitectonics both of control and BCNU-treated rats. In particular, changes in MEMRI signal depicted the laminar architecture of control rats while BCNU-treated cortex showed no appreciable changes in MEMRI contrast, consistent with their abnormal cortical lamination. Furthermore, in the treated animals MEMRI revealed hyperintense signals corresponding to heterotopia, as shown by the comparison between MEMRI images and Thionin staining and calbindin immunocytochemistry from the same animals. The qualitative findings obtained with MEMRI were semi-quantitatively confirmed by image segmentation of grey matter. Overall, these data show that MEMRI {{can be used as a}} non-invasive technique to investigate cortical alterations in animal models of CD in vivo, giving the possibility to perform longitudinal studies, such as electrophysiological recordings or behavioural investigations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo cases (a {{young male}} and a girl, {{suffering}} intractable epilepsy) of diffuse subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia,</b> or so-called double cortex (DC) {{have been investigated}} using magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG confirmed involvement of both cortices (hetero- and normocortex) in the genesis of interictal spikes, and, according to the heterogeneity of DC syndrome, some differences were observed: spike initiation in the normocortex and latter involvement of the heterotopic cortex in the man, and rather a cancellation in both cortices in the girl. In addition, participation of heterotopic cortex in physiological activities could be demonstrated in the man...|$|E
40|$|Subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (double cortex syndrome) is {{an orphan}} disease with an {{incidence}} of 1 to 200, 000 {{people in the}} population.

40|$|AbstractRecently, we {{and others}} {{reported}} that the doublecortin gene is responsible for X-linked lissencephaly and subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia.</b> Here, we show that Doublecortin is expressed in the brain throughout the period of corticogenesis in migrating and differentiating neurons. Immunohistochemical studies show its localization in the soma and leading processes of tangentially migrating neurons, and a strong axonal labeling is observed in differentiating neurons. In cultured neurons, Doublecortin expression is highest in the distal parts of developing processes. We demonstrate by sedimentation and microscopy studies that Doublecortin is associated with microtubules (MTs) and postulate {{that it is a}} novel MAP. Our data suggest that the cortical dysgeneses associated with the loss of Doublecortin function might result from abnormal cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal cell development...|$|E

40|$|AbstractX-SCLH/LIS {{syndrome}} is a neuronal migration disorder with {{disruption of the}} six-layered neocortex. It consists of subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (SCLH, band heterotopia, or double cortex) in females and lissencephaly (LIS) in males, leading to epilepsy and cognitive impairment. We report the characterization of a novel CNS gene encoding a 40 kDa predicted protein that we named Doublecortin and the identification of mutations in four unrelated X-SCLH/LIS cases. The predicted protein shares significant homology with the N-terminal segment of a protein containing a protein kinase domain at its C-terminal part. This novel gene is highly expressed during brain development, mainly in fetal neurons including precursors. The complete disorganization observed in lissencephaly and heterotopia thus seems to reflect a failure of early events associated with neuron dispersion...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Cortical dysgenesis is {{increasingly}} recognised {{as a cause}} of epilepsy. We report a case with double cortex heterotopia and secondarily generalized seizures with a generalised spike wave pattern. During the course of the disease, the child developed electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep. From the first examination, sleep pattern revealed increased frequency and amplitude of spindle activity, more evident in anterior areas. The role of the thalamocortical pathway in increased sleep spindle activity is discussed with emphasis on the possible role of altered thalamocortical pathways in abnormal cortical migration. A strong suspicion of cortical dysgenesis may therefore be based on specific EEG sleep patterns.

40|$|Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule-associated protein {{involved}} in neuronal migration, which causes X-linked lissencephaly and subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (SCLH) when mutated. Here {{we show that}} DCX interacts with the ubiquitin-specific protease Drosophila fat facets related on X chromosome (DFFRX). This interaction was confirmed by targeted mutagenesis, colocalization, and immunoprecipitation studies. DFFRX is thought to deubiquitinate specific substrates including ߭catenin, preventing their degradation by the proteasome. Interestingly, unlike ߭catenin, no ubiquitinated forms of DCX could be detected, and indeed we show that DCX interacts with a novel recognition domain in DFFRX, located outside of its catalytic site. We also show that DFFRX associates with microtubules at specific subcellular compartments, including those enriched in DCX. These results thus suggest {{that in addition to}} vesicular trafficking, DCX {{may play a role in}} the regulation of cell adhesion via its interaction with DFFRX in migrating and differentiating neurons.

40|$|MR imaging, {{clinical}} {{data and}} underlying pathogenesis of subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (SCLH), {{also known as}} band heterotopia, in two sisters and their mother are presented. On MR imaging a different degree of SCLH was found in all three affected family-members. The inversion recovery sequence was considered most useful in the demonstration of the heterotopic band of gray matter and the assessment of cortical thickness. The younger sister presented with epileptic seizures {{at the age of}} five months and a delayed achievement of developmental milestones. The older sister of seven years had epileptic seizures since the age of one year, and developmental delay. Their mother has only had one seizure-like episode at the age of 39. Her psychomotor development had been normal. Investigation of DNA samples of the three female family-members revealed a mutation in the X-linked doublecortin gene. Within families with band heterotopia, this gene has also been related to male family members with lissencephaly...|$|E

40|$|The X-linked {{subcortical}} <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> and lissencephaly {{syndrome is}} a disorder of neuronal migration {{caused by a}} mutation in XLIS, a recently cloned gene on chromosome Xq 22. 3 -q 23. The predicted protein product for XLIS, doublecortin (DC), shows high homology to a putative calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase, KIAA 0369 protein (KI). Here we identified DC and KI in the brains of human and rat fetuses by immunochemical and immunohistochemical means. In this study, Western blotting demonstrated that both DC and KI are specific to the nervous system and are abundant during the fetal period, around 20 gestational weeks in humans and embryonic days 17 to 20 in rats. Immunostaining of the developing neocortex disclosed localization of DC and KI immunoreactivities in neuronal cell bodies and processes in the zones of ongoing neuronal migration. Although KI showed a somewhat wider distribution than DC, the temporal and spatial patterns of their expression were similar. These results suggest that DC and KI participate in a common signaling pathway regulating neuronal migration...|$|E
40|$|Type I {{lissencephaly}} is a cortical malformation disorder character-ized by disorganized cortical {{layers and}} gyral abnormalities and associated with severe cognitive impairment and epilepsy. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the epilepsy and mental retardation {{in this and}} related disorders remain unknown. Two genes, LIS 1 and doublecortin, have both {{been shown to be}} mutated in a large proportion of cases of type I lissencephaly and a milder allelic disorder, subcortical <b>laminar</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (SCLH). Studying the protein products of these genes and the biochemical pathways in which they belong is likely to yield important information concerning both normal and abnormal cortical development. The relationships between the LIS 1 and Doublecortin proteins are not yet well defined, but both are believed to {{play a critical role in}} cortical neuronal migration. Lis 1 is expressed from very early development in the mouse and in both proliferating cells and post-mitotic neurons of the cortex. This protein is likely to have multiple functions since it is a subunit of the enzyme platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, which degrades platelet activating factor, and has also been shown to be involved in microtubule dynamics, potentially influencing nuclear migration through its interaction with the dynein motor protein complex. Doublecortin on the other hand is exclusively expressed in post-mitotic neurons and is developmentally regulated. In young developing neurons Doublecortin has a specific subcellular localization at the ends of neuritic and leading processes. This localization, combined with our previous data showing that it is a microtubule-associated protein and that it interacts with adapter complexes involved in vesicle trafficking, suggests a role in the growth of neuronal processes, downstream of directional or guidance signals. The observations summarized here favor the suggestion that whereas LIS 1 may play a role in nuclear migration, Doublecortin is instead restricted to functions at the leading edge of the cell...|$|E
