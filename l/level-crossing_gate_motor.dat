30|$|In most Marr–Albus models conjunctive LTD is {{the sole}} form of {{learning}} underlying cerebellar function. However, several studies suggest that conjunctive LTD is an incomplete explanation. First, {{it has been shown}} that cerebellar motor learning can take place in the absence of PF-PC LTD [18, 19]. Second, the correlation of Purkinje cell firing and muscle EMG can show both positive or negative correlations, with positive correlations being the more prevalent [20, 21]. If the role of Purkinje cells was to <b>gate</b> <b>motor</b> commands through just inhibition, negative correlations should be the most common. Third, synaptic inhibition of Purkinje cells, whose complex spike-elicited plasticity acts to counteract PF-PC conjunctive LTD, seems to play a role in motor learning [22], which is ignored by models that rely exclusively on PF-PC LTD. Moreover, other studies suggest that the timing of Purkinje cells’ spikes is important, not only their firing rate. Tottering mutant (tg) mice have virtually the same firing rate as that of wild types during spontaneous activity and in response to optokinetic stimulation; nevertheless, tg mutants show abnormal compensatory eye movements and severe ataxia [23].|$|R

40|$|Background Some neurochemical {{evidence}} {{as well as}} recent studies on molecular genetics suggest that pathologic gambling {{may be related to}} dysregulated dopamine neurotransmission. Methods The current study examined sensory (<b>motor)</b> <b>gating</b> in pathologic gamblers as a putative measure of endogenous brain dopamine activity with prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle eye-blink response and the auditory P 300 event-related potential. Seventeen pathologic gamblers and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were assessed. Both prepulse inhibition measures were recorded under passive listening and two-tone prepulse discrimination conditions. Results Compared to the control group, pathologic gamblers exhibited disrupted sensory (<b>motor)</b> <b>gating</b> on all measures of prepulse inhibition. Sensory <b>motor</b> <b>gating</b> deficits of eye-blink responses were most profound at 120 -millisecond prepulse lead intervals in the passive listening task and at 240 -millisecond prepulse lead intervals in the two-tone prepulse discrimination task. Sensory gating of P 300 was also impaired in pathologic gamblers, particularly at 500 -millisecond lead intervals, when performing the discrimination task on the prepulse. Conclusions In the context of preclinical studies on the disruptive effects of dopamine agonists on prepulse inhibition, our findings suggest increased endogenous brain dopamine activity in pathologic gambling in line with previous neurobiological findings...|$|R
40|$|The group I metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptor 5 (mGluR 5) {{has been}} implicated in the pathology of various neurological disorders including schizophrenia, ADHD, and autism. mGluR 5 -dependent synaptic plasticity has been described {{at a variety of}} neural connections and its signaling has {{been implicated in}} several behaviors. These behaviors include locomotor reactivity to novel environment, sensorimotor gating, anxiety, and cognition. mGluR 5 is expressed in glutamatergic neurons, inhibitory neurons, and glia in various brain regions. In this study, we show that deleting mGluR 5 expression only in principal cortical neurons leads to defective cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB 1 R) dependent synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex. These cortical glutamatergic mGluR 5 knockout mice exhibit increased novelty-induced locomotion, and their locomotion can be further enhanced by treatment with the psychostimulant methylphenidate. Despite a modest reduction in repetitive behaviors, cortical glutamatergic mGluR 5 knockout mice are normal in sensorimotor <b>gating,</b> anxiety, <b>motor</b> balance/learning and fear conditioning behaviors. These results show that mGluR 5 signaling in cortical glutamatergic neurons is required for precisely modulating locomotor reactivity to a novel environment but not for sensorimotor <b>gating,</b> anxiety, <b>motor</b> coordination, several forms of learning or social interactions...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{an emerging}} field which utilizes the unique structural properties of nucleic acids {{in order to}} build nanoscale devices, such as logic <b>gates,</b> <b>motors,</b> walkers, and algorithmic structures. Predicting the structure and interactions of a DNA device requires good modeling of both the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the DNA strands within the system. The kinetics of a set of DNA strands can be modeled as a continuous time Markov process through the state space of all secondary structures. The primary means of exploring the kinetics of a DNA system is by simulating trajectories through the state space and aggregating data over many such trajectories. We expand on previous work by extending the thermodynamics and kinetics models to handle multiple strands in a fixed volume, and show that the new models are consistent with previous models. We developed data structures and algorithms that allow us to take advantage of local properties of secondary structure, improving the efficiency of the simulator so that we can handle larger systems. The new kinetic parameters in our model were calibrated by analyzing simulator results on experimental systems that measure basic kinetic rates of various processes. Finally, we apply the new simulator to explore a case study on toehold-mediated four-way branch migration. </p...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the consequences of juvenile capsaicin desensitization on different functions: acute and inflammation-induced thermal and mechanical sensitivity, urinary bladder capacity and thermoregulation, and also on the potentially schizophrenia-related impairments in sensory-motor <b>gating,</b> <b>motor</b> activity and cognitive functioning. Male Wistar rats desensitized with increasing doses of subcutaneous capsaicin after weaning were investigated. Heat and mechanical pain sensitivity did not change significantly; however, morphine produced a prolonged decrease in the nociceptive response to inflammation in desensitized animals. Ultrasound examination of the bladder revealed enhanced bladder volume in treated animals. Capsaicin-treated animals had higher body temperature at 22 degrees C in both dark and light periods, and they also showed prolonged hyperthermia in new environmental circumstances. Warm environment induced a profound impairment of thermoregulation in desensitized animals. The treated animals also showed higher levels of activity during the active phase and at both cool and warm temperatures. The amplitude of the responses to auditory stimuli and prepulse inhibition did not differ between the two groups, but the desensitized animals showed learning impairments in the novel object recognition test. These results suggest that juvenile capsaicin desensitization leads to sustained changes in several functions that may be related to schizophrenia. We propose that capsaicin desensitization, together with other interventions, may lead to an improved chronic animal model of schizophrenia...|$|R

So, this paper describes the automatic railway gate control system using PIC microcontroller for saving precious human lives and preventing major disasters in railway track. Railway gate may be saved for the road users to prevent accidents in terms of train speed at level crossing. This system uses PIC 16 F 877 A microcontroller with the help of sensors. It can divide into two parts. The first part is concern on the hardware development where all electronic components have included. IR sensors, inductive sensors are the input components while buzzer, light indicator, DC motor and LCD display are the output components. These are controlled by the controller circuit. The microcontroller forms the main unit of the system. It receives input signal from the sensors and sends information to the <b>gate</b> <b>motor</b> driver for opening and closing the gate. Besides, the input signal will active LCD display and alarm and indication light circuit was provided as additional part of this system.

The gate is closed, when the train crosses the first IR sensor and the gate is opened, when the train crosses the second IR sensor. This system deals about one of the efficient methods to avoid train accidents. The second part is based on software programming to operate the hardware structure.

How consumption is controlled by external sensory cues and internal metabolic state remains under intense investigation. Here, we identify four GABAergic interneurons in the Drosophila brain that establish a central feeding threshold which is required to inhibit consumption. Inactivation of these cells results in indiscriminate and excessive intake of all compounds, independent of taste quality or nutritional state. Conversely, acute activation of these neurons suppresses consumption of water and nutrients. The output from these neurons is required to <b>gate</b> activity in <b>motor</b> neurons that control meal initiation and consumption.

30|$|Power <b>gating</b> and <b>motor</b> speed {{decoding}} are continuous {{processes that}} have critical clocking constraints beyond {{the capabilities of}} bus operation {{to and from the}} I/O board. Therefore, even though the PMC 66 - 16 AISS 8 A 04 board also provides digital I/O, both the PWM gating signals and the input pulses from the optical speed encoder are directly passed through FPGA pins to be processed by dedicated hardware logic. This is done by plugging a custom-made adapter card with Samtec CON 0.8 [*]mm connectors into the expansion site on the AP 1000. While the vector control uses data acquired from the AIO card through a state machine, the PWM signals are constantly fed to the power module (Figure 6). Those signals are sent directly through the general purpose digital outputs on the AP 1000 itself instead of going through the AIO card. This ensures complete control over the speed at which these signals are generated and sent while targeting a specific operating frequency (16 [*]kHz in our example). This way, the speed calculations required for the vector control algorithm are done using precise clocking without adding to the burden of the state machine which dictates the communications between FPGA and the AIO card. The number of transitions found on the signal lines between the FPGA and speed encoder are used to evaluate the speed at which the motor is operating.|$|R

The thermodynamics of multiple interacting DNA strands is a well-studied model which can make equilibrium predictions on these systems, but many devices operate far from equilibrium. The prediction of large non-equilibrium systems requires the simulation of a kinetics model, as these are both stochastic and computationally difficult to solve in an exact form.

The first experiment used the radial arm maze to examine working versus reference memory. Next, delays were imposed between the first four radial arm maze choices and the last, in order to examine short-term memory. Finally, pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle was assessed to determine the effects of nicotine on sensorimotor gating in NBM lesioned animals.

The orexin system has close anatomical and functional relationships with systems that regulate the autonomic nervous system, emotion, mood, the reward system and sleep/wakefulness states. Recent pharmacological studies using selective antagonists have suggested that orexin receptor- 1 (OX 1 R) is involved in physiological processes that regulate emotion, the reward system and autonomic nervous system. Here, we examined Ox 1 r-/- mice with a comprehensive behavioral test battery to screen additional OX 1 R functions. Ox 1 r-/- mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior, altered depression-like behavior, slightly decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, reduced social interaction, increased startle response and decreased prepulse inhibition.

40|$|Dopamine (DA) {{replacement}} therapy with l-DOPA {{remains the most}} effective treatment for Parkinson's disease, but causes dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) {{in the vast majority}} of the patients. The basic mechanisms of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) have become the object of intense research focusing on neurochemical and molecular adaptations in the striatum. Here we review this vast literature and highlight trends that converge into a unifying pathophysiological interpretation. We propose that the core molecular alteration of striatal neurons in LID consists in an inability to turn down supersensitive signaling responses downstream of DA D 1 receptors (where supersensitivity is primarily caused by DA denervation). The sustained activation of intracellular signaling pathways induced by each dose of l-DOPA leads to abnormal cellular plasticity and high bioenergetic expenditure. The over-exploitation of signaling pathways and energy reserves during treatment impairs the ability of striatal neurons to dynamically <b>gate</b> cortically driven <b>motor</b> commands.
