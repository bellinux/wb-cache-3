25|$|Another {{style is}} the {{recumbent}} bicycle. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> onto a support and operate pedals {{that are on}} about {{the same level as}} the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the Union Cycliste Internationale.|$|E
25|$|Handheld {{ergonomic}} keyboards {{are designed}} to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.|$|E

500|$|The {{controls}} {{were designed to}} give more realistic movement to characters. Characters can dash, bob and weave in all eight directions. The punches are divided into left and right jabs/hooks. When punches are {{used in conjunction with}} [...] "technique" [...] and [...] "special" [...] buttons, extra types of punches can be executed. Combinations and counter-punches are also possible. By combining upper body movements with punches, players can duck down and hit to the body or <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> and throw a quick punch to the head. The initial setup uses the left analog stick for all the character's bodily movements; minor movements to the stick control the upper body movements, while larger movements control the lower body and movement within the ring.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} more convoy runs, Nevada {{set sail}} for the United Kingdom {{to prepare for}} the Normandy Invasion, arriving in April 1944. Her float plane artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS-7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus). She was chosen as Rear Admiral Morton Deyo's flagship for the operation. During the invasion, Nevada supported forces ashore from 6–17 June, and again on 25 June; during this time, she employed her guns against shore defenses on the Cherbourg Peninsula, [...] " [...] to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> as [...] hurled salvo after salvo at the shore batteries." [...] Shells from her guns ranged as far as [...] inland in attempts to break up German concentrations and counterattacks, even though she was straddled by counterbattery fire 27 times (though never hit). Nevada was later praised for her [...] "incredibly accurate" [...] fire in support of beleaguered troops, as some of the targets she hit were just [...] from the front line. Nevada was the only battleship present at both Pearl Harbor and the Normandy landings.|$|E
500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} {{so little time}} to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order {{to sound like a}} live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Joyce was not {{teaching}} early Egyptian perversions nor inventing new ones. Girls <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> everywhere, showing {{lace and}} silk stockings; wear low-cut sleeveless blouses, breathless bathing suits; men think thoughts and have emotions {{about these things}} everywhere—seldom as delicately and imaginatively as Mr. Bloom—and no one is corrupted. Can merely reading about the thoughts he thinks corrupt a man when his thoughts do not? ...|$|E
2500|$|Courtship in {{the common}} box turtle, which usually takes place in spring, begins with a [...] "circling, biting and shoving" [...] phase. These acts are {{carried out by the}} male on the female. Following some pushing and shell-biting, the male grips the back of the female’s shell with his hind feet to enable him to <b>lean</b> <b>back,</b> {{slightly}} beyond the vertical, and mate with the female. [...] Remarkably, female common box turtles can store sperm for up to four years after mating, and thus do not need to mate each year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, a New York {{attorney}} {{whose daughter}} had received an unsolicited copy of The Little Review issue containing the [...] "Nausicaa" [...] episode of Ulysses {{brought it to}} the attention of John S. Sumner, secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Sumner lodged a complaint in September 1920, and on October 4 Anderson and Heap were arrested and charged with obscenity for publishing [...] "Nausicaa" [...] in the 1920 July–August issue of The Little Review. [...] This episode was an account of protagonist Leopold Bloom fantasizing about a young girl named Gerty MacDowell who leans back to expose herself to Bloom. The scene culminates in Bloom’s orgasm, which legal historian Edward de Grazia, in Girls <b>Lean</b> <b>Back</b> Everywhere, argues would have likely escaped the average reader's notice due to Joyce’s metaphorical language.|$|E

2500|$|When Foreman and Ali {{finally met}} in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with {{superior}} punching speed. However, Ali quickly realized that this approach required him to move much more than Foreman and would cause him to tire. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali's sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali's head. The ring ropes, being much looser than usual (Foreman later charged that Angelo Dundee had loosened them, and this story is supported by Norman Mailer in the book The Fight), allowed Ali to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> and away from Foreman's wild swings and then grab Foreman behind the head, forcing Foreman to expend much extra energy untangling himself. Ali also constantly pushed down on Foreman's neck but was never warned about doing so. To this day, {{it is unclear whether}} Ali's pre-fight talk of using speed and movement against Foreman had been just a diversionary tactic or whether his use of {{what became known as the}} [...] "rope-a-dope" [...] tactic was an improvisation necessitated by Foreman's constant pressure.|$|E
2500|$|The skiff is {{designed}} for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer leans forward, and bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole and leans back. This is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the recovery phase begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as [...] "feathering"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke. The hands must never pass one above the other - one hand must always lead, or one of the blades will [...] "dig" [...] in the water. The seat does not slide and the unbending of the legs follows from the leaning back of the body. Finally skiffs are more stable so {{that it is possible to}} <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> further and keep the blade in the water for longer. The last extra distance provides considerable motive power to the boat, leading to the encouragement to [...] "squeeze the finish".|$|E
