60|$|Living in lonely {{houses and}} cottages shut out from {{civilisation}} by {{the difficulties of}} communication, and hemmed in by floating mists and by much that was awe-inspiring, with in winter additional barriers of storm, snow and flood, {{it is easy to}} imagine how in the fancy of the yeoman, shepherd, farmer, or solitary <b>lime</b> <b>burner,</b> as 'th' edge o' dark' threw its weird glamour over the scene, boggarts and phantoms would begin to creep about to the music of the unearthly voices heard in every sough and sigh of the wandering wind as it wailed around the isolated dwellings.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1671, Cendoya {{obtained}} 12,000 pesos in Mexico City {{to build}} the fort, as well as acquiring tradesmen, including fifteen masons, stonecutters, <b>lime</b> <b>burners,</b> and plasterers in Havana. The best of the plasterers was Lorenzo Lagunes, who had worked in France, Italy, and Havana, {{and may have been}} familiar with treatises on fortification published in Europe; he now served as master of the stonemasons and <b>lime</b> <b>burners.</b> Cendoya chose military engineer Ignacio Daza to supervise construction works on the Castillo; presumably he was responsible for drawing up its plans. To these workers were added 17 soldiers, several Black slaves from Cuba and one hundred and fifty Native American peons to labor at the fort.|$|R
5000|$|The {{forest is}} a popular {{destination}} for mountain biking, and has several marked trails ranging from those suitable for families, to twored trails for experienced riders. The forest also has {{hundreds of miles of}} singletrack, several black-graded bomb holes and a steeply undulating section called [...] "The Beast" [...] {{at the end of the}} <b>Lime</b> <b>Burner</b> Trail.|$|E
50|$|In 1608 {{there were}} 50 {{houses in the}} village of Staunton. A muster roll for the parish {{includes}} one labourer, two miners, three farmers, one <b>lime</b> <b>burner,</b> one husbandryman, two blacksmiths, one carpenter and a tyler, with others making a total of 35 - this is for fighting men (when called) with weapons in the parish. This would mean that there were about 150 residents altogether.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was also}} a Thomas Steers, <b>lime</b> <b>burner</b> of Greenwich ({{probably}} the owner and/or digger of [...] "Jack Cade's Cavern" [...] and of a nearby sand mine) who was born about this time and in the right area, but who was probably not the same person. Other Steers were involved in pottery. This hints at an extended Steers family with interests in kilns and building mortar.|$|E
5000|$|... “Forbitoribus” {{apparently}} {{refers to}} the Confraternity of the “Forbiciai” - the ‘scissors-makers’ and manufacturers of knives. It was a common practice in the 12th century for churches to be sponsored by specific guilds or artisans’ associations, such as Saint Benedict of the Kettle-Makers (de Caccabis), Saint Mary of the Blacksmiths (de Ferraris), Saint Nicholas of the <b>Lime</b> <b>Burners</b> (Calcarariorum), Saint Nicholas of the Rope Makers (Funariorum).|$|R
50|$|The early {{inhabitants}} {{earned their}} living, as everywhere else, through farming. They led lives full of hardship and deprivation. Eventually, though, some found work as <b>lime</b> <b>burners</b> at brickworks around the Remigiusberg, as miners {{in the surrounding}} coal and mercury mines or as textile workers in the new mills in Kusel. Others by then might already have worked at traditional occupations such as smith, cabinetmaker, cobbler, mason and carpenter.|$|R

Copies of the portico (pronaos) of the Zeus temple and of a bay of the Artemis temple can be visited in the Pergamonmuseum in Berlin. Much of the architectural remains of Magnesia were destroyed long ago by local <b>lime</b> <b>burners.</b> The well preserved remains of the Zeus temple have been destroyed by local residents even after Humann's excavation campaign.|$|R
50|$|Early {{settlers}} on {{the island}} included timber getters, and by 1873 there {{are known to have}} been two houses {{at either end of the}} low central saddle. These were owned by George Woods and Albert Nelson, a <b>lime</b> <b>burner</b> and boarding house operator respectively. In the late 1890s, the island was briefly dedicated as the site for an inebriates asylum that was ultimately built on nearby Peat Island several years later.|$|E
50|$|The border was {{the river}} Lysakerelva, and along it the Wedel-Jarlsberg family {{continued}} owning property. Smaller industry had developed alongside the river, including a mill, sawmill, brickworks and a <b>lime</b> <b>burner.</b> The sawmill was discontinued in 1888 {{due to a}} new sawmill being built further north at Fossum. The brickworks was closed in 1902, and the mill in 1904. From 1913 to 1946 a power station operated {{in place of the}} mill; it later became a furniture factory. Its purpose was to provide power for the industry at Fossum, but excess power was sold to locals.|$|E
5000|$|He {{became an}} {{agricultural}} labourer while still a child; however, he attended school in Glinton church {{until he was}} 12. In his early adult years, Clare became a [...] in the Blue Bell public house {{and fell in love}} with Mary Joyce; but her father, a prosperous farmer, forbade her to meet him. Subsequently, he was a gardener at Burghley House. He enlisted in the militia, tried camp life with Gypsies, and worked in Pickworth as a <b>lime</b> <b>burner</b> in 1817. In the following year he was obliged to accept parish relief. Malnutrition stemming from childhood may be the main culprit behind his 5-foot stature and may have contributed to his poor physical health in later life.|$|E
50|$|The {{census of}} 1851 shows about 50 farms, {{and that the}} parish was mainly {{agricultural}} up {{to the time of}} the Second World War. The associated trades of blacksmith, saddler and carpenter etc. were supplemented by stonemasons and <b>lime</b> <b>burners,</b> there being good quality limestone in the parish. After the mechanisation of farming, and the growth of the aircraft industry at nearby Patchway and Filton, the parish gradually became a home for commuters. The area contains an ancient woodland, Wildacre, owned and operated by the Woodland Trust.|$|R
50|$|Rural {{industries}} and craftsmen were {{an important part}} of life in a country town. The local trade directory for 1830 shows that there were in Aberystwyth:Twenty boot makers, eight bakers, two corn millers, eleven carpenters and joiners, one cooper, seven tailors, two dressmakers, two straw hat makers, two hat makers, three curriers, four saddlers, two tinsmiths, six maltsters, two skinners, four tanners, eight stonemasons, one brewer, four <b>lime</b> <b>burners,</b> three shipwrights, three wheelwrights, five cabinet makers, one nail maker, one rope maker and one sail maker.|$|R
50|$|The 1901 Madras Census noted {{three groups}} who called {{themselves}} Paravars. It {{speculated that the}}ir common root were the mostly Christian Tamil-speaking Paravars, The other groups were the Canarese-speaking Paravars, who were umbrella makers and devil-dancers and the Malayalam-speaking Paravars, who were <b>lime</b> <b>burners,</b> gymnasts, midwives and shell collectors. It has been further speculated that the splitting of the latter two groups from the first may have been {{as a consequence of}} a desire {{to move away from the}} ancient tribal area when faced with the arrival of Muslims.|$|R

In 1823 Norton was in the Wapentake of Buckrose and the East Riding of Yorkshire. Population at the time was 1017. Occupations included five farmers, one of whom was also a <b>lime</b> <b>burner,</b> two blacksmiths, four butchers, six grocers, five shoemakers, three tailors, two horse jockeys, a horse trainer, three raff merchants (dealers in lumber and odd refuse), two schoolmasters, a corn miller, saddler, stonemason, linen draper, cabinet maker, roper, gardener, fellmonger, wheelwright, overseer, and surgeon, and the landlords of The Bay Horse, and The Oak Tree public houses. Resident were fifteen members of the gentry.|$|E

50|$|There is some {{confusion}} about Jacquard’s early work history. British economist Sir John Bowring met Jacquard, who told Bowring {{that at one}} time he had been a maker of straw hats. Eymard claimed that before becoming involved in the weaving of silk, Jacquard was a type-founder (a maker of printers’ type), a soldier, a bleacher (blanchisseur) of straw hats, and a <b>lime</b> <b>burner</b> (a maker of lime for mortar). Barlow claims that before marrying, Jacquard had worked for a bookbinder, a type-founder, and a maker of cutlery. After marrying, Jacquard tried cutlery making, type-founding, and weaving. However, Barlow does not cite any sources for that information. Ballot stated that Jacquard initially helped his father operate his loom, but the work proved too arduous, so Jacquard was placed first with a bookbinder and then with a maker of printers' type.|$|E

50|$|The Lonari caste {{are found}} chiefly in India regions of Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Khandesh, Nasik, Pune, Baramati, Satara, Sholapur, Jalna, the Satara agency, and the {{southern}} Maratha country. The caste had a population of 19,222 in 1901, which included 9,672 males and 9,550 females. They are an upper caste of cement-makers and <b>lime</b> <b>burners</b> who once {{seem to have been}} Marathas, but they also seem to have formed themselves into a separate class by adopting the occupation of <b>lime</b> and charcoal <b>burners.</b> In Belgaum district they are divided into Mith (salt) and Chuna (lime) Lonaris, who eat together but do not intermarry. In Ahmednagar, Poona, and Sholapur district, they are divided into Lonari proper and Kadu, Akaramashe, who eat together but do not intermarry. In the Jativivek, they are described as the progeny of a man of the mallat caste and of a woman of the avart caste.|$|R
50|$|David Harris, {{younger brother}} of Job, married Mary Rebecca Pankhurst at Buchsfeldt, South Australia in 1872. His {{occupation}} {{was listed as}} a <b>lime</b> <b>burner.</b> In 1875, David was listed as {{an employee of the}} Virginia Gold Mining Company, Northern Territory and was a passenger on the SS Gothenburg in February 1875. The steamship left Darwin en route to Adelaide when a cyclone-strength storm was encountered and the SS Gothenburg sank off the north Queensland coast on 24 February 1875. Only 22 men, including David, survived the wreck while 98-112 people died, many being high profile South Australian dignitaries and civil servants. Harris Street in Millner, Darwin is named after David Harris. In 1876, David and his wife Mary moved to Green's Plains (near Kadina, South Australia) as a pioneering farmer. They had 8 children. David died 23 May 1885 and is buried at Kadina.|$|E
50|$|The work {{performed}} by these practitioners {{is not only}} essential {{to the maintenance of}} the historic built environment, but also to the preservation of the traditional trade skills and knowledge themselves. In many cases, traditional trade skills and techniques date back centuries. Traditional trades such as carpenters and timber framers; masons, plasterers, <b>lime</b> <b>burners,</b> and brick makers; painters; blacksmiths; and slate, metal, shingle, tile, and thatch roofers, are anecdotally said to be “dying” arts. While it is true that some techniques of the past are not well enough understood, {{it is also true that}} these crafts have been practiced continuously all over the world without dying at all.|$|R
50|$|A {{resident}} {{colony of}} quarrymen did not {{pause in the}} slightest but went on dismantling buildings. All trace of structures {{in that part of}} the forum vanished between August 15 and September 14, 1546. The stone was sold to cutters for reuse or to <b>lime</b> <b>burners</b> for the creation of cement. None of these proceedings were in any way archaeological. Cardinal Farnese assigned the scholars to watch the diggings. Collecting a team they moved swiftly to rescue what they could, sinking tunnels to the side to search for fragments. Subsequently, more fragments turned up embedded in buildings then in use, showing that the area had been less intensely mined previously, and casting doubt of the location of the original source of the fragments.|$|R
500|$|Much of the {{expenditure}} {{was on the}} construction teams, called [...] "crews", who built the forts. The numbers of workers varied {{during the course of}} the project, driven in part by seasonal variation, but the teams were substantial: Sandgate Castle, for example, saw an average of 640 men on the site daily during June 1540, and the work at Hull required a team of 420. A skilled worker was paid between 7 and 8 pence a day, a labourer between 5 and 6 pence, with trades including stonemasons, carpenters, carters, <b>lime</b> <b>burners,</b> sawyers, plumbers, scavelmen, dikers and bricklayers. Finding enough workers proved difficult, and in some cases men had to be pressed into service unwillingly. Labour disputes broke out, with strikes over low pay at Deal in 1539 and at Guisnes in 1541; both were quickly suppressed by royal officials.|$|R

50|$|Originally, the {{inhabitants}} earned their livelihood mainly at agriculture. Quite early on, though, {{they sought to}} exploit mineral wealth. As in many places in the Westrich, an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France, there were also collieries in Bedesbach. Near the limit with Ulmet, as early as 1773, a substantial coal seam was discovered at the Hellerberg (mountain) by a farmer, which the Zweibrücken Chief Mountain Director (Oberbergdirektor) Stahl later had exploited, an endeavour at which over the years Stahl himself and the Duke of Zweibrücken (for his private estate) made a profit of more than 10,000 Gulden. The coal thus mined was used mainly by smiths and <b>lime</b> <b>burners.</b> Since the coal was dug {{to a certain extent}} destructively, the mine eventually caved in. A new gallery was built that was roughly 290 m long. The colliery at the Hellerberg was run until 1840, and again for a short while after the First World War. After 1800, there were three further galleries under the collective name Karlsgrube in the Kerzenbach and in the Grundwäldchen (wood). Employed here were four to six workers, who over time mined 2,600 metric tons of coal.|$|R
40|$|New air {{pollution}} regulations will require cleaner, more efficient processes for converting coal to electricity, producing solid byproducts or wastes {{that differ from}} conventional pulverized-coal combustion ash. Large scale landfill test cells containing byproducts were built at 3 sites and are to be monitored over at least 3 years. This report presents results of a 3 -y field test at an ash disposal site in northern Ohio; the field test used ash from a combined <b>lime</b> injection-multistage <b>burner</b> (LIMB) retrofit at the Ohio Edison Edgewater plant. The landfill test cells used LIMB ash wetted only to control dusting in one cell, and LIMB ash wetted to optimize compaction density in the other cell. Both test cells had adequate load-bearing strength for landfill stability but had continuing dimensional instability. Heaving and expansion {{did not affect the}} landfill stability but probably contributed to greater permeability to infiltrating water. Leachate migration occurred from the base, but effects on downgradient groundwater were limited to increased chloride concentration in one well. Compressive strength of landfilled ash was adequate to support equipment, although permeability was higher and strength was lower than anticipated. Average moisture content has increased to about 90 % (dry weight basis). Significant water infiltration has occurred; the model suggests that as much as 20 % of the incident rainfall will pass through and exit as leachate. However, impacts on shallow ground water is minimal. Results of this field study suggest that LIMB ash from combustion of moderate to high sulfur coals will perform acceptably if engineering controls are used to condition and compact the materials, reduce water influx to the landfill, and minimize leachate production. Handling of the ash did not pose serious problems during cell construction; steaming and heat buildup were moderate...|$|R
40|$|A 1, 500 ton {{temporary}} storage pile of water conditioned LIMB (<b>Lime</b> Injected Multistage <b>Burner)</b> ash by-product from the Ohio Edison Edgewater plant Lorain, OH {{was constructed in}} July, 1991 at a coal company near New Philadelphia, Ohio. This stockpile was created for dry FGD by-product material {{to be held in}} reserve for a land application uses field demonstration. High volume, beneficial uses of dry FGD by-products, such as for mine reclamation and embankment stabilization, will require temporary stockpiling of the by-product. Purpose for constructing this pile was to study changes with time in the LIMB by-product material when exposed to weathering. This by-product material was studied over a 2 1 / 2 year period. The water to control fugitive dust was added in the ash conditioner at the power plant while being loaded into dump trucks. Amount of water normally added in the conditioning process is close to the optimum moisture content of 40 [...] 50 % (dry weight basis), to construct a compacted road embankment or road base. Four environmental operating permits required for construction of the storage pile were obtained, three from Ohio EPA (air, water and solid waste), and one from the Ohio Division of Reclamation (revised reclamation area permit). There was no significant environmental impacts from storm runoff or leachate water from the LIMB ash stockpile during the initial 18 month period through December, 1992. After 2 1 / 2 years of storage, the potential value of the LIMB material for use as a road embankment material or soil conditioner has declined significantly. Ettringite formation occurs. Aging allows the expansive reaction to take place before its potential use as compacted structural fill or embankment...|$|R
