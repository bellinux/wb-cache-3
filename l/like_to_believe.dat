25|$|Setsuna F. Seiei is {{the primary}} protagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam 00. He was {{discovered}} by Celestial Being {{at the age of}} 16 for having special potential as a pilot. He is a Gundam Meister and pilots Gundam Exia, specialized in melee combat. The group pursues the complete eradication of armed conflict mainly through the deployment of the revolutionary Gundam units in aggressive armed interventions. Setsuna's real name is Soran Ibrahim; with Setsuna being his codename. He was once a child soldier of Krugis descent in the war-torn Krugis Republic. During this time, he murdered his own parents under Ali Al-Saachez's influence in order to prove his devotion to God, and hence bears a deep hatred towards Saachez. Due to his previous religious brainwashing (and awakening from it), Setsuna claims he no longer believes in God, yet still debates the role of God in people's lives, suggesting that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in God. Across the series, Setsuna appears mostly stoic being indifferent to potential love interest such as princess Marina Ismail.|$|E

500|$|If The Love Song of J.

The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that religion." ...|$|E

500|$|After the 2000s, {{the effects}} of poptimism {{attracted}} a belief that once a pop star reaches {{a certain level of}} stardom, many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews. Richards argued that poptimism cheerleads the already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent. New York Times Magazines Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of click-driven internet journalism that aspired to the lowest common denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and film critics. Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: [...] "When [...] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' I imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, [...] "Don't tell them that!" [...] We <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that it never was in the first place." [...] He also noted a minuscule number of lowly-rated albums in publications such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and PopMatters, and that [...] "telling consumers what to purchase is still the point of a lot of music 'criticism'." ...|$|E

For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> these things are true, and showing compassion {{to the people who}} do think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to get money from people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
2500|$|The Twelfth Doctor is, {{according}} to Capaldi, [...] "more alien than he's {{been in a}} while."

Unlike his previous two incarnations who cared about humans and tried to understand them, Capaldi has confirmed that, this incarnation [...] "doesn't quite understand human beings or really care very much about their approval."

Initially it was reported that Capaldi specifically requested that the Doctor will not flirt with his companion the way his previous incarnation did, but the actor stated that he said no such thing and that it was inflated by the media. Steven Moffat has teased that Capaldi's Doctor may perhaps be more in love with Clara than he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> He has also been described as a [...] "total adrenaline junkie" [...] and, {{according to}} Moffat, [...] "much fiercer, madder [...] less reliable".

2500|$|There {{are some}} fairly {{widespread}} {{questions as to}} whether or not the speaker may have a homosexual love interest in his friend the young man. This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to tell if the speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is more to it than that. However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to auto-eroticism. Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea of being alone and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E
