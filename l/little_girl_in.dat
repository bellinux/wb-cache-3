The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|To {{learn about}} the Yeti, which he {{depicted}} as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of On the Trail of Unknown Animals. After re-reading Heuvelmans' description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted the tracks of what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped {{at the foot of}} a rock face on Annapurna. The creature's care for the starving Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in extrasensory perception and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in the story that also fascinated Hergé.|$|E

25|$|The site of {{the mass}} killing of Khojaly {{inhabitants}} was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist Chingiz Mustafayev. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight {{to the scene of}} the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how he looked out of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot in their heads, and the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> her last move was stretching out her hands to her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his camera, but after recovering from the shock started filming. However, the helicopter came under the fire, and they had to leave.|$|E

By using the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> this way, the show transforms what should've been anti-climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline. It's not enough to make the bad parts of the earlier episodes great, but it does show that the writers had more on their mind than stalling." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger felt that albeit predictable, the segment was [...] "well executed".

However, someone broke into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally like the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was a horrifying sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel."

Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II.

500|$|While {{the film}} is shot {{primarily}} in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of {{the highest levels of}} government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. [...] "It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down... the annihilation of European Jewry," [...] he said. [...] "So that was my message in letting that scene be in color." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing [...] "the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance." [...] Professor André H. Caron of the Université de Montréal wonders if the red symbolises [...] "innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
500|$|Cote de Pablo relayed {{that there}} had been a dispute between the {{director}}, Terrence O'Hara, and the actors during filming about how the scene should be choreographed. Both sides thought that it needed to be very intimate, but the director thought that the moment should be drawn out more while de Pablo and Michael Weatherly wanted to keep it brief. Furthermore, the latter two believed that simply looking at each other would be sufficient to convey the message to the audience. Eventually, de Pablo approached O'Hara and said, [...] "Listen, if there was any more time of staring into each other's eyes, it would be like, cut to a hotel room." [...] In an interview, she explained that she and Weatherly played the characters as being at a more vulnerable level than is typical for the show. She likened Tony to a [...] "man Teddy Bear" [...] in the episode; in the Tony-Ziva dynamic, he is normally portrayed as being the more juvenile of the two while Ziva is more mature and worldly. In [...] "Berlin", their roles are largely reversed as more of [...] "the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> Ziva" [...] is shown and as Tony takes charge of the situation while they are dancing.
