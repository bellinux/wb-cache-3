5|$|The {{speed of}} <b>light</b> <b>has</b> become {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions {{of a second}} ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to {{the speed of light}} in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower {{at the speed of light}} through glass.|$|E
5|$|While most marine {{bioluminescence}} {{is green}} to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow.

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As <b>light</b> <b>has</b> a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that <b>light</b> <b>has</b> a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.|$|E
5|$|Friends and comrades, the <b>light</b> <b>has</b> {{gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite {{know what to tell}} you or how to say it.

Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that <b>light</b> <b>has</b> traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

5|$|Several {{condensed}} matter experiments involve {{scattering of}} an experimental probe, such as X-ray, optical photons, neutrons, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe {{depends on the}} observation energy scale of interest. Visible <b>light</b> <b>has</b> energy {{on the scale of}} 1 electron volt (eV) and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as dielectric constant and refractive index. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 keV and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density.|$|E

As of the 2017 ceremony, Bryan Craig is the most recent winner in this category for his portrayal of Morgan Corinthos, on General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible <b>light</b> <b>has</b> too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E

5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the <b>light</b> <b>has</b> been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Ray of Light debuted {{at number}} one on the UK Albums Chart, {{remaining}} at the top spot for two weeks. It was certified six times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 1.8 million copies. In France, the album entered the albums chart at number two, staying there for seven weeks before descending the chart. It was certified three times platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for shipments of 900,000 copies. Actual sales of the album in France stand at 925,400 copies. In Germany, the album reached {{number one on}} the Media Control Charts and remained there for seven weeks. It remains Madonna's best-selling album in Germany with three times platinum certification from Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for shipment of 1.5 million copies. Due to its commercial success in European countries, the album ultimately topped the European Top 100 Albums chart and was certified seven times platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales of seven million copies, becoming the third best selling albums in Europe for the 1998-2007 period. Ray of Light achieved similar success in the rest of world, topping the official charts of Belgium, Netherlands, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Norway, Singapore, Spain and Switzerland. It was the best-selling album from Warner Music company in the Asia-Pacific region during the 1998. In total, Ray of <b>Light</b> <b>has</b> sold over 16 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The <b>light</b> <b>has</b> symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
