50|$|The <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> {{agglutination}} test (LAT) is a {{more sensitive}} method to detect H. influenzae than is culture. Because the method relies on antigen rather than viable bacteria, the results are not disrupted by prior antibiotic use. It also has {{the added benefit of}} being much quicker than culture methods. However, antibiotic sensitivity testing is not possible with LAT alone, so a parallel culture is necessary.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{diagnosis}} of H. influenzae is typically performed by bacterial culture or <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> agglutinations. Diagnosis is considered confirmed when the organism is isolated from a sterile body site. In this respect, H. influenzae cultured from the nasopharyngeal cavity or sputum would not indicate H. influenzae disease, because these sites are colonized in disease-free individuals. However, H. influenzae isolated from cerebrospinal fluid or blood would indicate H. influenzae infection.|$|E

Besides, <b>latex</b> <b>particles</b> were also found to be triterpenes in E. lathyris latex (Skrukrud 1987). Moreover, some reports pointed out that the <b>latex</b> <b>particles</b> were synthesized in vacuoles originated from ER (Fineran 1983; Skrukrud 1987; Cai et al. 2009). Therefore, it can be say that the <b>latex</b> <b>particles</b> are the accumulation site of terpenoid end products in the laticifers, and the mevalonate to terpenoid converting activity is associated with the structure which was identified as a vacuole originated from ER. Based on stated above, we further speculated that as an initial enzyme in MVA pathway for terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, the EhAACT located in cytosol could be transported to small vacuoles originated from ER to synthesize terpenoid backbones. Lastly, the terpenoid was further synthesized into <b>latex</b> <b>particles</b> in these small vacuoles in E. helioscopia laticifers.|$|R

Specimens of amniotic fluid and gastric aspirate from each infant were tested for the presence of GBS antigens with a commercial <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> agglutination test (Wellcogen Strep B; Wellcome Diagnostics, Dartford, England). To eliminate nonspecific <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> agglutination reactivity, presumably caused by proteins, a processing procedure was required.

Both types of the aggregates were highly porous and fractal with fractal dimensions of 2. 13 +/- 0. 31 for the <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> aggregates (1210 - 2144 mu m) and 1. 78 +/- 0. 24 for the AS flocs (1265 - 3737 mu m). The results show that PIV is a powerful flow visualization technique capable of determining flow field details at the micrometer scale around and through settling aggregates and flocs. The PIV streamlines provided direct experimental proof of internal flow through the aggregate interiors. According to the PIV images, fluid collection efficiency ranged from 0. 052 to 0. 174 for the <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> aggregates and from 0. 008 to 0. 126 for AS flocs. AS flocs are apparently less permeable than the particle aggregates, {{probably due to the}} extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) produced by bacteria clogging the pores within the flocs.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is presented of the thermophoresis of latex particles in polar solvents. Expressions for the thermophoretic mobility (TM) of the particles, which consist of polymer solutions emulsified {{in a poor}} solvent {{with the addition of}} salt, are obtained. The model is based on the thermophoresis of polymer chains partitioned between the emulsion droplet and the surrounding solvent. The partitioning is assumed to originate with the 2 ̆ 2 salting in 2 ̆ 2 of monomer units (mers) in the surfactant film that surrounds and stabilizes the <b>latex</b> <b>particle.</b> Correlation between mers then leads to a partitioning of mers between the good solvent inside the <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> and the surrounding poor solvent. Assuming a mer concentration that decays exponentially into the surrounding solvent, the expression for the particle TM is obtained. It is found that, with the increase of the square of the derived dimensionless parameter, the <b>latex</b> <b>particle</b> TM increases from zero to a hypothetical value of the polymer 2 ̆ 7 s TM in the poor solvent. The dimensionless parameter contains the product of mer concentration at the particle surface, the mer radius, and the square of the mean thickness of the mer distribution in the external solvent.
