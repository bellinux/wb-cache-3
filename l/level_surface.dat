5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object on a <b>level</b> <b>surface</b> is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center}} of the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a <b>level</b> <b>surface,</b> and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{federal law}} exempts {{low-speed}} electric bicycles from Dept. of Transportation and NHTSA motor vehicle regulations, {{and they are}} regulated under federal law {{in the same manner}} as ordinary bicycles. The Consumer Product Safety Act defines the term low speed electric bicycle as a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (1 horsepower), whose maximum speed on a paved <b>level</b> <b>surface,</b> when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20mph (15 U.S.C. 2085(b)). At the present time, neither the DOT nor the NHTSA restrict the assembly of e-bikes for use on public roads, although commercially manufactured e-bikes capable of speeds greater than 20mph are considered motor vehicles and thus subject to DOT and NHTSA safety requirements. Consequently, the laws of the individual state and/or local jurisdiction govern the type, motor wattage, and speed capability of e-bikes used on public roadways (see Electric bicycle laws). As long as the bicycle is capable of pedal propulsion, most U.S. states currently do not distinguish between designs that may be self-propelled by the electric motor versus pedal assist designs in which the electric motor assists pedal propulsion by the rider.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new Eulerian tool to study {{complicated}} dynamical systems {{based on the}} average growth in the surface area {{of a family of}} <b>level</b> <b>surfaces</b> represented implicitly by a level set function. Since this proposed quantity determines the temporal variation of the averaged surface area of all <b>level</b> <b>surfaces,</b> we name the quantity the Variation of the Integral over Area of <b>Level</b> <b>Surfaces</b> (VIALS). Numerically, all these infinitely many <b>level</b> <b>surfaces</b> are advected according to the given dynamics by solving one single linear advection equation. To develop a computationally efficient approach, we apply the coarea formula and rewrite the surface area integral as a simple integral relating the total variation (TV) of the level set function. The proposed method can be easily incorporated with a recent Eulerian algorithm for efficient computation of flow maps to speed up our approach. We will also prove that the proposed VIALS is closely related to the computation of the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) in the Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) extraction. This connects our proposed Eulerian approach to widely used Lagrangian techniques for understanding complicated dynamical systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{response}} to thermodynamic driving forces, the domains in microphase-separated block copolymers have distinct intermaterial dividing surfaces (IMDS). Of particular interest are bicontinuous and tricontinuous, triply periodic morphologies and their mathematical representations. <b>Level</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{are represented by}} functions F: R 3 f R of points (x, y, z) 2 R 3, which satisfy the equation F(x, y, z)) t, where t is a constant. <b>Level</b> <b>surfaces</b> make attractive approximations of certain recently computed triply periodic constant mean curvature (cmc) surfaces and they are good starting surfaces to obtain cmc surfaces by mean curvature flow. The functions F(x, y, z) arise from the nonzero structure factors F(hkl) of a particular space group, such that the resulting surfaces are triply periodic and maintain the given symmetries. This approach applies to any space group and can, therefore, yield desired candidate morphologies for novel material structures defined by the IMDS. We present a technique for generating such <b>level</b> <b>surfaces,</b> give new examples, and discuss certain bicontinuous cubic IMDS in detail...|$|R
