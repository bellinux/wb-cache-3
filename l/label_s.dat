40|$|Sustainability {{certification}} {{schemes and}} standards {{are meant to}} prevent a range of unacceptable socioeconomic and environmental consequences, such as threats to biodiversity. While there is wide support for conserving biodiversity, opera- tionalizing this support {{in the form of}} guiding principles, criteria/indicators, and legislation is complicated. This study investigates how and to what extent 26 sustainability standards (eleven for forest management, nine for agriculture and six biofuel-related) consider biodiversity, by assessing how they seek to prevent actions that can threaten biodiversity as well as how they support actions aimed at biodiversity conservation. For this purpose, a benchmark standard was developed, meant to represent a case with very high ambitions concerning biodiversity con- servation. Of the assessed standards, the biofuel-related standards demonstrated the highest level of compliance with the benchmark. On average, they complied with 72 % of the benchmark’s component criteria, compared to 61 % for the agricul- tural standards and 60 % for the forestry standards. Fairtrade, Sustainable Agricul- ture Network/Rainforest Alliance (SAN/RA), Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS) were particularly stringent, while Green Gold <b>Label</b> <b>S</b> 5 (GGLS 5), PEOLG, Global Partnership for Good Agricul- tural Practices (GLOBALGAP), European Union Organic (EU Organic), National Organic Program (NOP), Green Gold <b>Label</b> <b>S</b> 2 (GGLS 2), and International Sus- tainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) were particularly unstringent. All eleven forestry standards, six of the nine agricultural standards, and all six biofuel-related standards addressed ecosystem conversion, ranging from requiring that high con- servation value areas be identified and preserved to requiring full protection. Finally, key barriers to, and challenges for, certification schemes are discussed and recommendations are made for further development of sustainability standards...|$|E

40|$|A {{proof of}} the Riemann’s {{hypothesis}} (RH) about the non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function is presented. It {{is based on the}} construction of an infinite family of operators D (k,l) in one dimension, and their respective eigenfunctions ψs(t), parameterized by continuous real indices k and l. Orthogonality of the eigenfunctions is connected to the zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function. Due to the fundamental Gauss-Jacobi relation and the Riemann fundamental relation Z(s ′) = Z(1 − s ′), one can show that there is a direct concatenation among the following symmetries, t goes to 1 /t, s goes to β − s (β a real), and s ′ goes to 1 − s ′, which establishes a one-to-one correspondence among the <b>label</b> <b>s</b> of the orthogonal states to a unique vacuum state, and the zeroes s ′ of the ζ. It is shown that the RH is a direct consequence of these symmetries, by arguing in particular that an exclusion of a continuum of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function results in the discrete set of the zeroes located at the points sn = 1 / 2 + iλn in the complex plane. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{estimated}} 35 % of {{the human}} proteome is intrinsically disordered. Disordered proteins {{play a key role}} in physiologic and pathologic regulation, recognition, and signaling making protein disorder the subject of increasing investigation. Since disordered samples do not generate x-ray quality crystals and since they have conformations that interconvert faster than the time resolution of NMR or ESR, little is known about their structure or function. By combining isotope-edited two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2 D IR) with spectral modeling based on molecular dynamics simulations, this work will show that one can measure the residual structure and conformational heterogeneity of a putatively disordered sequence. This methodology was first used to study the structure and dynamics of the tryptophan zipper 2 (TZ 2) peptide. The TZ 2 peptide is a 12 residue engineered sequence that employs the "tryptophan zipper" motif to stabilize a p-hairpin fold. For this work five isotopologues of TZ 2 were synthesized, the p-turn label K 8, the midstrand labels T 10 and T 3 T 1 O, the N-terminal <b>label</b> <b>S</b> 1, and the unlabeled peptide UL. Temperature dependent FTIR and 2 D IR studies in conjunction with modeling revealed that the TZ 2 peptide at low temperatures exists as a folded peptide with a type I' turn and a small previously unobserved subpopulation of a bulged loop structure. Upon heating a fraying of the peptides termini is observed, in addition the population of the type I' turn increases relative to the population of the bulged turn. The TZ 2 peptide provided a model hairpin system to test the utility of different forms of analysis and isotope labeling patterns for the subsequent study of disordered hairpin peptides. This methodology was next employed to gain insight into the structure of the elastin-like peptide GVGVPGVG, a prototypical disordered system. For this work nine isotopologues were studied in addition to size dependent variants based on the VPGVG sequence and point mutants variants of the form GVGXPGVG. The conformational ensemble was found to contain a high population of irregular P-turns possessing two peptide hydrogen bonds to the proline C=O (see figure below). Further, it was found that this population grows as a function of 1) side-chain volume for the peptide series GVGXPGVG, where X = Gly, Ala, and Val, and 2) polymer size for the peptide series GVG(VPGVG) a, where n = 1 - 6 and 251. These findings provide new insight into the molecular origin of the mechanical properties of biopolymers containing XPG turns including collagen (X = Pro), elastin (X = Val), mussel byssus (X = Gly), dragline spider silk (X = Gly), and wheat glutenin (X = Gln). `by Joshua Lessing.
