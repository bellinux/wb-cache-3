5|$|Prior to Dystopias recording, {{longtime}} drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick {{announced their}} {{departure from the}} band. It is the first album by the band since 2004's The System Has Failed not to feature the former, and the first not to feature the latter since 2007's United Abominations. These roles have been filled by Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and Angra guitarist Kiko <b>Loureiro,</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|During March 2015, several {{rock music}} news {{websites}} speculated that Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler would perform drums on the album, which was later {{confirmed by the}} band. It was also announced in the same month that Angra guitarist Kiko <b>Loureiro</b> joined the band. Mustaine revealed a track listing for the then-untitled album on July 27 and announced production of the album was completed a month later.|$|E
5|$|Dystopia has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, and holds a Metacritic rating of 69/100. Commending the band's {{return to a}} more aggressive style, Calum Slingerland of Exclaim! wrote that Dystopia put the band back on track and started {{a new chapter in}} the band's storied career. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe liked the combination of energetic riffs and cynical lyrics {{about the state of the}} world. Loudwires Chad Bowar said Dystopia was a first-rate Megadeth album and praised the interplay between Mustaine and <b>Loureiro.</b>|$|E

5|$|More new lands were {{opening up}} to European colonial powers, the botanical riches being {{returned}} to European botanists for description. This was a romantic era of botanical explorers, intrepid plant hunters and gardener-botanists. Significant botanical collections came from: the West Indies (Hans Sloane (1660–1753)); China (James Cunningham); the spice islands of the East Indies (Moluccas, George Rumphius (1627–1702)); China and Mozambique (João de <b>Loureiro</b> (1717–1791)); West Africa (Michel Adanson (1727–1806)) who devised his own classification scheme and forwarded a crude theory of the mutability of species; Canada, Hebrides, Iceland, New Zealand by Captain James Cook's chief botanist Joseph Banks (1743–1820).|$|E
5|$|The band {{encountered}} several setbacks {{through the}} second half of 2014. The August concert in Tel Aviv was canceled due to an armed conflict between Israel and Gaza. Megadeth was scheduled to appear on Motörhead's Motörboat cruise in late September, but withdrew because of Mustaine's complications following his cervical spine surgery. In late November, Drover quit the band after ten years, wanting to pursue his own musical interests. This was quickly followed by the departure of Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences. Ellefson denied rumors that Megadeth would disband, and said he and Mustaine would continue working on new music. Mustaine said {{that one of the reasons}} for Broderick's and Drover's departure was the frustration caused by Megadeth's fan base demanding a reunion with Friedman and Menza. Tragically, former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza died from a heart attack on May 21, 2016 while performing with OHM at a jazz club in Los Angeles. Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Kiko <b>Loureiro</b> of Angra were brought in to perform on Megadeth's fifteenth studio album.|$|E

5000|$|Musa coccinea was {{described}} by Andrews in 1799. M. uranoscopos Lour. (an illegitimate name) is often incorrectly given as a synonym. <b>Loureiro's</b> 1790 account is confused. He refers to an illustration in Rumphius' 1747 Herbarium Amboinense, hence {{this is the type}} of his name. However, this illustration had previously been used in Linnaeus' description of M. troglodytarum, so M. uranoscopos Lour. is a superfluous name for M. troglodytarum. <b>Loureiro's</b> description [...] of M. coccinea; however the type rather than the description determines the synonymity, so M. uranoscopos Lour. is not a synonym of M. coccinea.|$|R
25|$|During mid-2000 Angra split, parting {{ways with}} vocalist Andre Matos who took bassist Luis Mariutti and drummer Ricardo Confessori with him.

500|$|A more {{moderate}} {{opinion of the}} album came from Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound. Hadusek called the album [...] "worthy of bearing [...] name," [...] but criticized several aspects of the release. He opined that <b>Loureiro's</b> playing was largely [...] "cold, calculated and emotionless," [...] and suggested that Mustaine's lyrics form [...] "a loose concept album of post-capitalist suspicions, X-Files conspiracies, and pseudo-Libertarian rhetoric." ...|$|R

At Bologna, Pisa, Naples and numerous other Italian cities, they freely exercised the Jewish religion again. They were soon so numerous that Fernando de Goes <b>Loureiro,</b> an abbot from Oporto, filled an entire book with the names of conversos who had drawn large sums from Portugal and had openly avowed Judaism in Italy.|$|E

500|$|Asked {{about any}} further Big Four gigs, Mustaine called for [...] "the powers-that-be" [...] {{to help put}} {{together}} a new Big Four tour in 2017 as all the respective bands were promoting new albums. Dystopias title track won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 2017 Grammy Awards, the band's first win after 12 nominations. Mustaine, <b>Loureiro,</b> Ellefson and Verbeuren attended the ceremony however album drummer and award recipient Chris Adler did not. While accepting the award, the house band played Mustaine's former band Metallica's [...] "Master of Puppets" [...] causing some controversy among fans.|$|E
500|$|In May 2015, {{the band}} posted several videos clips on PledgeMusic {{featuring}} snippets of new songs, titled [...] "The Emperor" [...] and [...] "Conquer... or Die". One song, [...] "Poisonous Shadows," [...] was stated by Mustaine to feature piano parts performed by <b>Loureiro.</b> Additionally, {{he indicated that}} it would include orchestral arrangement by Ronn Huff, father of record producer Dann Huff who worked with the band in the late 1990s. It was also announced that the album would feature a guest appearance from country musician Steve Wariner, who would perform steel guitar parts. However, neither Huff nor Wariner were credited in the album's liner notes.|$|E
500|$|After an {{international}} break of nearly two weeks, Benfica returned to competition on 10 September with a Lisbon Derby against Sporting CP. Koeman played the same 3–4–3 as before, selecting Carlitos for the starting 11 {{in place of}} Nuno Gomes. Sporting scored first through Luís <b>Loureiro</b> in the first half, but Simão equalized with a free-kick on the second half. In the 75th minute, Liédson made the score 2–1 against a ten-man Benfica, ultimately winning the match for Sporting. With two losses and a draw in three match-days, Koeman broke a club record for the worst season start in history, already eight points {{from the top of}} the league. Four days later, Benfica made their seasonal European debut in the Champions League against Lille. The match was well fought between both teams, with Fabrizio Miccoli scoring a winning goal for Benfica in the 92nd minute. Koeman later said in the post-match interview, [...] "We deserved this win because we search for it". On 18 September, Benfica hosted União de Leiria; Koeman reverted to the 4–2–3–1 formation that Giovanni Trapattoni regularly used. Benfica won 4–0 in the largest win all season, with Nuno Gomes netting a hat-trick. Koeman classified the formation as [...] "ideal," [...] and sid he wanted to use it more often in the future. The following Saturday, Benfica played on the road against Penafiel. A strong start put Benfica in the lead by 2–0 in the first 15 minutes, and despite conceding a goal, they woth the match 3–1. Koeman attributed the win to the good momentum that Fabrizio Miccoli–Nuno Gomes were passing. On 27 September, Benfica travelled to Old Trafford to play Manchester United on the second match-day of the Champions League. United scored first through a Ryan Giggs free-kick that deflected off the wall; Simão levelled the score in the second half—also on a free kick—but United responded with a winning goal in the 85th-minute through Ruud van Nistelrooy.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Kory Grow {{declared}} that Megadeth [...] "sound reborn" [...] {{on the album}} and said the band has [...] "rarely sounded tighter or more cutting." [...] Grow also stated that despite the [...] "grim" [...] lyrical themes of conspiracies and impending doom, Mustaine managed to insert some humor into the album, citing lyrics from [...] "The Emperor." [...] John Semley of Now called Dystopia [...] "a great record" [...] and praised <b>Loureiro's</b> playing on the record. Semley argued that despite the album's plusses, however, it would likely be overshadowed by Metallica's followup to 2008's Death Magnetic, tentatively due for a 2016 release.

50|$|Boavista has a {{reputation}} in Portugal and, to some extent abroad, as an attacking team, playing hard-fought matches, even in defeat. One shining {{example of this is}} the 2001 Portuguese title, during the golden João <b>Loureiro's</b> presidency, where the team was the best defense in terms of goals conceded, at the same time having one of the best attacks of the competition. It was only the second time a team other than the Big Three managed to win the title. The other was C.F. Os Belenenses back in the 1945-46 season. This style was mainly the brainchild of coach Jaime Pacheco. With his departure for RCD Mallorca in 2003, the team started to play less attractive football {{over the next two years}} and their results began to decline. Pacheco returned but their image only started to change when Pacheco was replaced by Carlos Brito for 2005-06. Ironically, he came back to replace sacked Željko Petrović in October 2006, who in turn was a late replacement for Porto-bound Jesualdo Ferreira, who departed before the first matchday.|$|R
