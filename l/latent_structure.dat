40|$|Abstract Multivariate {{statistical}} {{process monitoring}} (MSPM) is an efficient data-driven fault detection and diagnosis approach for complex industrial processes. Partial least squares or projection to <b>latent</b> <b>structures</b> (PLS) {{is one of}} the <b>latent</b> projection <b>structures</b> used in MSPM, which uses process data X and quality data Y together. In this paper, we discuss a new fault diagnosis approach based on total projection to <b>latent</b> <b>structures</b> (T-PLS). Four kinds of monitoring statistics are used in T-PLS, and a new definition of variable contributions to T 2 of PLS is proposed. Then, definitions of variable contributions to all statistics are derived to identify the faults. Control limits for contribution plots are calculated to identify whether a variable is in abnormal situation or not. Further, the proposed method separates the identified variables into faulty variables related to Y and unrelated to Y more clearly than conventional method. A case study on Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) indicates the efficiency of the proposed approach.

40|$|Inferring <b>latent</b> <b>structures</b> from {{observations}} {{helps to}} model and possibly also understand underlying data generating processes. A rich class of <b>latent</b> <b>structures</b> are hierarchical <b>latent</b> class (HLC) models. Zhang (2004) proposed a search algorithm for learning such models that can find good solutions but is often computationally expensive. As an alternative we investigate two greedy procedures: the BIN-G algorithm determines both {{the structure of}} the tree and the cardinality of the latent variables in a bottom-up fashion. The BIN-A algorithm first determines the tree structure using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and then determines the cardinality of the latent variables as for BIN-G. We show that even with restricting ourselves to binary trees we obtain HLC models of comparable quality to Zhang‘s solutions, while being faster to compute. This claim is validated by a comprehensive comparison on several datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods are able to estimate int erpretable <b>latent</b> <b>structures</b> on real-world data with a large number of variables. By applying our method to a restricted version of the 20 newsgroups data these models turn out to be related to topic models, and on data from the PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) 2007 challenge we show how such tree-structured models help us understand how objects co-occur in images...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>latent</b> <b>structure</b> of a {{flashbulb}} {{memory is}} taxonic, and qualitatively distinct from non-flashbulb memories.

This follows the idea that flashbulb memories are a recollection of [...] "event-specific sensory-perceptual details" [...] and are much different from other known autobiographical memories. Ordinary memories show a dimensional structure that involves all levels of autobiographical knowledge, whereas flashbulb memories appear to come from a more densely integrated region of autobiographical knowledge. Flashbulb memories and non-flashbulb memories also differ qualitatively and not just quantitatively. Flashbulb memories are considered a form of autobiographical memory but involve the activation of episodic memory, where as everyday memories are a semantic form of recollections. Being a form of autobiographical recollections flashbulb memories are deeply determined by the reconstructive processes of memory, and just like any other form of memory are prone to decay.|$|E

Index formations and qualitative mathematics were subjects taught by Lazarsfeld and are important components of the GT method according to Glaser.

5000|$|Much in {{the same}} line, it has been {{pointed out that the}} {{decisions}} based on the analysis of big data are inevitably [...] "informed by the world {{as it was in the}} past, or, at best, as it currently is". [...] Fed by a large number of data on past experiences, algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past. If the systems dynamics of the future change (if it is not a stationary process), the past can say little about the future. In order to make predictions in changing environments, it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic, which requires theory. [...] As a response to this critique it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations, such as agent-based models and Complex Systems. Agent-based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms. In addition, use of multivariate methods that probe for the <b>latent</b> <b>structure</b> of the data, such as factor analysis and cluster analysis, have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi-variate approaches (cross-tabs) typically employed with smaller data sets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In data-based {{monitoring}} field, the nonlinear iter-ative partial {{least squares}} procedure {{has been a}} useful tool for process data modeling, which is also the foundation of projection to <b>latent</b> <b>structures</b> (PLS) models. To describe the dynamic processes properly, a dynamic PLS algorithm is proposed in this paper for dynamic process modeling, which captures the dynamic correlation between the measurement block and quality data block. For the purpose of process monitoring, a dynamic total PLS (T-PLS) model is presented to decompose the measurement block into four subspaces. The new model is the dynamic extension of the T-PLS model, which is efficient for detecting quality-related abnormal situation. Several examples are given to show the effectiveness of dynamic T-PLS models and the corresponding fault detection methods.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the <b>latent</b> <b>structure</b> of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is essential for developing causal models of this disorder. Although some researchers have presumed that ADHD is dimensional and others have assumed that it is taxonic, there has been relatively little research directly examining the <b>latent</b> <b>structure</b> of ADHD. The authors conducted a set of taxometric analyses {{using data from the}} NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (ns between 667 – 1078). The results revealed a dimensional <b>latent</b> <b>structure</b> across a variety of different analyses and sets of indicators, for inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and ADHD. Furthermore, analyses of correlations with associated features indicated that dimensional models demonstrated stronger validity coefficients with these criterion measures than dichotomous models.
