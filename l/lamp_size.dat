40|$|The {{lighting}} {{industry is}} driven to provide light sources and lighting systems that, when properly applied, {{will produce a}} suitable luminous environment in which to perform a specified task. Tasks may include everything from office work, manufacturing and inspection to viewing priceless art objects, selecting the right chair for your living room, and deciding which produce item to select for tonight's dinner. While energy efficiency is a major consideration in any new lighting system design, the sacrifice of lighting quality may cost {{more in terms of}} lost productivity and user dissatisfaction than can ever be saved on that monthly energy bill. During the past several years, many new light sources have been developed and introduced. These product introductions have not been limited to anyone lamp type, but instead may be found in filament, fluorescent and high intensity discharge lamp families. Manufacturers of light sources have two basic goals for new product development. These goals are high efficiency lighting and improved color rendering properties. High efficiency lighting may take the form of either increasing lamp efficiency (lumens of light delivered per watt of power consumed) or decreasing <b>lamp</b> <b>size,</b> thus making a more easily controlled light source that places light where it is needed. The manufacturer's second goal is to produce lamps that render colors accurately while maintaining high efficiency. This paper will discuss new introductions in light sources and lighting systems and how they may impact the design of luminous environments of the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy crisis}} of the early seventies has had a drastic {{influence}} on both the application and development of light sources. This situation has forced us to examine old methods and search for new answers for improved efficiency. We can no longer operate {{on the premise that}} more is better. At lower light levels a lighting design is less forgiving. The current thrust in lamp and luminare design has been high efficiency. Tremendous effort has been expended to produce energy efficient sources that deliver better color, improved optical control, and reduced <b>lamp</b> <b>size.</b> Given that we must operate in this arena of heightened energy awareness and that lighting, by its very nature, becomes a prime candidate for reduction, we must not lose sight of the fundamental reason for lighting to provide the ability for us to see details to perform specific tasks. The heart of an industrial plant is the production area. A myriad of tasks must be accomplished. Lighting is installed for humans, not machines. The eye can only adapt to a degree and accommodate a variety of conditions; i. e., color, texture, etc. Higher light levels are required as an individual?s age increases. It has also been confirmed in many studies that light levels directly affect performance. People who have sufficient quantity and quality of illumination can accomplish their work faster and more accurately. A delicate balance lies between energy efficient lighting and under and over-lit spaces. This balance is with the fundamental lighting goal. Any formula to maintain this balance should include two vital factors: First, light output for levels and quality determined by proper task analysis and second, control by design which utilizes the best source and equipment available...|$|E

The electronic load cell device developed for measurement of HLU behavior of piglets could accurately and automatically record the number of piglets utilizing the heat lamp for the entire trial period, but it could not determine the lying patterns of the piglets;Dynamic HLU of piglets exposed to 250 W, 175 W, or 125 W heat lamps was measured during four production seasons. The results indicated that there was a consistent circadian pattern in HLU for all the heat lamps tested. HLU was significantly higher during the day than at night. The dynamic HLU behavior was greatly affected by the heat <b>lamp</b> <b>size.</b> The 175 W heat lamp produces the best piglet resting pattern. The thermal needs of neonatal piglets declines with increasing age;The effects of the lamp output and color on piglet behavior and performance were evaluated at two air temperatures of 18 (± 1. 5) °C and 27 (± 1. 5) °C, respectively. The {{results indicate that the}} variable-output lamp is more suitable for swine farrowing operation. Compared with the constant-output lamp, the variable-output lamp would yield an annual energy savings of 29 (@ 0. 10 /kWh and 88 % of usage).

The ambient temperature in farrowing unit significantly affects heat lamp usage of the piglets;A mathematical model describing the thermal interactions between the environment and piglets was developed. The model predictions indicated that the heat lamp need of piglets was affected by the piglet age and ambient temperature, and the ambient temperature was the most important factor affected the heat lamp needs of piglets. The heat lamp needs of piglets was gradually decreasing with age and the average decreasing of heat lamp needs of piglets was 1 W per day, the decreasing of heat lamp needs of piglets was sharp as 10. 5 W/°C with ambient temperature.

40|$|Fluorescent lamps are {{the most}} widely used {{artificial}} light source today, responsible for approximately 70 % of the lumens delivered to our living spaces globally. The technology was originally commercialized in the 1930 's, and manufacturers have been steadily improving the efficacy of these lamps over the years through modifications to the phosphors, cathodes, fill-gas, operating frequency, tube diameter and other design attributes. The most efficient commercially available fluorescent lamp is the 25 Watt T 5 lamp. This lamp operates at 114 - 116 lumens per watt while also providing good color rendering and more than 20, 000 hours of operating life. Industry experts interviewed indicated that while this lamp is the most efficient in the market today, there is still a further 10 to 14 % of potential improvements that may be introduced to the market over the next 2 to 5 years. These improvements include further developments in phosphors, fill-gas, cathode coatings and ultraviolet (UV) reflective glass coatings. The commercialization of these technology improvements will combine to bring about efficacy improvements that will push the technology up to a maximum 125 to 130 lumens per watt. One critical issue raised by researchers that may present a barrier to the realization of these improvements is the fact that technology investment in fluorescent lamps is being reduced in order to prioritize research into light emitting diodes (LEDs) and ceramic metal halide high intensity discharge (HID) lamps. Thus, it is uncertain whether these potential efficacy improvements will be developed, patented and commercialized. The emphasis for premium efficacy will continue to focus on T 5 lamps, which are expected to continue to be marketed along with the T 8 lamp. Industry experts highlighted the fact that an advantage of the T 5 lamp {{is the fact that it}} is 40 % smaller and yet provides an equivalent lumen output to that of a T 8 or T 12 lamp. Due to its smaller form factor, the T 5 lamp contains less material (i. e., glass, fill gas and phosphor), and has a higher luminance, enabling fixtures to take advantage of the smaller <b>lamp</b> <b>size</b> to improve the optics and provide more efficient overall system illuminance. In addition to offering the market a high-quality efficacious light source, another strong value proposition of fluorescent lighting is its long operating life. In today's market, one manufacturer is offering fluorescent lamps that have a rated life of 79, 000 hours - which represents 18 years of service at 12 hours per day, 365 days per year. These lamps, operated using a long-life ballast specified by the manufacturer, take advantage of improvements in cathode coatings, fill gas chemistry and pressure to extend service life by a factor of four over conventional fluorescent lamps. It should be noted that this service life is also longer (approximately twice as long) as today's high-quality LED products. The fluorescent market is currently focused on the T 5 and T 8 lamp diameters, and it is not expected that other diameters would be introduced. Although T 8 is a more optimal diameter from an efficacy perspective, the premium efficiency and optimization effort has been focused on T 5 lamps because they are 40 % smaller than T 8, and are designed to operate at a higher temperature using high-frequency electronic ballasts. The T 5 lamp offers savings in terms of materials, packaging and shipping, as well as smaller fixtures with improved optical performance. Manufacturers are actively researching improvements in four critical areas that are expected to yield additional efficacy improvements of approximately 10 to 14 percent over the next five years, ultimately achieving approximately 130 lumens per watt by 2015. The active areas of research where these improvements are anticipated include: (1) Improved phosphors which continue to be developed and patented, enabling higher efficacies as well as better color rendering and lumen maintenance; (2) Enhanced fill gas - adjusting proportions of argon, krypton, neon and xenon to optimize performance, while also minimizing the mercury dose; (3) Improved cathode coatings to enhance electron emissivity and extend lamp life; and (4) UV-reflective glass coatings deposited between the layer of phosphor and the glass tube, to reflect any UV light back into the phosphor layer for down-conversion...|$|E
25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial <b>lamp</b> <b>sizes,</b> to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products.

The first has an output of 308 μ and the second emits at 121 μ. The same technique {{can be used to}} generate light at the full range of excimer wavelengths including 157, 193 and 248 μ. TuiLaser hopes to be selling the product by year_end. This is a short news story only. Visit www. three-fives. com for the latest advanced semiconductor industry news...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{solar cells}} were {{prepared}} {{in large numbers}} using roll-to-roll methods and were subsequently integrated into the Organic Electronics Association (OE-A) demonstrator in the year 2011 and presented as a small credit card <b>sized</b> <b>lamp</b> with a flat outline. The lamp comprised the polymer solar cell together with printed circuitry, discrete components and flexible lithium polymer batteries. The number of discrete steps required for the manufacture of the lamp was 35 and more than 10000 units of the demonstrator was manufactured. We describe the efforts towards increasing the technical yield which was 89 % overall and discuss the compromises {{that had to be}} made to achieve the high technical yield for a process that was as automated as possible. All the steps in the preparation of the solar cell, the circuitry and the overlays were performed using full roll-to-roll methods. The mounting of the discrete components, such as LED, diode and Zener diode, was performed in sheets of 15 units using a fully automated SMD mounting machine. The mounting of the batteries, contacts and final testing was done manually. The lamination into the final lamp and the final laser cutting into the discrete lamps were performed using automated systems. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
5000|$|... 3rd {{generation}} of Retro-Fit LED tubesThe so-called 3rd generation LED tubes {{currently on the}} market resolve the insufficient luminosity problem characteristic to their 1st and 2nd generation counterparts. Since the light emitted by LED tubes is beam-like, the performance (measured in lx) of LED tubes as compared to fluorescent <b>lamps</b> of comparable <b>size</b> has also significantly depended on luminaire placement and optics. Some luminaire frames reflect the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides quite well, while others waste almost all but the light emitted downwards. Especially 1st and 2nd generation LED tubes of lesser luminous power failed to match the performance of fluorescent lamps if the luminaire included wide optics with good reflecting characteristics and only accommodated a single fluorescent/LED tube. Such luminaires are capable of maximizing redirection of the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides back into the room. In case of 3rd generation LED tubes, efforts {{have been made to}} solve this problem by increasing their luminous power, so that it would be sufficient under any circumstances, regardless of the luminaire. As a result, however, the tube surface brightness surpasses that of fluorescent lamps, and in some cases, individual bright LED components can have a disturbing effect. Today, several manufacturers offer 3rd generation LED tubes, but the excessive luminous power is generally accompanied by increased electricity consumption.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found that radar returns of {{extended}} targets are not only sparse but also exhibit a tendency to cluster into randomly located, variable sized groups. However, the standard techniques of Compressive Sensing as applied in radar imaging hardly considers the clustering tendency into account while reconstructing the image from the compressed measurements. If the group sparsity is taken into account, it is intuitive that one might obtain better results both in terms of accuracy and time complexity as compared to the conventional recovery techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). In order to remedy this, techniques like Block OMP have been used in the existing literature. An alternate approach is via reconstructing the signal by transforming into the Hough Transform Domain where they become point-wise sparse. However, these techniques essentially assume specific size and structure of the groups and are not always effective if the exact characteristics of the groups are not known, prior to reconstruction. In this manuscript, a novel framework that we call locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) have been proposed for efficient reconstruction of group sparse signals from compressed measurements without assuming any specific size, location, or structure of the groups. The recovery guarantee of the LAMP and its superiority compared to the existing algorithms has been established with respect to accuracy, time complexity and flexibility in group <b>size.</b> <b>LAMP</b> has been successfully used on a real-world, experimental data set.

5000|$|Mipham {{also wrote}} {{extensively}} about astrology which was, in his words, a [...] "delightful game" [...] that he mastered {{in his teens}} but later applied to more serious topics such as medicine; these two topics, with various texts on more or less related topics of divination, occupy perhaps 2,000 pages of his writing. An entire volume of Mipham's is devoted to Ju-thig or divination using knots, a method that might be termed [...] "Bon" [...] in origin, {{for want of a}} more accurate term; this may have been the legacy of his family, who were doctors for several generations. Throughout his writings there are many resources for divination, in addition to astrology, including several rituals for looking in mirrors (pra-mo), one using dice (mo), pulling different-length 'arrows' (Wylie: da dar) out of a quiver and so on, compelling a non-human [...] "bird" [...] to whisper future news in one's ear, and so on. In one short text he prescribes various methods of divination (all drawn, Mipham emphasizes, from Tantric scriptures and commentaries) that make use of unusual sources of augury such as: the vicariously overheard chatter of women; sudden appearance of various animals, especially birds; weather phenomena; the shape, size and color of flames in the agnihotra or fire puja; the quality of burning butter <b>lamps,</b> especially the <b>size</b> of the flame, the amount and shape of smoke that arises; and {{the size and shape of}} the carbon deposit on the wick.|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} field of a packed-bed photocatalytic reactor filled with quartz wool coated with titanium dioxide was modeled using the Monte Carlo technique {{and the following}} information: the radiation flux emitted by the <b>lamps,</b> the diameter <b>size</b> distribution of the quartz fiber cloth, the mass of quartz fibers and of TiO 2 that was immobilized on the fiber surface {{as well as the}} refractive index and the spectral absorption coefficient of the materials of the system. Modeling predictions were validated with radiometer measurements of the transmitted radiation through the reactor, the root mean square error being < 9. 7 %. Finally, by means of a parametric study, the validated model was used to analyze the effect of the design variables: the radii of the quartz fibers, thickness of the TiO 2 coatings, and amount of TiO 2 coated quartz wool, on the distribution and nonuniformity of the radiative energy distribution inside the reactor.
