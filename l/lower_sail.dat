60|$|Rasmunsen {{replied with}} an idiotic grin. The iron-bound shores {{were in a}} lather of foam, and even down the middle the only hope was to keep running away from the big seas. To <b>lower</b> <b>sail</b> was to be {{overtaken}} and swamped. Time and again they passed boats pounding among the rocks, and once they saw one {{on the edge of}} the breakers about to strike. A little craft behind them, with two men, jibed over and turned bottom up.|$|E
60|$|A grunt succeeded, which Mark scarce {{knew how}} to interpret. It might mean dissatisfaction, or it might mean surprise. As the captain, however, was {{thoroughly}} awake, and was making his preparations {{to come out on}} deck, he thought that he had done all that duty required, and he returned to his own post. The after-part of the ship was now the best situation for watching, and Mark went up on the poop, in order to see and hear the better. No <b>lower</b> <b>sail</b> being in the way, he could look ahead almost as well from that position as if he were forward; and as for hearing, it was much the best place of the two, in consequence of there being no wash of the sea directly beneath him, as was the case when stationed between the knight-heads. To this post he soon summoned Bob Betts, who belonged to his watch, and with whom he had ever kept up as great an intimacy as the difference in their stations would allow.|$|E

6000|$|Tamasese boats as {{they passed}} Matautu were {{in the habit of}} firing on the shore, as like as not without {{particular}} aim, and more in high spirits than hostility. One of these shots pierced the house of a British subject near the consulate; the consul reported to Admiral Fairfax; and, {{on the morning of the}} 10th, the admiral despatched Captain Kane of the Calliope to Mulinuu. Brandeis met the messenger with voluble excuses and engagements for the future. He was told his explanations were satisfactory so far as they went, but that the admiral's message was to Tamasese, the de facto king. Brandeis, not very well assured of his puppet's courage, attempted in vain to excuse him from appearing. No de facto king, no message, he was told: produce your de facto king. And Tamasese had at last to be produced. To him Kane delivered his errand: that the Lizard was to remain for the protection of British subjects; that a signalman was to be stationed at the consulate; that, on any further firing from boats, the signalman was to notify the Lizard and she to fire one gun, on which all boats must <b>lower</b> <b>sail</b> and come alongside for examination and the detection of the guilty; and that, [...] "in the event of the boats not obeying the gun, the admiral would not be responsible for the consequences." [...] It was listened to by Brandeis and Tamasese [...] "with the greatest attention." [...] Brandeis, when it was done, desired his thanks to the admiral for the moderate terms of his message, and, as Kane went to his boat, repeated the expression of his gratitude as though he meant it, declaring his own hands would be thus strengthened for the maintenance of discipline. But I have yet to learn of any gratitude on the part of Tamasese. Consider the case of the poor owlish man hearing for the first time our diplomatic commonplaces. The admiral would not be answerable for the consequences. Think of it! A devil of a position for a de facto king. And here, the same afternoon, was Leary in the Scanlon house, mopping it out for unknown designs by the hands of an old woman, and proffering strange threats of bloodshed. Scanlon and his pigs, the admiral and his gun, Leary and his bombardment,--what a kettle of fish! ...|$|E
50|$|The {{rule was}} {{designed}} to favour heavy cruising boats with <b>lower</b> <b>sail</b> areas, dissuading more extreme racing yachts coming in to Channel Handicap. It was also designed to use the minimum number of measurements, in contrast to both the IOR and IMS, and to have owners measure their own boats, to make it simple and economic to implement.|$|E
50|$|The nearest {{land was}} the Azores 90 mi to the west, but with crude {{navigation}} in lifeboats {{there was too}} great a risk of missing the islands and continuing out into the Atlantic. Therefore, the boats sailed east together, aiming for mainland Portugal 600 mi to the east. At nightfall the boats' commanders disagreed {{as to what to}} do. Tallack wanted all boats to <b>lower</b> <b>sail</b> and heave to with their sea anchors to allow survivors to rest. Anson and Reid with boats 2 and 6 chose to continue east, leaving boats 1 and 4 with the motor boat No. 8. On 7 July boats 1, 4 and 8 again began to east together, but Tallack soon became concerned for the condition of his wounded survivors. After consultation he and No. 8 boat therefore left boats 1 and 4 together and sailed east as quickly as possible.|$|E

5000|$|According to Sheldon, the squall {{hitting the}} Albatross {{was a white}} squall, i.e. an unpredictably sudden, very strong squall. His opinion was that the Albatross was {{essentially}} a stable, [...] "safe" [...] ship, and that the crew of teenagers—who had already spent about eight months on board—were sufficiently trained, but that this rare weather phenomenon left the ship no chance. Critics of this view, however, have argued that refittings of the Albatross {{over the years by}} her various owners had made her top heavy, which affected her secondary stability, that is, her ability to remain stable or even right herself after tilting to the side, as opposed to capsizing. In her times as North Sea pilot schooner, the ship had a far smaller and <b>lower</b> <b>sail</b> area, which means that the force of the wind did not have as much power and as powerful an angle as it did the day she sank. Almost 40 years after the loss of the Albatross, Daniel S. Parrott reanalyzed some of the documents about the ship and comparable ships in his book, Tall Ships Down. He suggested that due to the ship's impaired stability, even a [...] "normal" [...] squall could have sunk her; according to him, only the expert handling of the ship and the habitual prudence of the ship's captain(s) to reduce sail area early had prevented the refitted Albatross from capsizing in previous strong wind conditions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new concept of {{creating}} artificial equilibrium points in the circular restricted three body problem, where the third body uses a hybrid of solar sail and solar electric propulsion. The work aims to investigate {{the use of a}} hybrid sail for artificial equilibrium points that are technologically di±cult with either of these propulsion systems alone. The hybrid sail has freedom in specifying the sail lightness number, then minimizing the required thrust acceleration from the solar electric propulsion thruster while satisfying the equilibrium condition. The stability analysis of such artificial equilibrium points by a linear method results in a linear time varying (mass) system. The freezing time method then provides unstable and marginally stable regions for hybrid solar sail artificial equilibria. We compare these propulsion systems with a given payload mass and mission life for a polar observation mission. For a near term sail assembly loading we find for the hybrid sail a substantially lower propellant mass compared to solar electric propulsion and <b>lower</b> <b>sail</b> length with respect to a solar sail, and a lower initial spacecraft mass...|$|E
60|$|It {{was evident}} that the display of the heavy metal carried by the Indiaman was an {{unpleasant}} surprise to the privateers. Both <b>lowered</b> <b>sail</b> and ceased firing, and there was then a rapid exchange of signals between them.|$|R
60|$|Several boats hurtled {{past them}} in the next half-hour,--small boats, boats of their own size, boats afraid, unable to do aught but run madly on. Then a ten-ton barge, at {{imminent}} risk of destruction, <b>lowered</b> <b>sail</b> to windward and lumbered down upon them.|$|R
60|$|Jorgenson {{pointed at}} the mass of praus, {{coasting}} boats, and sampans that, jammed up together in the canal, lay covered with mats and flooded by the cold moonlight with {{here and there a}} dim lantern burning amongst the confusion of high sterns, spars, masts and <b>lowered</b> <b>sails.</b>|$|R
60|$|As usual, Sunday and Demetrios Contos arrived together.

50|$|The {{division}} of a sail into upper and <b>lower</b> <b>sails</b> {{was a matter}} of practicality, since undivided sails were larger and, consequently, more difficult to handle. Larger sails necessitated hiring, and paying, a larger crew. Additionally, the great size of some late-19th and 20th century vessels meant that their correspondingly large sails would have been impossible to handle had they not been divided.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on, a moment, sir, until I can {{get this}} awkward glass to bear on it.--Ay--now I have her--she's but a speck, at the best--royals and head of top-gallant-sails--no, sir, by George, it's our own cutter, the Active, with her square-sail set, and the heads of her <b>lower</b> <b>sails</b> just rising. I know her {{by the way she}} carries her gaff." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{went forward}} {{and led the}} halliards to the winch, but {{they would have had}} trouble in setting the partly <b>lowered</b> <b>sail</b> if the {{schooner}} had not come up into the wind and relieved the strain on it. By degrees they heaved up the gaff and peaked it, after which they went aft, as the vessel plowed faster over the falling sea.|$|R
5000|$|By {{eliminating}} the battens and associated batten cars, the material cost savings {{for a typical}} 60-ft catamaran can {{be as much as}} $12,000 AUD. [...] Aft-mast rigs with no mainsail also require fewer winches to raise and <b>lower</b> <b>sails,</b> and no winches to move the boom. When [...] "Hot Buoys" [...] converted from a Bermuda rig to an aft-mast rig 5 winches were no longer required.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} to go under the easiest sail possible. The brig can go two feet to this craft's one, and you will only want your <b>lower</b> <b>sails.</b> If you put on more you will be running ahead and losing us at night. We shall show a light over our stern, and on no account are you to allow yourselves to lose sight of it." ...|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, {{they were}} fast {{coming up with}} the light, and when a high, dark wall ran out in front Wyndham luffed the boat and they <b>lowered</b> <b>sail</b> and took down the mast. Marston sculled her past the wall, and the narrow harbor opened up. A few anchor lights swung languidly inside, and the indistinct, dark shape of a steamer shut out part of the wall. When they got near her Marston stopped sculling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Therein he differeth {{from most}} men--and {{to own the}} truth, son Luis, not without some show of reason. He is a navigator, as thou wilt understand, and he replies that, on the ocean, when a ship is seen from afar, her upper sails are first perceived, and that as she draweth nearer, her <b>lower</b> <b>sails,</b> and finally her hull cometh into view. But thou hast been over sea, and may have {{observed}} something of this?" ...|$|R

You see, {{when she gets}} into the trough between these great waves, the <b>lower</b> <b>sails</b> are almost becalmed; and we are obliged to show {{something}} above them, to keep a little way on her. We are still lying to, you see, and meet the waves head on. If her head was to fall off a few points, and one of these waves took her on the beam, she would go down like a stone.|$|R
60|$|Although {{the three}} boys had agreed with Bob that an attempt {{be made to}} so far repair the tug {{that she might be}} gotten into port, all of them {{believed}} she should have been left to sink. By making Joe Taylor a member of the crew the brig could be worked under <b>lower</b> <b>sails,</b> and there was little doubt but that she would soon reach the coast; whereas, by trying to save the steamer both crafts might be lost.|$|R
50|$|Slightly {{before they}} arrived on each other's beam, both frigates reduced their <b>lower</b> <b>sails</b> and hoisted their flag, firing a full broadside. The British frigate was the 32-gun HMS Iris, under Captain James Hawker. After {{overhauling}} Iris, Hermione turned {{to run into}} the wind, on a starboard tack, and easily sailed into the beam of Iris. The exchange of fire then resumed, and Latouche was wounded when his arm was shot through by a musket ball; he nevertheless continued to command his ship.|$|R
60|$|One day a large {{sailing ship}} was seen coming out. The Dragon {{remained}} with <b>lowered</b> <b>sail</b> {{until she had}} passed; then started in pursuit, and speedily {{came up with the}} Danish vessel. Edmund summoned her to surrender, and was answered by a Norseman of great stature and noble appearance, who from the poop hurled a javelin, which would have pierced Edmund had he not leapt quickly aside. A few other darts were thrown and then the Dragon ran alongside the enemy and boarded her.|$|R

50|$|Wyoming was {{equipped}} with a Hyde anchor windlass and a donkey steam engine to raise and <b>lower</b> <b>sails,</b> haul lines and perform other tasks. The steam engine {{was not used to}} power the ship, but permitted it to be sailed with a smaller crew of only 11 hands. It was named for the state of Wyoming because Wyoming Governor Bryant Butler Brooks (1907-1921) was one of the investors in the ship, which cost $175,000 in 1909 dollars. Another Percy & Small-built schooner, the five-masted Governor Brooks, was named after Brooks.|$|R
60|$|We <b>lowered</b> <b>sail,</b> {{picked up}} {{one end of the}} net, and began to heave it into the boat. But at the first heave we heard a bullet zip- zipping past us on the water, {{followed}} by the faint report of a rifle. The men who had rowed ashore were shooting at us. At the next heave a second bullet went zipping past, perilously near. Charley took a turn around a pin and sat down. There were no more shots. But as soon as he began to heave in, the shooting recommenced.|$|R
