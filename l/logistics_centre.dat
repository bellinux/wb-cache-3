At first, Antonov An-2, DHC-6/300 Twin Otters, Dorniers 228 and smaller aircraft {{were used for the}} services. Later, two Basler BT-67, operated by Antarctic <b>Logistics</b> <b>Centre</b> International, were taken into use. The cooperation has resulted in the availability of larger aircraft more suited for research, through coordinated search and rescue operations between the participating countries.

From there, a DHC-6/300 Twin Otter, Basler BT-67 and a helicopter was used to distribute the crew and supplies to the various bases. In addition to evaluating the airfield at Novolazarevskaya, an evaluation was performed at Troll in January 2002.

25|$|A large new 60,378 sq ft VC10 {{flight shed}} hangar {{was ready to}} house the {{prototype}} VC10 airliner by 1962 and a second even larger (98,989 sq ft) flight shed was added alongside this by 1964. The latter was probably the largest aircraft hangar in Europe {{at the time and}} became known locally as 'The Cathedral' hangar while the smaller shed was called 'The Abbey'. The huge factory at Brooklands went on to design and build the BAC TSR.2, One-Eleven and major assemblies for Concorde. The Labour government's cancellation of TSR-2 in 1965 and the disappointing lack of significant orders for VC10s and Concorde saw the factory contract from the early 1970s.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{advancement}} of information technology and increased market competition, construction companies are driven to employ supply chain management strategies to seek competitive advantage. Managing logistics is one component {{at the core of}} such strategies. An effective logistics system ensures delivery of the right products and services to the right customers at the right time while minimizing costs and rewarding all participants based on value added to the supply chain. As a component of a <b>logistics</b> system, <b>logistics</b> <b>centres</b> can serve the construction industry by offering services such as: storage, transport, distribution, assembly, kitting, consolidation, sorting, breaking bulk, cross-docking, and e-commerce. This paper focuses on the role <b>logistics</b> <b>centres</b> may play and the impact they may have on construction supply chains. Construction companies may configure their <b>logistics</b> <b>centres</b> in different ways to match their global and local supply chain strategy, while addressing challenges posed by variation in demand and supply for material, equipment, and services. A hypothesis is that <b>logistics</b> <b>centres</b> are underused in this industry, yet may offer considerable advantage. The ultimate aim of the research that is reported on here is developing a logistics system to support project-based production needs. The authors present a simulation model of a logistic centre that supports multiple site stores on different construction projects facing variations in supply lead times. The objective of the simulation is to find an approach to reduce material management costs while avoiding resource shortages, and enhancing both reliability and responsiveness of the supply chain...|$|R

40|$|<b>Logistics</b> <b>centres</b> of huge {{capacity}} {{and having the}} ability to create added value have emerged in recent decades. These centres have become network nodes between the co - operating organizations which accomplish the management of supply chains (networks) b y connecting different modalities and networks with their infrastructure and informatics. The effective operation of <b>logistics</b> <b>centres</b> presented in business networks are usually managed by logistics supplier businesses (3 PL/ 4 PL). Defining the supply net as a complex network, <b>logistics</b> <b>centres</b> may be called hubs, the routes and relationships connecting the centres or – by borrowing the term used in network theory – may be called edges. Hub management provides core supply chain execution and visibility. Takin g into consideration earlier results of network research we are searching for correlations between its proven principles and the growth possibilities of the centres (hubs) operated by logistics service providers. In addition, the results concerning cell ne tworks provide further, new insights and increasing opportunities to consider the logistics systems within the field of theoretical network science. The present paper has developed {{as a result of the}} logistics supplier companies’ strategic responses to the challenges of a rapidly changing environment, both on local and global level...|$|R
