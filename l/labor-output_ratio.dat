40|$|GDP) {{slowed to}} only 2. 5 percent per year. From 1989 {{through the first}} half of 1992, growth has slowed further to only 0. 5 percent, with growth reduced about 2 percent below normal due to {{transitory}} cyclical factors. Thus, either way you look at it, what is alternately termed trend, secular, steady-state, or capacity growth has slowed to about 2. 5 percent. This growth is very slow compared to the trend growth of nearly 4 percent experienced in 1948 - 65 or even the 3. 1 percent of 1965 - 79. In the perspective of this century, recent U. S. growth is slow but not unprecedented: for example, trend real GNP growth was only about 2. 25 percent during 1929 - 48 as the capital stock fell due to the Depression and World War 11. This observation provides part of the explanation for slower recent growth compared to 1948 - 65 : the earlier postwar period was dominated by a catch-up in the capital stock to levels consistent with the equilibrium <b>labor-output</b> <b>ratio,</b> and growth averaged only abou...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} Philippine {{employment}} in the 1970 s presents {{a review of the}} literature on the employment experience in the 1970 s,which concentrates on those studies dealing primarily with the demand component of the labor market and highlights a number of policy-related issues that have emerged in recent years from the research work on employment and unemployment. It evaluates the Philippine employment statistics as a set of measures of labor utilization. It evaluates the quality of the employment data from the household surveys, which have been the main source of employment statistics in the Philippines. It also discusses and presents the policy environment in the 70 s in an attempt to explain the employment experience during that period by first assessing the extent of the employment problem then focuses on a description of the employment generation by industry in the 1970 s in comparison with that of the late 1950 s and 1960 s. It also attempts to analyze the employment trend by industry based on a heuristic framework, which defines the growth of employment in terms of the growth of output, the productivity per person engaged and the incremental <b>labor-output</b> <b>ratio.</b> labor force, labor mobility, labor market, employment opportunities, labor productivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to apply a {{generalized}} version of the Farrell measure of technical efficiency to a sample of Illinois strip mines. We disaggregate the original Farrell measure (which was designed to measure lost output or wasted inputs due to underutilization of inputs) into three mutually exclusive and exhaustive components: (1) a measure of purely technical efficiency, (2) a measure of input congestion (overutilization of some input(s)) and (3) a measure of scale efficiency. This approach has the advantage that it provides additional information on the sources of inefficiency of production, which should be useful to managers, in general, not only in strip mining. Simple linear programming techniques are derived and used in calculating these efficiency measures for our sample. We find that Illinois strip mines are fairly efficient (relative to each other). The major source of inefficiency was due to deviations from the optimal scale of production. We also find suggestive evidence that inefficient mines tend to have relatively high stripping <b>ratios,</b> high <b>labor-output</b> <b>ratios,</b> single rather than multiple coal seams, and lower earth-moving capacity. technical efficiency, mining, linear programming, farrell measure, congestion, scale efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The INTERLINK {{model is}} a dynamic linear model {{simulating}} development of a national or regional economy as a whole. The objective of the model is to provide projections of the potential long-term economic development of a region or a nation under various assumptions on {{the present and the}} potential future structures of the overall system. The model allows one to evaluate the potential economic growth of a region or a nation within and after the transition period (. i. e., the change from the use of conventional to nonconventional energy sources), to describe the internally consistent operation of several production sectors, to provide information required for energy demand projections, and to identify limiting factors in the development of regional economies. The {{model is a}} dynamic input-output Leontief system with a set of variables, such as GNP, export, import, employment, investment, and final consumption, given both as totals and by sectors. Structural parameters, such as technological and capital coefficients, final consumption profile vectors, and <b>labor-output</b> <b>ratios,</b> are exogenously changeable over time. The model can be used both as an optimization model, with various assumptions on the objectives of a given nation or region in the transition period, and as a simulation model, with assumed growth rates for various production sectors and final consumption. As a result, the model provides estimates of GNP, final consumption, and investment changing over time, for a regional energy system development strategy under consideration...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, Vietnam {{has been one}} of the fastest growing economies in the world, but {{employment}} growth has been much slower. The large gap between GDP and employment growth implies real labor productivity growth, so greater per capita income. However, this enlarging gap, together with emerging unemployment and underemployment problems, also indicates limited benefits to employment from output expansion, an issue of concern to Vietnamese policymakers. ^ This dissertation research addresses the relationship between GDP growth and employment growth. The central question is why labor demand in Vietnam grows so much more slowly than GDP. Three fundamental causes proposed to explain slow employment growth are: 1) structural transformation; 2) labor-saving technological progress; and 3) institutional biases due to minimum wage and state investment policies. ^ A decomposition of labor demand growth shows that structural transformation and state investment bias can at most explain 40 % of the difference between GDP and employment growth, while the remaining 60 % is due to biased technological change and minimum wage bias. Further analysis breaks apart these effects due to changing sectoral output structures and declining <b>labor-output</b> <b>ratios,</b> respectively. ^ Productivity growth prevailed in Vietnam over the past decade, but we need to allow for biased technological change to find it. Biased technological progress is more important than all other factors in affecting labor demand growth. For the entire economy, the Leontief production function best fits the data, and estimates suggest a 5 % increase in labor productivity and a 1 % increase in capital productivity per year during 2000 - 2009. The traditional agricultural sector also experienced 3 % annual growth of labor productivity accelerating the structural transformation process. ^ State investment bias has slowed labor demand growth by 0. 51 % per year. Privatization is beneficial to labor demand growth as a result of higher labor intensity in non-state firms relative to state owned enterprises, and robust growth of the domestic private sector. ^ Minimum wage bias is not an important contributing factor, due to low elasticities of factor substitution and weak links between minimum and market wages. Tighter regulation of the minimum wage policy will only strongly affect labor demand in the formal agricultural and manufacturing sectors. ^ The problem of stagnant employment is shared in other Asian countries. Labor demand growth decomposition for China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam for 1986 - 2008 shows that biased technological progress was responsible for more than 70 % of slow employment growth, while structural transformation can only explain up to 30 % of the gap between GDP and employment growth. Capital accumulation has been the dominant factor driving Asian economic growth at the early stages of the development, but as development proceeds, technological progress, especially the labor saving type, eventually plays a more important role. ...|$|R
