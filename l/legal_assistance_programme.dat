40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Attorney‐General’s Department’s administration of the Indigenous <b>Legal</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Programme.</b> Audit objectives and criteria The objective of the audit was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Attorney-General’s Department’s administration of the Indigenous <b>Legal</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Programme.</b> To conclude on this objective the ANAO adopted high level criteria relating to the effectiveness of program management arrangements, AGD’s management of funding agreements, performance monitoring and reporting arrangements. Overall conclusion Access to appropriate legal assistance services is an important element of a fair and equitable legal system. Since 2011, funding through the Indigenous <b>Legal</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Programme</b> (ILAP) has enabled service providers to deliver a cumulative total of 604   519 legal assistance services, or an average of 201   506 per year. Over the same period, ILAP funding has enabled these service providers to operate an average of 84 outlets each year to provide services. Research undertaken by a range of government and non-government bodies indicates generally that the level of unmet demand for Indigenous legal assistance services is higher than the supply of those same services. Additionally, the Productivity Commission has reported in the 2014 Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage report that between 2000 and 2013, Indigenous imprisonment rates have continued to worsen with the imprisonment rate for Indigenous adults increasing by 57. 4  per cent. There have also been significant increases in juvenile detention rates since 2001. While these trends in themselves are not necessarily reflective of levels of access and the quality of services provided through ILAP, they do indicate that demand for Indigenous legal assistance services is high and is likely to remain so. Facilitating appropriate access to justice is complex and involves a number of different institutions. For the most part, Australians interact with the justice system at the state and territory level, and accessibility is largely determined by how that justice system functions. As a result, while Australian Government support through ILAP is able to address some barriers to access, it is not able to address all factors relevant to improving access to justice for Indigenous people. Further, the demand for services arises largely from the operation of state and territory laws. In this respect, demand for Indigenous legal assistance services is not in the control of the Australian Government and can be affected significantly by changes made to state and territory laws. In this context, and considering the small size of the program, the overall management approach taken by the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) is reasonable. The approach recognises that there are institutional and jurisdictional differences in justice systems across Australia, and acknowledges that ILAP service providers are better placed than AGD to identify appropriate service approaches in the areas they service. Accordingly, AGD allows service providers flexibility in their planning and delivery approach. In circumstances where national programs allow for local flexibility, program management arrangements need to be designed to achieve appropriate levels of consistency. Performance information arrangements also need to be well developed to enable appropriate comparative analysis and assessment of program performance overall. AGD has put in place a range of approaches to promote consistent national management of ILAP. These include a formula based funding allocation model that incorporates information specific to each jurisdiction, but assesses each jurisdiction against the same criteria and weightings to determine the funding levels to be allocated to each service provider. Expectations in relation to service delivery are promoted by the Service Delivery Directions, made available to service providers to inform the annual development of service plans, and the development of the Indigenous Quality Practice Portal designed to support the collection and analysis of relevant performance information and monitor delivery against Service Standards. Grant funding is managed through standard funding agreements that are in place with each service provider. AGD’s management of ILAP has matured since it assumed responsibility for the program in 2004, and while the current management framework is reasonable overall, improvements can be made in the following areas. Firstly, to give better effect to the intent of the program to prioritise assistance to communities with the highest need, the funding allocation model, which is currently being revised by AGD, could be enhanced by the inclusion of additional social and economic indicators of disadvantage to better target available resources. Secondly, there would be benefit in developing greater consistency in relation to performance expectations. Currently, each ILAP service provider proposes targets for the number of services they expect to provide in their annual service plans, which are endorsed by AGD as part of the annual planning process. However, the definition of a service can vary between jurisdiction and AGD has not developed a benchmark level of service against which an assessment of proposed targets can be made. Further, service plans are not integrated into funding agreements, and as a result, there is no clear link between the funding amounts provided in the agreements and the expected level of performance. Generally, ILAP funding agreements are compliance focussed and show only a limited performance orientation. While the reporting requirements established in the funding agreements give AGD sufficient visibility to identify issues of compliance, AGD has not always been timely in verifying or addressing matters relating to service provider compliance. Further, the focus of AGD’s program measurement and reporting is mainly on the levels of funding expended and the number of legal services delivered. This information is relevant in view of the demand-driven nature of ILAP. However, in the absence of targets or baseline information in relation to access, AGD is unable to assess whether access to justice has improved as a result of ILAP funding. Improvements to the collection, reporting and use of currently available performance information—directed towards measuring and reporting on the quality of services delivered and supported by appropriate assurance and verification mechanisms—would better enable AGD to strengthen its focus on whether the program is performing in line with expectations, and that barriers to access are being appropriately addressed. The ANAO has made one recommendation aimed at improving AGD’s approach to setting and assessing performance targets...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, the Government of Indonesia has {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> intended {{to improve the lives of}} the poor and help them escape poverty. Many of these programmes are now operating at a national scale and cover millions of Indonesians. Using a new household survey dataset that covers the eastern areas of Indonesia (Indonesian Family Life Survey East 2012), this paper investigates the household-level determinants of access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The analysis reveals that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are relatively more available in poorer provinces and that poorer households—all things being equal—are more likely to access social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> than nonpoor households, which suggests that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in eastern Indonesia are successful in their efforts to target the poor (poverty targeting), both across regions and households. However, poverty targeting still has scope for improvement in terms of accuracy. Besides the poverty status (as measured in per capita consumption expenditures), the authors found that several other factors infl uence programme access. Having a disabled household member or having a household head who is a widow(er) appears to increase the likelihood of receiving social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the level of trust and confl ict in a community affects access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Particularly in the case of Raskin, we found that the programme is distributed more widely among those communities that are characterized by higher levels of confl ict and lower levels of trust. The authors did not fi nd that poor access to infrastructure and remoteness infl uences household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> once they controlled for province fi xed effects in the regression framework. Furthermore, the fi ndings suggest that possession of a local ‘poverty letter’ strongly improves household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> even after controlling for a wide set of socioeconomic characteristics. In general, determinants of programme access differ signifi cantly among provinces and between rural and urban areas...|$|R

40|$|In {{the legal}} policy level, the {{government}} of Indonesia has already had the policies to assist the justice seekers who are financially weak {{to have an access}} to justice through court. There are two research problems in this matter. First, does the policy on the <b>legal</b> <b>assistance</b> as stipulated in Law Number 16 of 2011 work optimally for the justice seekers who are financially weak? Second, how is the implementation of the policy on the <b>legal</b> <b>assistance</b> in the practices?

The conclusion obtained from the research is: First, it is not yet optimum since the policy especially in terms of budget allocation of the <b>legal</b> <b>assistance</b> is still low.

40|$|Social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} noted {{as one of the}} {{important}} keys to determining the success of the recovery process in the aftermath a disaster. It has also been shown that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster, significantly contribute to the recovery phase of disaster management, by utilizing the communities? capacity to facilitate community recovery from a disaster. Through the community recovery framework, social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with active collaboration and interaction between the community and the social assistants, can speed up community recovery efforts; contributing to the disaster recovery management. The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the social assistance delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the affected community. Therefore, the current study sought to address this gap by exploring the experiences of social assistance within the affected community following a disaster. With this knowledge, the government, NGOs, private sectors and other parties would gain insights, inputs and recommendations from the affected community, to whom the programmes were delivered, so that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster may be made more effective. A qualitative study was conducted in Kinahrejo hamlet, the most affected community from the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption.
