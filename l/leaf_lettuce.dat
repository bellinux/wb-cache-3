500|$|While McDonald's {{had been}} trying to develop and test a similar product for several years, the company was caught off guard at the time when its {{mainline}} competitors introduced their grilled chicken products and was not able to initially deploy a similar product. This was primarily due to the fact the company's highly specialized kitchens could not produce a high quality product without a large investment in new equipment. By early 1991, McDonald's grilled chicken product was still in development, and the vendor would not introduce its version, the McGrilled Chicken Classic, until 1994. The McGrilled chicken sandwich was replaced with the Grilled Chicken Deluxe sandwich in September and October 1996 as part of McDonald's Deluxe line of [...] "upscale" [...] sandwiches; the company had hoped that a higher value product would help improve average check performance at its stores. However, by 1998 the whole Deluxe line was said to be not selling well, and the Grilled Chicken Deluxe was eliminated when McDonald's brought back the Chicken McGrill sandwich back in 1999. The Chicken McGrill sandwich was retired in 2005 when the company introduced its new Premium line of products, which like the TenderCrisp sandwich was targeted to a more adult audience with higher quality ingredients such as natural cheeses and whole <b>leaf</b> <b>lettuce.</b> Beginning in April 2015, McDonald's moved to a new grilled chicken sandwich, the Artisan Grilled Chicken; the new chicken uses a smaller list of ingredients in the chicken filet, removing ingredients such as maltodextrin and sodium phosphates. The new sandwich is in response to consumer-based market trends of food products that have simpler, more natural ingredients.|$|E

2500|$|Arch Deluxe – An {{attempt to}} produce a [...] "luxury" [...] hamburger, {{promoted}} by a high-profile advertising campaign (introduced in 1996), today {{considered one of the}} most expensive failures in McDonald's history. It featured a honey mustard-type sauce, quarter-pound beef patty on a potato roll, with <b>leaf</b> <b>lettuce,</b> tomato, red onion, and cheese; peppered bacon was also offered for an extra charge. The Arch Deluxe was accompanied with three other burgers at the time, the Crispy Chicken Deluxe (later renamed the Crispy Chicken Sandwich), the Grilled Chicken Deluxe (later renamed the Chicken McGrill), and the Fish Filet Deluxe (since discontinued along with the Arch Deluxe itself).|$|E
2500|$|Big N' Tasty/Big Tasty – the Big N' Tasty, {{introduced}} in 1997, was a [...] beef patty with ketchup, cheese, mayonnaise with a grill diced onions, pickles, <b>leaf</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and tomatoes. It was devised to resemble Burger King's Whopper sandwich. It {{is also known}} as the Big Xtra in Slovenia and most of Canada; the McXtra in Quebec, Canada; the McFeast Deluxe in Australia; the Big Tasty (without the 'N') in Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy (without ketchup), Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom; the Quarter Pounder Deluxe in South Africa; and the McNifica (a play on Spanish magnifica, 'wonderful') in Mexico and Latin America. The Big Tasty configuration is somewhat different, consisting of a third-pound (150 g) beef patty, sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, Emmental cheese, and Big Tasty sauce (which has a smoke flavor). The Big Tasty Bacon variant also contains strips of bacon. This variant was sold in the US until 2009; it is now sold internationally only.|$|E
2500|$|Premium chicken {{sandwiches}} – the Premium {{line was}} added in July 2005. The Classic was a rebranding of the Crispy Chicken and Chicken McGrill sandwiches, themselves rebrandings of the Deluxe chicken line in 1998, with mayonnaise, <b>leaf</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and a tomato slice. The Ranch BLT contains ranch sauce instead of mayonnaise and includes bacon. The Club {{is similar to}} the Classic with added bacon and a piece of Swiss cheese. In Latin America, the Classic and the Club are sold, but a honey mustard chicken sandwich is sold in place of the BLT. All were served on a whole-grain roll, with either a grilled or crispy chicken breast. On March 20, 2014, the Premium Crispy Chicken Bacon Clubhouse and Premium Grilled Chicken Bacon Clubhouse were added to the line-up (alongside the beef variant of the sandwich) on a new artisan roll. In February 2015 the Ranch BLT and Club were removed from the menu. The standard crispy offering was renamed to the Premium Crispy Chicken Deluxe (later the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich in August 2015) and it was upgraded to sit on the artisan roll introduced with the Bacon Clubhouse. In the first week of April 2015, McDonald's replaced the Premium Grilled Chicken sandwich with the Artisan Grilled Chicken. Like the Taste-Crafted Burgers, the Taste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches were introduced in 2016, in West Coast markets, and in all other U.S. markets in January 2017. Signature Sriracha was the latest to be added in June 2016, reinstated in July through September 2017; it was replaced by Sweet Barbecue Bacon in May 2017.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{morphological}} and phytochemical {{characteristics of}} two Ocimum basilicum cultivars (<b>Lettuce</b> <b>Leaf,</b> and Red Rubin-mountain Athos hybrid) under artificial lighting were investigated. Four LED light treatments [AP 673 L (high red and high red:far-red), G 2 (high red and low red:far-red), AP 67 (moderate {{blue and red}} and low red:far-red), and NS 1 (high blue and green, high red:far-red and 1 % ultraviolet) ] with different colors mixing UV, blue, green, red and far-red, and fluorescent tubes (FL, high blue, green and red:far-red) as Control {{were used in the}} growth chambers for 28 days under PPFD of 200 ± 20 μmolm− 2 s− 1 for all treatments at plant height. G 2, Control and AP 67 treatments for <b>Lettuce</b> <b>Leaf,</b> and G 2 for Red Rubin hybrid had higher growth rate. Roots of <b>Lettuce</b> <b>Leaf</b> were significantly longer under AP 673 L compared to NS 1, while Red Rubin hybrid showed no significant differences. Total biomass was significantly greater under NS 1, AP 67 and G 2 compared to the Control, for both cultivars. For both <b>Lettuce</b> <b>Leaf</b> and Red Rubin hybrid, root:shoot ratio (R/S) was favored under NS 1, whereas the Control had the lowest impact. Leaf area of both cultivars was greater under the Control. Root growth capacity evaluation was also assessed. Seedlings of <b>Lettuce</b> <b>Leaf</b> cultivated under the effect of the Control and AP 673 L, and seedlings of Red Rubin hybrid grown under AP 673 L (mainly) quickly developed new root system. This could offer the advantage of fast exploitation of larger soil volume after transplanting. Total phenolic content of <b>Lettuce</b> <b>Leaf</b> was significantly higher under NS 1 compared {{to the rest of the}} treatments, while in Red Rubin hybrid, NS 1 had significantly higher total phenolic content compared to the Control and G 2. Our study demonstrates that LEDs variably affected growth characteristics and increased total phenolic content compared to conventional fluorescent light for these two O. basilicum cultivars...|$|R

40|$|In Arizona, Sclerotinia <b>leaf</b> drop of <b>lettuce</b> {{is caused}} by two {{different}} species of fungi, Sclerotinia minor and S. sclerotiorum. Relatively cool and moist environmental conditions favor this disease. Some new fungicides in development were evaluated for control of <b>leaf</b> drop on <b>lettuce</b> during the winter vegetable growing season of 1998 - 99. Sclerotia of each pathogen were applied to plots after thinning and just before {{the first of two}} applications of test compounds. The final severity of leaf drop in these trials was moderately high. Significant reduction in the final count of dead lettuce plants compared to nontreated plots was usually achieved by application of the standard compounds Ronilan and Rovral as well as an appropriate rate of the experimental compounds Elevate, Medallion or Serenade. Medallion and Elevate provided equivalent disease control to that of the current standard materials with 0. 178 and 0. 5 lb active ingredient (a. i.) per acre, respectively, compared to the current 1. 0 lb a. i. per acre required with the standard compounds.
