40|$|Interbank {{contagion}} {{has become}} a buzzword {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis that led to a series of shocks to the interbank market and to periods of pronounced market disruptions. However, little is known about how interbank networks are formed and about their sensitivity to changes in key bank parameters (for example, induced by common exogenous shocks or by regulatory initiatives). This paper aims to shed light on these issues by modelling endogenously the formation of interbank networks, which in turn allows for checking the sensitivity of interbank network structures and hence their underlying contagion risk to changes in market-driven parameters as well as to changes in regulatory measures such as <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> <b>limits.</b> The sequential network formation mechanism presented in the paper is based on a portfolio optimisation model whereby banks allocate their interbank exposures while balancing the return and risk of counterparty default risk and the placements are accepted taking into account funding diversification benefits. The model offers some interesting insights into how key parameters may affect interbank network structures and can be a valuable tool for analysing the impact of various regulatory policy measures relating to banks' incentives to operate in the interbank market...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} rules in place in {{selected}} countries to limit risk concentrations in the credit portfolio. The paper focuses {{on a number of}} issues suggested by international organizations for countries and bank supervisors to consider in imposing standards for risk diversification in the credit portfolio. The issues reviewed for each country are the <b>large</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits,</b> the definition of credit exposure (including application on a consolidated basis), and the definition of a group of related borrowers. The paper concludes that most of the countries reviewed set <b>limits</b> on <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> for banks and define a related group of borrowers in line with recommended international standards. The major differences identified among countries include how to determine the credit exposure, the application of the <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> on a consolidated basis, and whether to impose <b>limits</b> on <b>exposure</b> to a specific sector.

40|$|The tight {{linkage between}} {{sovereign}} and bank balance sheets magni ed {{the depth of}} the European sovereign debt crisis. As a response to this, reform efforts are therefore focused on severing this vicious tie. Some progress has been made. The Banking Union framework addresses the transfer of banking sector risk to the sovereign. Policy makers are now discussing how to address the treatment of sovereign debt on bank balance sheets. Currently, it is treated as risk free. Zero risk weights are applied, meaning banks do not need to set aside capital to protect themselves from potential losses in these securities. Nor do banks have any <b>limits</b> on their <b>exposure</b> to a particular sovereign. This discussion paper analyses the two widely discussed basic options to address this regulatory gap: applying non-zero risk weights to sovereign expo- sures, and putting <b>limits</b> on <b>exposures</b> to sovereigns, akin to those in place for other exposures. Although this paper analyses each option in isolation, the two complement one another as they target different facets of risk. Positive risk weights address counterparty credit risk, whereas <b>large</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> address concentration risk. Both policy options would, according to our analysis, lead to improved bank risk management and render banks more resilient. They would equip them to better absorb losses: positive risk weights would require higher capital buffers and <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> would lead to greater diversi cation. Positive risk weights would also improve risk transparency and correct distorted incentives for investing in sovereign bonds. At the systemic level, leverage would decrease and losses in the event of default would be more spread out. On the downside, both regula- tory proposals would lower bank pro tability in the short run. In the longer run, positive risk-weights could permanently reduce bank pro ts by increasing their funding costs, while <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> would lead to a more diversi ed portfolio and lower funding costs. The bene ts in terms of increased resilience in the banking sector would come at a cost for some sovereigns. Sovereign bond holdings would become more costly in terms of capital if positive risk weights were applied or the exposures were capped by a hard limit. In both cases, banks would try to deal with excess sovereign bonds on their balance sheets by injecting fresh capital or reducing their portfolio of sovereign bonds. An increased supply of sovereign paper, or a lack of demand for new issues, would raise funding costs for the sovereign and consequently for the whole economy. Furthermore, both policy options would lower liquidity in the sovereign debt markets, as they add to the cost and hinder the ability of banks to provide market-making services. <b>Exposure</b> <b>limits</b> in partic- ular would have signi cant repercussions on markets in the short run, as banks traditionally have <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to domestic sovereigns {{that they would have to}} shed. Other market participants would need to absorb this additional supply. Sovereigns would need to re-arrange their nancing sources, which could prove challenging. Additionally, the two options could aggravate long-run macro-level cyclical developments for stressed sovereigns. During an economic downturn, an increased riskiness of a sovereign would translate into higher risk weights and a higher capital charge for the bank holding its debt. This would further worsen nancing conditions for sovereigns precisely at the time when scal space is most needed. Similarly, <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> could lead to cliff effects in a downturn, if sovereigns fail to extend their investor base. We expect that introducing positive risk weights would have the largest effect on stressed sovereigns, while imposing <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> would impact sovereigns with large outstanding debt volumes the most. The trade-off between strengthening the resilience of the banking sector to sovereign risk and maintaining the investor base for European sovereigns makes the issue of adjusting regulation particularly complex. Any policy decision needs to take into account the effects it would have on sovereign funding conditions. In addition, as banks traditionally hold large amounts of sovereign debt, any regulatory change could have a large initial impact with potentially destabilising consequences. Hence, a gradual and transparent transition would be crucial for a successful implementation of any combination of the two alternatives...|$|R

40|$|In Sweden, as {{in other}} industrialised nations, {{occupational}} <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> {{are considered to be}} an important tool for chemical risk management, although many other factors also play a role in occupational safety and health management. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> in relation to information about, and the risk perception of, chemicals. An interview study was performed at four Swedish process industry workplaces in order to investigate these issues. For each workplace, the range of informants covered at least one person who spent most of their working time in the production process; one person in a managerial position; one person in the site health, safety and environment department; the main safety ombudsman; and the site manager. The results show that informants' understanding of occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> and their use is quite poor, although they do understand that there is epistemic uncertainty in determining the toxicological effects of hazardous substances. The risk perception and safety behaviour of the informants were not affected by the occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits,</b> nor did occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> have any role as sources of information. Nevertheless, almost all the informants expressed the view that occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are trusted and needed; safety engineers and main safety ombudsmen, generally, also added that occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are useful.

30|$|At the EU level, two {{concepts}} for deriving occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> values exist.

The second set are the indicative occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> values (IOELVs) [14 – 16] for which member states are obliged to derive national limit values that can either be higher or lower than these IOELVs. These limit values were based on consideration of evidence for an impact of the substance on health [13]; currently 5 BOELVs and 112 IOELVs have been set. For both sets of limits, the focus is on airborne exposure rather than dermal contact.
