Flight parameters (e. g. speed and <b>line</b> <b>spacing)</b> directly affect the rate of area coverage, cost, and data quality of any survey. The influences of <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> have been investigated for data from inter‐tidal, coastal and upland environments {{with a range of}} 137 Cs activity concentrations and depositional histories. Estimates of the integrated 137 Cs activity (‘inventory’) within specified areas and the shapes of depositional features were calculated for subsets of the data at different line spacings. Features with dimensions greater than the <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> show variations in inventory and area of less than 3 %, and features with dimensions less than the <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> show larger variations and a decreased probability of detection. The choice of <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> for a task is dependent on the dimensions of the features of interest and required edge definition. Options for <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> for different tasks are suggested. It is noted that for regional mapping, even 5 – 10 km <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> can produce useful data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{meet the}} {{performance}} {{test for the}} confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) accurately in some specific application occasions, the spatial resolution imaging principle of confocal laser scanning microscope was analyzed theoretically. And the micron <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> as the measurement standard has tried to investigate the lateral resolution of CLSM in experiment. The value range of the lateral resolution was calculated by the fluctuation state of the output light intensity signal when there is the lateral movement between the objective with sample. At the same time, some reasons for spatial resolution are also been evaluated in theory. Experiments demonstrate that if {{the value of the}} <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> standard is closer to the spatial resolution of CLSM, the standard can be utilized to test the spatial resolution. So we can use a a series of <b>lines</b> <b>spacing</b> standards with different <b>lines</b> <b>spacing</b> values to test the serial effective resolution. And in our experiment, we only measured <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> standard with 8 µm line width and 100 µm line pitch with many times by CLSM, and the spatial resolution of the CLSM is obtained about more minimal than 0. 3 µm by the scanning curves...|$|R

50|$|Where space begins…can {{actually}} {{be determined by}} the speed of the space vehicle and its altitude above the earth. Consider, for instance, the record flight of Captain Iven Carl Kincheloe, Jr. in an X-2 rocket plane. Kincheloe flew 2000 miles per hour (3,200 km/h) at 126,000 feet (38,500 m), or 24 miles up. At this altitude and speed, aerodynamic lift still carries 98 per cent of the weight of the plane, and only two per cent is carried by centrifugal force, or Kepler Force, as space scientists call it. But at 300,000 feet (91,440 m) or 57 miles up, this relationship is reversed because {{there is no longer any}} air to contribute lift: only centrifugal force prevails. This is certainly a physical boundary, where aerodynamics stops and astronautics begins, and so I thought why should it not also be a jurisdictional boundary?

50|$|The patent {{describes}} Burt's machine {{as having}} a set of typeface characters that were arranged on the under side {{of a set of}} parts that had a lever pivoted to swing vertically and horizontally. The desired typeface character is brought to the printing point by moving this lever horizontally to a position over the same character in the index, and the impression on the paper is made by then depressing the lever. Different styles of typeface characters could be used. They were arranged in two rows on a lever. The rows of typeface characters could be shifted on the lever to bring either one to the printing point. The paper was carried in an endless band that traveled crosswise of the machine and the band was moved for letter space by the impression lever every time the lever is depressed to print. The <b>line</b> <b>space</b> was made by shifting the frame carrying the printing mechanism toward the front or rear of the machine, with the paper remaining stationary. Ink-pads were located at each side of the impression point, and all the typeface characters, except the one in the printing position, were inked every time the impression lever was depressed. Upper and lower case typeface letters could be used. A dial was provided that indicated the length of paper (inches) which had passed the printing point in printing each line. The operator knew the width of the paper being used each time. There was a stop printing indicator for end of the line.|$|E
50|$|Jones {{chooses to}} briefly convey certain {{moments of the}} story {{by the use of}} certain {{iconographic}} references, and narrative devices. She uses several strategies in this piece to tell this story. For example, to depict Ethiopia Jones uses the large figure wearing the ethnic headdress to signify the importance of Ethiopia to the painting. The words art and the people leading to the city represent the African-American community and their progress over time including their life struggles that influence their art. Not only does the large figure represent Ethiopia, but the pyramids do also. The star in the top left corner of the painting represents the infamous north star that the slaves used as a guide to lead them to the north. The position {{of the people in the}} image towards the bottom on the right suggests a plea for mercy, by the way position of their arms are bent and they are hunched over, accompanied by their body language that expresses redemption by their confident and straight up posture. Other design elements including <b>line,</b> <b>space,</b> and color all come together to tell this story. The lines in this painting are fluid, straight, and squiggly based on the outline of the figure, the sky to the right, and the mountain in the middle. The space in this painting is deep because due to the perspective of the painting. If the viewer is standing right in front of the figures with the head dress. The position of the objects allows her to take a deep perspective into what’s going on. By the position of the objects and how they are placed in front of, and behind each other. Also the surrounding space frames the narrative, especially at the bottom by the large figure to the right, and to the left the stairs. The colors in this painting are of a cool dark color scheme using only black, and blue mostly, but also yellow to represent salvation, light, and triumph. The blacks and blues in this painting are used to represent their struggle, for example in the saying “blue in the face” or “beaten till your black and blue”. The visual elements are arranged asymmetrically, are rhythmic, open, and unbalanced to appeal to the viewer (Terry).|$|E

Similarly, watermark embedding in a text document with variable <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> is achieved by slightly increasing or decreasing the distance between any two adjacent lines according to the value of the watermark bit.
