Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western fa√ßade of the museum is a screen wall composed of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside {{is constructed}} of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too much like a trailer on stilts.|$|E

On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are ceramic tiles depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, a mosaic reveals the sky where the train had previously been present. The platform level features semi-transparent and reflective glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, {{new types}} of glass such as <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> {{reinforced}} glass and glass bricks increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass. Multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass. Similarly, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens. Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other application in medicine and science. Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.|$|E
25|$|The Mk III was {{the first}} attempt to improve the basic Spitfire design and {{introduced}} several features which were used on later marks. Powered by a Rolls-Royce RM 2SM, later known as the Merlin XX, developing 1,390hp (1,036kW) due to its two-speed supercharger, the wingspan was reduced to 30ft 6 in (9.3 m) and the area reduced to 220 square feet (20.4 sq m) while the overall length was increased to 30ft 4 in (9.2 m). The strengthened main undercarriage was raked forward two inches, increasing ground stability and had flaps to fully enclose the wheels when retracted. The tailwheel was also made fully retractable. The windscreen was redesigned, with a built-in, internal <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> bulletproof panel and optically flat, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> quarter panels.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 artwork in {{the station}} house is called Passage by Tom Patti, and was {{designed}} in conjunction with FX+FOWLE Architects.

25|$|In 1944, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> was {{introduced}} in the PV model. After Vattenfall engineers presented their pioneering work to Volvo in the 1950s, Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin invented and patented the modern three-point safety belt, which became standard on all Volvo cars in 1959, and then made this design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free. Additionally, Volvo developed the first rear-facing child seat in 1964 and introduced its own booster seat in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} modern {{aquarium}} {{made of glass}} {{was developed in the}} 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with putty. Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA simply {{supported}} glass/polyvinyl butyral (PVB) /glass beam is modelled by plane finite elements. The distribution of strain and stress through the beam thickness and along its axis is obtained {{as a result}} of linear finite element analysis. It shows that the bending stress in the glass layers is determinant for the load-bearing capability of <b>laminated</b> <b>glasses,</b> but the shear in the PVB-interlayer plays an important role for glass-layer interaction. A mathematical model of triplex glass beam is derived, consisting of a bending curvature differential equation and a differential equation of PVB-interlayer shear interaction. The derived equations are solved analytically with boundary conditions of {{simply supported}} beam under uniform transverse load. A parametric study of the derived mathematical model is carried out. The model is utilized for lightweight structure optimization of layer thicknesses. The results of the optimization show that <b>laminated</b> <b>glasses</b> could be superior to monolithic glasses...|$|R

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the University and his Verona, Wisconsin studio Littleton began melting small batches of glass in his {{ceramics}} kiln, using hand-thrown stoneware bowls as crucibles. [...] He built his first glass furnace in the summer of 1959. [...] As a result of these ongoing experiments, the ACC asked him to chair a panel on glass at its Third National Conference, at Lake George, New York, in 1958. The panelists were glass artists and designers Michael and Frances Higgins and Earl McCutchen, who worked in <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> at the University of Georgia. Paul Perrot, director of the Corning Museum of Glass, was the fifth panelist. At this conference, Littleton suggested that glass should be a medium for the individual artist. By the time the ACC convened its fourth conference in 1961, Littleton not only presented a paper on his own work in glass but also exhibited a sculpture made of three faceted pieces of cullet that he had melted, formed and carved in the previous year. By this time, Littleton was applying for grants to get his vision of a hot glass studio program at the University off the ground.|$|E
