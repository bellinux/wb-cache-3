40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the risk of}} accidental release of hydrocarbons during transportation and storage. Transportation of hydrocarbons from an offshore platform to processing units through subsea pipelines involves risk of release due to pipeline leakage resulting from corrosion, plastic deformation caused by seabed shakedown or damaged by contact with drifting iceberg. The environmental impacts of hydrocarbon dispersion can be severe. Overall safety and economic concerns of pipeline leakage at subsea environment are immense. A large leak can be detected by employing conventional technology such as, radar, intelligent pigging or chemical tracer but in a remote location like subsea or arctic, a small chronic leak may be undetected {{for a period of}} time. In case of storage, an accidental release of hydrocarbon from the storage tank could lead pool fire; further it could escalate to domino effects. This chain of accidents may lead to extremely severe consequences. Analyzing past accident scenarios it is observed {{that more than half of}} the industrial domino accidents involved fire as a primary event, and some other factors for instance, wind speed and direction, fuel type and engulfment of the compound. In this thesis, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is taken to model the subsea pipeline leak and the pool fire from a storage tank. A commercial software package ANSYS FLUENT Workbench 15 is used to model the subsea pipeline leakage. The CFD simulation results of four different types of fluids showed that the static pressure and pressure gradient along the axial length of the pipeline have a sharp signature variation near the <b>leak</b> <b>orifice</b> at steady state condition. Transient simulation is performed to obtain the acoustic signature of the pipe near <b>leak</b> <b>orifice.</b> The power spectral density (PSD) of acoustic signal is strong near the <b>leak</b> <b>orifice</b> and it dissipates as the distance and orientation from the <b>leak</b> <b>orifice</b> increase. The high-pressure fluid flow generates more noise than the low-pressure fluid flow. In order to model the pool fire from the storage tank, ANSYS CFX Workbench 14 is used. The CFD results show that the wind speed has significant contribution on the behavior of pool fire and its domino effects. The radiation contours are also obtained from CFD post processing, which can be applied for risk analysis. The outcome of this study will be helpful for better understanding of the domino effects of pool fire in complex geometrical settings of process industries. The attempt to reduce and prevent risks is discussed based on the results obtained from the numerical simulations of the numerical models...|$|E
40|$|Abstract CFD {{modelling}} combines transport {{phenomena and}} numerical approaches to solve physical problems. Although numerical modelling of flow scenarios is {{the cutting edge}} of flow modelling, there seems to be room for improvement. This paper proposes an approach for jet modelling in a low Mach number computational code. The methodology is based on the equivalent diameter and velocity profile calculated downstream from the jet <b>leak</b> <b>orifice.</b> The novel model DESQr (Diameter of Equivalent Simulation for Quicker Run) is combined with LES (Large Eddy Simulation) to calculate the gas jet profile due to accidental releases. The model is implemented in the framework of FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) and the open source code is modified to handle gas dispersion scenarios. Numerical findings for jet modelling and gas dispersion are compared with experimental data. The results are also compared with a commercial CFD tool. Good agreement is observed. Significant computational time reduction is achieved. A free open source CFD tool emerges and the results presented in this work are promising...|$|E
40|$|Several {{limitations}} and difficulties {{exist in the}} inspection and maintenance of underground pipelines that cannot use pigs (pipeline inspection gauges). Leaking is unavoidable in such bur-ied pipelines and poses serious problem to the environment {{as well as the}} pipeline owners. Pipe-line leakages are usually apparent either when the pressure is dropping for no other obvious rea-son or when valuable product is lost. However, even in the best-case scenario, where the opera-tors can isolate specific pipeline sections suspected to leak, it is often the case that the operators cannot reliably locate the exact position of the leak so as to take corrective measures. Acoustic emission (AE) is an excellent tool for detecting and locating leaks in buried pipelines. Access to the pipeline is required only locally for mounting AE sensors. Pipeline is pressurized and AE tested in 600 -to- 1000 -m-long sections at a time. The AE sensors detect the turbulent flow at the <b>leak</b> <b>orifice,</b> and with the use of digital AE systems and specialized software, the position of the leak is provided. The present paper deals with the technical description and the physics of the AE leak detection technique, presents the advantages, {{limitations and}} requirements of the method, describes the necessary functions of AE equipment for performing such a task, and, finally, re-ports on several case-studies of successful leak detection and location of buried pipelines. The case studies cover both new and in-service buried pipelines of different sizes...|$|E

The {{use of a}} good system for detecting and locating leaks in pipeline contribute significantly to operational safety and cost saving in petroleum industry. This paper aims to study the heavy oil-water flow in vertical ducts including leakage. A transient numerical analysis, using the ANSYS-CFX ? 11. 0 commercial software is performed. The mathematical modeling considers the effect of drag and gravitational forces between the phases and turbulent flow. Mass flow rate of the phases in the <b>leaking</b> <b>orifice,</b> the pressure drop {{as a function of}} the time and the velocity distributions are presented and discussed.

40|$|AbstractTo {{test the}} value of {{acceleration}} flow signals proximal to the <b>leaking</b> <b>orifice</b> in assessing the severity of prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation, 39 consecutive patients undergoing left ventriculography were examined by Doppler color flow imaging. Acceleration row signals proximal to the regurgitant orifice were detected in 27 or the 31 patients who had prosthetic mitral regurgitation by left ventriculography (sensitivity 87 %). All four patients without acceleration flow signals had mild prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angiography. No acceleration flow signals were detected in any patient without prosthetic regurgitation by left ventriculography (specificity 100 %). Individual values of the maximal area of acceleration flow signals obtained from three orthogonal planes in seven patients with mild prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angi ography ranged from 0 to 17 mm 2 (mean 4 ± 6). In 8 patients with moderate prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angiography, the maximal area of acceleration flow signals ranged from 21 to 58 mm 2 (mean 33 ± 15), whereas the maximal area of acceleration flow signals in 16 patients with severe prosthetic regurgitation ranged from 20 to 173 mm 2 (mean 102 ± 41). The maximal area of the acceleration flow signals from three planes correlated well with the angiographic grade of prosthetic mitral regurgitation. There {{was a significant difference}} in the maximal area of acceleration flow signals between mild and moderate (p < 0. 001), moderate and severe (p < 0. 001) and mild and severe (p < 0. 001) prosthetic mitral regurgitation. Thus, measurement of acceleration flow signals by Doppler color flow imaging is useful in assessing the severity of prosthetic mitral regurgitation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the impact}} of {{different}} types of leaks on the excess pumping energy required in a distribution pipe is investigated. It is now well established that leakage is directly proportional to the pressure at the leak point in a pipe such that a pressure drop is inevitable. In order to compensate this drop in pressure, the pumping energy required to supply demand at a constant pressure has to be increased. How much more energy is required depends on the type and extent of the leak. For the 3 types of simulated <b>leaks</b> namely: <b>orifice,</b> circumferential and longitudinal slits with the same area of discharge, it is found that the excess pumping energy required for a circumferential crack in the pipe is the highest, followed by the orifice and then longitudinal slit {{as a result of the}} discharge to sustain customer demand and pressure head. The results of this research can be used to design a more robust control system or pump rescheduling strategy in order to save energy and water with regard to design, operation, and rehabilitation of old water distribution system...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} concern of water {{companies}} {{throughout the world}} to have available water resources, which is strongly related to leakage control is not always properly considered within water management companies. Nowadays, the continuous monitoring of water distribution systems is a prerequisite towards the rapid and efficient detection of any abnormal situation. Within European Union priorities, the problematic of available water sources have paid attention {{through the development of}} an integrated policy to reduce and control leakage, as well as to encourage water companies to implement it. A briefly overview of international water framework conciliating water losses and users needs is presented, as well as the main management plans for a better leakage control in water systems. Since <b>leaks</b> are conceptually <b>orifices,</b> the importance of water losses and costs quantification and the benefit of a monitoring system installation are enhanced. Finally, it is presented a practical implementation by a water company in a controlled zone where is showed the type of developed analysis, the need of having an up-to-date database, which operating system and rules must be implemented in order to avoid damages.

40|$|Nowadays helium {{permeation}} leaks are {{the most}} diffused leaks in the lowest flow range, but its flow rate is temperature dependent. On the contrary, <b>orifice</b> <b>leaks</b> has a low coefficient temperature, {{but they have a}} size (about 1 µm) that limits their applicability in the lowest flow range. The Focused Ion Beam is used in widespread fields, both technological and scientific, from nano-technology to semiconductor and material science applications. In the last years a class of Dual Beam workstations, combining a FIB column with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), appeared on the market making easier to treat materials at nano-scale with precise metrology. By means of FIB it is now possible to produce orifices with a diameter on the nanoscale that allow to have flow rates, with 1 atm of pressure differential, comparable to the ranges obtained with permeation leaks. In this work we present a method to produce orifices having a diameter at nanometer scale. The orifices can be used for any gas, including mixtures, and can change continuously the flow rate simply varying the inlet pressure. The paper will present several orifices produced on different materials like silicon nitride, silicon, and metal foils. All membranes have been installed on a copper gasket mountable on NW 16 Conflat® flange and tested as calibrated leaks...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{performed}} {{at the department of}} diagnosis and dependability at Volvo Car Company, Torslanda. The background of this project is based on interest in ascertaining how different factors possibly can affect a diagnosis method, which has been developed to find leaks in the fuel tank and evaporation system. According to the OBD II requirements <b>leaks</b> with an <b>orifice</b> diameter larger or equal to 0, 5 mm, must be detected. The idea of the diagnosis method is to create an over pressure in the system with an air-pump. The current through the pump is measured and correlates to the power consumed by the pump. As the power {{is a function of the}} pressure difference over the pump, the pump current correlates to the pressure in the tank. Thus, the pump current can be used as a measure of the impenetrability. Changes in the system pressure, not caused by the pump, are accordingly disturbances to the method. The object of this work was to develop mathematical models, describing the lapse where the system is pressurized by the pump under the influence of different physical factors. The model is for instance considering variations in temperature and height, flow resistance in lines and valves, component characteristics, fuel evaporation, leaks etc. Furthermore the pump current is treated by the diagnosis evaluation algorithm with purpose to judge whether there is a leak in the system. The model has been implemented in Matlab/Simulink and it can consequently be used in dynamic simulations according to the over pressure leakage detection concept. Numerical experiments can be done in purpose to examine how changes in environmental conditions or component characteristics will affect the diagnosis method. Good agreement has been found between measurements and simulated results. The diagnosis function produces correct decisions under different conditions with disparity in leak sizes, additionally confirming the reliability of the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of features of viscous fluid effluent through the sharp-edged orifices and nozzles is necessary when calculating the heat engine fuel feed systems, device designs of chemical production, {{as well as}} in designing the components of hydraulic actuators and hydraulic control systems. Process of fluid effluent through the round shape orifices is rather well studied: in technical publications experimental values of fluid effluent coefficients and their dependence on Reynolds's number are widely presented. The process of fluid effluent through the sharp-edged nonround shape orifices is a little studied, and there is no quantitative assessment of the orifice shape influence on the fluid effluent coefficients. This work to some extent fills shortage of information in issue under consideration. As an object of study, conditionally sharp-edged equilateral, triangular, square, rectangular, and crosswise orifices were chosen. The inversion process effects on the shape of stream outflowing through the non-round orifice: this process is caused by interaction of surface tension force, aiming to minimize the external surface area of a stream, and force of inertia aimed at momentum conservation of the fluid particle mass being on the trajectory of an elementary stream. Unevenness of field of radial stream rates <b>leaking</b> towards the <b>orifice</b> has essential impact on the shape of the inverted stream. To raise a flow rate capacity of the non-round shape orifices, was used an external tubular non-expanding nozzle representing a short pipe section the length of which is about three - four diameters of the orifice. Control of the absolute pressure value in the camera of open external tubular non-expanding nozzle with a triangular intake orifice allows us to change its flow rate capacity in the certain, rather narrow range. Pressure in the camera of tubular non-expanding nozzle was changed through its regimented opening to atmosphere using an adjustable precision throttle. A controlled absolute pressure in the camera of open external tubular non-expanding nozzle provides a stream rate control depth to 13 %. As a result of the conducted pilot studies it was shown that the flow rate of studied nonround shape orifices with fluid effluent to atmosphere is more than the flow rate capacity of the round orifice, and a value of the flow rate coefficient of equilateral triangular orifice 10 % exceeds the value of the flow rate coefficient of the round orifice. Use of non-round shape orifices as a part of external tubular non-expanding nozzles to increase their flow rate capacity was of essential interest. The experiment has shown that the physics of hydrodynamic processes in the tubular nonexpanding nozzles of the open and closed type is not identical. Calculated values of a flow rate coefficient of external tubular non-expanding nozzle with non-round shape intake orifice are well in compliance with experimental data. The amount of pressure loss with expanding stream in the sleeve of external tubular non-expanding nozzle can be assumed to be equal to the loss of pressure with a suddenly increasing channel diameter, according to Bord's formula. Comparison of calculated and experimental values of flow rate coefficients of external tubular non-expanding nozzles allowed to accept values of coefficient of hydraulic resistance of intake orifice and rate coefficient for the free and flooded streams to be equal and independent on the shape intake orifice. The reason of increasing flow rate capacity of non-round shape orifices can be considered as that of caused by features of a field of the radial stream rates leaking towards the intake orifice and defining increase of the relative area of a stream. </p...|$|R
