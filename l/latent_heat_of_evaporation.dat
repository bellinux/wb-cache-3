The focus {{of this paper is}} on the dependence between water and energy in industry and the way these resources can be managed in an integrated and more sustainable manner. The fundamental methodology supporting the concept of simultaneous management of water and energy is the process systems approach guided by deep understanding of the simultaneous mass and heat transfer, considering phase and pressure changes. Special attention in this case is paid to the utilisation <b>of</b> the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> water <b>evaporation</b> and condensation (allowing for water and heat recycling). The paper takes a new view to water solutions management especially when processes experience difficulties for direct heat recovery. The paper also highlights the link between water management, heat recovery, process efficiency improvement and capacity de-bottlenecking, which bring additional positive impact of proposed methodologies. The advantages of efficiency improvement, water saving and improved environmental impact of proposed solutions are analysed and demonstrated on an industrial case. pm 201...|$|R

Excessive slurry {{is necessary to}} load beyond the anode initially to maintain good contact between the anode and the dewatered slurry. The water removed from the slurry increased significantly with the rotational speed initially and reached a plateau at 240 rpm.

The average solid content of the cake in the chamber after EOD can be 24. 6 wt % with the anode rotating at 240 rpm and 3 times excessive initial loading of slurry. This solid content is 70. 8 % higher than that obtained using a stationary stainless steel anode.

40|$|Sensitivity {{studies on}} Sodium-Water Reaction (SWR), {{which will take}} place in a steam {{generator}} of Liquid Metal Fast Reactor (LMFR) when a heat transfer tube fails, have been carried out using a multi-dimensional computational code: SERAPHIM. An initial pressure of liquid sodium, an interfacial area density and an <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> sodium hy-droxide (NaOH) are chosen as a parameter in this study. An influence of the parameter on a development of high tem-perature zone (> 1; 000 C) and maximum temperature has been investigated from the perspective that one avoids a secondary heat transfer tube failure in a steam generator due to overheating rupture. In the analyses, it is assumed that water vapor leaks into liquid sodium without any barrier for a simplicity. As a result, it is found that the initial pressure and the interfacial area density affect the high temperature zone strongly, whereas they have almost no influence on the maximum temperature in the present configuration. As concerns the <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> sodium hydroxide, it influences not on the high temperature zone but on the maximum temperature. The maximum temperature decreases approximately 200 C due to <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evaporation.</b> It is concluded that the <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> sodium hydroxide will be a key phenomenon for maximum temperature investigation in the SWR...|$|R

Living systems have a unique ability to equilibrate gradients in the nature. Storing energy of the incoming solar radiation into a <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> water <b>evaporation</b> is an example of such tree feature. It dissipates energy and simultaneously recycles nutrients and water in the ecosystem. There are few possible ways of energy balance detection shown in this work.

Mainly moisture and temperature regime and energy fluxes were monitored {{in the period of}} 1. 4. to 30. 9., 2014. All values were dependent on the type of vegetation, and the type and location of the environment. Microclimate analysis was performed on two locations - in a pasture in the basin of Mlýnský stream and wetland habitat in the basin of Horský stream. Both sites are located on the right bank of the Lipno lake. All the necessary meteorological characteristics were measured using automatic weather stations. Indicators of temperatures and humidity of soil and air, received, and the total amount of reflected sunlight and heat balance characteristics - albedo, Bowen ratio, evaporative fraction and heat flows were evaluated. The biggest differences were monitored at heights, in which was measured. In terms of relative humidity, values most varied at canopy level, where the differences were noticeable. The highest mean relative humidity was measured at height of 0. 2 m and 2 m on the wetland. As relative humidity even air temperature is dependent on the height at which it was measured. While the height of 2 m, the values at both sites was almost identical, at the canopy level are differences significant. The average temperature values depend on the season, but the largest amplitude of the temperature reached the sites in June. The surface temperature of the soil at the wetland was almost unchanged, contrary to pasture its course was similar to air temperatures series at the canopy level. The soil temperature at 20 cm was almost the same at both sites. In terms of energy fluxes, {{it was found that the}} highest <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> flux <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> was in wetland. Sensible heat flux was higher in the pasture.

40|$|A {{recently}} introduced measurement approach allows in situ determination of subsurface soil water <b>evaporation</b> by means <b>of</b> heat-pulse probes (HPP). The <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> component <b>of</b> subsurface <b>evaporation</b> is estimated from the residual <b>of</b> the sensible <b>heat</b> balance. This heat balance method requires measurement of vertical soil temperature and estimates of thermal properties for soil water evaporation determination. Our {{objective was to}} employ numerically simulated thermal and hydraulic processes using constant or diurnally cycled surface boundary conditions to evaluate and understand this technique. Three observation grid spacings, namely, 6 mm (tri-needle HPP), 3 mm (penta-needle HPP) and 1 mm, along with three soil textures (sand, silt, and silty clay) were {{used to test the}} heat balance method. The comparison <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> balance–based <b>evaporation</b> rate estimates with an independent soil profile water balance revealed substantial errors when thermal conductivity was averaged spatially across the evaporation front. Since the conduction component <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> flux is the dominant process at the evaporation front, the estimation <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate was significantly improved using depth-dependent instead of a space-averaged. A near-surface “undetectable zone” exists, where the heat balance calculation is irreconcilable, resulting in underestimation <b>of</b> total subsurface <b>evaporation.</b> The method performs better for medium- and coarse-textured soils than for fine-textured soils, where portions of the drying front may be maintained longer within the undetectable zone. Using smaller temperature sensor spacing near the soil surface minimized underestimation from the undetectable zone and improved accuracy <b>of</b> total subsurface <b>evaporation</b> rate estimates...|$|R
40|$|When a vapor bubble in {{a liquid}} changes size, <b>evaporation</b> or {{condensation}} <b>of</b> the vapor {{takes place at}} the surface of the bubble. Because <b>of</b> the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> requirement <b>of</b> <b>evaporation,</b> a change in bubble size must therefore be accompanied by a heat transfer across the bubble wall, such as to cool the surrounding liquid when the bubble grows (or heat it when the bubble becomes smaller). Since the vapor pressure at the bubble wall is determined by the temperature there, the result of a cooling of the liquid is a decrease of the vapor pressure, and this causes a decrease in the rate of bubble growth. A similar effect occurs during the collapse of a bubble which tends to slow down the collapse. In order to obtain a satisfactory theory of the behavior of a vapor bubble in a liquid, these heat transfer effects must be taken into account. In this paper, the equations of motion for a spherical vapor bubble will be derived and applied to the case of a bubble expanding in superheated liquid and a bubble collapsing in liquid below its boiling point. Because of the inclusion <b>of</b> the <b>heat</b> transfer effects, the equations are nonlinear, integro-differential equations. In the case of the collapsing bubble, large temperature variations occur; therefore, tabulated vapor pressure data were used, and the equations of motion were integrated numerically. Analytic solutions are obtainable for the case of the expanding bubble if the period of growth is subdivided into several regimes and the simplifications possible in each regime are utilized. The growth is considered here only during the time that the bubble is small. An asymptotic solution of the equations of motion, valid when the bubble becomes large (i. e. observable), has been presented previously, together with experimental verification. We shall be specifically concerned in the following discussion with the dynamics of vapor bubbles in water. This restriction was made for convenience only, since the theory is applicable without modification to many other liquids...|$|R

The most advanced experience with heat-resisting engineering materials has been gained in gas turbine applications. The potential developments towards higher operating temperatures of alloys based on iron, nickel and cobalt are approaching exhaustion. The next stage may use the higher melting point metals, especially molybdenum, columbium and tungsten, non-metallics such as carbon and ceramics, or combinations of metals and ceramics. The s refractory metals are capable of stressed service at 2500 [degrees]F. (1370 [degrees]C.) and higher, if means of protection against oxidation can be found. On the same condition graphite {{can be used for}} much higher temperatures. For the ballistic missile, ablation of surface layers on the nose cone offers the best prospect of successful heat-dissipation. The ablating material may be an organic material, e. g. synthetic resin, or a ceramic compound. For longer spells at high temperatures, as in satellites on re-entry, the alternatives are thermal insulation by nonmetallic surface coatings, and skins of metals having very high melting points. Coatings which provide insulation and protection from oxidation are provided as flame-sprayed ceramic oxides, especially alumina and zirconia, or ceramics reinforced by a refractory metal grid attached to the base metal. The major technical difficulties in applying the refractory metals to service at very high temperatures arise from their reactivity with ambient gases, especially oxygen, and their tendency to brittleness at low and moderate temperatures.
