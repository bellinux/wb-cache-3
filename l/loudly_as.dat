25|$|On March 3, The Bruins {{were playing}} the Chicago Blackhawks at the Boston Gardens {{in their first}} game since news of the scandal became public. The Boston fans cheered <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> the Bruin players skated onto the ice. Old-time {{followers}} of the Bruins compared the reception to the last time Boston had won the Stanley Cup in 1939. Boston was down 4–1 going into the third period, but rallied to tie the game. With the game at 4–3, Don Gallinger brought the puck down the ice, skillfully getting past at least three Blackhawks players in the process, and passed the puck to Johnny Peirson, who scored his first NHL goal to tie the game.|$|E
25|$|Questioned at {{the scene}} by four officers, Bryson {{initially}} claimed he had been hitchhiking when abducted by Berdella, who had kidnapped, raped, and tortured him for four days before {{he had managed to}} escape by jumping from a window {{on the second floor of}} the property. Furthermore, this individual had kept him bound to a bed on the second floor of the house throughout much of the time he had been held against his will, repeatedly sodomizing him, drugging him, and injecting his throat with drain cleaner to diminish his ability to speak <b>loudly.</b> <b>As</b> Bryson spoke, the officers also noted that in addition to the dog collar and broken foot, Bryson had red, swollen eyes, and visible scars and welts across his entire body. Two officers were told to maintain a discreet surveillance of the property, as Bryson was driven to the Menorah Medical Center, accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the Kansas City Police Department to request a formal search warrant of the property be drafted.|$|E

The door is suddenly flung open and two male colleagues of the counsellor's burst open into the room. In a second they {{take a look at}} the scene, and we see what they see—the counsellor looking lost, Karen looking shocked, and most significantly, David standing over the counsellor, brandishing a fire extinguisher in an apparently threatening manner. Presuming their colleague to be in danger, the two men hurl themselves at David, knocking him to the ground. He squeals as he goes down, and complains <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> he's pinned to the floor." ...|$|E

500|$|... 2001 earned Stanley Kubrick an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, {{as well as}} {{nominations}} for Best Director and Original Screenplay (shared with Arthur C. Clarke). Anthony Masters was also nominated for Best Art Direction. An honorary award was made to John Chambers in that year for his make-up work on Planet of the Apes, and Clarke reports that he [...] "wondered, as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> possible, whether the judges had passed over 2001 because they thought we had used real ape-men". The film won four Baftas, for Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound Track and as Best Road Show, and was a nominee in the Best Film category.|$|E
500|$|Hagmaier {{was present}} during Bundy's final {{interviews}} with investigators. On {{the eve of}} his execution, he talked of suicide. [...] "He did not want to give the state the satisfaction of watching him die", Hagmaier said. Ted Bundy died in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16a.m. EST on January 24, 1989; he was 42 years old. Hundreds of revelers—including 20 off-duty police officers, by one account—sang, danced and set off fireworks in a pasture {{across the street from the}} prison as the execution was carried out, then cheered <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> the white hearse containing Bundy's corpse departed the prison. His remains were cremated in Gainesville, and the ashes scattered at an undisclosed location in the Cascade Range of Washington State, in accordance with his will.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} trailer {{features a}} jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer {{on a tour}} of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is [...] "tracked" [...] with Herrmann's Psycho theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy The Trouble with Harry; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, [...] "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.|$|E

500|$|On July25,1990, Barr {{performed}} [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] {{before a}} baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds at Jack Murphy Stadium. As she later claimed, she was initially having trouble hearing herself over the public-address system, so she was singing as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> possible, and her rendition of the song sounded [...] "screechy". Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr claimed she had been encouraged by baseball officials to [...] "bring humor to the song". The song and the closing routine received heavy media attention and offended many, including President George H. W. Bush, who called her rendition [...] "disgraceful." [...] Barr would revisit this incident during her Comedy Central Roast in 2012, wherein she once again belted out the last few bars of the national anthem, without screeching.|$|E
500|$|In the {{execution}} scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates {{the two parts}} of act1 in Wagner's Parsifal. In the final bars, as Tosca evades Spoletta and leaps to her death, the theme of [...] "E lucevan le stelle" [...] is played tutta forze (as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> possible). This choice of ending has been strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca. Joseph Kerman mocked the final music, [...] "Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams {{the first thing that}} comes into its head." [...] Budden, however, argues that it is entirely logical to end this dark opera on its blackest theme. According to historian and former opera singer Susan Vandiver Nicassio: [...] "The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues gives the end of the opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected discovery among Puccini's papers, can never truly be resolved." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 28 April 1789, Bounty lay about [...] south of the island of Tofua. After a largely sleepless night, Christian had decided to act. He {{understood}} from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and, after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin, he learned the names of several more. With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh [...] "called as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> [...] could in hopes of assistance". The commotion woke Fryer, who saw, from his cabin opposite, the mutineers frogmarching Bligh away. The mutineers ordered Fryer to [...] "lay down again, and hold my tongue or I was a dead man".|$|E
6000|$|... "Whisht; shame's in ye, sirs," [...] {{said the}} voice of a man very <b>loudly,</b> which, <b>as</b> quickly sinking, said in a low but {{distinct}} tone, [...] "It's her father and sister." ...|$|R

2500|$|During the San Diego Comic-Con 2010, Way {{announced}} that the band had finished recording the fourth studio album. This was later confirmed by Iero on the band's website, announcing that the album was [...] "done, finished, kaput, in the proverbial can, and being played <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> we drive way too fast in our respective cars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mahathir {{has been}} a highly {{controversial}} figure, and a subject of harsh attacks by his critics. Former de facto Law Minister Zaid Ibrahim writes in his memoirs: [...] "In my heart, I cannot accept allegations that Dr Mahathir personally was a corrupt man. Corrupt people are never brave enough to speak as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> Dr Mahathir. Wealth {{is not a major}} motivation for him. He only craves power." ...|$|E
2500|$|Medieval shops {{had little}} in common with their modern equivalent. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were {{described}} as little more than [...] "rude booths" [...] and their owners [...] "bawled as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> the itinerants." [...] Cox and Dannehl suggest that the shopper's experience was very different. Glazed windows, which were rare in the seventeenth century, and did not become commonplace until the eighteenth century, meant that shop interiors were dark places. Goods were rarely out on display and the service counter was unknown. Shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Many stores had openings onto the street and served customers from there.|$|E

5000|$|A quote by Jack Cruz Hopkins, Jr., Chalee’s grandson, sums her up thusly: [...] "Anyone {{fortunate}} to have met Pop Chalee never forgot her. She was like a sparkling blue flower and a beautiful human being. Her love of life and her pursuit of beauty enchanted everyone she ever touched. Her Taos kin called her Merina. Her sisters called her Pinkie. Her friends and loyal public called her Pop Chalee. To me she was Grandma Pop ... Nobody could laugh <b>as</b> <b>loudly,</b> smile <b>as</b> clearly, or shine as brightly as my Grandma Pop. She lit up a room." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a comment}} on the {{loudness}} war, Steven Wilson mentioned how he considered placing a message on record sleeves that reads as follows: [...] "Please note that this record may not be mastered as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> {{some of the other}} records in your collection. This is in order to retain the dynamic range and subtlety of the music. Please, use your volume knob." [...] Conversely, the CD version of the album has been proved to contain clipping and dynamic range compression, whereas the 5.1 surround mix on the DVD-A version does not. However, subsequent releases Fear of a Blank Planet and Nil Recurring are mastered at lower levels, preserving more of their original dynamic range.|$|E
2500|$|Thousands of Kuwait {{opposition}} supporters rallied on 24 September, a {{day ahead}} where the [...] Constitutional Court is scheduled to rule on next day if the electoral constituency law {{is in line with}} the constitution based on a request submitted by the government last month. Around 10,000 people, who filled the seaside square opposite the parliament building, cheered <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> opposition figures called for an elected government and warned against what they called a politicised ruling. The next day, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Gulf emirate's electoral constituency law was in line with the constitution, rejecting a government appeal. Dozens of opposition activists who were in the court room hailed the verdict and exchanged congratulations.|$|E
2500|$|Taliban {{restrictions}} on the cultural presence of women covered several areas. Place names including the word [...] "women" [...] were modified so that the word was not used. Women were forbidden to laugh <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> it was considered improper for a stranger to hear a woman's voice. Women were prohibited from participating in sports or entering a sports club. The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) dealt specifically with these issues. It was founded by Meena Keshwar Kamal, a woman who amongst other things established a bi-lingual magazine called Women's Message in 1981. She was assassinated in 1987 {{at the age of}} 30, but is revered as a heroine among Afghan women.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{men wearing}} T-shirts emblazoned with [...] "Greed" [...] leaped {{onto the field}} at Shea Stadium to a {{standing}} ovation, and tossed $160 in $1 bills at the player's feet before being restrained by security, who were <b>loudly</b> booed <b>as</b> the men were escorted from the field.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} done," [...] said Winterborne, not to her, though he spoke the words quite <b>loudly.</b> And <b>as</b> {{the day was}} nearly ended, he added, [...] "Here, Marty, I'll send up a man to plant the rest to-morrow. I've other things to think of just now." ...|$|R
60|$|Edgar and Albert came up {{with the}} force after an hour-and-a-half's riding, and found it halted some four miles from Bruges.

2500|$|Donning the Steinke hood, the testee {{enters the}} water and {{immediately}} commences a rapid ascent, due to the buoyancy of the escape device. [...] As they ascend, each testee must allow the air in his lungs to escape, this is facilitated by yelling as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> possible. [...] Typically they are told to yell [...] "HO HO HO"repeatedly. [...] If one does not forcefully and continuously expel air from the lungs in this manner, they may be gravely injured or killed. [...] The air exiting the lungs is allowed to exit the hood {{through a set of}} two one-way valves, keeping the device inflated but not over-inflated. Upon reaching the top, the testee swims to the side, climbs up, removes his Steinke Hood, deflates it, stands at parade rest, and yells [...] "I FEEL FINE", while a corpsman examines the testee.|$|E
2500|$|Sullivan, already {{bothered by}} the choice of songs, was now even angrier. He cut the Crickets' act from two songs to one, and when {{introducing}} them mispronounced Holly's name, so it came out vaguely as [...] "Hollered" [...] or [...] "Holland." [...] In addition, Sullivan {{saw to it that}} the microphone for Holly's electric guitar was turned off. Holly tried to compensate by singing as <b>loudly</b> <b>as</b> he could, and repeatedly trying to turn up the volume on his guitar. For the instrumental break he cut loose with a dramatic solo, making clear to the audience that the technical fault wasn't his. The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance. Holly's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives; photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan.|$|E
2500|$|Singh felt he {{had been}} more harshly treated because the marker was [...] "the son of a VIP in the Indonesian PGA." [...] He then {{took a job at}} the Keningau Club in Sabah, Malaysia, before his move to the Miri Golf Club in Sarawak. While this was a period of {{hardship}} for him, he continued to gain experience. He saved the money he needed to resurrect his career and began to re-enter tournaments. In 1988 he teamed up with a sponsor, Red Baron, which funded a trip to Africa to compete on the now defunct Safari Tour where he captured his first event, the 1988 Nigerian Open. Locals cheered him <b>loudly,</b> <b>as</b> a man of color had never won the tournament before. At the end of that year he entered the European Tour Qualifying school for the second consecutive year, and was successful on this occasion.|$|E
60|$|The buzz of {{talk was}} going on <b>as</b> <b>loudly</b> and incessantly <b>as</b> before. The whispered {{conversation}} around M. le Contrôleur's bedside had excited no violent curiosity. The first surprise occasioned by His Majesty's unparalleled condescension soon gave way to indifference; {{it was obvious that}} the King's assiduity beside the Minister of Finance was solely due to a more than normal desire for money, and these royal demands for renewed funds were too numerous to cause more than passing interest.|$|R
