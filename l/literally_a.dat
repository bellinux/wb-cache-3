5|$|Cathedrals {{are places}} where the Christian rituals {{particular}} to a bishop, especially ordination and enthronement, can be performed, and are structured and furnished for these purposes. Each cathedral contains {{the seat of the}} local bishop, often <b>literally</b> <b>a</b> large throne. The bishop's throne is located towards the eastern end of the cathedral, near the high altar, which is main focus of worship.

In the early Medieval period, the altar always contained, or was associated with, the relics of a saint. Sometimes the relics were held in a separate shrine, near the high altar. In this part of the church are often located the tombs of former bishops, typically arranged either side of the major shrine, so the worshipping congregation symbolically comprised the whole body of clergy of the diocese, both living and dead, in communion with their patron saint. Seats are provided for the other significant clergy of the cathedral: the dean who is the foremost priest at the cathedral, the precentor, sacristan, archdeacon and canons.|$|E
