5|$|The {{first four}} {{sections}} (Beavers to Explorers) {{are led by}} a Section Leader and aided by Assistant Leaders, Sectional Assistants, Occasional Helpers and Young <b>Leaders,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> Explorer Scouts trained in leadership techniques. Scout Networks are mainly member led, but are assisted by a Network Leader who ensures that the Network is working within {{the rules of the}} association. In addition to adult leadership, the association encourages its members themselves to take on positions of responsibility for their section meetings. This can be through responsibility for a group of members, such as the Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol Leader in Scouts and Sixers and Seconders in Cubs, or through sectional forums to feedback on programmes. The Scout section also have the role of Senior Patrol Leader, usually someone about to move on to Explorers who overlooks all the patrols, {{and the members of the}} Explorer section are openly encouraged to run evenings and to plan their own meetings.|$|E

25|$|Through Oroonoko {{and other}} male characters, the speaker shows men as {{dominant}} <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> accompanied by strong female companions. In her text, The Romance of Empire: Oroonoko and the Trade in Slaves, Laura Brown emphasises {{the significance of}} female characters. Although men are obviously important in the novel, Brown states that “female figures—either Imoinda or the narrator and her surrogates—appear as incentives or witnesses for almost all of Oroonoko’s exploits”. Throughout the novel, Imoinda supports Oroonoko {{in all of his}} decisions, even when he suggests that he kill her to escape their slavery. Furthermore, Brown claims that Oroonoko is not alone during his execution because “ mother and Sister were by him”.|$|E

The codes of conduct in the guidelines include that publishers [...] "respect our sacred spaces as places of prayer, worship, peace, learning and heritage"; that they [...] "do not assume that sacred space interiors are copyright free"; that they [...] "get permission from the faith <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> responsible for the building interiors you want to clone"; and that they [...] "support the work of those engaged in resisting the culture of gun crime and those involved in promoting the work of conflict resolution." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though {{he also says}} that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It {{is not the kind of}} anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.|$|E
500|$|Anwar Ibrahim, former UMNO deputy President {{and former}} Deputy Prime Minister, whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat became the second-largest party in Parliament after the elections, and {{the de facto}} leader of the {{opposition}} Pakatan Rakyat coalition, chose to instead reject ketuanan Melayu in favour of [...] "ketuanan rakyat" [...] (people's supremacy). Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno <b>leaders,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians." [...] A week later, his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, told the press that [...] "we should not keep talking about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which is not what the people want to see," [...] urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat.|$|E

Regenvanu argued that the executive of existing parties was controlled by veteran politicians, inhibiting the rise of new, younger politicians. Regenvanu stated that a core objective of the party would be [...] "to try and put good leaders into parliament and into politics at all levels.

2500|$|Much {{research}} has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that [...] "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all." [...] One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic leadership exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.|$|E

The track is called [...] "King Push". Phoenix then denied in a statement to XXL having produced the record, saying [...] "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend’s son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye 's camp.". He is set to produce a documentary about LGBT teenagers on summer camp.|$|E
2500|$|When the 2011–2012 Russian protests {{had begun}} in late 2011, in {{response}} to the Russian legislative election, 2011, Clinton had been outspoken about the need for legitimate democratic processes there, saying in December 2011: [...] "The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> accountable to them." [...] She added that [...] "Russian voters deserve a full investigation of electoral fraud and manipulation." [...] In return, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin denounced Clinton, accusing her of backing Russian protesters financially and in fact precipitating their actions: [...] "They heard this signal and {{with the support of the}} U.S. State Department began their active work." [...] When Putin won the Russian presidential election, 2012 in March 2012, some in the State Department wanted to denounce Russian process again, but they were overruled by the White House, and Clinton stated simply that [...] "The election had a clear winner, and we are ready to work with President-elect Putin." ...|$|E

She insists that many contemporary Muslims have not yet transitioned to modernity, and that many Muslim immigrants are culturally unsuited {{to life in the}} West and are therefore a burden. Ali calls upon atheist and Christian Euro-Americans to unite against the Muslim extremism in the [...] West. She [...] urges the former to educate Muslims and the latter, especially Western Churches, to convert [...] "as many Muslims as possible to Christianity, introducing them to a God who rejects Holy War and who has sent his son to die for all sinners out of love for mankind". Hirsi Ali stated that: [...] "Islam needs a reformation. Muslim <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> serious about achieving true and enduring peace, need to revise the Koran and the Hadith, so there is a consistency between what the peaceloving Muslims want and what their religion says." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{international}} {{offices of}} some of the unions and the national leadership of the AFL began to exert pressure on the General Strike Committee and individual unions to end the strike. Some locals gave in to this pressure and returned to work. The executive committee of the General Strike Committee, pressured by the AFL and international labor organizations, proposed ending the general strike at midnight on February 8, but their recommendation was voted down by the General Strike Committee. On February 8, some streetcar operators returned to work and restored some critical city transportation services. Seattle's main department store reopened as well. Then teamsters and newsboys returned to work. On February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the general strike on February 11 and by noon on that day it was over. It stated its reasons: [...] "Pressure from international officers of unions, from executive committees of unions, from the 'leaders' in the labor movement, even from those very <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still called 'Bolsheviki' by the undiscriminating press. And, added to all these, the pressure upon the workers themselves, not of the loss of their own jobs, but of living in a city so tightly closed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The school newspaper, The Towerlight, {{announced}} that in February 2008, the school administration {{was planning to}} implement a [...] "Free Speech Policy". The policy defines several things that would be considered free speech, and that students would be restricted to where they could assemble and have demonstrations or protests. This has caused serious backlash from the students, and has solicited various protests on campus and vocal dissent from the Student Government Association as well. Jenny Haley, the SGA president at the time, said the policy was not discussed nor negotiated with the SGA and that she feels {{it is a mistake}} to exclude students from the decision making process. It was also noted that during a meeting with the administration to discuss the policy, several administrators said that the only input initially solicited from students for the Free Speech policy was from a committee called the Student Leadership Council that consists of student <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in charge of large student groups. Several of the students contested that not only did they not know who was on this committee, but that most of them did not even know that kind of committee even existed.|$|E
