The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to <b>learn,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E

500|$|Music critic Bruce Eder, in {{a review}} for the AllMusic website, wrote the Beach Boys [...] "brush up against {{the dark side of}} the '60s, in the form of 'Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love'". In his {{assessment}} of the song, Richie Unterberger commented [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] is far more notorious for its relation to Manson, not the music itself which he describes as [...] "average". Author Carl Larkin, in his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, wrote the track [...] "had the ironic distinction of putting Charles Manson in the charts". Journalist Nathan Jolly called the song [...] "softer but still eerie", also noting how fans of the Beach Boys who listened to the song over the years [...] "had no idea of the inherent evil of its actual composer". Throughout the years, [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] has appeared on several other Beach Boys compilations and bootlegs.|$|E

In 1969, [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] was included on the Beach Boys' 15th studio album 20/20. The song was actually an altered version of [...] "Cease to Exist", composed by aspiring folk singer-songwriter and later convicted murder-conspirator Charles Manson. Musically, Wilson deviated from Manson's blues influence, reworking it to fit the band's pop-oriented approach.|$|E

500|$|A {{level of}} intrigue {{surrounds}} the song chiefly because of Manson's hand in its creation and his brief relationship with Wilson. Soon {{after the release}} of [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love", Manson, along with his [...] "Family", was infamously convicted of several murders. Manson himself recorded the original arrangement of the song for his debut album , released in March 1970. Reception toward [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] is often mixed, considering its sinister background, but music critics credit Manson's rendition as his most accomplished work. Since its original distribution, the song appears on several compilation albums by the Beach Boys.|$|E

The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, I want you to think how nice it is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E

500|$|According to writer Peter Ames Carlin, Manson penned [...] "Cease to Exist" [...] {{specifically}} for the Beach Boys to record. In exchange for his rights to [...] "Cease to Exist", Manson received a sum of cash and a BSA motorcycle which he later gave to Family member [...] "Little" [...] Paul Watkins. When Wilson acquired the song from him, for the most part, he abided Manson's original specifications. However, {{in an attempt to}} better accommodate the group's trademark vocal harmonies, Wilson reworked the song's bluesy structure and added another bridge. In addition, [...] "Cease to Exist"'s lyrics were also partially altered (most notably the opening lyric [...] "Cease to exist" [...] to [...] "Cease to resist"), and the title of the song was changed to [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] as a result, much to Manson's indignation. [...] The Beach Boys recorded the track at Brian Wilson's home studio on September 11 and 16–18, 1968.|$|E
500|$|General George Washington, {{commander}} in chief of the Continental Army, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs. [...] Lafayette met him at a dinner on 5 August 1777; according to Leepson, [...] "the two men bonded almost immediately." [...] Washington was impressed by the young man's enthusiasm and was inclined to think well of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in awe of the commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, [...] "I am here to <b>learn,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> teach." [...] He became a member of Washington's staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as [...] "friend and father".|$|E

In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you <b>learn</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take everything so literally." ...|$|E

Benjamin discussed her character's motive: [...] "There has always been a spark between her and Phil and it’s never been put out. Lisa has tried to love Mark and in her own way, she does— but it’s not passionate between them. She knows it’s wrong. She chose Mark, but Phil is her weakness. She wants him, and there’s nothing she can do about it. Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa’s being impulsive. She’s a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn’t want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn’t have with Mark— passion. You’d think she’d <b>learn</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it’s happening again. She’s playing with fire, but it’s exciting.” Explaining his interpretation of Phil's motive, Steve McFadden added, [...] "He likes the new, spirited Lisa. She’s very different from the girl who let him walk all over her. She was just living to please him and he didn’t like that [...] Lisa isn’t the woman she used to be. She fought to keep her family together. She stood up to Phil. She even shot him! He wants a family, and he’s also attracted to her.” ...|$|E
