50|$|After leaving Kilmarnock, Barr went {{on trial}} with Scottish Premiership side Partick Thistle in July 2014 and also played as a trialist in {{pre-season}} for Motherwell. On 1 September 2014, Barr signed for Ross County. He made his debut on 13 September 2014, in a 2-1 home defeat against Motherwell. His season was ended in November 2014, when {{he suffered a}} knee injury against Aberdeen and underwent cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>surgery.</b> At {{the end of the}} season, Barr was released by Ross County.|$|E
50|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} <b>ligament</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{a complex}} operation that requires expertise {{in the field of}} orthopedic and sports medicine. Many factors should be considered when discussing surgery including the athlete's level of competition, age, previous knee injury, other injuries sustained, leg alignment and graft choice. Occasionally, stimulation of the body's natural ability to heal the native ligament, called a “healing response”, is relied upon. More commonly, the ligament must be replaced by a graft from the patient's own tissue or tissue from a cadaver. Graft choice could be confusing, requiring expert counseling from a doctor.|$|E

In 2004, he joined Gwangju Sangmu for military duties. He mostly played for Icheon Sangmu that was reserve team of Gwangju Sangmu and played at the Korea National League. He was given hardship discharge because of cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>surgery.</b> He played for Daegu FC for one year. He also played V-League side Cảng Sài Gòn and Korea National League side Suwon City. He quit his career because cruciate ligament injury.|$|E
5000|$|Bourne also {{appeared}} on the Raw brand, saving Rey Mysterio from an assault by Kane. The two defeated John Morrison and The Miz the following week. At Cyber Sunday in October, WWE fans chose Bourne to face Matt Hardy for the ECW Championship. He was pinned after Hardy performed a Twist of Fate on him. Two days later, during a six-man tag match on ECW, he landed a dive from the ring on his right ankle, dislocating it and tearing his deltoid <b>ligament.</b> <b>Surgery</b> was not necessary, but Bourne was not medically cleared {{to return to the}} ring. On December 8, he won the [...] "Best Finishing Maneuver" [...] Slammy award for his shooting star press.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} for the PCL to heal on its own. Surgery is usually required in complete tears of the <b>ligament.</b> <b>Surgery</b> usually takes place after a few weeks, {{in order to allow}} swelling to decrease and regular motion to return to the knee. A procedure called ligament reconstruction is used to replace the torn PCL with a new ligament, which is usually a graft taken from the hamstring or Achilles tendon from a host cadaver. An arthroscope allows a complete evaluation of the entire knee joint, including the knee cap (patella), the cartilage surfaces, the meniscus, the ligaments (ACL & PCL), and the joint lining. Then, the new ligament is attached to the bone of the thigh and lower leg with screws to hold it in place.|$|E

5000|$|Prof. Toft {{has made}} his name in two areas. The first is the arthroscopic {{replacement}} of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) which he was first to perform in Europe in 1983, thus instituting a revolution in cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>surgery.</b> The other highlight in his work is abrasion arthroplasty, a technique introduced by his teacher, Professor Lanny L. Johnson of the Michigan State University in Lansing, which Prof. Toft has developed into a very useful tool for [...] "regeneration" [...] of severely arthritic knee joints {{in order to prevent}} knee replacement surgery. In recognition of these developments Prof. Toft was offered a professorship at the University of Milan in 2005. Together with Prof. Walter Pascale of the University of Milan, Prof. Toft founded the International Association for Biologic Joint Reconstruction in Munich in October 2006.|$|E

Surgery to repair the posterior cruciate ligament is controversial due to its placement and technical difficulty.|$|E
50|$|The next {{aspect of}} the surgery is {{preparation}} and placement of the reconstruction grafts. The preparation can be done while the other steps are being completed by another surgeon or physician’s assistant. The semitendinosus tendon can be harvested using a hamstring stripper for use as the reconstruction autograft. The autograft is sectioned into a 16-cm length for the sMCL reconstruction and 12-cm length for the POL reconstruction. These lengths are also used if the surgery is done with cadaver allograft. The sMCL and POL grafts are pulled into their respective femoral tunnels and each secured with a cannulated bioabsorbable screw. The grafts are passed distally along their native courses to the tibial attachments. The sMCL is passed under sartorius fascia (and any remaining sMCL fibers). Both grafts are passed (but not yet secured) into their respective tibial tunnels using the existing eyelet pins. If simultaneous cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>surgery</b> is underway, the cruciate reconstructions are secured before securing the medial ligaments.|$|E
40|$|Title: Casuistry of {{physiotherapy}} care {{of patient}} after anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> reconstruction <b>surgery</b> of knee Objectives: The {{purpose of the}} theoretical part of the thesis is to introduce the issue of soft tissue injury of the knee joint, especially anterior cruciate ligament. Acquaintance with conservative and surgical treatment, physical therapy and physiotherapeutical care after <b>ligament</b> reconstruction <b>surgery.</b> The special part of the thesis presents casuistry of physiotherapy care of patient after anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> reconstruction <b>surgery</b> of knee. Methods: Bachelor thesis consists of two parts, theoretical and special. The first part contains theoretical knowledge about soft tissue injury of the knee joint, possibilities of examination, conservative and surgical treatment. The second part is concerned with casuistry of physiotherapy care of patient. Results: During therapy the reflex changes in the right lower limb have been eliminated, the shortened muscles have been elongated, weakened muscles have been strenghtened and the joint play {{of the head of}} fibula and the patella has been re-established.

50|$|Bullard {{made his}} Hull debut as a {{substitute}} in their 28 January 2009 match against West Ham, but picked up a knee injury during the game. The injury was to the same knee that Bullard dislocated whilst at Fulham, but was not initially thought {{to be related to}} the prior damage. However, it was sufficiently serious to necessitate Bullard flying back to the same surgeon, Richard Steadman, in the United States for further knee surgery. On 19 February it was declared that he would be out for the rest of the season after the cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>surgery.</b> He returned to action on 6 October, in a reserve team match against Bolton, scoring a long range effort after cutting in on the inside of a Bolton defender. His Premier League return was off the bench on 19 October 2009 against his old club, Fulham, a 2-0 defeat. He scored his first goal for Hull, a free kick, against West Ham on 21 November 2009. He also scored his second goal for the club in the same game, this time from the penalty spot. His third goal for Hull came against Manchester City, again from the penalty spot. After the goal he imitated Hull manager Phil Brown's on-pitch team talk from the same fixture the previous season.|$|E
50|$|Dusan Langura {{began his}} high school career as a junior at Furtah Preparatory School, a small private school located in Acworth, Georgia. He lived with the Humphery family in nearby Woodstock, Georgia. Dusan came in Woodstock, Georgia shortly before his junior {{year of high school}} after living in Los Angeles, California. Dusan gained fame in Woodstock, Georgia for his {{shooting}} ability after playing at the local LA Fitness gym. As a junior, he averaged 15.4 points, 6.5 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 0.3 steals per game. The Furtah Prep Falcons lost in the Georgia Independent School Association Class AA State Finals against the Frederica Academy Knights of St. Simons. Langura played the Georgia Independent School Association state finals with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. During his senior year of high school, Dusan came back on the court 8 months after his anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>surgery.</b> After not being able to play AAU during the summer of his junior year, Langura was not being heavily recruited by NCAA Division I schools. In November of his senior year, Langura broke the Furtah Preparatory School three points record scoring 35 points and hitting 9 three pointers against Heritage Academy. After this game, Langura started drawing interest from several low major NCAA Division I schools. After being undefeated for most of the season, the Furtah Prep Falcons ended up losing again against Frederica Academy in the Elite 8 of the Georgia Independent School Association Class AA State Championship in 2 overtimes. Dusan Langura was selected for the Georgia Independent School Association Class AA All-star Game, however refused to go feeling he didn’t accomplished what he was supposed to accomplish his senior year of high school. Langura won the most academic and most athletic award during his senior year of high school. Dusan Langura graduated in 2012 from Furtah Preparatory School as high school valedictorian with a 4.27 Grade Point Average. Despite having interest from Ivy League schools to play basketball and other low major NCAA Division I schools, Langura decided to stay in the state of Georgia and enroll at The University of Georgia coached by former Nevada Wolf Pack men’s basketball program head coach Mark Fox.|$|E
