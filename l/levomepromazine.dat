50|$|A {{significant}} part of the clinically approved drugs are lipophilic weak bases with lysosomotropic properties. This explains a number of pharmacological properties of these drugs, such as high tissue-to-blood concentration gradients or long tissue elimination half-lifes; these properties have been found for drugs such as haloperidol, <b>levomepromazine,</b> and amantadine. However, high tissue concentrations and long elimination half-lives are explained also by lipophilicity and absorption of drugs to fatty tissue structures. Important lysosomal enzymes, such as acid sphingomyelinase, may be inhibited by lysosomally accumulated drugs. Such compounds are termed FIASMAs (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase) and include for example fluoxetine, sertraline, or amitriptyline.|$|E

This study was a comparative investigation of the clinical efficacy and safety of IM olanzapine and IM <b>levomepromazine</b> in agitated elderly patients with schizophrenia at 2 hours post-dose. Methods: The subjects were 52 inpatients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -IV. Their clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC), PANSS, and Agitation Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), and their safety was assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), and glucose test. Results: The PANSS-EC total score, the ACES score, and the glucose level significantly decreased from baseline in both the IM olanzapine group and the <b>levomepromazine</b> injection group; however, no between-group differences were observed. Mean change from baseline in the PANSS total score, positive score, the BARS score, and the DIEPSS total score was significantly greater in the IM olanzapine injection group compared with the <b>levomepromazine</b> injection group. Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} suggest that agitated elderly patients rapidly respond to IM olanzapine and IM <b>levomepromazine</b> treatment.

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>levomepromazine</b> and different desflurane concentrations upon electrocardiographic variables. Animals Twenty adult mongrel dogs of both sexes weighing 6 - 28 kg. Methods Dogs {{were divided into two}} groups of 10 animals. Group I received 1 mg kg(- 1) lV of <b>levomepromazine</b> and 15 minutes later anesthesia was induced with propofol (3 mg kg(- 1) IV). Desflurane end-tidal concentration was set at 1. 6 MAC. After 30 minutes at this concentration, measurements were taken and the end-tidal concentration was reduced to 1. 4 MAC. Thereafter, it was reduced to 1. 2 and then 1. 0 MAC at 1. 5 -minute intervals. The same procedure was followed for group 2, except that <b>levomepromazine</b> was replaced with 0. 2 mL kg(- 1) of 0. 9 % saline solution and more propofol was needed for induction (7 mg kg(- 1)). The animals' body temperature was maintained between 38. 3 and 39 degreesC using a heating pad. The electrocardiographic tracing was obtained from lead II throughout the experimental period. The measurements were taken immediately before the administration of <b>levomepromazine</b> or placebo (T- 1), 15 minutes after pre-medication (T- 2) and 30 minutes after the establishment of 1. 6 MAC (T- 3) The other measurements were made at the concentrations of 1. 4, 1. 2, and 1. 0 MAC, respectively (T 4 - 6).

No clear change in the urinary metabolic ratio of debrisoquine/ 4 -OH-debrisoquine (MR) was seen {{with any of the}} single beta-adrenoceptor antagonist treatments, but the MR value increased significantly when all beta-adrenoceptor blocker treatments were considered together.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of the pretreatment of dogs with <b>levomepromazine</b> on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane.

After 15 min, 5 ± 3 mg/kg propofol was administered iv, followed by 1. 6 MAC of desflurane. Thirty minutes after the establishment of the initial concentration, the dogs were submitted to an electric stimulus (30 Hz, 200 V, 4 mA, 5 s) applied to the labial fold. If no movement was observed by the end of the stimulus, the reservoir bag was emptied and the MAC was reduced by 0. 2 MAC, with the circuit being saturated with the new concentration of the anesthetic (1. 4 MAC) and 15 min later another electric stimulus identical to the first one was applied. Desflurane concentration was reduced by 0. 2 MAC every 15 min, with the electric stimulus being discontinued when the animal moved. The MAC was defined as the mean concentration between the desflurane dose at which movement was observed and the immediately preceding dose. Respiratory rate and end tidal CO 2 were measured immediately before administration of the drugs (T 1), 15 min after <b>levomepromazine</b> or placebo administration (T 2), and 30 min after the establishment of the initial concentration of the anesthetic agent (T 3).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sedative and antinociceptive effects of three dopaminergic blockers often used in veterinary medicine. The study was conducted on 10 Thoroughbred mares. Sedation was evaluated by determining the spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) in automated individual behavior stalls and by measuring head ptosis (HP). The intravenous injection of acepromazine (0. 05; 0. 08 and 0. 11 mg/kg) and azaperone (0. 25; 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/kg) did not induce significant changes on SLA. In contrast, intramuscular injection of <b>levomepromazine</b> caused an increase in SLA at the dosages of 0. 75 and 1. 0 mg/kg, but not at 0. 5 mg/kg. Significant head ptosis occurred with all dosages and drugs.

The primary metabolic pathways of caffeine are 3 -N-demethylation to paraxanthine (CYP 1 A 2), 1 -N-demethylation to theobromine and 7 -N-demethylation to theophylline (CYP 1 A 2 and other enzymes), and 8 -hydroxylation to 1, 3, 7 -trimethyluric acid (CYP 3 A).
