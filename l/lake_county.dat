5|$|By 1958, SR-201 between US-40 west of Magna and SR-68 (Redwood Road) was a two-lane highway through rural Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>County.</b> The rural {{landscape}} {{changed by the}} time SR-201 intersected 300 West and entered urban Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>County,</b> the highway becoming a four-lane road. The route remained this way until the intersection of 1300 East (SR-181), where the route reverted to a two-lane configuration. By 1965, {{a time when most}} U.S. Routes in the city were being replaced by Interstate Highways, all two-lane portions of the road east of 1300 East were widened to at least four lanes; an interchange between US-40, US-40A and future I-215 was being built at the mouth of Parley's Canyon. From under-construction I-15 west to Redwood Road, the old route of SR-201 was being superseded by a six-lane freeway directly to the south. All construction was complete by 1970 with interchanges at 900 West and Redwood Road; the new freeway extended west to 2700 West.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire is {{a village}} in Vernon Township, <b>Lake</b> <b>County,</b> in the U.S. state of Illinois. The village is a {{northern}} suburb of Chicago. The population of Lincolnshire was 7,275 at the 2010 census. Lincolnshire was incorporated on August 5, 1957, from the unincorporated Half Day area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision. The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s. The Des Plaines River bisects the village, passing from north to south; Illinois Route 22 also divides the village into two parts, crossing the village from east to west.|$|E

25|$|Thompson and Governor James Withycombe, both Republicans, {{agreed that}} Bernard Daly, <b>Lake</b> <b>County's</b> long-time county judge and a Democrat, {{was the right}} person to be <b>Lake</b> <b>County's</b> new {{district}} court judge. As a result, just three days after the 1915 legislative session adjourned, Withycombe appointed Daly to <b>Lake</b> <b>County's</b> new district judge position. Thompson filed for re-election to his state senate in January 1916. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Shortly after the primary, he announced he would seek a second term as Senate President and began meeting with carry-over senators and Republican candidates for the senate. However, Thompson lost his senate seat in the general election to Judge George T. Baldwin of Klamath Falls by one vote. Thompson won Crook, Jefferson, and <b>Lake</b> <b>counties</b> with a 325-vote margin, but lost Klamath County by 326 votes. At the time, newspapers speculated that he may have lost his seat {{as a result of his}} litigation work dealing with disputed water rights in south central Oregon.|$|R

5|$|State Route 201 (SR-201) is an east–west {{expressway}} and freeway {{located in}} Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>County</b> in the U.S. state of Utah. Colloquially {{known as the}} 21st South Freeway, the route serves {{as an alternative to}} Interstate 80 (I-80) through Salt Lake City. From the western terminus of the route west of Magna, the highway heads east through Kennecott Copper property as an expressway before running through the western suburbs of Salt Lake City as a freeway. Shortly after the route returns on a surface route, SR-201 terminates on its eastern end at State Street (U.S. Route 89).|$|E
5|$|The Lincolnshire {{area was}} {{originally}} {{a part of}} the town of Half Day, the first region settled by non-Native American peoples in <b>Lake</b> <b>County.</b> The first white settler in the Lincolnshire area was Captain Daniel Wright, who arrived in 1834.

5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the <b>Lake</b> <b>County</b> Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of <b>Lake</b> <b>County</b> rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E
