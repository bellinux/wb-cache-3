40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{rifamycin}} synthetase is primed with a 3 -amino- 5 -hydroxybenzoate starter unit by a <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> {{that contains}} domains homologous to the adenylation and thiolation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Adenylation and thiolation {{activities of the}} <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> were reconstituted in vitro and shown to be independent of coenzyme A, countering literature proposals that the <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> is a coenzyme A ligase. Kinetic parameters for covalent arylation of the <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> were measured directly for the unnatural substrates benzoate and 3 -hydroxybenzoate. This analysis was extended through competition experiments to determine the relative rates of incorporation {{of a series of}} substituted benzoates. Our results show that the <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> can accept a variety of substituted benzoates, although it exhibits a preference for the 3 -, 5 -, and 3, 5 -disubstituted benzoates that most closely resemble its biological substrate. The considerable substrate tolerance of the <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> of rifamycin synthetase suggests that the module has potential as a tool for generating substituted derivatives of natural products. The rifamycin synthetase 1 of Amycolatopsis mediterranei is responsible for the biosynthesis of prosansamycin X, a precursor to the antibiotic rifamycin B (Figure 1). The rifamycin synthetase consists of a core of five multifunctiona...|$|R

In this work, acyltransferase (AT) domain swaps, mutagenesis, and cross-complementation with heterologous polyketide synthase domain (PKS) <b>loading</b> <b>modules</b> were performed {{in order to facilitate}} production of new analogues of the polyene macrolide nystatin. Replacement of AT 0 in the nystatin PKS <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> NysA with the propionate-specific AT 1 from the nystatin PKS NysB, construction of hybrids between NysA and the <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> of rimocidin PKS RimA, and stepwise exchange of specific amino acids in the AT 0 domain by site-directed mutagenesis were accomplished. However, none of the NysA mutants constructed was able to initiate production of new nystatin analogues. Nevertheless, many NysA mutants and hybrids were functional, providing for different levels of nystatin biosynthesis. An interplay between certain residues in AT 0 and an active site residue in the ketosynthase (KS) -like domain of NysA in initiation of nystatin biosynthesis was revealed. Some hybrids between the NysA and RimA <b>loading</b> <b>modules</b> carrying the NysA AT 0 domain were able to prime rimocidin PKS with both acetate and butyrate units upon complementation of a rimA-deficient mutant of the rimocidin/CE- 108 producer Streptomyces diastaticus. Expression of the PimS 0 <b>loading</b> <b>module</b> from the pimaricin producer in the same host, however, resulted in production of CE- 108 only. Taken together, these data indicate relaxed substrate specificity of NysA AT 0 domain, which is counteracted by a strict specificity of the first extender module KS domain in the nystatin PKS of Streptomyces noursei...|$|R

50|$|A Test Double is a test-specific {{capability}} that {{substitutes for}} a system capability, typically a class or function, that the UUT depends on. There are two times at which test doubles can be introduced into a system: link and execution. Link time substitution is when the test double is compiled into the <b>load</b> <b>module,</b> which is executed to validate testing. This approach is typically used when running in an environment other than the target environment that requires doubles for the hardware level code for compilation. The alternative to linker substitution is run-time substitution in which the real functionality is replaced during the execution of a test case. This substitution is typically done through the reassignment of known function pointers or object replacement.|$|E

5000|$|Program-controlled interruptionPoOps {{indicates}} that the channel has fetched a CCW with the PCI bit set. The channel continues processing; this interruption simply informs the CPU of the channel's progress. An example {{of the use of}} Program-controlled interruption is in the [...] "Program Fetch" [...] function of Contents Supervision, whereby the control program is notified that a Control/Relocation Record has been read. To ensure that this record has been completely read into main storage, a [...] "disabled bit spin", one of the few which remains in the control program, is initiated. Satisfaction of the spin {{indicates that}} the Control/Relocation Record is completely in main storage and the immediately preceding Text Record may be relocated. After relocation, a NOP CCW is changed to a TIC and the channel program continues. In this way, an entire <b>load</b> <b>module</b> may be read and relocated while utilizing only one EXCP, and possibly only one revolution of the disk drive.
