5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of industry, the company still found itself with {{thousands}} of acres of land that could be developed. William M. <b>Ladd,</b> who had succeeded Reed as President of Oregon Iron and Steel and his father as President of <b>Ladd</b> & Tilton Bank, formed the <b>Ladd</b> Estate Company to manage these real estate assets. The newly formed <b>Ladd</b> Estate Company converted the depressed company town into a prestigious suburb complete with country club, golf course, polo field, and even worked to rename the harsh-sounding Sucker Lake to Oswego Lake. The company existed as a shell until 1960, when in its final act, it deeded its powerhouse and dams to lake shareholders.|$|E

5|$|Dolman joined Howard and Lucas at Skywalker Ranch for {{a series}} of lengthy story conferences, and wrote seven drafts of his script between the spring and fall of 1986. Pre-production began in late 1986. Various major film studios turned down the chance to {{distribute}} and co-finance it with Lucasfilm because they believed the fantasy genre was unsuccessful. This was largely due to films such as Krull, Legend, Dragonslayer, and Labyrinth. Lucas took it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which was headed by Alan <b>Ladd,</b> Jr. <b>Ladd</b> and Lucas shared a relationship {{as far back as the}} mid-1970s, when <b>Ladd,</b> running 20th Century Fox, greenlighted Lucas' idea for Star Wars. However, in 1986, MGM was facing financial troubles, and major investment in a fantasy film was perceived as a risk. <b>Ladd</b> advanced half the $35 million budget for it in return for theatrical and television rights, leaving Lucasfilm with home video and pay television rights to offer in exchange for the other half.|$|E

40|$|Background: Congenital midgut malrotation {{is rarely}} {{encountered}} outside the pediatric population. The <b>Ladd’s</b> procedure {{is the standard}} corrective measure for intestinal malrotation in children and consists of division of peritoneal bands (<b>Ladd’s</b> bands) traversing the posterior abdomen, reduction of volvulus, appendectomy, and functional postioning of the intestine with or without fixation.

5|$|To {{alleviate}} {{shortages and}} supply the war effort, the U.S. Army and the Canadian government began {{construction of the}} Alaska Highway, which connected the Canadian road network to Alaska's Richardson Highway and Fairbanks. The highway was completed in fall 1942 and regular traffic began in 1943. As work on the highway took place, war supplies were already reaching Fairbanks through the air. The Northwest Staging Route, a chain of airfields, ended at Fairbanks. Starting in February 1942, supply aircraft began landing in Fairbanks to supply the war effort in Alaska. In summer 1942, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union resulted in {{an extension of the}} Lend-Lease effort to Russia. Using the Northwest Staging Route, aircraft were flown from Great Falls, Montana, to <b>Ladd</b> Field. At <b>Ladd</b> Field, the aircraft were turned over to Soviet pilots, who flew them to Nome and on to the Soviet Union. Fairbanks was chosen as a transfer location because it was more protected from potential Japanese attack than Nome.|$|E

40|$|Intestinal malrotation {{is rare in}} adults. Patients {{may present}} with acute {{obstruction}} or chronic abdominal pain. These symptoms are caused by <b>Ladd′s</b> bands and narrow mesentery resulting from incomplete gut rotation. Barium, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography and sometimes explorative laparotomy are used for diagnosis. <b>Ladd′s</b> procedure is the treatment of choice but data about laparoscopic approach in adult is scarce. We report three cases of laparoscopic correction of adult malrotation presenting with chronic abdominal pain. The diagnosis is made by CT/MRI. Laparoscopic <b>Ladd′s</b> procedure (release of bands, broadening of mesentery and appendicectomy) was performed via three ports. Procedure time 25 - 45 min. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 2. At 6 month follow-up, all are symptom free.

5|$|While at Paramount, in 1955, he {{produced}} the highly commercially successful Strategic Air Command, starring James Stewart. After {{the success of}} Strategic Air Command, Paramount obtained the rights to The Sons of Katie Elder, and assigned the project to Briskin to produce, with Alan <b>Ladd</b> starring. However, when <b>Ladd</b> brought out {{the remainder of his}} contract with Paramount, the film was put on hold, and would not be produced until 1965, by a different producer, Hal B. Wallis. In May 1956, Briskin asked to be released from the final two years of his agreement with Paramount, to which the studio agreed. The one condition was that Briskin finish work on his remaining film commitment to the studio, The Joker is Wild, starring Frank Sinatra, which was being produced by an independent film company, A.M.B.L. Productions, under an agreement with Paramount.|$|E

5|$|A two-man {{committee}} was created {{with the aim}} of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. Duncan F. Curry and William F. <b>Ladd</b> were chosen as the committee members, but <b>Ladd</b> withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games. At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory. A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, and Adams joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates. At the convention, which consisted of one session each in January and February, Adams was voted president. The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed.|$|E

In June 1942, the invasion of the Aleutian Islands and the bombing of Dutch Harbor intensified the war's effect on Fairbanks. <b>Ladd</b> Field's cold-weather testing detachment was disbanded as its soldiers were used to bolster Alaska defenses at other locations.|$|E
