The maximum shear load can reach 7500 N and is predominately affected by the morphology of the IMC layers, which in turn depend on rotation speed, welding speed and other parameters. Nano-hardness decreases from about 3. 9 GPa in the upper steel surface layer to about 1. 3 GPa in the steel base material.

40|$|<b>Lap</b> <b>joining</b> {{was carried}} out using a defocused laser beam for 1. 2 -mm thick A 6111 {{aluminum}} alloy plate and 1. 0 -mm thick low-carbon steel (SPCC) plate. The defocused laser beam was applied on the upper surface of the SPCC plate and the beam traveled under various welding conditions. When {{the depth of the}} molten SPCC pool was maintained at around 90 % of the SPCC plate thickness, the selected area near the upper surface of the A 6111 plate melted to form a semi-elliptical molten pool. Consequently, the solid SPCC and molten A 6111 came in contact at the interface and joining was achieved through the solid–liquid reaction. The interfacial strength of the lap joint was controlled by the morphology of the Fe–Al intermetallic compound (IMC) layer. Improved strength was obtained when the weld interface was covered with a thin (about 1 -mm thick) and continuous IMC layer. The estimated maximum shear stress of the lap joint was about 70 % of that for A 6111 -T 4. Welding conditions providing excessive heat input increased the thickness of the IMC layer and caused the formation of needle-like IMC and cracks in the A 6111 molten pool. Such microstructures reduced the joint strength. X-ray diffraction analysis for the weld interface revealed that the IMC layer consisted of various kinds of Fe–Al base equilibrium phases (Al 13 Fe 4, Al 5 Fe 2, Al 2 Fe, FeAl, and Fe 3 Al) and a non-equilibrium Al 6 Fe phase...|$|R

40|$|Present design {{trends in}} {{automotive}} manufacture have shifted emphasis to alternative lightweight materials {{in order to}} achieve higher fuel efficiency and to bring down vehicle emission. Although some other joining techniques are more and more being used, spot welding still remains the primary joining method in automobile manufacturing so far. Spot welds for automotive applications should have a sufficiently large diameter, so that nugget pullout mode is the dominant failure mode. Interfacial mode is unacceptable due to its low load carrying and energy absorption capability. Strength tests with different static loading were performed in, to reveal the failure mechanisms for the lap-shear geometry and the cross-tension geometry. Based on the literature survey performed, venture into this work was amply motivated by the fact that a little research work has been conducted to joining of dissimilar materials like non ferrous to ferrous. Most of the research works concentrated on joining of different materials like steel to steel or aluminium alloy to aluminium alloy by resistance spot welding.
