500|$|One {{experiment}} {{designed to}} evaluate insight and problem-solving ability involved {{a piece of}} meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a <b>little</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and [...] "the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable trial-and-error learning." [...] This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.|$|E

2500|$|Team Liquid {{defeated}} Newbee {{three straight}} {{times in the}} best-of-five series, {{the first time a}} team had been shut out in the International Grand Finals. PC Gamer described Team Liquid's approach as a [...] "dominating snowball style" [...] strategy. One of Liquid's team members would aggressively attack the Newbee base in a sacrificial manner, harming some of their defenses a <b>little</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> This allowed the CPU-controlled mobs for Team Liquid, known in-game as [...] "creeps", to easily clear through one of the lanes that were no longer defended and harass the opponent's base, requiring Newbee's players to focus more on defending against the creeps than the attacking heroes. Eventually Newbee were overwhelmed and succumbed to Team Liquid's attack. Newbee attempted to adjust their strategy {{at the start of the}} third match by changing their hero drafting picks, but were unable to recover. The third and final match was won by a coordinated effort by Team Liquid's players, using several powerful hero abilities in synergy, to take out all of Newbee's heroes. They then pressed their advantage to advance towards Newbee's base, unable to be stopped, winning the match and therefore the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) {{supported}} the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement. Thorndike developed {{the theory of}} instrumental conditioning or the law of effect. [...] The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that learning is done a <b>little</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> or in increments, learning is an automatic process and all the principles of learning apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with Robert Woodworth on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to learn another subject if the subjects are similar. This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the classics because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence. Thorndike {{was one of the}} first to say that individual differences in cognitive tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability. [...] He contributed word dictionaries that were scientifically based to determine the words and definitions used. The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level. [...] He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions. Thorndike contributed arithmetic books based on learning theory. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general intelligence. He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects. His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale.
