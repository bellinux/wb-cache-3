5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the <b>localisation</b> of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|Development {{took about}} a year and a half, with the team aiming for as much realism as possible. Certain features, {{including}} multiplayer, were dropped. Over 15 million copies were sold, and ports for various games consoles were released, most in 1995. Theme Park received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the gameplay and humour, but criticised console ports for reasons such as lack of save or mouse support. The game received a Japanese <b>localisation</b> (in addition to normal Japanese releases), Shin Theme Park, released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and remakes for the Nintendo DS and iOS, released in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, and two direct sequels followed: Theme Park World (known as Sim Theme Park in some territories) and Theme Park Inc (also known as SimCoaster).|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear <b>localisation</b> signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.|$|E
40|$|A {{single phase}} {{hexagonal}} close packed Zircaloy 2 was cold deformed to different reductions by laboratory rolling. Systematic characterisations of the structural developments were carried out. Bulk texture developments were gradual, strongest developments being noticed at the highest strain. Although formation of well defined deformation fibre(s) could not be identified, overall developments in deformation texture were best captured through Taylor type models incorporating only prismatic slip. Strain <b>localisations</b> were observed as single or double walled dislocation structures at approximately 45 and 60 degrees to the rolling direction. Such strain <b>localisations</b> were always associated with significant lattice reorientations or misorientation developments. Relative softening in lattice strain, observed at the higher reductions, can possibly {{be explained by the}} appearance of extensive strain <b>localisations</b> and the associated concurrent local dynamic recovery. The grains or orientations with dominant presence of strain <b>localisations</b> could be indirectly related to negative textural softening...|$|R
40|$|Consider a Quillen {{adjunction}} of {{two variables}} between combinatorial model categories from C×D to E, {{and a set}} S of morphisms in C.

5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language <b>localisation</b> of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using teletext service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E

40|$|We present {{computer}} models of nano-scale computing circuits based on propagation of localised excitations or defects in complexes of polymer chain rings. A cyclotron automata are sets of rings of one-dimensional array of finite states (cellular automata) which exhibits {{a wide range}} of travelling <b>localisations</b> (gliders). When information (e. g. values of logical variables) is encoded in the initial positions and velocity vectors of the gliders the cyclotron automata are becoming power abstract machines which execute high-performance computing. The computing is based on collisions between the mobile <b>localisations.</b> We present collisions that emulate basic types of interactions between <b>localisations</b> typical for spatially-extended non-linear media: fusion, particles, elastic collision, and soliton-like collision, all they implement basic computing primitives. Mobile <b>localisations</b> in complex one-dimensional cellular automata are compact sets of non-quiescent patterns translating along evolution space.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} numerical {{simulations of}} behaviour of concrete elements subjected to uniaxial compression for plane strain. FE-calculations are performed with two different elasto-plastic constitutive laws for concrete. Numerical results obtained suffer from mesh sensivity {{due to the}} presence of material softening. To obtain a well-posed boundary problem and a mesh independent solution, conventional constitutive laws with softening require an extension (called regularisation) to describe properly the <b>localisations</b> of deformations. In this paper elasto-plastic constitutive laws are extended by non-local strain terms. Owing to them, <b>localisations</b> of deformations are realistically captured...|$|R
