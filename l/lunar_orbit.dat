5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon. The Agena would then have been used to perform <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> insertion. Following the completion of activities in <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many <b>lunar</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites, {{scientists}} came to discover that most low <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> (LLO) are unstable. PFS-2 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, squarely {{into one of the}} most unstable of orbits, at 11 degrees orbital inclination, far from the four frozen <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> discovered only later at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination.|$|R
50|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many <b>lunar</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites, {{scientists}} came to discover that most low <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> (LLO) are unstable.

5|$|After {{the first}} Moon race there were years of near quietude but {{starting}} in the 1990s, many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the Moon. In 1990, Japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> with its Hiten spacecraft. The spacecraft released a smaller probe, Hagoromo, in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> but the transmitter failed, preventing further scientific use of the mission. In 1994, the U.S. sent the joint Defense Department/NASA spacecraft Clementine to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b> This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface. This was followed in 1998 by the Lunar Prospector mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, {{which is likely to}} have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock with the mother ship, and then be discarded. Landing {{only a small part}} of the spacecraft on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|After {{about seven}} hours of rest, {{the crew was}} awakened by Houston {{to prepare for the}} return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E

5000|$|NASA {{was to have}} {{launched}} a <b>lunar</b> <b>orbiting</b> space station in 2008-2009 to support {{the creation of a}} permanently manned moonbase by 2009-2010.|$|R
25|$|Luna 10 was {{battery powered}} and {{operated}} for 460 <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> and 219 active data transmissions before radio signals were discontinued on May 30, 1966.|$|R
5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b> Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of a <b>lunar</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> is {{constrained by the}} non-spherical nature of the Moon’s gravity field. The orbital {{lifetime of}} <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> depends significantly on the initial conditions of the orbit. Right ascension of ascending node (Ω) {{is one of the}} important orbital parameter affecting the orbital lifetime. In the present work we have analyzed the effect of Ω on the variation of lifetime with altitude for circular <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits.</b> It is found that at a particular initial altitude, a small increase in the altitude results in substantial increase in the orbital lifetime due to effect of the long periodic terms of Earth’s gravity on eccentricity and this transition altitude is different for different Ω. Further, it is observed that the variation of transition altitude with Ω follows a definite, but different trend for orbits with different inclinations. The transition altitude for polar orbits is found to be higher without the effect of Sun and Earth gravity. Variation of transition altitude with orbital inclination is also analyzed. Lifetimes of high altitude circular <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> are analyzed and it is observed that at high altitudes lifetime decreases with altitude...|$|R
40|$|The planar, circular, {{restricted}} three-body problem {{predicts the}} existence of periodic orbits around the Lagrangian equilibrium point L 1. Considering the Earth-lunar-probe system, some of these orbits pass {{very close to the}} surfaces of the Earth and the Moon. These characteristics make it possible for these orbits, in spite of their instability, to be used in transfer maneuvers between Earth and <b>lunar</b> parking <b>orbits.</b> The main goal {{of this paper is to}} explore this scenario, adopting a more complex and realistic dynamical system, the four-body problem Sun-Earth-Moon-probe. We defined and investigated a set of paths, derived from the orbits around L 1, which are capable of achieving transfer between low-altitude Earth (LEO) and <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits,</b> including high-inclination <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits,</b> at a low cost and with flight time between 13 and 15 days. </p...|$|R

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along {{the rim of the}} crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E

Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.|$|E

40|$|The {{solar system}} is {{composed}} of numerous bodies orbiting the sun, and numerous satellites orbiting planets. However, no objects greater than a kilometer in diameter are known to orbit satellites. Theoretical arguments are used to show that most objects orbiting satellites ultimately would be destroyed by tidal interactions. This may explain why such objects have not been observed. These arguments are applied to objects orbiting the moon. The ages and sizes {{of most of the}} circular mare basins are compatible with the lifetimes and crater sizes expected for impacts by objects caught in decaying <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits.</b> The morphology of a few circular mare basins (Crisium, Serenitatis, and possibly Imbrium) indicates that they could have been formed by such impacts. Thus, the lunar surface may provide a record of impacts due to objects caught in tidally decaying <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits...</b>|$|R
5|$|The CSM {{for this}} flight, number 012 built by North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the Lunar Module. This {{was incorporated into}} the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the Moon landing flights.|$|E
5|$|When Shea {{was hired}} by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's {{commitment}} to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old, {{and many of the}} major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land on the Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to dock with the CSM in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> then be discarded.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong's {{second and}} last spaceflight was as {{commander}} of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969.

5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E
