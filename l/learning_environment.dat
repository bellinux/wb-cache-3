It was found that there were significant differences in the development levels of five typical <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> in smart cities, i.e., school, family, community, workplace, and museum <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> Some relations among the five typical <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> were found.School had high relationship with community and museum <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> Family was strongly correlated with workplace and museum <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> Community was associated with museum, family, and school <b>learning</b> <b>environments,</b> but no significant relation existed between participation in community activities and workplace learning.

Research about <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> are neither limited in formal situation nor an individual context, but expand to five environments, so that the relations among these typical <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> have been detected. The results indicated that school, community, and museum <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> are correlated basing on the demand for the construction of city’s infrastructure; because of the possible transfer of learning habits and so on, family learning is more correlated with workplace and museum learning environments; as a public living space, community is associated with museum, family, and school <b>learning</b> <b>environments,</b> but no significant relation exists between participation in community activities and workplace learning; as a public learning space, museum is suitable for citizens of all ages, and it is related to all other <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to create {{knowledge}} about factors influencing acceptance of virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> among academic staff and students in blended <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> The aim was operationalised by four research questions. To answer the research questions, several studies were performed applying the methods of survey study, conceptual-analytical research, a qualitative meta-analysis combined with a single case study and a comparative, explanatory case study. The empirical studies were performed at five universities in Sweden, Norway and Lithuania. In the thesis, a technology acceptance perspective extended with the perspectives of organisational learning and diffusion of innovations was used. The findings indicated that the contextual factor of culture was powerful in influencing acceptance of virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments,</b> positively as well as negatively. High degrees of performance expectancy, results demonstrability and social influence affected acceptance of virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> positively. The degree of social influence was hypothesised to be mediated by the contextual factor of culture. The organisational culture of universities, expressed as shared values of what is good quality teaching and learning, were found to partly oppose values inherent in the virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> The factor of students’ learning styles {{did not have any}} impact on acceptance of virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> The original version of the technology acceptance model was found to be insufficient in explaining differences in acceptance of virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> In the conclusions of the thesis, a descriptive and explanatory model of virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> acceptance among academic staff and students in blended <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> is presented applying the combined perspectives of organisational learning, technology acceptance and diffusion of innovations. Implications for practice are put forward, emphasizing culture as an important factor to consider in the implementation of virtual <b>learning</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R
