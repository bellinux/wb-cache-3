2500|$|On February 20, 2013, Sony {{announced}} the PlayStation 4 during {{a press conference}} in New York City, and it was released on November 15, 2013 in North America. The new console places a heavy emphasis on features surrounding social interaction; gameplay videos can be shared via the PlayStation Network and other services, and users can stream games being played by themselves or others (either through the console, or directly to services such as Twitch). The PS4's DualShock 4 controller is similar to the previous model, but adds a touchpad and a [...] "Share" [...] button, along with an <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> on the front to allow motion tracking. An updated camera accessory will also be offered for the system; it now uses 1280×800px stereo cameras with support for depth sensing similar to Kinect, and remains compatible with the PlayStation Move peripherals. The PS4 will also have second screen capabilities through both mobile apps and the PlayStation Vita, and game streaming through the recently acquired Gaikai service.|$|E
50|$|The new Panamera {{no longer}} has its predecessor's oft-criticized, elephantine {{hatchback}} wagon styling, with {{the tail of the}} vehicle developing a clear link to the Porsche 911 through the full width rear <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bar,</b> and the sharply creased tail and upper bumper. This improvement in design has helped clarify the model's identity as a sports-oriented GT car.|$|E
5000|$|The Freeway Division of the Highway Patrol {{received}} the latest generation [...] of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. It has a gray base color, but the PPR logo is located {{only on the}} middle of the front door and without the logo of the Department of Transportation. A blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> is mounted inside the car, exactly the same as the new Expressway patrol cars. It plays the same role, Patrullas Fantasmas (Ghost Patrol).|$|E
25|$|Red is {{the most}} used color on Japanese {{emergency}} vehicles. The Japanese police uses <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> mounted on a raised (mechanical) platform {{to make them more}} visible over congested streets. Rotating lights are most commonly used. But some newer vehicles have <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> installed. Vehicles with any other light color than red are security or engineers. Wig-wag headlights are not used.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} {{mid-cycle}} refresh of W212, the 2017 E-Class features two larger units {{instead of the}} four-eyes headlights, though unique <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> within the headlamps still gives the nigh-time effect of four individual units. Prior to its world debut, a teaser video previewing the car's multibeam LED headlamps was released in January 2015.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of lights has allowed competitors {{to switch from}} HIDs to a viable LED technology. Rigid Industries was the first LED company to win the Baja 1000 in 2012 with BJ Baldwin. <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> are <b>lighter</b> & smaller, creating less drag and better aerodynamics. The tougher housing and lack of filament make them much more robust.|$|R
50|$|On {{the back}} side of the trunk is the logo of the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works, in a smaller size. A blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> is mounted inside the vehicle; it has two light bars in the front with two {{searchlights}} on its sides, and one complete light bar in the back. The purpose of the new patrol car is to be what it calls a Patrulla Fantasma or Ghost Patrol Car. It surprises speeders by pretending to be a government vehicle of the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works.|$|E
50|$|As Officers {{progress}} through their career they are offered {{a choice to}} purchase a subsidized vehicle, off a specified list, to use for patrol and private usage. Officers with a subsidized vehicle are given a monthly allowance for the purchase and maintenance of the vehicle with fuel provided by the department under certain guidelines. Although subsidized vehicles are unmarked, they can be identified by having a blue dome light or a mini <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> {{at the center of}} the vehicle, and are equipped with emergency sirens to be used for on-duty purposes only. The Honolulu Police Department is one of few departments that allow Officers to use subsidized vehicles for patrol usage as it lowers the department's budget compared to having all fleet vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{changes to}} the Ontario Highway Traffic Act in August 2007, the Niagara Regional Police Service began {{replacing}} red and white [...] "Street Hawk" [...] emergency lights on police vehicles with new blue and red <b>LED</b> <b>lights.</b> Older-style <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> were gradually phased out through attrition.|$|R
50|$|Governor Sila M. Calderon {{integrated}} the Ford Explorer and the Ford Taurus {{into the}} fleet in 2003, replacing the Mitsubishi Montero and Jeep Cherokee, although specialized units continued {{using some of}} these older models. The Ford Mustang replaced the Chevrolet Camaro and the Honda Shadow motorcycle replaced Honda Police CB500P motorcycle. Harley Davidson Electra Glide motorcycles remained in service, but were assigned only to veteran motorcycle patrol officers and the governor's escort. This was also when <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> {{were introduced to the}} fleet, on the Chevrolet Impala cars assigned only to the Public Residential Security Corps.|$|R
5000|$|The current main sheriff's office patrol {{vehicles}} are the Chevrolet Impala and the Chevrolet Tahoe. The vehicles' markings include a sheriff's office badge {{on the front}} quarter panels, [...] "SHERIFF" [...] on the doors and [...] "EAST BATON ROUGE" [...] on the bottom door panels. Green and yellow stripes run {{down the side of}} the vehicle and a unit number is displayed on the roof for air unit identification. The patrol {{vehicles are}} outfitted with <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> and have laptop computers for use by deputies. Other marked patrol vehicles currently used include Harley-Davidson motorcycles and the Chevrolet Caprice. Several other unmarked vehicles in various makes and models are also used for non-patrol purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Marked cruisers are white, with hood, trunk lid, {{front and}} rear quarter panels and bumpers painted navy blue. The words Waterloo Regional Police appear in white {{retroreflective}} text with a navy blue outline. A distinct solid red line curves from the front, through {{to the rear of}} the vehicle, with the motto [...] "People Helping People" [...] and [...] "911" [...] on the rear quarter panel. A series of white horizontal stripes appear above and below the curved red stripe. The crest of the police service appears on the rear pillar as well. A Canadian flag in addition to any special designations for the vehicle, such as [...] "Supervisor", [...] "Traffic", [...] "Duty Officer" [...] are displayed on the front fender. On the rear of the cruiser, the text [...] "Waterloo Regional Police" [...] is displayed on the left side of the trunk lid, and the vehicle number and divisional designation (where applicable) on the right side. On the bumper appears the police service website (wrps.on.ca), along with the Crime Stoppers tip-line number encompassed by retroreflective chevrons. Affixed to the roof is a red and blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bar,</b> as well as several antennas for communication and GPS.|$|E
50|$|The Edmonton Police Service {{uses the}} D&R rds 16 siren in the {{majority}} of their fleet that is also equipped with the howler brand. Each marked vehicle has the Whelen Legacy lightbar, (excluding the Crown Vic's and Ford Taurus's that are equipped with <b>LED</b> X <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> and some CODE 3 sirens.|$|R
2500|$|Amber LEDs {{are widely}} used on {{operational}} appliances owned by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. The combination of blue and amber <b>LEDs</b> in a <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> are proven to be more visible at a distance. Amber lights are also utilised by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) ...|$|R
25|$|The Holden Commodore is {{the current}} generic road vehicle of choice for the police. In the past they have used Ford Falcons and the Nissan Maxima. The highway patrol mainly uses the Holden Commodore S variant along with the Holden VF Commodore. The police also use unmarked models of the Holden Cruze and Holden Commodore. Liveries are {{chequered}} Battenburg markings orange-blue (older models - VT, VX and VZ Commodores) or yellow-blue (Newer Models, Captiva, Commodore VE and VF, trucks and vans), as well as cars in standard factory colours, {{commonly referred to as}} unmarked or undercover. Since 2008 the orange-blue livery is being phased out, and all marked patrol vehicles were expected to have the yellow-blue livery as well as <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> by 2014. Both Commodore sedan and wagon bodies are used - normally in V6 form. The Holden Commodore (VE, VT, VX and VZ) is currently being phased starting 2013 and slowly being replaced with Holden VF Commodores. The Holden Cruze is currently only used for Youth Aid, both marked and unmarked.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike in {{many other}} law {{enforcement}} agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates over 10,000 SUVs and pickup trucks, which {{are known for their}} capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. These vehicles may have individual revolving <b>lights</b> (strobes or <b>LEDs)</b> and/or <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> and sirens and/or have their bumpers removed or have off-road suspension and tires. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor or the Dodge Charger as patrol cars or high speed [...] "interceptors" [...] on highways. The border patrol has approx 2,000 sedans. The Border Patrol also operates all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and small boats in riverine environments.|$|R
50|$|During 2016, {{the main}} runway {{of the airport}} was resurfaced and fitted with new {{navigation}} lights, which will improve the safety level of the runway. Runway guard <b>lights,</b> <b>LED</b> stop <b>bar</b> signals and guidance signs at all the holding positions on the airport's main runway were also added. The instrument landing system was also upgraded to CAT II, which enables aircraft to land during poor weather conditions. The airfield lighting control and monitoring system was upgraded, including installation of new lighting signals on all four taxiways.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 MKX {{debuted in}} December 2006 as a rebadged {{variant of the}} Ford Edge. In {{addition}} to the chrome grille, the MKX's front fascia features projector-beam headlight assemblies with standard chrome-accented fog lights mounted in the lower fascia. The MKX features an optional adaptive headlight system that pivots {{the aim of the}} light projectors to match the steering inputs of the driver. In the rear, the MKX features dual chrome exhaust tips and brake <b>lights</b> backlit by <b>LEDs</b> with a <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> that crosses the MKX's liftgate. The optional sunroof, marketed as a Panoramic Vista Roof, is the production version of the glass roof feature shown on the 2004 Aviator Concept. The Vista Roof features a forward power sunroof and a fixed rear moonroof with dual power sunshades.|$|R
50|$|A special {{version of}} the XF Diesel S was {{announced}} in 2009 for the UK police car market, with the first police force orders in 2010.Its emergency vehicle equipment included a roof-mounted <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> with 3,600 <b>light</b> elements, side alley lights, blue and white strobing LEDs in the grille and blue flashing LEDs {{along the side of}} the car, blue and red flashing <b>LED</b> <b>lights</b> in the rear light clusters.|$|R
50|$|The primary patrol {{vehicle of}} the {{department}} is the Ford Police Interceptor. The prisoner transport vehicles are Chevrolet vans. Harley Davidson motorcycles are currently used. Current markings are all black vehicles with yellow lettering stating transit police. Towards {{the front of the}} vehicle is the department's uniform patch and at the rear is the Maryland Transit Administration logo. <b>Light</b> <b>bars</b> are red and blue rotating <b>lights</b> or <b>LED</b> <b>lights,</b> though some vehicles have strobe lights incorporated into the design.|$|R
40|$|Although drivers use various sensory {{channels}} {{to control and}} navigate their vehicles, they acquire most of all driving-related information visually. In fog, no matter what visual acuity is, the visual channel is useless due to the induced poor visibility. Driv-ers react differently to the adverse weather, resulting in high speed variation. That is why it has the high fatal rate during foggy conditions. Then, {{it is imperative to}} provide drivers positive guidance in fog. In this study, the Fog Detect and Warning System (FDWS), being called as the fog lighthouse, was conceived to inform drivers of safety speeds and distances between each vehicle. FDWS includes visibility meters, <b>light</b> <b>bars,</b> and vehicle detectors. The visibility meters calculate sight distances when fog occurs and the estimated sight distances inform drivers through the <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> which are installed at every 30 m intervals. The <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> which display red warning lights inform a following vehicle of the position of the leading vehicle to keep the safety distance between the two vehicles. Since the main lights with the high-bright <b>LED</b> (<b>Light</b> Emitting Diode) have high visibilities, drivers can easily recognize far away. Also microwave sensors together with the <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> are installed to detect the presence of vehicles at every 30 m intervals. The aim of this paper was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the fog system on driver behavior and con-sciousness. As a pilot study, FDWS was implemented on a 1 km section of National Highway No. 37 with a divided four-lane, rural highway. The analysis of the driver behavior was based on mean speed with standard deviation, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to estimate the driver consciousness. The results indicates that FDWS significantly led to an about 3 kph (for day...|$|R
25|$|All of the 2014-2016 International/Hortons have a 4 door cab, {{the updated}} black and gold graphics. All {{exterior}} lights are Whelen M9s except the scene lights which maintain the 900s, and a Freedom II <b>light</b> <b>bar.</b> The 2017 rescues have the Freedom IV roof <b>light</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there is}} an evident trend of ever-thinner and {{intricate}} opto-electronic package and devices, which brings about severer thermal issues as well as unprecedented challenges for the thermal design. Not only thickness of opto-electronic package itself will raise the peak temperature and pose a potential risk to electronic devices, but also the limited-space and interacted opto-electro-thermo-mechanical properties restrict the use of traditional active thermal management means and precise estimation of cooling performance. This dissertation aims to numerically and experimentally analyze thermal behaviors of various LED package configurations while thinning {{it as well as}} apply novel radiation coating and packaging materials to cooling electronic devices with limited-space. What’s more, an opto-thermal coupled numerical method in the application of LED was discussed. Last but not the least, much faster Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were adopted to predict patterns for cooling performance of our thermal radiation coating in Li-ion battery system and acceleration stage before the onset of thermal runaway, which is the key to cut-off the battery before explosion. It’s found that: (1) LED packages have different thermal behaviors for various configurations while thinning it. There can be a 5 - 10 ℃ of temperature change for single-chip LED. (2) For white <b>LEDs</b> and <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> in direct view LED backlight units (DLED-BLUs), our thermal conductive Die Attach Adhesive (DAA) and thicker encapsulant are able to increase the power level by up to 1. 5 times. (3) Our thermal radiation can effectively decrease the peak temperature by 14. 5 oC for linear LED modules as well as boost the uniformity of temperature distribution. (4) The thermal performance of LED package is different with and without considering optical effect. So optical effect should not be neglected while conducting thermal simulation for opto-electronic devices. (5) Machine learning algorithms can shorten prediction time of thermal performance of passive radiation material from 1 day to less than 0. 5 min, compared with finite element method. A practical system design to effectively prevent explosion of Li-ion battery system is provided, too...|$|R
5000|$|The CSP fleet {{includes}} the traditional patrol vehicles (Ford Crown Victorias), SUVs, and motorcycles. Most unmarked patrol cars are silver, {{although a few}} navy blue, black, maroon, and dark-brown cars exist. Recently they received the new Ford Police Interceptor sedan in all silver with no marking and a <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> on top and lights on the front side and back. The Interceptor is also equipped with a front crash bumper with lights. Also, they have unmarked new Ford Interceptors with hidden lights on front wind shield and back. The CSP {{has had a long}} history of using unmarked patrol cars on the state's highways, only identifiable as police vehicles by the red and blue <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> on the top. The words [...] "State Police" [...] are labelled on the center of the <b>light</b> <b>bar.</b> The colored lightbars are slowly fading out of use to the new crystal clear LED lightbars. Patrol cars are outfitted with <b>LED</b> warning <b>lights</b> on the roof and rear deck, 800 MHz Digital radio systems, Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs), and Mobile Video Cameras (MVRs). Some of the older vehicles have a [...] "State Trooper" [...] placard on the rear. The CSP has also had a long history of using non-traditional unmarked patrol cars for enforcement such as Chevrolet Camaros, Ford Mustangs, Ford Explorers, Grand Nationals, Mazda MX-6s, Ford F-Series pickup trucks, and Dodge Chargers. In 2016, they started using Unmarked Chevrolet Caprice cruisers. These units are not equipped with <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> and instead utilize more low profile emergency lighting systems. The CSP utilizes Radar, Lidar (Laser), and VASCAR (Visual Average Speed Computer And Recorder) for speed enforcement.|$|R
50|$|The {{top of the}} gamepad {{features}} a <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> with three <b>LEDs</b> that illuminate in different colors, {{which can be used}} to identify players by matching the colors of the characters they are controlling in a game, or to provide enhanced feedback or immersion by changing patterns or colors in reaction to gameplay. (Example: In Grand Theft Auto V when the player is wanted by police the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> flashes red & blue). It is also used in conjunction with the PlayStation Camera to judge the positions and movements of multiple players. The <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> was developed for PlayStation VR.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the initial}} {{controller}} version the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> was a permanently illuminated bright colored light. The potential for light pollution in darkened playing rooms, {{as well as}} an interest in extending battery life led to inquiries as whether the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> could be switched off by users when not required in game; Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida initially responded in the negative (July 2013), though videogame developers had the option to disable the light in game. In early 2014, the company announced that a future update would allow the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> to be dimmed. (Enabled by system update 1.70 of April 2014.) ...|$|R
