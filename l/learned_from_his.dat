5|$|Many of Riley's {{poems are}} filled with musical references.

He {{performed}} in two different local bands, and became so proficient on the violin {{he was invited to}} play with a group of adult Freemasons at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being A Short'nin' Bread Song—Pieced Out.|$|E

5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Born and Heisenberg {{formulated}} {{the matrix}} mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen ("Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes {{corresponding to the}} initial and final states. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.|$|E
5|$|In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler {{threw his}} support to Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield. The anti-Chandler forces {{eventually}} put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again. Having <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to Combs, Chandler had deposited {{the money in}} a Cuban bank, but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew {{the government in the}} Cuban Revolution. Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461. Republicans nominated John M. Robsion, Jr. to oppose Combs, and when Democratic President Harry S. Truman came to Paducah to campaign for Combs, Chandler refused to welcome him to the state, a customary duty of the sitting governor. Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party's nominees, calling Combs a liar and alleging that his running mate, Wilson W. Wyatt, who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found Americans for Democratic Action. Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May and 17, {{the main}} Austrian army under Charles {{arrived in the}} Marchfeld, a plain {{northeast}} of Vienna just across the Danube that often served as a training ground for Austrian military forces. Charles kept {{the bulk of his}} forces several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On the 20th, Charles <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> observers on the Bissam hill that the French were building a bridge at Kaiser-Ebersdorf, just southwest of the Lobau island, that led to the Marchfeld. On the 21st, Charles concluded that the French were crossing at Kaiser-Ebersdorf in strength and ordered a general advance for 98,000 troops and the accompanying 292 guns, which were organised into five columns. The French bridgehead rested on two villages: Aspern to the west and Essling to the east. Napoleon had not expected to encounter opposition, and the bridges linking the French troops at Aspern-Essling to Lobau were not protected with palisades, making them highly vulnerable to Austrian barges that had been lighted on fire.|$|E
5|$|William Stacy {{was born}} in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 1734 and died in Marietta, Ohio in 1802. Slightly {{different}} years of birth and death have been reported. Stacy grew up in Gloucester {{on the coast of}} Massachusetts and worked as a shoemaker, a trade <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> father; he may also have worked in the seafaring business. William Stacy married Sarah Day in 1754. Subsequently, during 1757, they moved away from the coast to New Salem in western Massachusetts, and raised a large family. Stacy took up farming and continued his work as a shoemaker. He also became a commercial banker, loaning money at interest before there were any banks in the area. His customers were from New Salem and other towns in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. By the time of his early middle age, William Stacy was living a comfortable life; he was successful and widely known. During 1775, at the age of 41, William Stacy's life changed with the onset of friction between the Thirteen Colonies and the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|His brother Howard Burnham (1870–1918), born {{shortly before}} {{the family moved to}} Los Angeles, lost one leg at the age of 14 and {{suffered}} from tuberculosis. During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brother the art of Scoutcraft, how to shoot, and how to ride the range, all in spite of his wooden leg. Howard moved to Africa, became a mining engineer in the Johannesburg gold mines, and later wrote a text book on Modern Mine Valuation. He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico. During World War I, Howard worked as a spy for the French government, operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany. Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying. From his death bed, Howard returned to France via Switzerland and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government: the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and {{there was no need to}} move allied troops away from the Western Front. Howard was buried at Cannes, France, leaving behind his wife and four children. He had been named after his second cousin, Lieutenant Howard Mather Burnham who was killed in action in the American Civil War.|$|E
