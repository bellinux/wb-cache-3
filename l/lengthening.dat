5|$|The {{dropping}} {{of final}} short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, {{but also some}} gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel <b>lengthening</b> occurred in many situations to preserve the distinctions.

5|$|Throughout the 1950s, State Highway 74 {{continued}} to be realigned and extended. Southwest of Norman, it swapped routings with SH-9 on December 6, 1954.

5|$|Vestgrensa {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involved a heightening and <b>lengthening</b> of the platforms, and installation of a third rail power supply and a new signaling system.

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By <b>lengthening</b> the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design.
