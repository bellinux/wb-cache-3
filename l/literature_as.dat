Written responses from 41 neophyte research scholars from various disciplines in an Australian university were gathered {{in response to}} two questions: "What do {{you mean when you}} use the words "literature review"?" and "What is the meaning of a literature review for your research?" A phenomenographic analysis identified six conceptions, or ways of experiencing, literature reviews: <b>literature</b> review <b>as</b> a list, <b>literature</b> review <b>as</b> a search, <b>literature</b> review <b>as</b> a survey, <b>literature</b> review <b>as</b> a vehicle for learning, <b>literature</b> review <b>as</b> a research facilitator, and <b>literature</b> review <b>as</b> a report.

5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang.

According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E
