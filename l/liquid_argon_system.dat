40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{recently}} shown that current molecular dynamics (MD) atomic force fields {{are not yet}} able to produce lipid bilayer structures that agree with experimentally-determined structures within experimental errors. Because of the many advantages offered by experimentally validated simulations, we have developed a novel restraint method for membrane MD simulations that uses experimental diffraction data. The restraints, introduced into the MD force field, act upon specified groups of atoms to restrain their mean positions and widths to values determined experimentally. The method was first tested using a simple <b>liquid</b> <b>argon</b> <b>system,</b> and then applied to a neat dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer at 66 % relative humidity and to the same bilayer containing the peptide melittin. Application of experiment-based restraints to the transbilayer double-bond and water distributions of neat DOPC bilayers led to distributions that agreed with the experimental values. Based upon the experimental structure, the restraints improved the simulated structure in some regions while introducing larger differences in others, {{as might be expected}} from imperfect force fields. For the DOPC-melittin system, the experimental transbilayer distribution of melittin was used as a restraint. The addition of the peptide caused perturbations of the simulated bilayer structure, but which were larger than observed experimentally. The melittin distribution of the simulation could be fit accurately to a Gaussian with parameters close to the observed ones, indicating that the restraints can be used to produce an ensemble of membrane-bound peptide conformations that are consistent with experiments. Such ensembles pave the way for understanding peptide-bilayer interactions at the atomic level...|$|E

The higher luminosities are of particular importance for the forward calorimeters (FCal), where the expected increase in the ionization load poses a number of problems that can degrade the FCal performance such as beam heating and space-charge effects in the <b>liquid</b> <b>argon</b> gaps and high-voltage drop due to increased current drawn over the current-limiting resistors. A proposed FCal replacement as a way to counter some of these problems is weighed against the risks associated with the replacement.

The <b>Liquid</b> <b>Argon</b> (LAr) Calorimeter read-out will therefore be modified to deliver digital trigger signals with a higher spatial granularity {{in order to improve}} the identification efficiencies of electrons, photons, tau, jets and missing energy, at high background rejection rates at the Level- 1 trigger. The new trigger signals will be arranged in 34000 so-called Super Cells which achieves 5 – 10 times better granularity than the trigger towers currently used and allows an improved background rejection. The readout of the trigger signals will process the signal of the Super Cells at every LHC bunch-crossing at 12 -bit precision and a frequency of 40 MHz. The data will be transmitted to the Back End using a custom serializer and optical converter and 5. 12 Gb/s optical links.

The data were taken with the H 1 detector at the HERA collider in the year 2005 corresponding to two polarisation states: a left-handed electron polarisation of $- 27 \%$ and a right-handed electron polarisation of $+ 37 \%$, corresponding to integrated luminosities of $ 68. 6 ~\rm pb^{- 1 }$ and $ 29. 6 ~\rm pb^{- 1 }$, respectively. The inclusive total deep inelastic charged current cross section and the differential cross sections are measured for both helicities in the kinematic domain $Q^{ 2 }> 400 ~\rm GeV^{ 2 }$ and $y< 0. 9 $. The entire analysis chain necessary for the determination of the cross sections is described with emphasis on the understanding of the performance of the <b>Liquid</b> <b>Argon</b> trigger <b>system.</b> The experimental results obtained are consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model.
