2500|$|For some time, the LIRR {{had tried}} to attract {{customers}} on the East End. In 1955, {{an attempt was made}} to do this.

During the mid-1960s the LIRR <b>lost</b> <b>mail</b> contracts, which had justified service on the East End. One way to continue service to these stations would have been to implement bus service, which could then replace certain train trips, reducing the need of maintenance on the Montauk Branch and Ronkonkoma Branch. The LIRR decide to do precisely that. In the 1960s and 1970s, the LIRR operated a bus route between Greenport and Huntington as a combination [...] "Road 'n' Rail" [...] service, paralleling the Montauk Branch between Babylon and Montauk. Passengers on short trips were expected to be attracted to the buses as they were cheaper than rail, and because they ran through a heavily populated area that had no rail stations.|$|E

Brooks was lynched while awaiting trial on July 29, 1874.|$|R
5000|$|Hoping {{to reach}} new readers, Conger-Kaneko changed the magazine's name to The Progressive Woman in March 1909.

50|$|In 1954 the Canadian National Railway, {{successor}} to the Grand Trunk Railway closed and abandoned the station at Muskoka Wharf. That same year the company <b>lost</b> its <b>mail</b> contract as trucks could now deliver the mail faster than steamers.

Pendorwood took delivery in February 1955 in a newly formed company named Gravenhurst Steamships Limited, and retubed the Sagamo's boilers for what {{would prove to be}} the last time. In an effort to improve profits fares rose and maintenance was cut, and the ships soon looked shabby. The ship continued running despite more frequent breakdowns until Labor Day, 1958 when she retired.|$|R

50|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Chippewa-Hiawatha on the Milwaukee Division during May 1938, the Copper Country Limited took a back seat on the Milwaukee Road's trains to Upper Michigan. During 1958, the through Sault Ste. Marie sleeper was {{discontinued}} entirely after several cutbacks leaving only the sleeper to Calumet. As ridership continued to slide the Milwaukee offered the sleeper only three days a week beginning in the spring of 1964. During its final years, the Copper Country carried only a few cars. Its existence persisted almost entirely because of the lucrative U.S. mail contracts that kept many similar trains running across the country. The Copper Country Limited <b>lost</b> its <b>mail</b> car in October 1967. With little reason to keep it and few riders remaining, the train made its last runs on March 7, 1968.|$|R
