25|$|Radiation {{oncology}} is {{the medical}} specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and {{is distinct from}} radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis. Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure ("curative") or for adjuvant therapy. It may {{also be used as}} palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.|$|E

The patient, {{if a man}} of note, is placed upon the sand, and fed with rice or millet bread till he recovers or dies. The chicken-pox kills many infants; they are treated by bathing in the fresh blood of a sheep, covered with the skin, and exposed to the sun. Smoke and glare, dirt and flies, cold winds and naked extremities, cause ophthalmia, especially in the hills; this disease rarely blinds any save the citizens, and no remedy is known. Dysentery is cured by rice and sour milk, patients also drink clarified cows' butter; and in bad cases the stomach is cauterized, fire and disease, according to the Somal, never coexisting. Haemorroids, when dry, are reduced by a stick used as a bougie and allowed to remain in loco all night. Sometimes the part affected is cupped with a horn and knife, or a leech performs excision. The diet is camels' or goats' flesh and milk; clarified butter and Bussorab dates--rice and mutton are carefully avoided. For a certain <b>local</b> <b>disease,</b> they use senna or colocynth, anoint the body with sulphur boiled in ghee, and expose it to the sun, or they leave the patient all night in the dew;--abstinence and perspiration generally effect a cure. For the minor form, the afflicted drink the melted fat of a sheep's tail. Consumption is a family complaint, and therefore considered incurable; to use the Somali expression, they address the patient with [...] "Allah, have mercy upon thee!" [...] not with [...] "Allah cure thee!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Local {{cancer in}} many parts of the body can cause lymph nodes to enlarge, usually because of tumours cells that have metastasised into the node.

Emergency radiation therapy (usually 20 Gray in 5 fractions, 30 Gray in 10 fractions or 8 Gray in 1 fraction) is the mainstay of treatment for malignant spinal cord compression. It is very effective as pain control and <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> control. Some tumours are highly sensitive to chemotherapy (e.g. lymphomas, small-cell lung cancer) and may be treated with chemotherapy alone.|$|E

50|$|The most {{prominent}} symptom of Sever's disease is heel pain {{which is usually}} aggravated by physical activity such as walking, running or jumping.The pain is localised to the posterior and plantar side of the heel over the calcaneal apophysis. Sometimes, the pain may be so severe that it may cause limping and interfere with physical performance in sports. External appearance of the heel is almost always normal, and signs of <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> such as edema, erythema (redness) are absent. The main diagnostic tool is pain on medial- lateral compression of the calcaneus {{in the area of}} growth plate, so called squeeze test. Foot radiographs are usually normal.

It {{provides}} local control and potential cure in localized gastric stage IE and II 1E disease with 5-year EFS of 85-100% reported in retrospective studies. [...] However, the irradiation field is potentially large as it must include the whole stomach, which can vary greatly in size and shape. Irradiation techniques have improved considerably in the last 20 years, including treating the patient in a fasting state, decreasing the irradiated field and required dose. The moderate dose of 30 Gray (Gy) of involved-field radiotherapy administered in 15 fractions (doses) {{can be associated with}} tolerable toxicity and excellent outcomes. Hence, radiotherapy is the preferred approach for <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> where antibiotic therapy has failed, or is not indicated. Evidence also suggests that radiotherapy can be utilized to control localized relapses outside the original radiation field.|$|E
50|$|In 1561, a Portuguese Jesuit missionary {{managed to}} make his way into the Mwenemutapa's court and convert him to Christianity.

After a lengthy preparation, an expedition of 1,000 men under Francisco Barreto was launched in 1568. They managed to get as far as the upper Zambezi, but <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> decimated the force. The Portuguese returned to their base in 1572 and took their frustrations out on the Swahili traders, who they massacred. They replaced them with Portuguese and their half-African progeny who became prazeiros (estate holders) of the lower Zambezi. Mutapa maintained a position of strength exacting a subsidy from each captain of Portuguese Mozambique that took the office. The mwenemutapa also levied a duty of 50 percent on all trade goods imported.|$|E
50|$|To {{discover}} {{the extent and}} severity of coronary artery ectasia {{there are a variety}} of diagnostic tools used. The most common method for discovering the disease is through angiography. Angiography is the procedure where a contrast dye is entered into the vessels and an x-ray is taken, which will allow the vessels to be seen on the x-ray. Using angiography clinicians are able to display the size, location and number of vessels affected by the disease. Is can also be analyzed through other methods such as intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Using these diagnostic methods, it has been discovered that the disease normally occurs most often in the right coronary artery, followed by the left anterior descending artery, and finally the left anterior circumflex artery. Using these methods Coronary artery ectasia can be divided into four different types: Type 1¬→diffuse ectasia in 2-3 different vessels, Type 2¬→ diffuse disease in 1 vessel and <b>local</b> <b>disease</b> in another, Type 3¬→ diffuse disease in one vessel and Type 4¬→ localized or segmental ectasia.|$|E
