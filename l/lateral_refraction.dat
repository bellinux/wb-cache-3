40|$|Abstract]: Environmental {{conditions}} in underground coal mines effect <b>lateral</b> <b>refraction</b> when surveying {{with a regular}} theodolite. Xstrata Coal’s Oaky North Mine situated 26 Km east of Tieri in Central Queensland’s Bowen Basin has overcome these environmental conditions by utilising gyrotheodolites to control the underground survey network. This project studies the environmental conditions effecting <b>lateral</b> <b>refraction</b> and how Oaky North Mine utilises gyrotheodolites to control the underground survey network. Oaky North Mine is an underground longwall coal operation, producing approximately 5 million tonnes of sub-bituminous, medium volatile coal per annum. Two pairs of parallel tunnels (gateroads) with cross cuts every 100 m are driven using a continuous miner for a length of approximately 3. 4 Km. These gateroads form the maingate and tailgate of the longwall block. The demand for an accurate underground control network is high. Typically, accuracies of ± 50 mm are expected allowing a breakthrough tolerance of ± 100 mm. The ability to establish accurate control networks and perform associated surveys is restricted by <b>lateral</b> <b>refraction.</b> The path of light through the atmosphere {{is influenced by the}} inhomogenities of the refractive index. This refractive effect deteriorates the pointing accuracy of survey lines. Currently, there is no available method to accurately correct these systematic errors. This project investigates whether literature research supporting the use of a gyrotheodolite, will improve breakthrough errors of an open ended traverse or when compared to the readings from TCRA 1203 vary sufficiently to be outside accepted tolerances. Specifically, in this project, the gyrotheodolite used is the DMT (Deutsche Montan Technologie) Gyromat 2000, permanently fixed to a Wild T 2 theodolite. The Gyromat 2000 is a fully automated high precision (1. 5 cm every 1 Km) surveying gyroscope with a measuring time < 10 mins...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One of the {{limitations}} of velocity models obtained from seismic method is lack of lateral resolution at low frequencies, since in this method the stacking velocity is used. The major objective {{of this paper is to}} cover <b>lateral</b> resolution using <b>refraction</b> tomography. In refraction tomography modeling a correct initial velocity model based on refraction wave data is the main step for tomography inversion. The presented paper focuses on preparation of the initial velocity model for refraction tomography. This model is then used in seismic tomography process to minimize the time difference between the initial model and all first breaks. 31 km 2 Dwide-line seismic data of Sefid-Zakhor gas field are selected so that contain exploration well of the field to compare tomography inversion interval velocity model in well location with checkshot interval velocity for validation. The high fit between checkshot and tomography velocity is observed. High accuracy result is derived because of picking first time arrivals both in shotgathers and satationgathers and considers any lateral change as a velocity layer in preparing initial velocity model. However, in the Sefid-Zakhor gas field the data acquisition is discontinues because of its erratic terrain topography, the desired result obtained in the first iteration of refraction tomography inversion because of the accuracy of the initial velocity model. Finally, the drift between well and tomography velocity i...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of heat flow {{is one of}} the prerequisites for modeling the thermal structure of sedimentary basins and allows the determination of its geodynamic state as well as the composition and structure of the basement. Although maps of the surface heat flow in the Northeast German Basin (NEGB) are published, our knowledge of this parameter is rather flaw. With this work a well-founded determination and evaluation of heat flow in the NEGB are presented for the first time. Under conductive and stationary conditions heat-flow density (q) is calculated as the product of temperature gradient of a depth interval and its representative thermal conductivity. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of the rocks must be known, and temperature measurements must be available. The surface heat flow (q s) then can be calculated adding to this q the amount of heat generated by the radiogenic elements of the overburden. Deep boreholes, drilled in the course of oil and natural gas exploration, particularly in the years 1962 - 1990, were used in this study for the determination of q. Due to the targets of drilling and coring the depth intervals examined were predominantly in Permian rocks (Permocarboniferous magmatites and Permian sediments). Laboratory-derived thermal conductivity (TC) was determined in 363 core samples in dry and saturated conditions. The variability of TC within the lithotypes is related to facies, cementation, and degree of diagenesis. Based on the TC of lithotypes, the TC value of formations was estimated taking into account the respective facies conditions in the particular borehole. The TC of lithotypes and formations have higher values than previously supposed and used in modelings of the NEGB. Heat production (A) of rocks was determined on the one hand by direct measurement of the content of U, Th, and K in 52 rock samples {{and on the other hand}} indirectly by evaluating borehole measurements. In order to do so, total gamma-ray intensity logs (GR logs) recorded in older gamma units (GE) were converted to modern API units using an empirical equation: GR[API c]= 4. 95433 × GR[GE c] - 27. 24. The A value for the entire sedimentary succession of the NEGB calculated from GR logs (using API units) amounts to 1 - 6 µW/m 3 (4 µW/m 3 on average). The determination of q is accomplished and described in detail for 13 borehole locations. Possible disturbances were considered, and different correction procedures were applied. The corrections comprise the in-situ temperature correction of TC measured under room conditions, the corrections of temperature disturbances caused by the drilling process, corrections of <b>lateral</b> heat <b>refraction</b> at salt structures, and corrections of palaeoclimatic effects. The determined q values show an uncertainty, which is assumed to be approximately 15 % for all locations. The q s values range between 70 - 90 mW/m 2 (average value: 77 mW/m 2). It is shown that both, different magmatic successions at the basin basis and the different Mesozoic and Cenozoic deposits (depending on the situation in the basin and the positioning relative to the adjacent salt structures) affect a differentiation of q s. The q s values of this study do not coincide with the distribution pattern of former q s maps. In order to investigate the thermal consequences of different assumptions of structure and composition of the crust and the lithosphere, 2 D sections were modelled under steady-state conditions. Variable compositions of the crust and different thicknesses of the lithosphere could explain the determined q s values. It is assumed that the Pritzwalk gravity anomaly of dense rock with less heat production causes a negative thermal anomaly at the surface. Without a better knowledge of the deeper underground of the NEGB it cannot be estimated as to which parts the determined mean q depends on a high heat production of the crust or a high mantle heat flow. It also cannot be ascertained whether the assumption of a thermal stationary regime, which represents a substantial part of the computations, is justified for the NEGB. <br...|$|R

Three possible explanations are offered to account forthe observed discrepancies: (1) eompressional phases observed at Marcus,Midway, and Wake are mantle-guided phases of the Pn type; (2) systematicerrors in epicenter determinations of the type reported by Japanese authorsfor earthquakes in the Kurile, Japan, and Izu trench region are present;and (3) real differences exist in the upper-mantle velocity structure of thetwo regions in question through which the phases travelled.

40|$|The G {{waves from}} the Niigata {{earthquake}} of June 16, 1964 recorded at the world-wide standard seismograph stations are studied {{for the purpose}} of elucidating the source mechanism. The observed radiation pattern of G 2 waves with period 200 sec indicates a source of pure thrust fault with the strike direction N 20 °E. This result is in excellent agreement with those from the first motion study {{as well as from the}} field studies of the epicentral area by various geological and geophysical methods. The amplitude and phase spectra for shorter periods are variable, and a statistical approach is taken in their investigation. Both G 2 and G 3 waves with periods shorter than about 150 sec show a statistical behavior expected for a finite sample of a smoothed Gaussian noise. The factors causing this randomization may be 1) the source complex, 2) the interference due to <b>lateral</b> <b>refraction,</b> and 3) the interference with higher modes or body waves. The near-pole phenomena are demonstrated on a before-after picture by the forward extrapolation of G 2 wave fronts and the backward extrapolation of G 3 wave fronts. It is confirmed that the π/ 2 polar phase advance is a good first approximation. However, the "after" picture obtained from G 3 waves shows much greater irregularity than the "before" picture obtained from G 2 waves, and it is difficult to find the source mechanism by the phase equalization of G 3 waves.

40|$|A shallow {{aftershock}} {{sequence in}} the Hawkes Bay {{region of the}} North Island, New Zealand (May 1990) was recorded with high quality on an L-shaped, 7 -station array of 3 -component, short-period seismographs at Wellington, such that the seismic waves travelled almost along strike of the subducted Pacific plate in this region. The arrival times at the stations of the Pn wave pulse {{from a number of}} aftershocks could be picked sufficiently accurately for a least-squares inversion to be carried out for wavefront speed, c, and incident azimuth, [theta]. The results show a high apparent velocity, 8. 7 [plus or minus] 0. 2 km/s, and an azimuth which is shifted by 6. 0 [plus or minus] 2. 5 degrees east of the true epicentre - station azimuth. The azimuthal anomaly, [delta][theta], has been interpreted as due to <b>lateral</b> <b>refraction</b> of Pn off the subducted slab. The effect of different geometries of the slab on the Pn wavefront characteristics (c and [delta][theta]) at Wellington have been explored through both simple geometrical considerations (in the case of a plane or cylindrical slab) as well as through 3 -dimensional ray tracing (in the case of irregular curvature of the slab). It has been shown that a plane or cylindrical slab would require P-wave velocities of about 9. 0 km/s to exist within it in order to fit both c and [delta][theta], whereas a model of the slab which departs from a regular cylinder and has a small updip component along strike can fit the observations with P-wave velocities of 8. 75 km/s in the high velocity medium. This model has been proposed by Ansell and Bannister (1991) after detailed consideration of the shallow seismicity that defines the slab surface in the lower North Island. Information {{about the nature of the}} high velocity medium has been obtained by modeling the waveforms through generation of synthetic seismograms by the reflectivity technique of Kennett (1983). The large number of aftershocks within a small source region, and the sampling of much the same wavepath, meant that a sufficient number of seismograms had very similar and characteristic features that could be modelled. The typical seismogram of the data set had a simple Pn wavepulse, followed immediately by a complex. high frequency (up to 15 Hz) phase (here referred to as Phf) and a high amplitude, lower frequency phase that dominated the P-wavetrain (here referred to as P). A velocity profile that contained a layer of 8. 75 km/s material at least 4 km thick, underlying "normal" mantle material of P-velocity 8. 2 [plus or minus] 0. 2 km/s. and whose surface lies approximately 18 km below the slab surface reproduced the observed seismogram features well. The presence of velocity gradients above and below the layer is not excluded. A gradual decrease in velocity below the layer in fact gives a better fit of the Pn pulse shape. By breaking down the synthetic seismogram into simpler versions. using Kennett's wavefield approximation technique, it has been shown that the Pn wave propagates through the high velocity layer, the Phf phase through the overlying layers as a sequence of reflections and refractions, and the P group as a reverberatory phase in a crustal waveguide, with its energy mostly in the form of free surface reflections and S to P conversion. These results have also been confirmed by ray tracing. Waveform modelling has also clearly shown that a low velocity layer (representing subducted sediment) on the top of the subducted slab produces a highly characteristic imprint on the synthetic seismogram, in the form of an energetic, reverberatory, lower frequency signal late in the P-wavetrain. Wavefield approximations show that this is also a crustal waveguide effect, with a strong component of mode conversion at the free surface, but P - S conversion appears to be the dominant mechanism. Seismograms very similar to such synthetic ones have been observed for the Weber aftershocks recorded at stations along the northern East Coast. The presence of such a low velocity layer in the East Coast region is thus implied, consistently with previous proposals. The petrological implications of the high velocity layer in the subducted Pacific plate are discussed. The most likely explanation is that it represents the maximum P velocity of an anisotropic layer within the Pacific upper mantle. It is proposed that the conditions of stress orientation, pressure and temperature at approximately 36 - 50 km depth in this region induces a strong realignment of olivine crystals with their fast direction along strike of the slab, normal to the maximum compressive stress axis. The upper mantle of the segment of the Pacific ocean just east of the Tonga - Kermadec trench and the North Island has been shown in this study to possess P-wave anisotropy, with the P-velocity reaching a maximum of 8. 37 km/s in a direction N 60 degrees E. This result was obtained by analysing a large set of ISC travel times from earthquakes along the Tonga - Kermadec - New Zealand subduction zone recorded at stations Niue, Rarotonga and the Chatham Islands. It is suggested that an enhancement of this anisotropy, accompanied by some re-orientation, takes place as the upper mantle medium is subjected to the new stress conditions in the initial stages of subduction...|$|E
