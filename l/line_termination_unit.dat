40|$|Abstract—The next digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) generation, called G. fast, extends the frequency band up to 212 MHz and achieves Gigabit data-rates. Vectoring technology cancels the performance-limiting crosstalk among DSL lines on a signal level, but requires co-located <b>line</b> <b>termination.</b> Differently, dynamic spectrum management level 2 (DSM-L 2) coordinates the transmit power spectra among interferers and thus, does not require all <b>line</b> <b>termination</b> <b>units</b> to be co-located. In this work we analyze the data-rates of G. fast under full vectoring, partial vectoring restricted to groups of users, and non-vectoring scenarios. We also propose interference alignment (IA) as an alternative method to DSM-L 2 {{for dealing with the}} interference in G. fast and show that IA is superior to DSM-L 2 in non-vectoring scenarios. Furthermore, we also propose time division multiple access (TDMA) for coordination of multiple vectoring groups in partial vectoring scenarios. I...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{line module}} unit {{converts}} analogue signals from {{a maximum of}} 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal {{at a rate of}} 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The digital concentrator switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the digital local switching unit via the digital <b>line</b> <b>termination</b> <b>units.</b> The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling.|$|R
50|$|The {{concentrator}} unit {{consists of}} four main sub-systems, line modules, digital concentrator switch, digital <b>line</b> <b>termination</b> (DLT) <b>units</b> and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if connection to the DLE is lost.|$|R

The interface utilizes the ground line as a "voltage active line" to transmit both clock and data signals between the digital microphone circuit and a receiving circuit. The digital microphone circuit detects the clock signal on the voltage active line and uses the detected clock signal to operate an ADC to provide digital data. The digital data is used to selectively drive current back to the receiving circuit over the voltage active line.
