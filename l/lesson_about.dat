In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored curriculum elements, instructional practices, and values guiding expert thinking regarding multiculturally inclusive <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> the United States Constitution. Significant research exists about teaching the Constitution and research is growing regarding multicultural inclusion. However, research integrating {{teaching about the}} Constitution with multicultural considerations is limited. Data were gathered from personal interviews with six Civics and multicultural education experts. Data analysis produced four themes regarding multiculturally inclusive citizenship education. The themes are: (1) Teaching extensive American and Constitutional history is a critical attribute of quality citizenship education. Civics students should develop deep historical understandings of the American founding documents and associated history. (2) America is, currently, and was historically, a racially, ethnically, and culturally diverse society. Citizenship education should include multiple historical perspectives and contributions generating increased student investment in our democratic system. (3) Civics educators may transmit culturally unifying information including concepts universally recognized by all Americans. These concepts include liberty, justice, and equality under the law. (4) The United States Constitution is an adaptable, dynamic, and evolutionary document. Students should see the founding documents as viable and applicable to contemporary situations. ^ The study used the primary and secondary research questions listed below. ^ Primary research question. (1) What curriculum elements, instructional strategies, and values guide expert thinking regarding multiculturally inclusive <b>lessons</b> <b>about</b> the United States Constitution?^ Sub questions.
