The main {{objective of this}} research is to determine success factors for new product launch (NPL) by subsidiaries operating in developing countries. It is argued that <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> NPL decisions contributes positively to new product superiority and commercial performance, with partial least squares used to test the hypothesis. The results show that <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> innovation decisions increases <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> branding and commercialisation decisions in the local market. However, <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> commercialisation decisions positively influences new product superiority, while <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> innovation decisions reduces this superiority. Finally, hypothesis testing reveals that <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> commercial decisions and new product superiority both increase the commercial performance of new products in the local market...|$|R
40|$|This thesis consolidates the {{available}} literature on game localisation into a single, ideal localisation process and compares this ideal process to the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) game Final Fantasy XIV. The main {{purpose is to}} identify and discuss any MMO specific localisation issues. Information on the <b>localisation</b> process <b>of</b> Final Fantasy XIV was gained through {{an interview with the}} localisation staff, as well as previously available online material. The results show that the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Final Fantasy XIV even exceeds the ideal localisation on several points, and indicates several MMO specific localisation issues: fluctuating team size, the need for uniformity <b>of</b> visual <b>assets</b> in all language versions, short localisation cycles, and how to incorporate player feedback. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the localised versions of the game have influenced the original version in several ways...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{can provide}} a useful forewarning <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> failure in electricity substations. A significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> are susceptible to PD due to incipient weakness in their dielectrics. This paper examines a low cost approach for uninterrupted monitoring of PD using a network of inexpensive radio sensors to sample the spatial patterns of PD received signal strength. Machine learning techniques are proposed for <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> PD sources. Specifically, two models based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are developed: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Least-Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR). These models construct an explicit regression surface in a high dimensional feature space for function estimation. Their performance is {{compared to that of}} artificial neural network (ANN) models. The results show that both SVR and LSSVR methods are superior to ANNs in accuracy. LSSVR approach is particularly recommended as practical alternative for PD source localisation due to it low complexity...|$|R

40|$|Multimedia {{materials}} require {{research methodologies}} that {{are able to}} comprehend all <b>of</b> their <b>assets.</b> Videogames are the epitome of multimedia, joining image, sound, video, animation, graphics and text with the interactivity factor. A methodology to conduct research into translation and <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> videogames should be able to analyse all <b>of</b> its <b>assets</b> and features. This paper sets out to develop a research methodology for games and their translations/localisations that goes beyond the collection and analysis of “screenshots” and includes as many <b>of</b> their <b>assets</b> as possible. Using the fully localised version of the game Watchdogs, this papers shows how tools and technologies allow for transcending the mere analysis of linguistic contents within multimedia materials. Using software ELAN Language Archive to analyse Portuguese-language dubbed and English-language subtitled excerpts from the videogame, it was possible to identify patterns in both linguistic and audio-visual elements, as well as to correlate them...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to explore}} the influence of culture difference on the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> multinational enterprise based on the case of Satatools in China. In order to achieve the research aim, questionnaire was used to investigate the culture confliction between foreign managers and Chinese local staffs during the process <b>of</b> <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools in China. Semi-structured interview was used to investigate the influence of culture difference on the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools in China. This research has yielded the following conclusions: First, from questionnaire, it could be known that Satatools implemented localisation strategy in production & purchase, marketing, human resources and R&D. Comparatively, human resources <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools is still conservative. The senior managers of Satatools in China still compose of staffs assigned by parent company. The barriers and challenges of the implementation <b>of</b> <b>localisation</b> strategy <b>of</b> Satatools in China’s market are cultural difference between China and American staffs, inadaptable management and leadership of American company for Chinese staffs and value differences between Chinese and American managers. Second, it is found from interview that comprehensive implementation <b>of</b> <b>localisation</b> strategy <b>of</b> Satatools in China includes production & purchase localisation, marketing localisation, human resources localisation and R&D <b>localisation.</b> The <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools in China is a gradual process, including production & purchase localisation at first, then marketing localisation and human resources localisation, and finally R&D localisation. Third, it is further found from interview that Satatools usually encounters barriers of cultural difference and confliction during localisation in China. Cultural differences increase difficulties of staff management with poor cohesion of staffs, innovation & change and decision-making. Moreover, cultural differences increase training costs of staffs and difficulties of R&D & design of products. Finally, this dissertation proposed some recommendations for enterprise in China to carry out the localisation strategy...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{problems}} of deconfinement, chiral symmetry restoration and <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the low Dirac eigenmodes in a toy model of QCD, namely unimproved staggered fermions on lattices of temporal extension $N_T= 4 $. This model displays a genuine deconfining and chirally-restoring first-order phase transition at some critical value of the gauge coupling. Our {{results indicate that the}} onset <b>of</b> <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the lowest Dirac eigenmodes takes place at the same critical coupling where the system undergoes the first-order phase transition.
