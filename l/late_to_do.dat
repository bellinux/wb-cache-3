5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when it was already too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E
5|$|When Sickles {{arrived with}} his III Corps, General Meade {{instructed}} {{him to take}} up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on Little Round Top. Sickles originally did so, but after noon he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground ("Hazel Grove") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade was furious about this insubordination, but it was too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything about itthe Confederate attack was imminent.|$|E

25|$|On 20 May, the French {{crossed to}} the north bank of the Sambre and took up a {{position}} facing west with the left flank resting on Erquelinnes and the right flank at the Bonne-Espérance Abbey. The following day Kaunitz mounted {{an attack on the}} new French position. The French were chased out of Erquelinnes but later recaptured the village and stopped the Coalition attack. Kléber suggested using Mayer's unengaged division near Bonne-Espérance to launch a counterattack on Kaunitz's left flank. But since Mayer belonged to the Army of the Ardennes, Desjardin declined to give the general a direct order. The order had to pass through Charbonnier, who was so far away that it was too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything. Vezú's division was at Fontaine-l'Évêque and Charbonnier was preoccupied rounding up cattle and horses. There is evidence from his correspondence that Charbonnier was jealous of his authority as army commander-in-chief and was reluctant to follow Pichegru's instructions. He considered his army as an autonomous force and failed to appreciate that he must cooperate with Desjardin to gain success.|$|E
25|$|At 11:10 the Light Brigade {{began their}} advance towards the Russians guns over a mile (~ 2km) away. When {{the first line}} was clear of the second, the order was given to 'Trot'. Initially {{there was nothing to}} {{indicate}} that Cardigan was not going to conform to Raglan's intentions, and it was only after he had travelled some 200 yards (~180 m) that the enormity of the misconstrued order became apparent to the spectators on the Sapouné Heights. Instead of inclining to the right towards the redoubts on the Causeway Heights and the captured British guns, the Light Brigade continued towards Obolensky's battery {{at the end of the}} valley. But it was too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything. Nolan was the first to be killed when he dashed forward ahead of Cardigan, either in an effort to force the pace, or, suddenly realising the terrible mistake that was being made (and his part in it), in an attempt to change the direction of the brigade towards Raglan's intended objective. Whatever the reason, Nolan was hit by a splinter from a shell fired from one of the guns positioned on the Fedioukine Heights.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} Argentine Dictatorship (1976 - 1983), a number of feature-length films have engaged in the public debate over the {{legacies}} of state terrorism.   El secreto de sus ojos (2009), Argentina's most recent Oscar winner, is the <b>latest</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, exploring the effects of more than a decade of impunity on those who lost their loved ones. Suggesting that restoration of a justice system that works can lead to the restoration of full civic engagement in a healthy body politic, the film raises important questions about citizenship and belonging in a post-national era. This essay explores the film's phenomenal success in the global memory market to illuminate what remains at stake in contemporary narratives of reconciliation. </p...|$|R
500|$|Thompson {{also criticized}} Bill Gates and Microsoft for {{contracting}} with Rockstar Games {{to release the}} game on the Xbox. The Xbox version has since been cancelled for undisclosed reasons, but a version was released years later on the Xbox 360. In August 2006, Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy, threatening to file suit in Miami {{if he did not}} gain help from U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns. Once the game is out, according to Thompson, [...] "the horse will be out of the barn and it will be too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything about it". Thompson argued that it violated Florida's public nuisance laws, which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, McPherson {{began to}} extend his right flank beyond the Confederate hilltop. [...] The {{position}} having been turned and his routed units reasonably reformed, Gregg ordered a withdrawal through Raymond towards Jackson. [...] Here, the Federal artillery finally made its mark in the battle, pounding the Confederate ranks as Gregg continued the delaying action to allow his battered units to withdraw. [...] As his disorganized force came scrambling over fences and through yards in Raymond, they were met by the 3rd Kentucky Mounted Infantry and 800 cavalry {{under the command of}} Wirt Adams, the leading elements of reinforcements headed to Raymond from all over the Confederacy. [...] Help had arrived too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything but provide cavalry rear guard protection to General Gregg's spent force.|$|E

2500|$|After sitting Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty {{announced}} that he would not seek re-election in 2010, it was widely anticipated that Coleman would run for governor. Polls in late 2009 showed him the favorite among Republicans and polling the strongest among all potential Republican candidates. However Coleman announced on January 17, 2010 that he would not run, saying [...] "The timing on this race is both a bit too soon and a bit too late.

2500|$|In 1968, Boesch {{was sent}} on a combat {{deployment}} to the Vietnam War, as a platoon chief based in Mỹ Tho in the Mekong Delta. [...] The general combat mission of SEALs in Vietnam {{was to do}} intelligence gathering and to conduct raids and ambushes and make prisoner grabs. [...] In Boesch's own 1995 retelling, he did all those things on that tour. [...] In the 2010 Vietnam-era memoir SEAL Warrior: The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday, Thomas Keith describes Boesch leading a platoon in nighttime ambush raids against the Viet Cong during the war, operating in the delta and using LCM-8 [...] "Mike boats" [...] for access. [...] Boesch earned the Bronze Star for heroic action during more than 45 combat operations. [...] Another primary mission for SEALs during the conflict was to train South Vietnamese special forces. When Boesch deployed to Vietnam again, in 1970, he later related that {{this time he was}} sent to Cam Ranh Bay, where he conducted training for the Liên Đoàn Người Nhái, the South Vietnamese equivalent of the UDT, as part of the Vietnamization strategy. [...] Boesch later assessed that these allied forces were capable, but overly dependent upon the U.S., and that [...] "Vietnamization was an idea that came too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> enough good." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 March 1981 Powell gave {{a speech}} to Ashton-under-Lyne Young Conservatives where he {{attacked}} the [...] "conspiracy of silence" [...] {{between the government and}} the opposition over the prospective growth through births of the immigration population and added, [...] "'We have seen nothing yet' is a phrase that we could with advantage repeat to ourselves whenever we try to form a picture of that future". He also criticised those who believed it was [...] "too <b>late</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything" [...] and that [...] "there lies the certainty of violence on a scale which can only adequately be described as civil war". He also said that the solution was [...] "a reduction in prospective numbers as would represent re-emigration hardly less massive than the immigration which occurred in the first place". The Shadow Home Secretary, Labour MP Roy Hattersley, criticised Powell for using [...] "Munich beer-hall language". On 11 April, there was a riot in Brixton and when on 13 April an interviewer quoted to Thatcher Powell's remark that [...] "We have seen nothing yet," [...] she replied: [...] "I heard him say that and I thought it was a very very alarming remark.
