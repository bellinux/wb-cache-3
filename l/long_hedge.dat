A lovely autumn countryside with changing many-tinted foliage lay stretched before them, all bathed in peaceful sunshine, and nothing save those flickering fitful gleams to tell of the silent and lurking enemy who barred their way. But the bold spirit of the French cavaliers rose the higher to the danger. The clamor of their war-cries filled the air, and they tossed their pennoned spears over their heads in menace and defiance. From the English line it was a noble sight, the gallant, pawing, curveting horses, the many-colored twinkling riders, the swoop and wave and toss of plume and banner.|$|E

Another Japanese maid, an array of Turkish towels on her arm, crossed the lawn well to the right in the direction of the bath-houses, from which the children, in swimming suits, were beginning to emerge.

The sweet fresh garden-scent came through the open window, and the birds were busy flitting and alighting, gurgling and singing. Yet Maggie's eyes began to fill with tears. The sight of the old scenes had made the rush of memories so painful that even yesterday she had only been able to rejoice in her mother's restored comfort and Tom's brotherly friendliness as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance, rather than {{in the presence of a}} happiness which we share. Memory and imagination urged upon her a sense of privation too keen to let her taste what was offered in the transient present. Her future, she thought, was likely to be worse than her past, for after her years of contented renunciation, she had slipped back into desire and longing; she found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder; she found the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for, and despaired of, becoming more and more importunate. The sound of the opening door roused her, and hastily wiping away her tears, she began to turn over the leaves of her book.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the land}} cleared was usually common land but after {{assarting}} the space became privately used. The process took several forms. Usually {{it was done}} by one farmer who hacked out a clearing from the woodland, leaving a hedged field. However, sometimes groups of individuals or even entire villages did the work {{and the results were}} divided into strips and shared among tenant farmers. Monastic communities, particularly the Cistercians, sometimes assarted, as well as local lords. The cleared land often leaves behind an assart hedge, which often contains a high number of woodland trees such as small leafed lime or wild service and contains trees that rarely colonise planted hedges, such as hazel. Examples are in Dorset, where there is a difference in the hedges in the west and the east of the county, at Hatfield Broadoak in Essex where the modern hedges still follow the boundaries of an ancient forest, and at Shelley in Suffolk where there is an unusually <b>long</b> <b>hedge</b> made up of coppiced lime trees that is the remnant of a nineteenth-century woodland clearance.|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho analisa o comportamento da base de café arábica, visando ajudar o estabelecimento de estratégias de hedge. Verificou-se que há oportunidades de ganho tanto para hedgers de venda quanto de compra, porém as oportunidades de estratégias de hedge de compra são poucas e a lucratividade é ainda menor, em relação às estratégias de hedge de venda. Além disso, os contratos futuros com vencimento em março e maio apresentaram os maiores riscos de base devido ao fato de se ter maiores incertezas nos meses que antecedem a nova safra. Verificou-se, ainda, que o fortalecimento da base não é diretamente proporcional ao risco de base, predominando casos em que maior rentabilidade é acompanhada por menor risco, e vice-versa. Por fim, contatou-se que as maiores rentabilidades com operações de hedge de venda ocorrem com operações iniciadas no segundo semestre do ano.

40|$|Hedging {{can be a}} {{valuable}} tool to minimize price uncertainty for producers. There {{are two types of}} hedges producers may use, a short hedge and a <b>long</b> <b>hedge.</b> Short hedges are used to lock in a net selling price when prices are expected to fall, while a <b>long</b> <b>hedge</b> is used to lock in a buying price when prices are expected to rise for a commodity that is bought and used as an input. A short hedge is initiated by selling a contract on the futures market. The contract is generally bought back close to the time the contracted commodity is sold in the cash market. If the futures contract value decreases, money is made on the transaction. If the futures contract increases in value as time passes, money is lost on the transaction. The resulting gain/loss on the futures contract transactions offset changes in the cash market due to price changes for the commodity, resulting in the net amount paid or received being close to the expected price. The reason this works in deferring risk is that movements in the cash price generally reflect the futures price, with the difference defined as the basis. If basis behaves in a normal way, the actual payoff or net price received will be the same as the expected price. A <b>long</b> <b>hedge</b> is the reciprocal of the short hedge. A <b>long</b> <b>hedge</b> is initiated to protect the producer from the expectation of rising costs...|$|E

Since the 1980 s, financial futures contracts based on indexes of stocks, commodities and currencies have been used to hedge these groups of assets. The {{purpose of this study was}} to apply the concept of index futures contracts to the produce industry by developing indexes based on prices of fruits and vegetables and to determine the hedging effectiveness of potential futures contracts written on these indexes. Twenty representative fruits and vegetables were chosen to compile indexes for fruits, for vegetables, and for fruits and vegetables together using a trade-weighted arithmetic average of 1989 to 1992 wholesale prices of selected commodities traded on the Dallas Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction of}} storage and futures trading when producers make decisions covering many harvests. In this more general context, by examining how risks are distributed between storers and growers, results are obtained that differ dramatically from previous models in the literature. When storage is costly, storers may reduce risk by taking <b>long</b> <b>hedging</b> positions, rather than selling inventories short. Contrary to the conventional view (in a tradition beginning with J. M. Keynes and J. R. Hicks), costless storage does not imply downward bias of futures prices (" normal backwardation"). Hedging against the optimally varying planting costs promotes upward price bias (" contango"), while hedging against storage costs to be incurred promotes downward bias. When the risks faced by growers and storers are negatively correlated, futures trading can substitute for vertical integration {{as a means of}} reducing risk.

40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} hedging {{performance}} of the newly established CSI 300 stock index futures over some short hedging horizons. We use wavelet analysis as well as conventional models (na&iuml;ve, ordinary least squares, and error-correction) to compute the constant hedge ratios. The constant conditional correlation (CCC) and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) bivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (BGARCH) specifications are employed to calculate the time-varying hedge ratios. Overall, {{we find that the}} CSI 300 stock index futures can be an effective hedging tool. Among the constant hedge ratio models, the wavelet analysis yields the best in-sample hedging performance, though its out-of-sample hedging performance is similar to other models. Comparing the time-varying ratio models, the CCC BGARCH model is better in terms of in-sample hedging effectiveness while for out-of-sample hedging performance, the DCC model is better with short hedging horizons and CCC model is more favourable with <b>long</b> <b>hedging</b> horizons. Finally, the question whether time-varying ratios outperform constant ratios depends on the length of the hedging horizon. Short horizons favour BGARCH <b>hedging</b> models while <b>long</b> horizons favour constant hedging ratio models...|$|R

The cash market model {{is characterized by the}} incorporation of <b>long</b> <b>hedged</b> to establish contractual claims against existing inventories, which may be either short hedged or unhedged. The futures market model incorporates outright speculation as well as spread speculation. The paper then examines through mathematical analysis the characteristics these markets must possess if they are informationally efficient, if they are conformable for testing price discovery, and if they are integrated in the short or long run. Thus far results indicate that informationally efficient futures markets are characterized by any one of five conditions: (1) perfectly inelastic utilization demand, (20 perfectly inelastic hedged inventory demand, (3) futures markets not used for hedging, (4) perfectly elastic speculation, or (5) infinitely elastic utilization demand and perfectly inelastic speculation. These conditions further imply that if futures markets are informationally efficient, their prices are not determined simultaneously with cash prices. The extreme assumptions associated with informational efficiency highlight the deficiency of the concept. Marketing,...|$|R
