50|$|The {{comparative}} study of different <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> carried out by Ferrari et al. reported that CPU load information based upon the CPU queue length does much better in load balancing compared to CPU utilization. The reason CPU queue length did better is probably because when a host is heavily loaded, its CPU utilization {{is likely to be}} close to 100% and it is unable to reflect the exact load level of the utilization. In contrast, CPU queue lengths can directly reflect the amount of load on a CPU. As an example, two systems, one with 3 and the other with 6 processes in the queue, are both very likely to have utilizations close to 100% although they obviously differ.|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{precision}} to predict service performance through <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> {{may lead to}} wrong decisions {{regarding the use of}} web services, compromising service performance and raising platform cost unnecessarily. This paper presents experimental studies to qualify the behaviour of <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> in the web service context. The experiments consider three services that generate controlled and significant server demands, four levels of workload for each service and six distinct execution scenarios. The evaluation considers three relevant perspectives: the capability for representing recent workloads, the capability for predicting near-future performance and finally stability. Eight different <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> were analysed, including the JMX Average Time index (proposed in this paper) specifically designed to address the limitations of the other indices. A systematic approach is applied to evaluate the different <b>load</b> <b>indices,</b> considering a multiple linear regression model based on the stepwise-AIC method. The results show that the <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> studied represent the workload to some extent; however, in contrast to expectations, most of them do not exhibit a coherent correlation with service performance and this can result in stability problems. The JMX Average Time index is an exception, showing a stable behaviour which is tightly-coupled to the service runtime for all executions. <b>Load</b> <b>indices</b> are used to predict the service runtime and therefore their inappropriate use can lead to decisions that will impact negatively on both service performance and execution cost...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic load-balancing {{strategies}} for distributed systems seek to improve average completion time of inde-pendent tasks by migrating each incoming task {{to the site}} where {{it is expected to}} finish the fastest: usually the site having the smallest load index. SMALL is an off-line learning system for developing configuration-specific load-balancing strategies; it learns new <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> as well as tunes the parameters of given migration policies. Using a dynamic workload generator, anumber of typical systemwide load patterns are first recorded; the completion times of several benchmark jobs are then measured at each site, under each of the recorded load patterns. These measure-ments are used to simultaneously train comparator neural networks, one per site. The comparators collectively model a set of perfect <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> in that they seek to rank, at arrival time, the possible destinations for an incoming task by their (not yet known) respective completion times.

40|$|A primary {{objective}} of computing systems is the efficient utilization of available resources. This {{has become increasingly}} important {{with the advent of}} large, low-cost distributed systems. Effective resource management of these types of systems requires strategies for the equitable distribution or scheduling of processes among the multiple processors available. Regardless of the type of scheduling being considered (static, dynamic, real-time), an essential element of the scheduling policy is the measurement of load. To efficiently manage load distribution, an accurate workload metric or load index is necessary. In this paper, we empirically investigate the usefulness of various popular <b>load</b> <b>indices,</b> and include one which we propose. We study the effect that the choice of load index has on the performance of load balancing algorithms executed on non-dedicated and heterogeneous distributed systems.

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{model for}} computational grids interconnects similar multi-resource servers from distributed sites. A job {{submitted to the}} grid can be executed {{by any of the}} servers; however, resource size or balance may be different across servers. One approach to resource management for this grid is to layer a global load distribution system on top of the local job management systems at each site. Unfortunately, classical load distribution policies fail on two aspects when applied to a multi-resource server grid. First, simple <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> may not recognize that a resource imbalance exists at a server. Second, classical job selection policies do not actively correct such a resource imbalanced state.

40|$|Load-balancing systems use {{workload}} indices to dynamically schedule jobs. We {{present a}} novel method of automatically learning such indices. Our approach uses comparator neural networks, one per site, which learn {{to predict the}} relative speedup of an incoming job using only the resourceutilization patterns observed prior to the job's arrival. Our <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> combine information from the key resources of contention: CPU, disk, network, and memory.
