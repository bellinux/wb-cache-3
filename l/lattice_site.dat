40|$|We {{explore the}} {{coherent}} destruction of tunneling (CDT) in a lattice array under selective in-phase harmonic modulations, {{in which some}} selected <b>lattice</b> <b>sites</b> are driven by in-phase harmonic oscillating fields and other <b>lattice</b> <b>sites</b> are undriven. Due to the occurrence of CDT, if the driving amplitude A and the driving frequency ω are tuned to satisfy the zeroth-order Bessel function J_ 0 (A/ω) = 0, the driven <b>lattice</b> <b>sites</b> are approximately decoupled with the undriven <b>lattice</b> <b>sites.</b> The CDT even takes place in lattice systems with high-order couplings between non-nearest <b>lattice</b> <b>sites.</b> By using the CDT, we propose a scheme for realizing directed transport of a single particle. It is possible to observe the CDT in the engineered optical waveguide array, which provides a new opportunity for controlling light propagation and designing switch-like couplers.

It is found that the behavior of phosphorus in Hg(0. 8) Cd(0. 2) Te is similar to that established for CdTe, except that all the electrically active phosphorus defect centers in Hg(0. 8) Cd(0. 2) Te appear to be only singly ionized.

2500|$|An {{example that}} links {{together}} {{many of the}} ideas {{in this article is}} the phase transition of the Ising model, a simple model of ferromagnetic substances. This is a statistical mechanics model, which also has a description in terms of conformal field theory. The system consists of an array of lattice sites, which form a -dimensional periodic lattice.

2500|$|Paradoxically, {{dimensional}} analysis {{can be a}} useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the Ising model {{can be used to}} study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. As we approach the critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, [...] ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on [...] "dimensional grounds" [...] that the non-analytical part of the free energy per <b>lattice</b> <b>site</b> should be [...] where [...] is the dimension of the lattice.|$|E

40|$|The coupled cluster method (CCM) {{is applied}} to a spin-half model at zero {{temperature}} which interpolates between a triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TAF) and a Kagome lattice antiferromagnet (KAF). The strength of the bonds which connect Kagome <b>lattice</b> <b>sites</b> is J, {{and the strength of}} the bonds which link the non-Kagome <b>lattice</b> <b>sites</b> to the Kagome <b>lattice</b> <b>sites</b> on an underlying triangular lattice is J'. Our results are found to be highly converged, and our best estimate for the ground-state energy per spin for the spin-half KAF (J'= 0) of - 0. 4252 constitutes one of the most accurate results yet found for this model. The amount of classical ordering on the Kagome <b>lattice</b> <b>sites</b> is also considered, and it is seen that this parameter goes to zero for values of J' very close the KAF point. Further evidence is also presented for CCM critical points which reinforce the conjecture that there is a phase near to the KAF point which is much different to that near to the TAF point (J=J').
