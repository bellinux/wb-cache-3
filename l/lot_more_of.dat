Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E

Locke was extremely proud of New Zealand's nuclear-free status, and of the decades of struggle endured to achieve it. She remained committed to the cause {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

500|$|After publication, Juster sent {{a copy of}} {{the book}} to the Ford Foundation, with an {{explanation}} of how the projected book on cities had transformed into The Phantom Tollbooth. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk to me about a whole different book, normally. But now they've got a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the words right. A <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the fun kind of crazy references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, {{as in the case of}} the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.|$|E

500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
500|$|Louis Leterrier, {{who enjoyed}} the TV series {{as a child}} and liked the first film, had {{expressed}} interest in directing the Iron Man film adaptation. Jon Favreau had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent. Leterrier's primary inspiration was Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Hulk: Gray (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film. Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him, while Feige added the film would explore [...] "that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself". Arad also said the film would be [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross".|$|E
500|$|In early February 2011, Gourcuff {{admitted}} that he was [...] "disappointed and frustrated" [...] with his performances with Lyon since joining the club stating [...] "I expected a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> myself" [...] and [...] "It's clear that my attacking contribution is not enough". Gourcuff also {{admitted that}} he was struggling {{to adapt to the}} style of manager Claude Puel, though the player later clarified his statements stating that they were misinterpreted. Two weeks after his comments, on 18 February 2011, Gourcuff scored his third goal for Lyon in the club's 4–0 win over Nancy. He, subsequently, went scoreless for the next two months with his only statistical output being an assist on a Jimmy Briand goal in a 3–0 win over Lens on 10 April. On 27 April, Gourcuff scored the match-winning goal in a 3–2 victory against Montpellier after appearing as a substitute two minutes prior. A week later, his season was ended prematurely after suffering an adductor injury in a 2–0 defeat to Toulouse. Gourcuff finished his debut campaign at Lyon with 36 total appearances, four goals, and five assists.|$|E

500|$|In a {{detailed}} review, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard wrote, [...] demonstrates an originality in sound {{that was necessary}} for the revitalization of the boy band movement. The electropop currently dominating Top 40 radio is seamlessly weaved into the pop harmonies made standards by 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees -- for instance, the title track sounds like a hybrid of Backstreet Boys' [...] "Larger than Life" [...] and an LMFAO song, and even includes a Katy Perry name-check. Up All Night has its ups and downs, but One Direction complete two important tasks on their debut album: the boy band notches a long-lasting hit with [...] "What Makes You Beautiful," [...] and they look forward instead of back. Get ready to hear a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> One Direction. Matthew Horton of Virgin Media opined that the album brims with [...] "punchy pop rock", and considered the dance-orientated [...] "Stole My Heart": [...] "the only misstep, which only reinforces their decision to go pop rock." [...] MSN Musics Ben Chalk called the album: [...] "manufactured, calculated and commercial", assessing that the resulting album [...] "is a corking pop album".

500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, {{and if there are}} good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Wesley is {{introduced}} in Angel having been {{fired from the}} Watcher's Council. Denisof says the experience gave the character [...] "a little shake". He elaborates, When he arrived in Sunnydale, he was straight out of Watcher grad school; he lacked practical experience. He {{was living in the}} ideal of the perfect way to execute his duties. I think that losing his job and going out alone roughened him up a little, lopped off some of his sharper corners. It made him more approachable and more personable, less sure of himself all the time. [...] Coming into the show immediately following the death of Doyle, Wesley serves as a partial replacement for that character. Comparing the two characters, Denisof states, [...] "Wesley is a clearer counterpart to Angel, whereas Doyle had more street smarts. Although [...] was struggling with his demon nature, he had seen a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the world in the same way Angel had."

According to journalist Joe Shooman, little work commenced on the album: [...] "As for +44, there had been months slipping by with no real work on that one aside from writing snippets here and there, although there were also reports flying about that the next tour would take in a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the world including South America." [...] Barker started releasing hip-hop remixes on May 9, 2008, and he hoped to collate his growing collection of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. Eventually, the project became a solo album, with Barker producing it all himself. By the following August, Hoppus began recording material for a possible solo studio album at Opera while Barker worked on his solo studio album. [...] "I see him in our studio every week, and we'll be in the room of the studio he's working in, listening to stuff he's recorded, or he'll come into the room where I'm working and check out my songs," [...] said Hoppus.
