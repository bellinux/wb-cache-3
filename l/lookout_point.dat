40|$|The {{increase}} of the visibility of a territory, in order to highlight {{the potential of the}} landscape, seen as a resource which can ensure the performance of various social-economic activities in a territory becomes achievable by arranging <b>lookout</b> <b>points.</b> Conducting the visibility analysis of such points is a common topic in the works of territorial planning, namely in terms of valorisation of landscapes and the visual impact assessment of their characteristics. The natural and the anthropic component of the District of Ciceu work together to create a valuable resource of the landscape, which are most often surprising by the presence of pitoresque valleys preserving the territorial specificities. The present study aims, in a first phase, that by the methods and tools specific to the onsite step (observation, mapping), to identify possible locations, including vestiges and historic buildings, suitable for arranging representative <b>lookout</b> <b>points</b> to present the elements of the landscape in the District of Ciceu. In order to achieve the visibility analysis, in order to highlight the assessment potential of district’s ”landscape” from the mapped <b>lookout</b> <b>points,</b> was resorted to ViewshedAnalysys method of the ArcGIS software. The use of the mapping leads to the materialization of theresults of the different cartographic representations, useful for the landscape recovery activities. The results of the study consist in generating the visibility areas of the <b>lookout</b> <b>points,</b> development of tourist routes that integrate the <b>lookout</b> <b>points</b> mapped on-site, namely to capitalize the landscape elements of the District of Ciceu...|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} <b>lookout</b> <b>points</b> in the park. Of these, Low Knoll with its {{full view of}} the lower marsh, and High Knoll with its 600 ft. {{elevation}} and view of the Pitt River and Pitt Meadows beyond, are among the most popular.

5|$|Trams served Caversham between 1880 and 1954, {{operating}} in Hillside Road, South Road, and David Street. Several bus routes now serve Caversham, connecting {{it with the}} heart of the city. Citibus and Dunedin Passenger Transport run routes from the city centre to Saint Clair and Corstorphine via Hillside Road, and to <b>Lookout</b> <b>Point</b> via South Road. Dunedin passenger transport also runs services between The Octagon and both Mosgiel and Brighton via South Road. Cargill's Corner, at the South Dunedin end of Hillside Road, is a major suburban bus hub.|$|E

A scene where the completed heist team walk down a beach was filmed in Copacabana.|$|E

5|$|Until the {{construction}} of the bypass, South Road and Caversham Valley Road formed the main route out of Dunedin to the south. State Highway 1 followed South Road through the main retail area, then followed Caversham Valley Road to <b>Lookout</b> <b>Point.</b> Above its retail area, South Road winds around the flank of Calton Hill; Caversham Valley Road forms a straighter, steep route that originally continued from the end of South Road's retail area. For this reason, the part of South Road running through the retail area is also sometimes referred to as part of Caversham Valley Road. Improvements to Caversham Valley Road to ease congestion and increase safety began in 2011. A junction {{at the north end of}} Caversham's main retail area connects South Road with the bypass.|$|E
5|$|Villadarias {{decided to}} send a force of 2,000 men– {{nearly a third of}} his entire army– divided into two groups: an initial force of 500 to seize the heights at night, {{followed}} by a further 1,500 the following daybreak. The first 500 set off at dusk on 11 November, led by a Colonel Figueroa and guided by Simón Susarte. They {{made it to the top}} of the Rock, reaching its southernmost peak near where O'Hara's Battery stands today, and descended part-way down the west side where they sheltered overnight in St. Michael's Cave. At daybreak they climbed the Philip II Wall, which extends up the west side of the Rock, and killed the English sentries in the <b>lookout</b> <b>point</b> at Middle Hill. A drummer boy bringing food to the lookout saw the invaders and raised the alarm.|$|E
5|$|Plaman Mapu {{was a tiny}} Malaysian village {{only half}} a mile behind {{the western part of}} the border between Sarawak and Kalimantan. There the British had {{established}} a base for 'B' Company of the Parachute Regiment. Apart from the two 3-inch mortars stationed there, the place had little strategic value beyond being a <b>lookout</b> <b>point</b> for the British to detect Indonesian raids over the border. By the low standards of the makeshift British jungle bases, it was fairly well defended, equipped with aforementioned mortars, an interconnected trench network, and a command bunker, with supporting artillery weapons within range of the base to supply cover. The defenders of the base, by contrast, were wholly unprepared for combat. The undermanned 'B' Company had recently been supplied with a platoon of inexperienced troopers who had pitiful experience in jungle warfare. Due to the intensity of recent fighting, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Eberhardie, had only been able to spare a few of the new men for a training course in such combat at Singapore, but one of those was Sergeant Major John Williams, who would play a crucial role in the coming battle.|$|E
