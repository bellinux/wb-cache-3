25|$|In the 19th century, the {{surgical}} techniques of J.F. Dieffenbach (1792–1847) popularized the nasolabial flap for nasal reconstruction, {{for which it}} remains a foundational nose surgery procedure. The nasolabial flap can be either superiorly based or inferiorly based; of which the superiorly based flap is the more practical rhinoplastic application, {{because it has a}} more versatile arc of rotation, and the donor-site scar is inconspicuous. Depending upon the how the defect <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the nose, the flap pedicle-base can be incorporated either solely to the nasal reconstruction, or it can be divided into a second stage procedure. The blood supply for the flap pedicle are the transverse branches of the contralateral angular artery (the facial artery terminus parallel to the nose), and by a confluence of blood vessels from the angular artery and from the supraorbital artery in the medial canthus, (the angles formed by the meeting of the upper and lower eyelids). Therefore, the incisions for harvesting the nasolabial flap do not continue superiorly beyond the medial canthal tendon. The nasolabial flap is a random flap that is emplaced with the proximal (near) portion resting upon the lateral wall of the nose, and the distal (far) portion resting upon the cheek, which contains the main angular artery, and so is perfused with retrograde arterial flow.|$|E
500|$|In 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist. She was {{eighteen}} months younger than Yeats and later claimed {{she met the}} poet as a [...] "paint-stained art student." [...] Gonne admired [...] "The Island of Statues" [...] and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, {{and she had a}} significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, [...] "it seems to me that she [...] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes." [...] Yeats's love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.|$|E

500|$|There is {{evidence}} that Offa constructed a series of defensive burhs, or fortified towns; the locations are not generally agreed on but may include Bedford, Hereford, Northampton, Oxford and Stamford. In addition to their defensive uses, these burhs {{are thought to have}} been administrative centres, serving as regional markets and indicating a transformation of the Mercian economy away from its origins as a grouping of midland peoples. The burhs are forerunners of the defensive network successfully implemented by Alfred the Great a century later to deal with the Danish invasions. However, Offa did not necessarily understand the economic changes that came with the burhs, so it is not safe to assume he envisioned all their benefits. In 749, Æthelbald of Mercia had issued a charter that freed ecclesiastical lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges– obligations which <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> everyone, as part of the trinoda necessitas. Offa's Kentish charters show him laying these same burdens on the recipients of his grants there, and this may be a sign that the obligations were being spread outside Mercia. These burdens were part of Offa's response to the threat of [...] "the pagan seaman".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{from these}} {{charters}} {{that we learn}} of the obligations lying upon land. The state demanded men for {{the army and the}} corvée, as well as dues in kind. A certain area was bound to provide a bowman, together with his linked pikeman (who bore the shield for both), and to furnish them with supplies for the campaign. This area was termed a [...] "bow" [...] as early as the 8th century BC, but the practice goes back much earlier. Later, a horseman was also due from certain areas. A man was only bound to serve a certain number of times, but the land still had to find a man annually. This service was usually discharged by slaves and serfs, but the amelu (and perhaps the mushkenu) also went to war. The bows were grouped together in tens and hundreds. The corvée was less regular. Special liabilities also <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> riparian owners to repair canals, bridges, quays, etc. The letters of Hammurabi often deal with claims to exemption. Religious officials and shepherds in charge of flocks were exempt from military duty.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard was {{interested}} in [...] "how" [...] one comes to acquire knowledge. Adolph Peter Adlers experience may have influenced him. He identified his audience as the [...] "reader" [...] and the [...] "listener" [...] but now he speaks of the [...] "seeker". He says, [...] "no man can see God without purity and that no man can know God without becoming a sinner. Dostoevsky tried to reproduce this concept in his art. In Stages on Life's Way, published the next day, he used David and Solomon as examples of those prototypes who did become pure in God's sight by becoming sinners. [...] "While David <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the ground with crushed and contrite heart, Solomon arose from his couch, but his understanding was crushed. Horror seized him when he thought {{of what it was}} to be God’s elect. He surmised that holy intimacy with God, the sincerity of the pure man before the Lord, was not the explanation, but that a private guilt was the secret which explained everything." ...|$|E

[...] His conviviality and his royal {{connections}} made him an important figure in the Royal Society. [...] In 1705, Arbuthnot became physician extraordinary to Queen Anne, {{and at the same}} time was put on the board trying to publish the Historia coelestius. Newton and Edmund Halley wanted it published immediately, to support their work on orbits, while John Flamsteed, the Royal Astronomer whose observations they were, wanted to keep the data secret until he had perfected it. [...] The result was that Arbuthnot used his leverage as friend and physician to Prince George, whose money was paying for the publication, to force Flamsteed to allow it out, albeit with serious errors, in 1712. [...] Also as a scholar, Arbuthnot took up an interest in antiquities and published Tables of Grecian, Roman, and Jewish measures, weights and coins; reduced to the English standard in 1705, 1707, 1709, and, expanded with a preface (which indicated that his second son, Charles, was born in 1705), in 1727 and 1747.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were three}} depositional stages for the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin which were {{dependent}} on plate tectonics of the era. Present-day North America was identified to <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the Proterozoic super-continent, Rodinia. This continent broke apart about 700 {{million years ago}} and formed other continents, {{one of which was}} Laurentia or the North American Craton. Laurentia drifted south of the equatorial zone. As this new smaller continent was smaller than Rodinia, it had some surface area under water level, including area designated as the Phanerozoic basin. [...] Cambrian 544-505 Ma to Mississippian 362-320 Ma period laid down base clastics, then platform carbonates and evaporites. These deposits form the origins of potash evaporites for the potash industry. [...] Laurentia began to rise {{at the close of the}} Cambrian Period. Huge flooding occurred during the Middle Ordovician period 505-441 Ma. Laurentia had shifted again, and the region of Saskatchewan was now north of the equator and some raising exposing the land again. Re-flooding in the Late Ordovician age with warm water increased calcium carbonate sedimentation, and marine life. The Williston basin was formed creating a lowered land area during this period filling with the Winnipeg Sea. The Williston basin was mainly south of Saskatchewan but extended north into the Saskatchewan plains area.|$|E
