40|$|IntroductionThe {{impact of}} esophageal tumor length on pT 1 esophageal {{adenocarcinoma}} {{has not been}} well evaluated. MethodsCase histories of all patients (n = 133) undergoing esophageal resection from 1979 to 2007 with pT 1 adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses of esophageal tumor <b>length</b> and <b>other</b> <b>standard</b> prognostic factors were performed. ResultsPatients with early-stage pT 1 esophageal adenocarcinoma with tumors less than 3 cm demonstrate decreased long-term survival (3 years: > 3 cm = 46 % vs 93 %; P 3 cm = 47 % vs 10 %; P 3 cm) is an independent risk factor for survival in patients with pT 1 early-stage esophageal cancer (hazard ratio: 4. 8, 95 % confidence intervals: 1. 4 – 16. 5; P 3 cm) identifies a high-risk population of pT 1 esophageal adenocarcinoma (3 years: group 1 [0 risk factors] = 100 %, group 2 [1 risk factor] = 87 %, and group 3 [2 risk factors] = 33 %; P 3 cm) is {{a risk factor for}} long-term survival and lymph node involvement in early-stage pT 1 esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophageal tumor length (> 3 cm) in combination with submucosal involvement may help to identify a high-risk group of patients with pT 1 esophageal adenocarcinoma...|$|R
40|$|In String theory {{realization}} of inflation, often the end point of inflation is the brane-anti brane annihilation. We consider {{the processes of}} reheating of the Standard Model universe after brane inflation. We identify the channels of the inflaton energy decay, cascading from tachyon annihilation through massive closed string loops, KK modes, brane displacement moduli to the lighter standard model particles. Cosmological data constraints scenarios by putting stringent limits on fraction of reheating energy deposited in the gravitons and nonstandard sector massive relics. We estimate the energy deposited into various light degrees of freedom in open and closed strings sectors, timing of reheating and reheat temperature. Production of gravitons is significantly suppressed in the warped inflation. However, we predict residual gravitational radiation background at the level Omega_GW∼ 10 ^- 8 of the present cosmological energy density. We also extend analysis to the multiple throat scenarios. A viable reheating would be possible in a single throat or in certain subclass of multiple throat scenarios of KKLMMT type inflation model, but overproduction of massive KK modes poses a serious problem. The problem is quite severe if some inner manifold comes with approximate isometries (angular KK modes) or if there exists a throat of modest <b>length</b> <b>other</b> than the <b>standard</b> model throat, possibly associated with some hidden sector (low-lying KK modes) ...|$|R
