25|$|Disadvantages of low {{pressure}} sodium lighting are that fixtures must usually {{be larger than}} competing fixtures, and that color cannot be distinguished, due to its emitting principally a single wavelength of light (see security lighting). Due to the substantial size of the lamp, particularly in higher wattages such as 135 W and 180 W, control of light emissions from {{low pressure}} sodium luminaires is more difficult. For applications requiring more precise direction of light (such as narrow roadways) the native lamp efficacy advantage of this <b>lamp</b> <b>type</b> is decreased and may be entirely lost compared to high pressure sodium lamps. Allegations that this also leads to higher amounts of light pollution from luminaires running these lamps arise principally because of older luminaires with poor shielding, still widely in use in the UK and in some other locations. Modern low-pressure sodium fixtures with better optics and full shielding, and the decreased skyglow impacts of yellow light preserve the luminous efficacy advantage of low-pressure sodium and result in most cases is less energy consumption and less visible light pollution. Unfortunately, due to continued lack of accurate information, many lighting professionals continue to disparage low-pressure sodium, contributing to its decreased acceptance and specification in lighting standards and therefore its use. Another disadvantage of low-pressure sodium lamps is that some people find the characteristic yellow light very displeasing aesthetically.|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{germicidal}} irradiation (UVGI) uses UVC radiation {{produced by}} low pressure Hg vapor lamps to control biological air contaminants. Lamp UV output depends on multiple factors, including accumulated operating time (age) and the thermal effects of ambient air temperature and velocity. Additionally, {{the life of}} some <b>lamp</b> <b>types</b> depends on the frequency of on-off cycles. Models of lamp life {{as a function of}} cycling rate and lamp output as a function of age and ambient conditions are developed for three common standard output <b>lamp</b> <b>types</b> based on heat transfer theory and manufacturer’s lamp performance data.

A typical range of ambient conditions reduces lamp output by more than 30 % of rated capacity and the inclusion of aging effects reduces capacity by as much as 70 %. For given ambient conditions, performance varies substantially across <b>lamp</b> <b>types</b> due to their differing heat transfer characteristics.
