25|$|Buckley became {{interested}} in recording at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, {{at the suggestion of}} friend Dave Shouse from the Grifters. He rented a shotgun house there, of which he was so fond he contacted the owner about the possibility of buying it. Throughout this period, February 12 to May 26, 1997, Buckley played at Barristers', a bar located in downtown Memphis underneath a parking garage in an alley off Jefferson Avenue. He played numerous times in order to work through the new material in a live atmosphere, at first with the band then solo as part of a Monday night residency. In early February, Buckley and the band did a third recording session with Verlaine, in Memphis, but Buckley expressed his dissatisfaction with the sessions and later called Grace producer, Andy Wallace, to step in as Verlaine's replacement. Buckley started recording demos on his own 4-track recorder in preparation for a forthcoming session with Wallace. Some of these demos were sent to his band in New York, who <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> enthusiastically, and were excited to resume working on the album. These recordings would go on to compose the second disc of Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. However Buckley was not entirely happy with the results and he sent his band back to New York while he stayed behind to work on the songs. The band was scheduled to return to Memphis for rehearsals and recording sessions on May 29.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E

500|$|The Cure {{were one}} of the first {{alternative}} bands to have chart and commercial success in an era before alternative rock had broken into the mainstream. In 1992, NME declared the Cure had, during the 1980s, become [...] "a goth hit machine (19 to date), an international phenomenon and, yet, the most successful alternative band that ever shuffled disconsolately about the earth". Interpol lead singer Paul Banks was quoted as saying, [...] "the Cure is the band that all of us in Interpol can say influenced us. When I was younger I <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> a lot. Carlos as well. Actually, he took a straight influence from this band on the way he played the bass and the keys.

500|$|The work on {{the album}} lasted for two years, due to the group working behind it paying {{attention}} to details and trying to record the best possible version of the material at hand, {{at the same time}} maintaining slow-paced progress. The {{work on the}} album began in 2012; after the songs were written, Micevski recorded demo versions and sent them to Gočeva. After she <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> the singer started a song selection process, choosing the most fitting ones among the numerous that were written for her. She decided recording and including ten songs on the track listing of her new album. Makedonsko Devojče 2 was recorded at studio XL by Dejan Momirovski in Skopje. During an interview with the portal IdiVidi, Gočeva explained that the group working on the album consisted of her long-time professional acquaintances, thus rendering the process of working with them easy and pleasant due to the presence of an [...] "excellent atmosphere". The long-time collaboration and the previous experiences they have had together served as a lesson for attaining perfection, making Gočeva more self-confident and determined in taking a specific direction with the album. During an interview on the TV show Carpe diem on the TV channel Alsat-M in February 2014, Gočeva called the album her best work she had published yet. The maturity she had gained throughout her career served as an inspiration of [...] "modernizing the traditional"; Gočeva said that the Macedonian folklore is something existing in the blood of the Macedonian people and added that her album was not characterized by typical traditional songs but rather songs drawing inspiration from that kind of music. Through the new tracks, she allowed her musical performance to stand out and leave a certain long-lasting contribution to Macedonian contemporary music. The singer also acknowledged that the music she had recorded for the album was not popular on a worldwide scale, but emphasized that the sound is more authentic for Macedonia as compared to other mainstream popular genres across the world such as hip hop, pop and R.|$|E

Despite this, Singer argues that it has led to a difficult intellectual climate, with professors in Germany unable to teach courses on applied ethics and campaigns demanding the resignation of professors who invited Singer to speak.|$|E

Eventually, Stevens contributed three songs to the soundtrack: [...] "Visions of Gideon", which was used {{at the end of}} the film, [...] "Mystery of Love," [...] and a new rendition of [...] "Futile Devices" [...] with piano. Stevens penned the songs by using the script, the book, and conversations with the director about the characters. He submitted them a few days before shooting began.

[...] "Oh!

In the UK, the song spent a total of 17 weeks in the top 40, peaking at No. 3 (4 weeks). In addition, the B-side, [...] "One Way Ticket", reached No. 1 on the pop charts in Japan. Sedaka had dated Carole King when he was still at high school, which gave him the idea to use her name in the song. Gerry Goffin – King's husband – took the tune, and wrote the playful response [...] "Oh! Neil", which King recorded and released as an unsuccessful single the same year. Thus, this was the only time the melody of the song was used by a popular artist and a future sensation around the same time.|$|E

[...] "The Beatles were big", Strait confirmed. [...] "I <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> a lot and that whole bunch of groups that were popular then". [...] His musical preference soon turned to country with singers Hank Thompson, Lefty Frizzell, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Bob Wills, Hank Williams, and Frank Sinatra influencing his style. Strait did not tune to the country music radio often as a youth, usually listening to the news and the farmer's report. His introduction to country music came mostly by way of live performances, which, according to Strait, could be heard in every town in Texas. He eloped with his high school sweetheart, Norma. The couple initially married in Mexico on December 4, 1971. That same year, he enlisted in the United States Army. While stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii {{as a part of}} the 25th Infantry Division, Strait began performing with a U.S. Army-sponsored band, [...] "Rambling Country", which played off-base under the name [...] "Santee". On October 6, 1972, while still in Hawaii, George and Norma had their first child, Jennifer.|$|E

I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated.
