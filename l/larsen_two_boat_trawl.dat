The data collected on <b>two</b> <b>boat</b> midwater <b>trawling</b> and gill netting during 1979 and 1980 - 81 are presented.

50|$|In {{midwater}} trawling, a cone-shaped net can be towed {{behind a}} single boat and spread by trawl doors, {{or it can}} be towed behind <b>two</b> <b>boats</b> (pair <b>trawling)</b> which act as the spreading device. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as: cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|R

40|$|In July/ August 1991 the Institute of Marine Research (IMR, Norway) {{performed}} a pairtrawling (<b>two</b> <b>boat</b> <b>trawl)</b> experiment with a surface trawl to catch young herring in the northem Norwegian Sea. 34 postsmolts and two 1 - sea-winter salmon were caught as bycatch. This {{was the first}} time that postsmolts were recorded in larger numbers during fishery in open sea in the North East Atlantic, although the area is believed to be the one of the main feeding areas for salmon during summer. A (one <b>boat)</b> pelagic research <b>trawl</b> has been developed by IMR for scientific surveys of the pelagic fish stocks. This trawl, an Åkra trawl, can be rigged both for mid water and surface trawling (0 - ~ 25 m), and is currently in use on all pelagic research cruises. In 1993 a study was made to test whether the new trawl would catch salmon. This study proved successful, and consequently, Atlantic salmon was included in a large scale ecology study in the Norwegian Sea, the so called "Mare Cognitum Programme" (MCP). In 1995, the first year of salmon surveys in the MCP framework, in addition to the trawl surveys, otter- board salmon trolling and salmon drift line fishery with an experimental line with 200 hooks were developed and tested from the R/V "Johan Hjort". A total of 157 postsmolts and nine 1 -sea-winter salmon have been caught in surface hauls since 1991. The fish have been caught in an area stretching from west of Scotland and the Hebrides up to 75 °N and 18 °E. The samplings have been performed from June to mid August...|$|R
50|$|A monkey's fist {{can be used}} on two ends of a tow {{lines of}} one side a fish net which is then thrown from one trawler to another, {{allowing}} the net to be cast and set between <b>two</b> <b>boats</b> so the <b>trawl</b> can be used between the two, in pair trawling where the tow or catch is negotiated between both parties. This makes it easier to catch fish given the greater surface area between both boats to turn around and catch missed fish from the sea much more quickly. Once all fish have been hauled up from the sea, tow lines of the fish net is returned by way of thrown both monkey's fists back to the host trawler. Alternatively, a monkey fist {{can be used as a}} weight of a heaving line thrown to over to an opposing ship to bring two ships together.|$|R
40|$|The lucrative {{external}} market for shrimp and constant {{rise in the}} mechanised trawl fishing fleets not only enhanced the marine fish production of our country but also showed {{the way for the}} growth of an organised sea food export industry and increase in employment opportunities in the subsidiary sector. In this context, a study was undertaken at nagapattinam centre of Tamil Nadu coast where the operation of ordinary trawlers and pair trawlers is common. The study indicates that pomfrets contributed to more than 50 per cent of the revenue of pair trawlers and prawns about 50 percent of the revenue of trawlers. The pair trawling further provided a new technique to fishermen of this region to harvest the hitherto underexploited valuable resources like pomfrets, rays, croakers, clupeids, carangids and perches in substantial quantity. The introduction of single and <b>two</b> <b>boats</b> high opening <b>trawl</b> nets not only served as diversification of the existing bottom trawling but also directed to redeploy many units to catch commercially important finfishes depending upon the seasonal abundance. The trawl catch forms more than 90 per cent of the mechanised landings and 50 % of the total landings of the state. The study indicates that both types of fishing are economically efficient...|$|R

A <b>trawling</b> <b>boat</b> can be a small open boat with only 30horsepower or a large factory ship with 10,000horsepower.

25|$|In the 1920s, {{diesel engine}} were adapted {{for use in}} shrimp boats. Power winches were {{connected}} to the engines, and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them. Shrimp boats became larger, faster, and more capable. New fishing grounds could be explored, trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters, and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year, instead of seasonally as in earlier times. Larger <b>boats</b> <b>trawled</b> offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries. By the 1960s, steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened shrimp boats, so they could trawl heavier nets, and steady advances in electronics, radar, sonar, and GPS resulted in more sophisticated and capable shrimp fleets.|$|R

2500|$|When <b>two</b> <b>boats</b> {{are used}} (pair trawling), the {{horizontal}} {{spread of the}} net {{is provided by the}} boats, with one {{or in the case of}} pelagic trawling two [...] attached to each <b>boat.</b> However, single-boat <b>trawling</b> is more common.

Trawl doors are available in various sizes and shapes and may be specialized to keep in contact with the sea bottom (bottom trawling) or to remain elevated in the water. In all cases, doors essentially act as wings, using a hydrodynamic shape to provide horizontal spread. As with all wings, the towing vessel must go at a certain speed for the doors to remain standing and functional. This speed varies, but is generally in the range of 2.5–4.0 knots.|$|R
