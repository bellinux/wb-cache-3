40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{longitudinal}} {{study examined the}} effects of physical activity on self-rated health (SRH); specifically, predicted interactions between <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> and job <b>activity,</b> and between <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> and age, were evaluated in relation to SRH. METHODS: Survey data on age and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> together with relevant covariates (education, body mass index, smoking and negative affectivity) were collected from oil industry employees. Three job activity levels were identified (sedentary, active and strenuous). At 5 -year follow-up, SRH, body mass index and smoking were reassessed. Hierarchical regression was used to analyse the longitudinal data (N= 314). RESULTS: The job <b>activity</b> x <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> interaction (controlled for baseline SRH and covariates) predicted follow-up SRH (p<. 025). Individuals in sedentary jobs benefited disproportionately from leisure activity; active and strenuous jobs were associated with lower SRH, irrespective of <b>leisure</b> <b>activity.</b> The age x <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> interaction was also significant (p<. 025); <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> was significantly and positively associated with SRH only among younger individuals. Changes in body mass index and smoking contributed additively to the model, but did not mediate physical activity effects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of <b>leisure</b> physical <b>activity</b> for employees in sedentary jobs, but suggest that other factors (such as adverse environmental conditions) may underlie the lower SRH associated with physically demanding work. The results also indicate that, irrespective of job activity level, younger individuals benefit more from <b>leisure</b> physical <b>activity</b> than older ones. Thus, the study informs interventions designed to improve the health of employees through increased physical activity...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} examine the {{relationship}} between <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation and levels of family strength. A secondary focus was to examine the effects of other independent variables that might affect <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation in families. The sample was composed of 500 men and women from 42 states. The data were collected during the summer of 1983 by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Percentages, frequencies, Pearson Product-moment correlation coefficient, and two-way analysis of covariance were used in the analysis of data. Significant positive relationships were found between family strength and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation. Significant positive relationships were found between family strength and eight <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> subscales: (a) mass media activities, (b) social activities, (c) outdoor activities, (d) sports activities, (e) cultural activities, (f) hobbies, (g) parallel activities, and (h) joint activities. Significant differences were found in seven of the eight leisure subscales according to level of family strength. Significant differences were found in <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation according to (a) sex, (b) age, (c) religious preference, and (d) level of family strength. No significant differences were found in <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation according to (a) number of children, (b) residence, (c) region of nation, and (d) present marital status. Family strengths and family-strengthening activities identified in open-ended questions coincided with other family strength studies. Findings indicate the need for: (1) programs designed and conducted which encourage greater <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation as a family; (2) more research on <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> categorical and interactional effects; and (3) studies including a sample representative of various races, social-economic classes, and weak families. ...|$|R

5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based <b>leisure</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing.
