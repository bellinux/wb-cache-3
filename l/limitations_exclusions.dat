Evaluate the effects that would result from the integration of foreigners into the public health insurance, based on the gross costs of the annual reports of commercial insurers {{and based on the}} income statement. Work gives a comprehensive overview of the current health care system in the Czech Republic, and design optimization. The first part is devoted to health systems, which are used in the world. They are defined by their key characteristics as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The second part is devoted to public and commercial health insurance in the Czech Republic, where the two systems are compared. In the third part we are analyzed the conditions, <b>limitations,</b> <b>exclusions</b> and insurance products offered price between commercial insurers. There are also quantified the costs and revenues associated with the inclusion of commercially insured foreigners in public health insurance. In the final part evaluates the balance of income and expenditure, which would hold a public health insurance, including the formulation of their own opinion on optimizing the system...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis C related liver {{failure and}} hepatocarcinoma {{are the most}} common {{indications}} for liver transplantation in Western countries. Recurrent hepatitis C infection of the allograft is universal and immediate following liver transplantation, being associated with accelerated progression to cirrhosis, graft loss and death. Graft and patient survival is reduced in liver transplant recipients with recurrent Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection compared to HCV-negative recipients. Many variables may impact on recurrent HCV liver disease. Overall, excess immunosuppression is believed to be a key factor; however, no immunosuppressive regimen has been identified to be more beneficial or less harmful. Donor age <b>limitations,</b> <b>exclusion</b> of moderately to severely steatotic livers and minimization of ischemic times could be a potential strategy to minimize the severity of HCV disease in transplanted subjects. After transplantation, antiviral therapy based on pegylated IFN alpha with or without ribavirin is associated with far less results than that reported for immunocompetent HCV-infected patients.

40|$|Background The {{relevance}} of the cause of kidney disease to prognosis among patients with chronic kidney disease is uncertain. Study Design Observational study. Settings and Participants 6, 245 nondialysis participants in the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP). Predictor Baseline cause of kidney disease was categorized into 4 groups: cystic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, and other recorded diagnoses. Outcomes End-stage renal disease (ESRD; dialysis or transplantation) and death. Results During an average 4. 7 years' follow-up, 2, 080 participants progressed to ESRD, including 454 with cystic kidney disease (23 % per year), 378 with glomerulonephritis (10 % per year), 309 with diabetic nephropathy (12 % per year), and 939 with other recorded diagnoses (8 % per year). By comparison with patients with cystic kidney disease, other disease groups had substantially lower adjusted risks of ESRD (relative risks of 0. 28 [95 % CI, 0. 24 - 0. 32], 0. 40 [95 % CI, 0. 34 - 0. 47], and 0. 29 [95 % CI, 0. 25 - 0. 32] for glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and other recorded diagnoses, respectively). Albuminuria and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate were associated more weakly with risk of ESRD in patients with cystic kidney disease than the 3 other diagnostic categories (P for interaction, < 0. 001 and 0. 01, respectively). Death before ESRD was uncommon in patients with cystic kidney disease, but was a major competing risk for participants with diabetic nephropathy, whose adjusted risk of death was 2 -fold {{higher than that of}} the cystic kidney disease group (relative risk, 2. 35 [95 % CI, 1. 73 - 3. 18]). <b>Limitations</b> <b>Exclusion</b> of patients with prior myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. Conclusions The cause of kidney disease has substantial prognostic implications. Other things being equal, patients with cystic kidney disease are at much higher risk of ESRD (and much lower risk of death before ESRD) than other patients. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at particularly high risk of death prior to reaching ESRD. © 2014 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a chronic}} functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract {{and is one}} of the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal diseases. The impact of IBS on the general population is large due to its high prevalence, suboptimal medical treatments and significant economic burden. The pathophysiology of IBS is complex and treatments are often symptom-specific. The most common therapeutic approaches for IBS include education and reassurance, lifestyles (especially nutrition-based interventions), peripherally acting medications (which typically target motility), centrally acting medications (which target visceral hypersensitivity and pain) and psychological interventions (which aim to reduce the effects of stress or symptom-specific anxiety). A beneficial dietary approach might include the following measures: a diet low in fermentable oligo-,di- and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), <b>limitation</b> or <b>exclusion</b> of gas-producing foods and/or lactose and gluten and fiber supplementation in selected cases. New therapeutic agents, namely nutraceutics, are also an interesting option in the management of IBS patients.

40|$|The South African secular media do not {{frequently}} portray men in parental roles; on {{the other}} hand, it seems that media and visual culture created by the Christian sector {{is more likely to}} engage with issues of fatherhood. Accordingly, it is relevant to explore representations of fatherhood in the Christian context, as these constitute some of the few examples of men’s parental roles in the South African visual culture landscape. Through a Barthean visual semiotic analysis, this article describes and problematises the representation (and non-representation) of certain aspects of fatherhood in the recent visual culture of three Afrikaans corporate churches in the Pretoria-Centurion area. It further establishes that strong connections between breadwinning, male headship and fatherhood exist in images created by these churches. Fathers are mainly shown as patriarchs, heads of households and as active outdoor adventurers.

40|$|Rules {{were a part}} of the {{collection}} of social, economic and legal means and resources that artisans used to successfully face different historic junctures with more versatility and success than was once thought. The study of the different guilds that were present in 17 th century Madrid through the comparative analysis of tailors, tanners and joiners focuses on three main aspects which determine the strategies used by artisans in order to adapt to historical context and to respond to social change: economic conditions of trades, their social behaviour and the internal dynamics followed by each one. In fact, many trades had a remarkable regulatory framework used to apply a restrictive policy for obtaining mastership. Nevertheless, the thorough study of their internal dynamics −renewal and continuity of members and families, social practices and mobility− proved that trades made moderate use of corporative measures −exams, apprenticeship, production <b>limitations</b> and, <b>exclusion</b> of women− to make it difficult for outsiders to join. The trajectories that were followed by the three trades prove that artisans were not a particularly homogenous group and question the commonly accepted thesis that guilds were an inbred professional collective...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} ways in which entry to the legal {{profession}} in early modern Europe was regulated {{and the nature of the}} various interests, from the state to the judges and societies of lawyers, who sought to limit the size of the practising bar and also the lower branch of the legal profession. In part exclusionary categories were universal, having been inherited from the tradition of the ius commune, but some were very specific to particular courts and regulated at the local or national level. At the same time, such <b>limitations</b> and <b>exclusions</b> as were maintained had an effect in directing law graduates away from legal practice and towards employment in other spheres, including the burgeoning bureaucracies of western Europe. This was particularly exacerbated during periods when the level of litigation in the courts fell, as it seems to have done in a number of jurisdictions in the early eighteenth century. The tendency of lawyers to combine to protect their interests is reflected in the monopolies that sometimes arose in relation to practice in particular courts. Sometimes a highly restricted number of advocates or procurators had the right to practise in a court, and this could create practical problems which, it was argued, affected the quality of the legal decisions produced...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{usefulness}} of the concept of social exclusion for Australian social housing policy. We draw on recent theoretical and empirical research from Europe and the UK to develop a critique of the concept of social exclusion. It is argued that any assessment of social exclusion needs to distinguish between its utility as an academic explanatory concept and its political deployment to justify new forms of policy intervention. Policy targeting anti-social behaviour through increasingly more punitive means, for instance, is often justified on the basis that it ameliorates the problems of social exclusion experienced by tenants residing in public housing estates. We conclude that, in spite of the <b>limitations</b> of social <b>exclusion</b> as an analytical concept, for political and pragmatic reasons it is likely to become {{an important component of the}} emerging Australian housing policy agenda...|$|R
40|$|For {{the most}} part, theory and {{empirical}} {{study in the}} psychology of women have failed to recognize many distinctions among women. In-deed, the focus of feminist theory and research has been directed to the explication of women’s essential experience of gender, as if this could {{be separated from the}} confounds of class and race. This presentation raises the issue of the diversity among poor women, the need to disen-tangle ethnicity and class, and the limitation of adopting a middle-class White perspective. In addition to racism, other possible causes of exclu-sion are explored. Silencing of poor women is also discussed in terms of causes and impact on the discipline of psychology. We have not provided sufficient mechanisms to allow diverse groups of women to tell their own stories; instead, we have felt comfortable in making as-sumptions and drawing parallels that may be inappropriate and incor-rect. Suggestions for achieving feminist goals are provided. The inspiration for my title came from a quote of Simone de Beauvoir in which she described the difficulty women have dealing with the simulta-neous limitations and variety of our roles. She said that women were “shut up in our world ” (cited in Bernard, 1981, p. 20). She referred to social <b>limitations</b> and <b>exclusions</b> based on gender.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{popularity}} of the Party for the Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands has risen a lot. Given that it is considered an extreme right party in the literature, curiosity arises as to what underlying mechanisms explain its popularity. In this study this led to the questions what mechanisms explain how PVV-Voters justify negative statements from the PVV-leader about the islam. Eight interviews were conducted to assess the underlying feelings, cognitions, interpretations and perceptions. Coding and analyses were performed. Results show that PVV-voters justify statements by resolving cognitive dissonance; by a process of collective hate; {{in order to get a}} positive group identity and because they perceive islam as a threat to the values of the Netherlands.

40|$|This thesis applies Nicolas Bourriaud’s {{concept of}} ‘relational aesthetics’ to the {{development}} of site-specific theatre practice. Focussing on the Arches arts centre in Glasgow, the aim is to suggest ways in which a performance aesthetic can be developed that uses, makes evident and contributes to what Bourriaud describes as the ‘space of relations’ that exists within every site. Employing a practice-as-research methodology in order to develop a ‘relational theatre practice’, the performances that comprise half of this thesis aim to respond to and generate relationships not only between theatre and its ‘audience’, but through a sensitivity to site as historically, geographically, culturally and socially located. Key to this project is an understanding of the boundaries, <b>limitations</b> and <b>exclusions</b> that inevitably come to define theatre practice in a site with as many contradictory and conflicting relationships as a busy arts venue like the Arches. The findings of this research are primarily dependent on three practice-as-research projects at the venue: Underneath the Arches (January 2009), Midland Street (September 2009) and A Work on Progress (April 2010). These projects have focussed respectively on three key areas of relational theatre practice; the performance text, the theatre audience and processes of theatre production. The written part of the thesis provides an exegesis of this practice, critically reflecting on the relationships that developed through the performances. Combining a practical and theoretical approach, this research interrogates Bourriaud’s relational aesthetic model through its application {{to the development}} of theatre practice within the specific context of a cultural site. Conversely, it reveals and works with the multiple relationships of the Arches, thereby providing new knowledge about the relational processes through which a cultural site is constituted...|$|R
40|$|Religious {{pluralism}} is {{a meaningful}} framework for many scholars {{and students of}} religion as well as citizens working {{to make sense of}} a religiously and culturally diverse society. It purports noble aims: bringing people together across differences and facilitating the inclusion of more people at the proverbial table of democracy. Pluralism has become an essential element in the management of religious diversity in the American public sphere. While presenting itself as politically neutral, the discourse of pluralism is, in fact, embedded with veiled politics. While it embraces a democratizing agenda, it simultaneously engages in regulatory activities that impose <b>limitations</b> and <b>exclusions</b> on people’s beliefs and behaviors. My work investigates this tension. I use Norman Fairclough’s theory of critical discourse analysis to analyze world religions textbooks as discursive sites for the production of the discourse of religious pluralism. I contend that pluralism is a formally non-political discourse that reproduces and legitimates liberal norms and ideology. It functions as a practice of liberal governance—a mode of governmentality. Its discursive practices serve as tools for orchestrating social cohesion and regulating religion within a liberal social framework. By framing this analysis through the concept of governmentality, I aim to explore the enduring salience of liberalism in American society and the multiple discourses that support liberalism’s totalizing tendencies. I investigate {{the ways in which the}} rhetoric of liberalism touts individual freedoms as a foundational value, while it simultaneously works in other ways to implicitly manage, regulate, and limit many of those freedoms. As I look at how these world religions textbooks help to mediate and transmit the liberal public sphere, I also consider how these discursive practices reveal the ambivalence and complexity involved in religious diversity in the U. S...|$|R
40|$|Prepared for an edited {{volume on}} gun {{litigation}} (Suing the Firearms Industry, T.

Commercial liability insurers employ a somewhat broader array of techniques. Selective exclusion is the main tool, but there is some evidence of gate keeping and prevention. Interestingly, guns appear to be regarded as more significant property risks (theft, fire and explosion) than liability risks.
