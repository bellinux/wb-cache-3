50|$|Lysozyme type C and alpha-lactalbumin {{are similar}} {{both in terms}} of primary {{sequence}} and structure, and probably evolved from a common ancestral protein. Around 35 to 40% of the residues are conserved in both proteins as well as the positions of the four disulphide bonds. There is, however, no similarity in function. Another significant difference between the two enzymes is that all <b>lactalbumins</b> have the ability to bind calcium, while this property is restricted to only a few lysozymes.|$|R
40|$|Milk {{production}} in ruminants necessitates renovation of least available plant materials into most enriched nutrients. This involves pregastric microbial rumen fermentation of plant cells {{and production of}} volatile fatty acids (VFA) as substrates for mammary milk lactose, fat and protein synthesis. Thus, milk contains numerous bioactive substances functioning beyond solely their nutritive value. Essential amino acids, specialized casein, <b>lactalbumins</b> and globulins, peptides, nucleosides, nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acids, sphingomyelins, fat soluble vitamins and minerals of mainly calcium are principal examples. Whey proteins are insulinotropic, medium chain fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity, and calcium favorably influences fat distribution. Peptides and calcium can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol. Dairy consumption benefits folate availability and lowers blood homocystein and heart attack risks. Very early (< 3 mo of age) neonatal cow milk intake has been related to insulin-dependent diabetes. Non- breast milk intake during early stages of life is unarguably uncommon. Modern nutrition does in no standard circumstances authorize feeding such quite young neonates non-breast milks. Milk sufficiency for neonatal brain, nervous and immune systems, and bone development and tissue growth for even up to 2 yr without major needs for alternative foods is an evolutionary verification for its irreplaceable role in human nutrition. However, the increasing concerns of cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and related complexities in modern populations due to improper nutrition have contributed to forming a fallacious public perception about milk in general and milk fat in particular as a possible risk factor. Despite such a functional nature of milk in improving human health, the confusion exists where education is suboptimal. Insightful education on milk science must accompany research to enable the public to discern a pseudo- science that unconsciously disregards milk as an animal fat food with serious health risks. With limited saturated fat intake from non-milk sources, increased milk consumption could bear a multitude of positive impacts on health even with high fat content. Milk {{is a collection of}} bioactive substances with unique nutritional properties that synergistically optimize the health of mind and physics in different age groups...|$|R

50|$|Whey {{cheese is}} a dairy product made of whey, the {{by-product}} of cheesemaking.

Lanthionines have also been found in bacterial cell walls and are the components {{of a group of}} gene-encoded peptide antibiotics called lantibiotics, which includes nisin (a food preservative), subtilin, epidermin (effective against staphylococcus and streptococcus), and ancovenin (an enzyme inhibitor).|$|E
5000|$|Whey is {{left over}} when milk is coagulated {{during the process}} of cheese production, and {{contains}} everything that is soluble from milk after the pH is dropped to 4.6 during the coagulation process. It is a 5% solution of lactose in water, with some minerals and <b>lactalbumin.</b> [...] The fat is removed and then processed for human foods. Processing can be done by simple drying, or the relative protein content can be increased by removing lipids and other non-protein materials.

In addition to considerations of flavour, the order of these steps is thought to have been, historically, an indication of class.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis aimed at controlling the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed cross-linking of bovine α <b>lactalbumin</b> {{and the implications of}} this cross-linking for the foam stabilizing properties. Attention is also given to microreactors and their potential to control the enzymatic cross-linking of proteins. The proportion of cross-linked α <b>lactalbumin</b> dimers, oligomers and polymers could be directed by variations in ionic strength, pH, H 2 O 2, and temperature. Covalent α <b>lactalbumin</b> dimers were proteolytic digested. FTMS analysis of the peptide mixture resulted in the unambiguous identification of a Tyr 18 Tyr 50 dityrosine cross-link. Structural modeling of the α <b>lactalbumin</b> dimer indicated that favorite electrostatics direct the selectivity of the cross-linking reaction and, hence, the formation of an intermolecular cross-link. The formation of the Tyr 18 -Tyr 50 cross-link suggests that further cross-linking of α <b>lactalbumin</b> dimers enables the formation of linear polymers. A microreactor system was set up to obtain control over the reaction conditions to cross-link proteins. The enzymatic cross-linking of α <b>lactalbumin</b> was analyzed as a function of enzyme and substrate(s) feed. The increase in absorption at 318 nm due to dityrosine formation was found to be directly correlated to the decrease in monomeric α <b>lactalbumin</b> and was shown to be a good tool to monitor the cross-linking reaction. The α <b>lactalbumin</b> oligomers produced were investigated for their foam stabilizing properties. Cross-linked α <b>lactalbumin</b> oligomers did not stabilize foams, whereas α <b>lactalbumin</b> polymers acted as an anti-foam, destabilizing other protein films...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Acute {{effect of}} the {{ingestion}} of 80 g each of casein, <b>lactalbumin,</b> and soybean isolate on serum and urinary uric acid concentrations was investigated in 10 healthy subjects.

40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{affinity}} chromatography, {{a homogeneous}} preparation of human β(1 → 4) D glactosyltransferase (the A protein of lactose synthase) was obtained. The specificity of this protein for glycoconjugates was studied in the presence and absence of human α <b>lactalbumin.</b> A kinetic analysis of the transfer of D galactose to N acetyl D glucosamine and to β(1 → 4) linked N acetylglucosamine oligomers, suggested that the active site region of the enzyme contains more than one binding site for acceptor molecules. Furthermore, experiments with N acetylglucosamine β(1 → 4) N acetylmuramic pentapeptide isolated from Micrococcus luteus indicated {{that the presence of}} a peptide chain does not enhance enzymic activity, as compared with the corresponding free disaccharide. Similar results were obtained using ovalbumin and the ovalbumin glycopeptide (which have similar apparent K(m) values for A protein) as galactose acceptors. In contrast to its ability to inhibit N acetyllactosamine production, α <b>lactalbumin</b> did not inhibit the transfer of D galactase to the N acetylglucosamine oligomers or the glycopeptides. Although α <b>lactalbumin</b> can switch the specificity of A protein from N acetyl D glucosamine to D glucose resulting in the production of lactose, no transfer of galactose was observed to β(1 → 4) linked glucose oligomers or to a collagen glycopeptide, D glucopyranosyl α(1 → 2) D galactopyranosyloxy β(1 → 5) lysine.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{adsorption}} of a <b>lactalbumin</b> at a planar poly acrylic acid PAA brush using neutron reflectometry NR and total internal reflection fluorescence TIRF spectroscopy. The PAA brush has been prepared by spin coating silicon or quartz plates with a hydrophobic poly styrene film and by transferring the copolymer poly styrene poly acrylic acid onto the modified surface. In the case of NR, the poly styrene film and the poly styrene chain ends of the copolymer were perdeuterated in order to generate a high contrast to the non deuterated PAA brush. a <b>Lactalbumin</b> {{was chosen as the}} model protein because it is a relatively small globular protein with a negative net charge at neutral pH values, as chosen in the experiments. Thus, it is interacting with the PAA brush {{on the wrong side of}} its isoelectric point. In addition, the effects of temperature on the volume fraction profile and the reorientational mobility of the protein within the PAA brush were determined. From the analysis of the NR data, it has been found that despite of its negative net charge, a <b>lactalbumin</b> is penetrating into the PAA brush. Its volume fraction profile parallels that of the PAA brush, indicating an exclusive interaction between the protein and the PAA. No protein accumulation is found at the inner poly styrene or the outer solution interface of the PAA brush. When increasing the temperature from 20 to 40 1 C, less protein is adsorbed, suggesting the presence of enthalpic interaction contributions. From the analysis of the TIRF data, a high degree of reorientational mobility of a <b>lactalbumin</b> within a PAA brush can be inferred. The reorientational correlation time of a <b>lactalbumin</b> labeled with the Alexa Fluor 488 dye was found to increase from 5. 5 to 32 ns upon adsorption, which can well be explained by the higher viscosity inside the PAA brush. Overall, the results of this study quantify for the first time the molecular details of the unique interaction of a protein on the wrong side of its isoelectric point with a planar charged brush interface. It is concluded that the high mobility of a <b>lactalbumin</b> within a PAA brush can partially be understood by the presence of repulsive electrostatic interactions. There is no freezing of the protein dynamics, which is a precondition for biological activit...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli HslVU is an ATP-dependent {{protease}} {{consisting of}} two heat shock proteins, the HslU ATPase and HslV peptidase. In the reconstituted enzyme, HslU stimulates the proteolytic activity of HslV by one to two orders of magnitude, while HslV increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HslU several-fold. Here we show that HslV alone can efficiently degrade certain un-folded proteins, such as unfolded <b>lactalbumin</b> and ly-sozyme prepared by complete reduction of disulfide bonds, but not their native forms. Furthermore, HslV alone cleaved a <b>lactalbumin</b> fragment sandwiched by two thioredoxin molecules, indicating that it can hy-drolyze the internal peptide bonds of <b>lactalbumin.</b> Surprisingly, ATP inhibited the degradation of un-folded proteins by HslV. This inhibitory effect of ATP was markedly diminished by substitution of the Arg 86 residue located in the apical pore of HslV with Gly, suggesting that interaction of ATP with the Arg residue blocks access of unfolded proteins to the proteolytic chamber of HslV. These results suggest that uncom-plexed HslV is inactive under normal conditions, but may can degrade unfolded proteins when the ATP level is low, as it is during carbon starvation...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} {{papers of}} this series (Frazier and Rupp, 1928), the action of proteolytic bacteria of milk on casein and on skim milk has been reported. In {{order to make the}} study of proteolysis in milk more complete a study was made of the action of these organ-isms on milk from which the casein and lactoglobulin had been removed and in which <b>lactalbumin</b> was the only remaining pro-tein. A number of the proteolytic bacteria were found to cause an increase in ammonia and in amino-nitrogen according to the formol titration method in milk, but were unable to split casein in any of the media used. This led to the supposition that lac-talbumin might have been decomposed. In this work the organ-isms were grown m a milk serum, made by the removal of all casein and lactoglobulin from milk. This milk serum contained <b>lactalbumin</b> as its only protein and small amounts of non-protein nitrogen. No references have been found to the action of bacteria on milk serum, although Franssen (1929) recommends its use in culture media.

The results demonstrate that the protein state recognized by GroEL is more unfolded and expanded than the typical molten globule state of -lactalbumin...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{generally}} more rapid amino acid absorption and lower osmotic pressure of small peptides compared with free amino acids, {{it has been}} suggested that 'elemental' diets should contain both small peptides and free amino acids as the nitrogen source. While studying protein hydrolysates intended for use in such diets we observed surprising differences in the absorption of amino acids, water, and Na+ during jejunal perfusion of partial enzymic hydrolysates of two proteins (<b>lactalbumin</b> and fish) which contained high and approximately equal amounts of their constituent amino acids in the form of small peptides. Total alpha amino nitrogen (alpha NH 2 N) absorption from the <b>lactalbumin</b> hydrolysate was greater, and individual amino acid absorption more even, than from equinitrogenous solutions of the fish protein hydrolysate, or from mixture of free amino acids simulating either hydrolysate. Net water and Na+ absorption occurred during perfusion of the <b>lactalbumin</b> hydrolysate, whereas net water and Na+ secretion occurred during perfusion of the fish protein hydrolysate.

40|$|Effects {{of feeding}} {{alkaline}} (0. 1 N NaOH) and heat treated (75 °C for 3 h) proteins (<b>lactalbumin</b> and soybean protein isolate, SPI) on growth, and protein and mineral status of rats have been determined. The untreated and alkaline/heat treated <b>lactalbumin</b> contained 0. 10 and 4. 42 g lysinoalanine (LAL) / 100 g protein, respectively. Similarly, the untreated and treated SPI contained 0. 03 and 1. 94 g LAL/ 100 g protein, respectively. The formation of LAL in the treated proteins was accompanied {{with a loss}} of cystine (73 - 77 %), threonine (35 - 45 %), serine (18 - 30 %) and lysine (19 - 20 %). The alkaline/heat treatments caused significant (P < 0. 05) reductions in protein digestibility of <b>lactalbumin</b> (99 vs. 73 %) and SPI (96 vs. 68 %). The processing treatments also caused a drastic negative effect on protein quality, as measured by rat growth methods such as relative protein efficiency ratio (RPER) and relative net protein ratio (RNPR). The RPER and RNPR values of untreated <b>lactalbumin</b> and SPI were 89 - 91 and 56 - 64 %, respectively. But the RPER and RNPR values of the treated <b>lactalbumin</b> and SPI were 0 %. The mineral status of rats was also compromised by feeding alkaline/heat treated proteins. Liver iron levels in male rats (165 - 180 μg/g dry weight) and female rats (306 - 321 μg/g dry weight) fed the treated proteins were about half the levels in male rats (229 - 257 μg/g dry weight) and female rats (578 - 697 μg/g dry weight) fed the untreated proteins. The kidney iron contents of rats fed the treated proteins were also lower than that of rats fed the untreated proteins. Liver copper levels of male and female rats fed the treated proteins were up to three fold higher than those found in rats fed the untreated proteins. The data suggested that LAL, an unnatural amino acid derivative formed during processing of foods, may produce adverse effects on growth, protein digestibility, protein quality and mineral bioavailability and utilization. The antinutritional effects of LAL may be more pronounced in sole-source foods such as infant formulas and formulated liquid diets which have been reported to contain significant amounts (up to 2400 ppm of LAL in the protein) of LAL. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{vesicular}} {{development of}} the scolex of E. multilocularis was investigated in media which consisted essentially of 0. 5 % <b>lactalbumin</b> in HANKS' solution. The results obtained are as follows. 1. For the purpose of defining {{the relation between the}} vesicular {{development of the}} scolex and the composition of media, scolices were incubated in the media containing various percentages of additionals such as bovine serum, bovine bile and liver extract. It was clarified that bovine serum was a necessary element for survival of a scolex. On the other hand, bovine bile and liver extract accelerated the vesiculation of scolex, but these substances had a tendency to cause degeneration and rupture of the scolex. The proportion of vesiculated scolices was noted the highest in 0. 5 % <b>lactalbumin</b> HANKS' solution combined with 20 % bovine serum and 10 % liver extract, intermediate in 0. 5 % <b>lactalbumin</b> HANKS' solution with 20 % serum and 0. 5 % bovine bile and lowest in 0. 5 % <b>lactalbumin</b> HANKS' solution with 20 % serum. Degeneration and rupture of scolices increased in parallel with the above rate, but the percentage of scolices showing mobility decreased, inversely. 2. The process of scolex vesiculation was classified into three types. In the first type, the scolex itself vesiculated globularly while in the second, the cyst was formed from a vacuole formed at the anterior or posterior extremity of the scolex. The third type was one in which a combination of the above two types was noted. 3. In the process of scolex vesiculation, disappearance of parenchymal cells, metamorphosis of subcuticular cells and increase of calcareous corpuscles were recognized. The vesicle completed by the above process manifested enlargement and multilocular vesiculation. 4. Collections of germinal cells similar to the early stage of brood capsule were found in some cysts. 5. In the vesiculated scolex which showed deficient thickening of the cuticular layer in proportion to increase of its volume, rupture due to increase of inner pressure was recognized. On the contrary, in the cysts with remarkable thickening of the cuticular layer, the size was increased very slowly. 6.
