40|$|We study a {{continuous}} time {{model of a}} levered firm with fixed assets generating a cash flow that fluctuates with business conditions. Since external finance is costly, the firm holds a liquid (cash) reserve to help survive periods of poor business conditions. Holding liquid assets inside the firm is costly {{as some of the}} return on such assets is dissipated due to agency problems. We solve for the firms optimal dividend, share issuance, and liquid asset holding policies. The firm optimally targets a level of liquid assets which is a non-monotonic function of business conditions. In good times, the firm does not need a high <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve,</b> but as conditions deteriorate, it will target higher reserve. In very poor conditions, the firm will declare bankruptcy, usually after it has depleted its <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve.</b> Our model can predict liquidity holdings, leverage ratios, yield spreads, expected default probabilities, expected loss given default and equity volatilities all in line with market experience. We apply the model to examine agency conflicts associated with the <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve,</b> and some associated debt covenants.

Stakeholders may disagree about firms' liquidity choices because they {{differ in the}} allocation of ex-post control rights for the firms' <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves.</b> Using state-level changes in takeover protection as exogenous shocks to corporate governance, I find that firms increase cash relative to lines of credit when the threat of takeover weakens.

It develops a dynamic stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} in which banks operate subject to agency problems and funding liquidity risk in their inter- mediation activity. Importantly, the amount of <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> held in the financial sector is determined endogenously: Balance sheet constraints force banks to trade off insurance against funding outflows with loan scale. A financial crisis, simulated as an abrupt decline in the collateral value of bank assets, triggers a flight to liquidity, which strongly amplifies the initial shock and induces credit crunch dynamics sharing key features with the Great Recession. The paper thus develops a new balance sheet channel of shock transmission that works through the composition of banks' asset portfolios...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is assessing, from 2001 to 2005, the impact of some changes {{affecting}} the Italian payment system on reserves demand and revenues of those banks directly participating in the new BI-REL, the Italian  RTGS  system.

The banking system reacted to those changes in a few months' time by raising the liquidity management's efficiency, also thanks to the start of the  RTGS  system's payment optimisation mechanism. The adjustment process would not only allow the banks to completely offset the effect brought about by Express II but even to improve, although slightly, the liquidity management's efficiency compared to prior to the changes.     JEL Codes: D 24;G 21;G 28; E 42 Keywords: Bank; Reserves</p...|$|E

Central banks {{are classified as}} weak or strong, depending upon their structural profitability.

Their operating expenditures, nonperforming assets, international reserve carrying costs, and international reserve accumulation needs are high.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} which studies the business-cycle implications of financial frictions and liquidity risk at the bank-level. Following Holmstr m and Tirole (1998), demand for <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> arises from the anticipation of idiosyncratic operating expenses during the execution phase of bank-financed investment projects. Banks react to adverse aggregate shocks by hoarding liquidity while being forced to decrease their leverage. Both effects amplify recessionary dynamics, since they crowd out funds available for investment financing. This mechanism is triggered by a market liquidity squeeze modelled {{as a shock to}} the collateral value of banks assets. This novel type of aggregate risk induces a credit crunch scenario which shares key features with the Great Recession such as strong output decline, pro-cyclical leverage and counter-cyclical liquidity hoarding. Unconventional credit policy {{in the form of a}} wealth transfer from households to credit constrained banks is shown to mitigate the credit crunch...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Islamic banking {{products and}} interprets {{them in the}} context of financial intermediation theory. Anecdotal evidence shows that many of the conventional products can be redrafted as Sharia-compliant products, so that the differences are smaller than expected. Comparing conventional and Islamic banks and controlling for other bank and country characteristics, the authors find few significant differences in business orientation, efficiency, asset quality, or stability. While Islamic banks seem more cost-effective than conventional banks in a broad cross-country sample, this finding reverses in a sample of countries with both Islamic and conventional banks. However, conventional banks that operate in countries with a higher market share of Islamic banks are more cost-effective but less stable. There is also consistent evidence of higher capitalization of Islamic banks and this capital cushion plus higher <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> explains the relatively better performance of Islamic banks during the recent crisis.

Instead, theoretical literature has kept a focus on issues relating to the information structure between banks and the lender of last resort. Also, controlling for moral hazard among banks due to safety nets was mainly attained through an element of ambiguity regarding the ultimate decision of a central bank to resolve a liquidity crisis, rather than through regulation. In this paper, regulat-ing a bank’s <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserve</b> is considered quid pro quo for emergency liquidity assistance by a central bank.

40|$|We analyze a {{model of}} optimal capital {{structure}} and liquidity choice based on a dynamic tradeoff theory for financially constrained firms. In addition to the classical tradeoff between the expected tax advantages of debt and bankruptcy costs, we introduce a cost of external financing for the firm, which generates a precautionary demand for liquidity and an optimal liquidity management policy for the firm. An important new cost of debt financing {{in this context is}} an endogenous debt servicing cost: debt payments drain the firm’s valuable <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves</b> and thus impose higher expected external financing costs on the firm. The precautionary demand for liquidity also means that realized earnings are separated in time from payouts to shareholders, implying that the classical Miller-formula for the net tax benefits of debt no longer holds.

Possible explanation for this is that, given the huge profit by the conventional banks, it has more chance to allocate it as liquidity reserve as well as increasing the facilities (improvement on technology).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis address how aggregate shocks affect insurance firms 2 ̆ 7 {{risk management}} and asset investment decisions {{as well as}} the impact of these decisions on insurance prices and regulation. The first chapter develops a signaling model to examine how insurance firms choose among retention, reinsurance and securitization especially for catastrophe risks. The second chapter examines the determination of insurance prices in an integrated equilibrium framework where insurers 2 ̆ 7 assets may be subject to both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. The third chapter presents an empirical analysis of the hypothesized impacts of internal capital and asset risk on insurance prices as predicted by the results of the second chapter. The last chapter investigates the optimal design of insurance regulation to achieve the Pareto optimal asset and liquidity management by insurers as well as risk sharing between insurers and insurees. Chapter 1 provides a novel explanation for the predominance of retention and reinsurance relative to securitization in catastrophe risk transfer using a signaling model. An insurer 2 ̆ 7 s risk transfer choice trades off the lower signaling costs of reinsurance against the additional costs of reinsurance stemming from sources such as their market power, higher cost of capital relative to capital markets, and compensation for their monitoring costs. In equilibrium, the lowest risk insurers choose reinsurance, while intermediate and high risk insurance choose partial and full securitization, respectively. An increase in the loss size increases the average risk of insurers who choose securitization. Consequently, catastrophe risks, which are characterized by low frequency-high severity losses, are only securitized by very high risk insurers. Chapter 2 develops a unified equilibrium model of competitive insurance markets where insurers 2 ̆ 7 assets may be exposed to idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. We endogenize the relationship between insurance prices and insurers internal capital that potentially reconcile the conflicting predictions of previous theories that investigate the relation using partial equilibrium frameworks. Equilibrium effects lead to a non-monotonic U-shaped relation between insurance price and internal capital. Specifically, the equilibrium insurance price first decreases with a positive shock to the internal capital when it is below certain threshold level, and then increases with a positive shock the internal capital when it is above the threshold level. Further, we also derive another testable implication that an increase in the asset default risk increases the insurance price and decrease the insurance coverage. Chapter 3 studies the property and casualty insurance industry in periods from 1992 to 2012 based on the aggregate level of NAIC data. We show that the insurance price decreases with an increase in the surplus of insurance firms {{at the end of the}} previous year when the surplus is lower than 8. 5 billion, and then increase when the surplus is higher than 8. 5 billion. Our results provide support for the hypothesis of a U-shaped relationship between internal capital and insurance price. Our results also provide evidence for the positive relationship between asset portfolio risk and insurance price. Chapter 4 studies the effects of aggregate risk on the Pareto optimal asset and liquidity management by insurers as well as risk-sharing between insurers and insurers. When aggregate risk is low, both insurers and insurers hold no <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves,</b> insurees are fully insured, and insurers bear all aggregate risk. When aggregate risk takes intermediate values, both insurees and insurers still hold no <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves,</b> but insurers partially share aggregate risk with insurers. When aggregate risk is high, however, it is optimal to hold nonzero <b>liquidity</b> <b>reserves,</b> and insurees partially share aggregate risk with insurers. The efficient asset and liquidity management policies {{as well as the}} aggregate risk allocation can be implemented through a regulatory intervention policy that combines a minimum liquidity requirement when aggregate risk is high, 2 ̆ 2 ex post 2 ̆ 2 contingent on the aggregate state, comprehensive insurance policies, and reinsurance...|$|E
