50|$|The Riggenbach {{system is}} similar in design to the Marsh system. It uses a <b>ladder</b> <b>rack,</b> formed of steel plates or {{channels}} connected by round or square rods at regular intervals. The Riggenbach system suffers from the problem that its fixed <b>ladder</b> <b>rack</b> is more complex and expensive to build than the other systems.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{government}} organization, utilizing an alarmed carrier PDS in conjunction with interlocking armored cable may, in some cases, allow {{for the elimination of}} the carrier systems altogether. In these instances, the cables being protected can be installed in existing conveyance (wire basket, <b>ladder</b> <b>rack)</b> or suspended cabling (on D-rings, J-Hooks, etc.).|$|E

50|$|The new {{terminal}} {{was completed in}} 2009. The capacity was 450 passengers per hour and the total area of 13400 m2, including the area occupied by the VIP and CIP halls. The terminal is equipped with electronic and electromechanical systems. These include passenger telescopic <b>ladders,</b> <b>racks</b> of electronic registration, HVAC (heating and cooling system), FIDS (Alert System departures on the electronic scoreboard), X-ray scanners, CCTV, lifts and escalators.|$|R
50|$|The buses are {{varied and}} {{characterized}} by being painted colorfully (usually with the yellow, blue, and red {{colors of the}} flags of Ecuador and Colombia) with local arabesques and figures. Most have a <b>ladder</b> to the <b>rack</b> on the roof which is also used for carrying people, livestock and merchandise.|$|R
50|$|The Riggenbach {{rack system}} used a <b>ladder</b> <b>rack,</b> formed of steel {{channels}} connected by square rungs at regular intervals, {{to engage the}} pinion wheels of the rack engine. The rungs of the NZASM rack track were spaced 4 in apart. To ensure correct meshing of the gears when entering the rack section, engaging pieces of special section, 6 ft long and fitted with round-bar rungs, were hinged to {{each end of the}} rack, supported by a spiral spring underneath. When the rack engine made contact with the hinged section and the gear wheels did not mesh with the rack correctly, the engaging section would be pressed down until correct meshing was accomplished.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{evaluate}} the low-back compression force and users feedback in loading ladders from vans using a hydraulic <b>ladder</b> <b>rack</b> and a tradition fixed <b>ladder</b> <b>rack.</b> Simulated ladder lifting task {{was used to evaluate}} the differences in peak compression force while workers load ladder from vans using the fixed <b>ladder</b> <b>rack</b> and the hydraulic <b>ladder</b> <b>rack.</b> Usability questionnaires were also distributed to workers who were invited to use the hydraulic <b>ladder</b> <b>rack</b> for three months to evaluate their preferences and perception of effort when working with the fixed and the hydraulic <b>ladder</b> <b>rack.</b> Significantly (p< 0. 1) higher peak compression force was found when participants used the fixed ladder racks. The upper arm angles for both of the left and right arms was also significantly (p< 0. 05) higher when workers worked with the fixed <b>ladder</b> <b>rack.</b> The majority of responses in the usability questionnaires significantly (p< 0. 05) favored working with the hydraulic <b>ladder</b> <b>rack...</b>|$|E
40|$|Existing Swedish design {{guidelines}} (JBR) cover silo wall heights {{up to about}} 3 m. These guidelines presumably overestimate the forces and pressures exerted by silage juice when silo walls are more than 3 m high, which could result in over-sizing, material waste and increased capital costs. This study determined silage physical properties in terms of horizontal wall pressure and evaluated silage juice levels in silos with a wall height of 3 m or more. Wall pressure was measured by transducers mounted on a steel <b>ladder</b> <b>rack</b> placed vertically along the internal silo wall. The <b>ladder</b> <b>rack</b> also permitted measurement of silage juice levels in slotted steel pipes. The pressure on the transducers was recorded by a data acquisition system displaying static and total loads (pressures imposed by silage material without and with the compaction machine, respectively). The static pressure {{at the bottom of}} the silo wall (4 m) was 16 kPa during filling and compaction, and 22 kPa 1 - 4 months after filling. The silage juice did not interact with compaction. The wall pressure increased by 30 % after filling, but the increase was only significant at 1 m from the silo bottom. The dynamic load was 17 kPa when the compaction machine passed 0. 1 m from the silo wall. New guidelines are proposed based on the results and on the Eurocode for ultimate limit states (ULS) for two stages; filling and the utility period. The design bending moment for ULS was 21 % lower than specified in JBR. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|When, in the Round 7 {{replay of}} last year's grand-final, Brisbane {{were unable to}} defeat Melbourne, they had managed to win just 2 of their first seven games, {{compared}} to their strong starts in 2006 and 2005. Having not yet played an NRL game in 2007, Tame Tupou, the Broncos' top try-scorer for the previous season, left the club in round 7 for England. In round 11 Brisbane were {{at the bottom of}} the <b>ladder</b> before <b>racking</b> up their biggest ever win, defeating an under-strength Newcastle Knights 71-6. It was also the Knights' biggest ever loss and the most points the Broncos had ever scored in a game. This was followed up with a loss to an understrength St George Illawarra Dragons.|$|R
40|$|Downstream passage {{problems}} have been studied mainly in Europe and North America, {{but not so much}} {{in the rest of the}} world, and have focused on anadromous species, particularly salmonids. Relatively few studies have been conducted on other migratory species. Moreover, in many cases bypass facilities for downstream migrants have been implemented without evaluating their effectiveness or if effectiveness has been evaluated, it has often been shown to be low. We will provide a brief historical review of downstream bypass problems in Sweden. This is followed by a description of the Swedish situation today, with focus on several case studies that have evaluated downstream bypass efficiency in rivers of different sizes and for several different species. We have divided Swedish rehabilitation history into four periods: Fish migration and natural reproduction (pre 1900 s), Fish <b>ladders</b> and <b>racks</b> with unknown function (1900 - 1935), The compensatory stocking and turbine passage era (1935 - 2000), and the modern approach of rehabilitating regulated rivers to allow natural reproduction. We will give examples of recent rehabilitation on Swedish rivers including measures such as inclined racks and bypasses/traps and guiding/skimming walls and we will present the results from their evaluation...|$|R
