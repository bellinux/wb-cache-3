25|$|Anthrax is {{a disease}} caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming, Gram positive, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium (Fig. 1). The lethality of the disease {{is caused by the}} bacterium's two principal virulence factors: (i) the polyglutamic acid capsule, which is anti-phagocytic, and (ii) the tripartite protein toxin, called anthrax toxin. Anthrax toxin is a mixture of three protein components: (i) protective antigen (PA), (ii) edema factor (EF), and (iii) <b>lethal</b> <b>factor</b> (LF).|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin is a three-protein {{exotoxin}} secreted by virulent {{strains of}} the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis—the causative agent of anthrax. The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and <b>lethal</b> <b>factor</b> (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal. Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation of macromolecular assemblies, and on protein translocation, pore formation, endocytosis, and other biochemical processes.|$|E

50|$|The Swedish Warmblood may be any solid colour (although certain colors {{associated}} with <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> will exclude a stallion from breeding approval). Most common colors are chestnut, bay or seal brown. True blacks are rare. Swedish Warmbloods are also seen in gray and roan. They generally stand , {{and have a}} reputation as strong, athletic animals with flowing gaits.|$|R
40|$|Crested newts {{exhibit a}} {{balanced}} lethal system which causes development to abort in 50 % of tailbud em-bryos. The main features of arrested embryos are described, shown to be constant {{in a range of}} culture conditions and found to be unchanged by parabiosis or extirpation of the central nervous system or heart. Two categories of abortive embryos can be dis-tinguished in some spawnings. A corresponding seg-regation of an easily identified marker chromosome confirms previous reports that chromosome 1 carries the recessive <b>lethal</b> <b>factors.</b> The marker chromosome is tentatively associated with the blistered form of abortive embryo. Two possible modes of origin for the {{balanced lethal system}} are discussed, either from ancestral autosomes or from sex chromosomes. The latter is favoured because it involves fewer assumptions. The subsequent evolution of the system should inevitably lead to progressively earlier embryonic mortality by an accumulation of multiple recessive <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> on each chromosome variant.

40|$|Since {{smoke is}} one of the <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> at the scene of a fire, the {{effectiveness}} of a smoke control system is of great importance. Buildings are likely to be influenced by natural winds, so the effectiveness of a natural smoke extraction system is often questioned. This study discusses the feasibility of using the Venturi principle to improve a natural smoke extraction system for buildings under the effect of wind. The findings show that side smoke extraction is likely to be influenced by external air flow. Smoke extraction can clearly be improved if a negative pressure zone is formed outside the smoke vent...|$|R
40|$|After binding to {{cellular}} receptors and proteolytic activation, {{the protective}} antigen component of anthrax toxin forms a heptameric prepore. The prepore later undergoes pH-dependent conversion to a pore, mediating translocation of the edema and <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> to the cytosol. We describe {{structures of the}} prepore (3. 6 Å) and a prepore:receptor complex (4. 3 Å) that reveal the location of poreforming loops and an unexpected interaction of the receptor with the pore-forming domain. Lower pH is required for prepore-to-pore conversion {{in the presence of}} the receptor, indicating that this interaction regulates pH-dependent pore formation.

50|$|Also {{interesting}} {{is the effect of}} alpha-defensins on the exotoxin produced by anthrax (Bacillus anthracis).

5000|$|Exotoxins such as PVL {{constitute}} essential {{components of}} the virulence mechanisms of S. aureus.

Its genes secrete two proteins - toxins designated LukS-PV and LukF-PV, 33 and 34 kDa in size. The structures of both proteins have been solved in the soluble forms, and are present in the PDB as ID codes [...] and [...] respectively.

The PAI also contains genes which encode a transcriptional activator AtxA and the repressor PagR, both of which regulate the expression of the anthrax toxin genes.|$|E
40|$|Effective defense {{responses}} {{involve the}} entire organism. To maintain body homeostasis after tissue damage, a systemic wound response is induced {{in which the}} response of each tissue is tightly orchestrated to avoid incomplete recovery or an excessive, damaging response. Here, we provide evidence that in the systemic response to wounding, an apoptotic caspase pathway is activated downstream of reactive oxygen species in the midgut enterocytes (ECs), cells distant from the wound site, in Drosophila. We show that a caspase-pathway mutant has defects in homeostatic gut cell renewal and that inhibiting caspase activity in fly ECs results {{in the production of}} systemic <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> after wounding. Our results indicate that wounding remotely controls caspase activity in ECs, which activates the tissue stem cell regeneration pathway in the gut to dampen the dangerous systemic wound reaction...|$|R
30|$|An {{encouraging}} {{result of}} this study was the lack of a generally positive response of ruderals to fire. Although some ruderals responded positively to fires, others did not. Low-intensity surface fires are not severe disturbances, and thus in one sense they should not be expected to favor ruderals or other species dependent upon soil disturbances or other <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> (Grime 1979, Roberts 2007, Brewer and Bailey 2014). There were some native ruderals that initially responded positively to canopy reduction by the tornado, but then declined over time (e.g., American burnweed and dogfennel). The decline in these species coincided with a significant increase in perennial ruderals moderately indicative of severe disturbances, such as sawtoothed blackberry. The net effect of these changes was no general decline or increase in ruderals over time as a function of either canopy reduction or fire.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{positive}} end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was evaluated in preventing the deleterious mechanical respiratory effects of fatty acid pulmonary embolism. One {{group of animals}} had ventilation without PEEP, while the second group had PEEP of 10 cm H 2 O applied only to the right lung. In the right lung, PEEP slightly reduced the blood flow, increased the vascular resistance, but reduced intersititial edema and reduced the degree of shunting to almost normal. Hypoxemia was prevented in the right pulmonary venous system, but was prominent in the left. The hypoxemia and shunting in the left lung were comparable to the Group I animals without PEEP to either lung. These studies confirm the value of PEEP in the therapy of the pulmonary manifestations of fat embolism which are the <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> in the fatty embolism syndrome...|$|R

50|$|In 2000 it was discovered, {{that two}} sibling colonies (colonies {{taken from the}} same mother colony or from the same LB growth) of the P. dendritiformis inoculated side by side can inhibit the growth of one and other (Figure 4). Recent {{detailed}} studies21 of the phenomenon in the branching morphotype, revealed that the two colonies not only inhibit each other from growing into the territory between them but induced the death of those cells close to the border. Material extracted from the agar gel between two colonies was found to kill single growing colonies. By employing molecular biology methods combined with the new genome sequencing information and bioinformatics, they discovered a new toxin (sibling <b>lethal</b> <b>factor),</b> which acts selectively only on the same bacterial strain. The findings suggest a new strategy for fighting bacteria by self-toxins they produce.|$|E
50|$|To {{enter the}} cells, the edema and <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> use another protein {{produced}} by B. anthracis called protective antigen, which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell protease then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA20 and PA63. PA20 dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further {{role in the}} toxic cycle. PA63 then oligomerizes with six other PA63 fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape, the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs, forming a resistant complex. Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to {{the interior of the}} host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol. It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.|$|R
40|$|We usually {{classify}} mutations {{according to}} their most conspicuous effects.

In the ease of eye color genes we initially observe only the directly visible pigments. As a rule, however, these easily recognizable features are preceded and accompanied by an additional set of characters (phenes) which become apparent only by the use of special methods. The totality of all phenes, in which a mutant deviates from a normal or standard genotype, constitutes the "pleiotropie pattern of manifestation " of the respective gene or factor. Such a pleiotropy of genie action conditions biochemical nd physiolog-ical, as well as morphological phenes (Hadorn, 1954).

40|$|Branches of gorgonians {{belonging}} to four different Mediterranean species (Eunicella singularis (Esper), Paramuricea clavata (Risso), Corallium rubrum (Linnaeus) and Lophogorgia ceratophyta (Linnaeus)) were transplanted to different habitats {{by means of}} three different methods, and survival and growth rates were observed over periods ranging from three months to over two years. It was concluded that transplantation of animals still fixed on their natural substratum is to be preferred over transplantations involving artificial devices. Transplanted adult branches of all four species tolerate conditions under which the species are not usually encountered. Tolerances or preferences of larval and juvenile phases must account for these discrepancies. Transplants never survived in shallow waters.

50|$|Bacillus anthracis is the {{etiologic}} agent of anthrax—a common disease of livestock and, occasionally, of humans—and the only obligate pathogen within the genus Bacillus. B. anthracis is a Gram-positive, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, with a width of 1.0-1.2 µm and {{a length of}} 3-5 µm. It can be grown in an ordinary nutrient medium under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.It is one of few bacteria known to synthesize a protein capsule (poly-D-gamma-glutamic acid). Like Bordetella pertussis, it forms a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase exotoxin known as Anthrax edema factor, along with anthrax <b>lethal</b> <b>factor.</b> It bears close genotypical and phenotypical resemblance to Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis. All three species share cellular dimensions and morphology. All form oval spores located centrally in an unswollen sporangium.

50|$|AVA is {{classified}} as a subunit vaccine that is cell-free and containing no whole or live anthrax bacteria. The antigen (immunologically active) portions are produced from culture filtrates of a toxigenic, but avirulent, nonencapsulated mutant — known as V770-NP1-R — of the B. anthracis Vollum strain. (The Vollum strain was the same one weaponized by the old U.S. biological warfare program.) As with the Sterne (veterinary) anthrax vaccine strain and the similar British anthrax vaccine (known as AVP), AVA lacks the capsule plasmid pXO2 (required for full virulence) and is composed chiefly of the anthrax protective antigen (PA) with small amounts of edema factor (EF) and <b>lethal</b> <b>factor</b> (LF) that may vary from lot to lot. Other uncharacterized bacterial byproducts are also present. Whether or not the EF and LF contribute to the vaccine's efficacy is not known. AVA has smaller amounts of EF and LF than AVP.|$|E

40|$|Bacterial populations contain persisters, cells which survive {{exposure}} to bactericidal antibiotics and other <b>lethal</b> <b>factors.</b> Persisters {{do not have}} a genetic resistance mechanism, and their means to tolerate killing remain unknown. In exponentially growing populations of Escherichia coli the frequency of persister formation usually is 10 − 7 to 10 − 5. It has been shown that cells overexpressing either of the toxic proteins HipA and RelE, both members of the bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules, have the ability to form more persisters, suggesting a specific role for these toxins in the mechanism of persistence. However, here we show that cells expressing proteins that are unrelated to TA modules but which become toxic when ectopically expressed, chaperone DnaJ and protein PmrC of Salmonella enterica, also form 100 - to 1, 000 -fold more persisters. Thus, persistence is linked not only to toxicity caused by expression of HipA or dedicated toxins but also to expression of other unrelated proteins...|$|R
40|$|Deficiency in Cathepsin D (CtsD), {{the major}} {{cellular}} lysosomal aspartic proteinase, causes the congenital form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs).

Here we demonstrate that re-expression of CtsD within the CNS but not re-expression of CtsD in visceral organs prevented both central and visceral pathologies of CtsD−/− mice. Our results suggest that CtsD was substantially secreted from CNS neurons and drained from CNS to periphery via lymphatic routes. Through this drainage, CNS-expressed CtsD acts as an important modulator of immune system maintenance and peripheral tissue homeostasis. These effects depended on enzymatic activity and not on proposed functions of CtsD as an extracellular ligand. Our results furthermore demonstrate that the prominent accumulation of ceroid/lipofuscin and activation of microglia in brains of CtsD−/− are not <b>lethal</b> <b>factors</b> but can be tolerated by the rodent CNS...|$|R
