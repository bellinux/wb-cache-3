25|$|There {{was only}} one mass-produced {{derivative}} of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a <b>luggage</b> <b>boot.</b> This was coded PS1/1, and {{was a very strong}} seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives an idea of the scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new buses and coaches few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a fairly typical sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol-engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} independents also took the PD3 and the Ulster Transport Authority took {{examples}} with fully fronted MCW bodies finished by the operator. Some of these on PD3/5 chassis had the newly optional O.680 11.1-litre 150 bhp engine and a <b>luggage</b> <b>boot,</b> {{for use on}} Belfast Airport services; some of the PD3/4s for rural routes also had a rear <b>luggage</b> <b>boot,</b> while the PD3/4s allocated to Derry City had the first instance of power-assisted steering on a Leyland double-decker.|$|E
50|$|Like its Leyland and AEC rivals, the Freeline had a high, {{straight}} ladder frame, made of substantial steel channel section, with an optional rear drop-frame extension for <b>luggage</b> <b>boots</b> on coaches, or standee platforms for urban buses.|$|R
5000|$|For 1934, Nash {{introduced}} {{completely new}} styling, called [...] "Speedstream", featuring generous use of ornamental moldings in body panels and fenders, {{in a very}} streamlined and Art Deco way. The designs were influenced by Russian Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and the new bodies featured streamline accents, bullet-shaped headlights, horizontal hood ribs, rear wheel spats, and built-in <b>luggage</b> <b>boots</b> with a full beaver-tail rear end. The Ambassador Eight series for this year was limited to various four-door sedan body styles.|$|R
5|$|On November 6, 2013, Disney Consumer Products began {{releasing}} {{a line of}} merchandise featuring Anna in Disney Store and other retailers. Various versions of Anna dolls include the fashion doll set, the mini-doll set, plush doll, Anna-as-a-toddler doll, and a special version called Musical Magic Elsa and Anna Dolls, which lights up and plays their signature songs that appear in the film when users hold their hands or they hold each other's hands. Anna's merchandise also covers {{a wide range of}} other products, such as rolling <b>luggage,</b> <b>boots,</b> clothes, nightgowns, bowls, plates, coffee mugs, and home décors. In addition, the film was adapted as simplified storybooks for children, with diverse versions featuring sound effects, original character voices, and mini projectors that project movie images on the wall. One of those books, called A Sister More Like Me, includes illustrations by Brittney Lee, the film's visual development artist. Both Anna and Elsa appear as playable characters in Disney Infinity through the use of their corresponding figurines.|$|R
50|$|While {{the engine}} and chassis were only altered in detail {{completely}} new coachwork was announced in August 1937. It included a <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> at the back and the door or lid forms a baggage platform. The seating and upholstery were redesigned.|$|E
50|$|A <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> {{was added}} {{at the back}} with a {{separate}} lockable compartment for a spare wheel. Other additions were footrests for the back passengers, an electric cigarette lighter, a sunshine roof, double screen wipers, sun visors, and a new pistol-grip handbrake lever on the dash.|$|E
50|$|The frame {{comprised}} lightweight longitudinal {{channel and}} tubular cross-members. It was straight over the axles with a dropped section {{forward of the}} front axle to provide a lower entrance. A drop frame for a <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> was optional at the rear. Special steels were used to keep weight down.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{laid down}} his lines resignedly, coolly {{surveyed}} Mr. Mayfield, the house, and the half-pleased, half-frightened Jeff, and {{then proceeded to}} remove the <b>luggage</b> from the <b>boot,</b> all the while whistling loud and offensive incredulity. Then he climbed back to his box. Mr. Mayfield, completely demoralized under this treatment, {{as a last resort}} essayed patronage.|$|R
6000|$|The figure which Bill saw thus engaged, {{without being}} {{otherwise}} distinguished, certainly seemed {{to justify the}} Judge's opinion. She {{appeared to be a}} well-matured country girl, whose frank gray eyes and large laughing mouth expressed a wholesome and abiding gratification in her life and surroundings. She was watching the replacing of <b>luggage</b> in the <b>boot.</b> A little feminine start, as one of her own parcels was thrown somewhat roughly on the roof, gave Bill his opportunity. [...] "Now there," [...] he growled to the helper, [...] "ye ain't carting stone! Look out, will yer! Some of your things, miss?" [...] he added, with gruff courtesy, turning to her. [...] "These yer trunks, for instance?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fear of assassination--the {{inevitable}} {{destiny of}} the tyrant--haunts the man-tiger even within the fastnesses of his lair. Day and night a carriage with four horses stands in readiness on La Petite Hollande, the great, open, tree-bordered Place at the extreme end of the Isle Feydeau and on which give {{the windows of the}} Hôtel de la Villestreux. Day and night the carriage is ready--with coachman on the box and postillion in the saddle, who are relieved every two hours lest they get sleepy or slack--with <b>luggage</b> in the <b>boot</b> and provisions always kept fresh inside the coach; everything always ready lest something--a warning from a friend or a threat from an enemy, or merely a sudden access of unreasoning terror, the haunting memory of a bloody act--should decide the tyrant at a moment's notice to fly from the scenes of his brutalities.|$|R
50|$|In 1953 two {{variants}} emerged. For coaching duties type PSUC1/2T had a dropped-frame extension at {{the rear}} for a <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> and a higher-ratio rear axle for a higher road speed. Among the first customers were Scout of Preston, an independent coach operator who competed with Ribble on Lancashire to London express services. They had the first five Duple Elizabethan-bodied coaches in early 1954.|$|E
50|$|The saloon <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> has a tail {{board that}} lets down (the rear window remains fixed) {{and the space}} behind the rear seat is usually covered by a vinyl tonneau cover. This can be removed, and the rear seats folded to permit {{the whole of the}} back of the car to be used for luggage, though the loading deck {{achieved}} was far from being flat.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 {{along with}} the rest of the Claymore range, the Nimbus was uprated {{featuring}} heavier BMC axles and an Albion constant mesh gearbox with either five or six speeds. Vacuum assistance to the brakes was now provided by a Hydrovac system, belt-driven from the engine. Two Nimbus-specific changes were the option of a drop-frame extension at the rear for a <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> and the option of a spare wheel mounted on a slide-out carrier, below this extension.|$|E
50|$|At {{the front}} of the vehicle, a front-hinged lid {{encloses}} space for the spare tyre, radiators and cooling fans, battery (ahead of a wheel arch), heating and cooling systems and the vehicle's electric control systems. At the rear, a full-width, insulated and trimmed <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> with a gas-strut-supported lid sits behind the engine bay, sizeable enough to hold several sizeable soft bags or set of golf clubs. Electrically actuated pop-up headlights fit flush to the vehicle nose, and contain twin round lamps in each for all 8, QV and 3.2 models, and a single homofocal rectangular unit each side of the Mondial t.|$|E
5000|$|Bedford co-developed with Duple the [...] "Vista" [...] {{coachwork}} for the OB, fronted by {{a classic}} bullnose. The ash framework was reinforced with steel, {{and the floor}} made from hardwood with softwood tongued and grooved boarding, {{with the exception of}} the cab area which was finished with alloy chequerplate. Seating capacity was normally 29 with overhead luggage racks provided for passengers, whilst the rear <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> was also used to store the spare wheel. The price of a complete coach, including finishing in a two-colour livery, was £1,314.10s for a 27-seater, and £1,325.10s for a twenty nine seater.|$|E
5000|$|A tilbury is a light, open, two-wheeled carriage, with {{or without}} a top, {{developed}} in the early 19th century by the London firm of Tilbury, coachbuilders in Mount Street (see also Stanhope (carriage)). A tilbury rig {{is little more than a}} single [...] "tilbury seat" [...] - the firm's characteristic spindle-backed seat with a curved padded backrest - [...] mounted over a raked <b>luggage</b> <b>boot,</b> and fitted with a dashboard and mounting peg, all on an elaborate suspension system of curved leaf springs above the single axle. The tilbury has large wheels for moving fast over rough roads. A tilbury is fast, light, sporty and dangerous: ...|$|E
5000|$|The final pre-war {{model was}} the 1938 Minx. There {{were no more}} factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies. The car was {{visually}} similar to the Magnificent, with a different grille, {{and access to the}} <b>luggage</b> <b>boot</b> (trunk) was external (that on the predecessor was accessed by folding down the rear seat). There were two saloon models in the range, the basic [...] "Safety" [...] model with simple rexine trim instead of leather, no opening front quarterlights, and less luxurious trim levels. The De Luxe model had leather trim, opening quarterlights, extra trim pads, and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model. This includes gearbox, differential, half shafts, steering box, and a great many other mechanical and cosmetic changes. Even the front grille, which to the casual eye looks almost identical to the 1938 model, became a pressed alloy component rather than a composite.|$|E
50|$|The Seddon Pennine 7 {{featured}} a ladder-frame chassis with channel-section longitudinals and tubular cross-members, available to either 5.6m wheelbase for 11m bodies or (from 1975) 6m wheelbase for 12m bodies. It was horizontal in elevation but only parallel in plan over the leaf-sprung {{front and rear}} axles; the nearside member was in-swept at the front to allow a wider low-entrance area, and the offside member was outswept in the wheelbase to allow ready access to the Gardner engine and its auxiliaries. The frame did not continue aft of the rear axle-mounting, collaboration with SBG's preferred supplier Walter Alexander Coachbuilders meant there was no worry about the body builder providing a strongly cantilevered rear overhang capable of supporting a capacious <b>luggage</b> <b>boot,</b> especially after Alexander's switch back (from 1967-72) to aluminium alloy body framing. Power steering was standard. The prototype (carrying a late body by Seddon's Pennine Coachcraft subsidiary) had a Self-Changing Gears semi-automatic gearbox, but production variants were initially to be fitted with a four-speed ZF synchromesh unit, coach versions having a higher ratio final drive allowing a 76 mph maximum speed, 56 mph being the designed maximum for bus versions, better acceleration and more flexible performance ensuing with the low ratio back axle.|$|E
5000|$|PD1/3: In Autumn 1946, the Construction and Use {{regulations}} were revised, allowing a maximum width for buses of 8', {{rather than the}} previous 7'6" [...] inches, provided the Traffic Commissioners approved the use of wider buses on routes, {{in the same way}} as they already had the power to approve double-deck buses on a route-by-route basis. Also, the gross vehicle weight for a double-deck bus was increased to 12 tons, from the wartime figure of 11 tons. The PD1/3 differed from the PD1 in that it had wider axles, being designed for the 8-foot width. Oldham Corporation quickly obtained clearance for all their routes and in 1947 DBU244 with Charles H. Roe H31/25R body became the first 8-foot-wide motorbus built for service in the UK. Oldham took in total 50 similar buses in 1947/8. Manchester Corporation were also early customers for the wider bus, following up their initial 1946 batch of fifty PD1s with a 1947/8 order for 100 PD1/3 with 58-seat (H32/26R) bodies to their standard outline by Metro-Cammell. During 1948 Ribble Motor Services, who had obtained permission to use full-width double-deck coaches on their express services from East Lancashire to Blackpool, received 30 such bodies by H. V. Burlingham of Blackpool, which had full-width cabs, electrically powered folding doors to the rear platform, which itself was built-up to saloon level, allowing a small <b>luggage</b> <b>boot.</b> The body design, with additional luggage stowage over the rear wheel arches, had generously radiussed windows, two sunroofs on the upper deck and, although of lowbridge layout (the Leyland patent on this expired in 1937), were fitted out to full coach standards for 49 passengers (FCL27/22RD). Liberal use was made of chromium-plated steel trim and they carried the cream coach livery, with red relief, rather than the bus livery of red with cream relief, they soon became famous as the [...] "White Ladies" [...] was so successful that a further twenty similar vehicles on PD2/3 chassis with East Lancashire Coachbuilders bodies, were added in 1951.|$|E

Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol-engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s. The PS2 followed the PD2 Titan in having the 125 bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine and a new synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous different versions of the home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear dropped frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17 ft 6 in wheelbase for 27 ft 6 in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18 ft 9 in for 30 ft long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|E
