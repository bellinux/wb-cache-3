40|$|Abstract Background Transmissible spongiform {{encephalopathy}} describes {{a family of}} diseases affecting both man and animals. Current tests for the diagnosis of these diseases {{are based on the}} detection of an abnormal misfolded form of the host protein PrP which is found within the central nervous and <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>systems</b> of affected animals. Recently, concern that this marker may not be as reliable as previously thought, coupled with an urgentneed for a pre-clinical live animal test, has led to the search for alternative assays for the detection of TSE disease. Methods This "proof of concept" study, examines the use of differential protein expression profiling using surface enhanced laser desorption and ionisationtime of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF) for the diagnosis of TSE disease. Spectral output from all proteins selectively captured from individual murine brain homogenate samples, are compared as "profiles" in groups of infected and non-infected animals. Differential protein expression between groups is thus highlighted and statistically significant protein "peaks" used to construct a panel of disease specific markers. Studies at both terminal stages of disease and throughout the time course of disease have shown a disease specific protein profile or "disease fingerprint" which could be used to distinguish between groups of TSE infected and uninfected animals at an early time point of disease. Results Our results show many differentially expressed proteins in diseased and control animals, some at early stages of disease. Three proteins identified by SELDI-TOF analysis were verified by immunohistochemistry in brain tissue sections. We demonstrate that by combining the most statistically significant changes in expression, a panel of markers can be constructed that can distinguish between TSE diseased and normal animals. Conclusion Differential protein expression profiling {{has the potential to be}} used for the detection of disease in TSE infected animals. Having established that a "training set" of potential markers can be constructed, more work would be required to further test the specificity and sensitivity of the assay in a "testing set". Based on these promising results, further studies are being performed using blood samples from infected sheep to assess the potential use of SELDI-TOF as a pre-mortem blood based diagnostic. </p...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was evaluation of the frequency and epidemiologic data of Lymphoma in Hamadan. Materials & Methods: In this retrospective study, all documented files of malignancies in four teaching hospitals of Hamadan (Mobasher, Sina, Ekbatan, Imam Khomeini) during 1993 - 2003 were evaluated. Results: Through 350000 hospital files and 3500 cases of malignancies, 404 cases were Lymphomas. (11 / 5 %) [285 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), 111 Hodgkin diseases (HD), 8 Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) ]. Males had a higher incidence of types of Lymphoma (male â€“ to female ratio was 1. 6 : 1).

40|$|The {{component}} {{cells of}} peripheral lymphoid tissue have been divided into the lymphocyte and plasma cell lines, mononuclear phagocytic cells, dendritic "reticular cells", the reticular (supporting) cells and endothelial cells, {{and it is}} suggested that this system of cells should collectively be referred to as the <b>lymphoreticular</b> monoclear phagocyte <b>system</b> or LRMPS. Seventeen tumours of the LRMPS (excluding Hodgkin's disease) have been studied at ultrastructural level. Of these 17 non-Hodgkin lymphomata 5 were follicular lymphomata and 12 diffuse. It is concluded that electron microscopy plays a valuable role in the diagnosis of this group of tumours. Not only does it allow rejection of a diagnosis of lymphoma in certain anaplastic tumours, but it also enables a more precise identification of the cellular components of a lymphoma as well as indicating the degree of differentiation of the cell line involved. Additional advantages are the visualization of subcellular structures useful as markers, and by means of specialized immunoelectron microscopic techniques the identification of antigens and antibody formation within a given tumour.

40|$|Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a {{transmissible}} {{spongiform encephalopathy}} of cervids, remains prevalent in North American elk, white-tailed deer and mule deer. A natural case of CWD in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) has not been reported despite potential habitat overlap with CWD-infected deer or elk herds. This study investigates the experimental transmission of CWD from elk or white-tailed deer to reindeer by the oral route of inoculation. Ante-mortem testing of the three reindeer exposed to CWD from white-tailed deer identified the accumulation of pathological PrP (PrP(CWD)) in the recto-anal {{mucosa associated lymphoid tissue}} (RAMALT) of two reindeer at 13. 4 months post-inoculation. Terminal CWD occurred in the two RAMALT-positive reindeer at 18. 5 and 20 months post-inoculation while one other reindeer in the white-tailed deer CWD inoculum group and none of the 3 reindeer exposed to elk CWD developed disease. Tissue distribution analysis of PrP(CWD) in CWD-affected reindeer revealed widespread deposition in central and peripheral nervous <b>systems,</b> <b>lymphoreticular</b> tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, neuroendocrine tissues and cardiac muscle. Analysis of prion protein gene (PRNP) sequences in the 6 reindeer identified polymorphisms at residues 2 (V/M), 129 (G/S), 138 (S/N) and 169 (V/M). These findings demonstrate that (i) a sub-population of reindeer are susceptible to CWD by oral inoculation implicating the potential for transmission to other Rangifer species, and (ii) certain reindeer PRNP polymorphisms may be protective against CWD infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the prion agent in skeletal muscle {{is thought to be}} due to the infection of nerve fibers located within the muscle. We report here that the pathological isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, accumulates within skeletal muscle cells, in addition to axons, in the tongue of hamsters following intralingual and intracerebral inoculation of the HY strain of the transmissible mink encephalopathy agent. Localization of PrPSc to the neuromuscular junction suggests that this synapse is a site for prion agent spread between motor axon terminals and muscle cells. Following intracerebral inoculation, the majority of PrPSc in the tongue was found in the lamina propria, where it was associated with sensory nerve fibers in the core of the lingual papillae. PrPSc staining was also identified in the stratified squamous epithelium of the lingual mucosa. These findings indicate that prion infection of skeletal muscle cells and the epithelial layer in the tongue can be established following the spread of the prion agent from nerve terminals and/or axons that innervate the tongue. Our data suggest that ingestion of meat products containing prion-infected tongue could result in human exposure to the prion agent, while sloughing of prion-infected epithelial cells at the mucosal surface of the tongue could be a mechanism for prion agent shedding and subsequent prion transmission in animals. In prion diseases, the prion agent is primarily found in the <b>lymphoreticular</b> and nervous <b>systems</b> (8, 23). In both natural an...|$|R

40|$|Background - Prion {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} the accumulation of the pathogenic PrPSc protein, mainly {{in the brain and}} the <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>system.</b> Although prions multiply/accumulate in the lymph nodes without any detectable pathology, transcriptional changes in this tissue may reflect biological processes that contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of prion diseases. Little is known about the molecular processes that occur in the <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>system</b> in early and late stages of prion disease. We performed a microarray-based study to identify genes that are differentially expressed at different disease stages in the mesenteric lymph node of sheep naturally infected with scrapie. Oligo DNA microarrays were used to identify gene-expression profiles in the early/middle (preclinical) and late (clinical) stages of the disease. Results - In the clinical stage of the disease, we detected 105 genes that were differentially expressed (= 2 -fold change in expression). Of these, 43 were upregulated and 62 downregulated as compared with age-matched negative controls. Fewer genes (50) were differentially expressed in the preclinical stage of the disease. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were largely associated with the following terms: glycoprotein, extracellular region, disulfide bond, cell cycle and extracellular matrix. Moreover, some of the annotated genes could be grouped into 3 specific signaling pathways: focal adhesion, PPAR signaling and ECM-receptor interaction. We discuss the relationship between the observed gene expression profiles and PrPSc deposition and the potential involvement in the pathogenesis of scrapie of 7 specific differentially expressed genes whose expression levels were confirmed by real time-PCR. Conclusions - The present findings identify new genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of natural scrapie infection in the <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>system,</b> and confirm previous reports describing scrapie-induced alterations in the expression of genes involved in protein misfolding, angiogenesis and the oxidative stress response. Further studies will be necessary to determine the role of these genes in prion replication, dissemination and in the response of the organism to this disease...|$|E

40|$|The thymus {{determines the}} {{spectrum}} of the receptor specificities of differentiating T cells for self-H- 2; however, the phenotypic expression of T cell's specificity for self plus virus is determined predominantly by the H- 2 type of the antigen presenting cells of the peripheral <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, virus specific helper T cells are essential for the generation of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells. For cooperation between mature T cells and other lymphocytes to be functional in chimeras, thymic epithelial cells and lymphohemopoietic stem cells must share the I region; killer T-cell generation also requires in addition compatibility {{for at least one}} K or D region. These conclusions derive from the following experiments: A leads to (A X B) F 1 chimeric lymphocytes do produce virus-specific cytotoxic T-cell activity for infected A but not for infected B cells; when sensitized in an acutely irradiated and infected recipient (A X B) F 1 these chimeric lymphocytes respond to both infected A and B. Therefore the predominantly immunogenically infected cells of chimeras the radiosensitive and by donor stem cells replaced lymphoreticular cells. In this adoptive priming model (KAIA/DB leads to KAIA/DC) chimeric lymphocytes could be sensitized in irradiated and infected F 1 against KA and DC but not against infected DB targets. In contrast KBIB/DA leads to KCIC/DA chimeras' lymphocytes could not be sensitized at all in appropriately irradiated and infected F 1 recipients. Thus these latter chimeras probably lack functional I-specific T helper cells that are essential for the generation of T killer cells against infected D compatible targets. If T cells learn in the thymus to recognize H- 21 or K, D markers that are not at least partially carried themselves in other cells of the <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>system</b> immunological interactions will be impossible and this paradox situation results in phenotypic immune incompetence in vivo...|$|E

Many TSEs are initiated by prion replication in the <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>system</b> (LRS). The cellular and molecular prerequisites for prion trafficking within the LRS are not fully understood. Here we have manipulated CD 40 and its ligand to investigate whether genetic or pharmacological ablation of germinal center B cells (GCBs), which migrate {{into and out of}} germinal centers, influences prion pathogenesis. In contrast to previous reports, no alteration of prion pathogenesis was detected in mice lacking CD 40 L and in mice treated with anti-CD 40 L antibodies. These results suggest that GCBs alone do not impact peripheral splenic prion transport, replication efficiency, or neuroinvasion, and point to other mechanisms affecting prion transport from lymphoreticular sites of replication to the nervous system...|$|E
40|$|The organs, tissues, and {{cells of}} the <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>system</b> have {{received}} considerable attention as targets for chemicals causing adverse effects. A basic toxicological approach is described for assessing {{the risk of a}} chemical perturbing the immune system. CD- 1 mice were exposed for 14 or 90 days to one of several chlorinated hydrocarbons: 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethylene or 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethylene. Other mice were exposed to dexamethasone, a known immunosuppressive agent. The immune system is evaluated against a background of the more standard toxicological parameters such as fluid consumption, body and organ weights, hematology, clinical chemistries, and blood coagulation. Reported here are the results for the male mice after 14 -day exposure to three chlorinated hydrocarbons and after 90 -day exposure to 1, 2 -dichloroethane and dexamethasone...|$|E
