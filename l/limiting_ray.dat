Source altitudes of VLF saucers are obtained from frequency-time spectra of VLF saucers by assuming the <b>limiting</b> <b>ray</b> model. The source distances of VLF saucers are less than about 800 km below the satellite. VLF saucers occur around the high-and low-latitude ends of the auroral hiss region. The active auroral hiss and the stable auroral hiss are classified according to the variability of the narrow-band intensity data processed from ISIS VLF tapes. The frequent occurrence region of the former agrees well with the usual auroral zone, while the latter occurs at invariant latitude from about 70 °to about 80 °both on {{the day and night}} sides. The properties of the stable auroral hiss have some similarities to those of the precipitating low-energy electrons, the so-called polar rain, in occurrence region and in intensity.

Our main result here states that these densities are Γ-ergodic with respect to an important subset of the limit set which we choose to call the “ray limit set”. In the particular case of uniform lattices and products of convex cocompact groups acting on the product of rank one symmetric spaces every limit point belongs to the <b>ray</b> <b>limit</b> set, hence our result is most powerful for these examples.

40|$|We {{present a}} new multithreaded {{implementation}} for the computationally demanding direct volume rendering (DVR) of volumetric datasets on desktop multicore processors using ray casting. The new implementation achieves interactive rendering of very large volumes, even on high resolution screens. Our implementation {{is based on}} a new algorithm that combines an object order traversal of the volumetric data followed by a focused ray casting. Using a very compact data structure, our method starts with a quick association of data subcubes with fine-grain screen tiles appearing along the viewing direction in front to back order. The next stage uses very <b>limited</b> <b>ray</b> casting on the generated sets of subcubes while skipping empty or transparent space and applying early ray termination in an effective way.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method for imaging shallow faults by {{migration}} of transmitted refraction arrivals. The {{assumption is that}} there is a significant velocity contrast across the fault boundary that is underlain by a refracting interface. This procedure, denoted as refraction migration with fault flooding, largely overcomes the difficulty in imaging shallow faults with seismic surveys. Numerical results successfully validate this method on three synthetic examples and two field-data sets. The first field-data set is next to the Gulf of Aqaba and the second example is from a seismic profile recorded in Arizona. The faults detected by refraction migration in the Gulf of Aqaba data were in agreement with those indicated in a P-velocity tomogram. However, a new fault is detected at the end of the migration image that is not clearly seen in the traveltime tomogram. This result is similar to that for the Arizona data where the refraction image showed faults consistent with those seen in the P-velocity tomogram, except it also detected an antithetic fault at the end of the line. This fault cannot be clearly seen in the traveltime tomogram due to the <b>limited</b> <b>ray</b> coverage...|$|R
40|$|One {{method of}} {{assessing}} the confidence in modeled features {{is to compare}} the results from different inversion schemes. I use synthetic traveltimes calculated from a model of an unconfined aquifer to determine the reliability of crosshole tomography. I compare the inverted models from straight and curved ray approximations to wave propagation. I investigate the effects of added random noise, regularization, the starting model, and the reference model on the curved ray inversion method. I also investigate the effects of different grid sizes for the forward model and of <b>limited</b> <b>ray</b> coverage through the earth model. Understanding {{the effects of these}} different methods and parameterizations will help place confidence limits on modeled features to more accurately reflect our knowledge of the subsurface. Straight or curved ray approximations to wave propagation resulted in similar models. However, the resolution estimates are substantially different and would lead to different assessments of the model reliability. Comparisons of the different choices for the model parameterization show that the resulting models are similar, indicating that tomography is a robust method. The most important factor to obtain reliable parameter estimates from crosshole radar tomography is to acquire wide aperture, densely sampled data with little noise...|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{tomography}} {{as used in}} {{the laboratory}} and {{in the field is}} strongly affected by <b>limited</b> and non-uniform <b>ray</b> coverage, and this will generally result in ill-posed inverse problems. In this study several regularization methods to improve inversion for non-uniform ray coverage are described. Inversions based on variable damping are tested and compared with inversions using simple damping. A two-stage autoregressive extrapolation technique is then proposed {{that can be used to}} extend the observed data and provide better tomographic images. The algorithm is based on the principle that the extrapolated data adds minimal information to the existing data. The first stage of the extrapolation is to find the optimal prediction-error filter (PE filter). The second stage is to use the PE filter to find the values of the missing data. The missing data are estimated to have the same spectrum as the observed data and this is similar to maximizing an entropy criterion. In order to test the method, synthetic and laboratory tomography experiments for rock samples are used in which full ray coverage can be obtained. Autoregressive methods are then used to extrapolate for partial ray coverage and the tomographic results are compared with the full ray coverage case. These tests show that the autoregressive method can extrapolate known data to find missing data as well as provide improved tomographic images. The autoregressive extrapolation is also tolerant to noise. Autoregressive methods may have important applications to tomography experiments in the field where it is often impossible to set up tomography experiments with perfect ray coverage. A synthetic field example using a cross-borehole geometry is performed and shows that autoregressive extrapolation can be applied to a <b>limited</b> <b>ray</b> coverage field geometry for seismic tomography. We finally applied travel-time tomography techniques to observed datasets recorded in the laboratory for rock samples. The results for these experiments show that for laboratory tomographic experiments, simple as well as complicated internal structures can be reconstructed. ...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{fluorescence}} in microscopy is a {{well known}} technology today. Due to the autofluorescence of the materials of the optical system components, the contrast of the images is degraded. The calculation of autofluorescense usually is performed by brute force methods as volume scattering. The efficiency of calculations {{in this case is}} extremely low and a huge number of rays must be calculated. In stray light calculations the concept of important sampling is used to reduce computational effort. The idea is to calculate only rays, which have the chance to reach the target surface. The fluorescence conversion can be considered to be a scatter process and therefore a modification of this idea is used here. The reduction factor is calculated by simply comparing in every z-plane of the lenses the size of the illuminated phase space domain with the corresponding acceptance domain. The boundaries of the domains are determined by simple tracing of the <b>limiting</b> <b>rays</b> of the light cone of the source as well as the pixel area under consideration. The small overlap of both domains can be estimated by geometrical considerations. The correct photometric scaling and the discretization of the volumes must be performed properly. Some necessary approximations produce negligible errors. The improvement in run time is in the range of 10 4. It is shown with some practical examples of microscopic lenses, that the results are comparable with conventional methods.

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} of lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) at high density on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak {{are presented in}} this paper. Bremsstrahlung emission from relativistic fast electrons in the core plasma drops suddenly above line-averaged densities of 10 [superscript 20][*]m[superscript − 3] (ω/ω[subscript LH] ~ 3) in single null discharges with large (≥ 8 [*]mm) inner gaps, well below the density limit previously observed on limited tokamaks (ω/ω[subscript LH] ~ 2). Modelling and experimental evidence suggest {{that the absence of}} LHCD driven fast electrons at high density may be due to parasitic collisional absorption in the scrape-off layer (SOL). Experiments show that the population of fast electrons produced by LHCD at high density ([bar over n][subscript e] > 10 [superscript 20] m[superscript - 3]) can be increased by operating with an inner gap of less than ~ 5 [*]mm with the strongest non-thermal emission in inner wall limited plasmas. A change in plasma topology from single to double null produces a modest increase in non-thermal emission at high density. Increasing the electron temperature in the periphery of the plasma (0. 8 > r/a > 1. 0) also results in a modest increase in non-thermal electron emission above the density <b>limit.</b> <b>Ray</b> tracing/Fokker–Planck simulations of these discharges predict the observed sensitivity to plasma position when the effects of collisional absorption in the SOL are included in the model.
