This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it <b>look</b> <b>when</b> the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The tour {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jeffrey Haney of the Deseret News described {{the show as}} [...] "funky and flashy". A reporter from USA Today called Spears' performance [...] "assured and energetic". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News pointed out that Spears seemed to have two personas during the show, one when singing songs from her album and a more edgy <b>look</b> <b>when</b> singing the covers. He also added that [...] "Spears' nods to edginess no doubt reflects her desire to grow into a more mature career". Jane Ganahl of the San Francisco Chronicle said that [...] "she may be somewhat entertaining, but she's also just another prefab act – longer on packaging than actual talent".|$|E
500|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} a change in Nico's <b>look,</b> <b>when</b> she adopted {{what has been called}} a [...] "gothic horror princess" [...] persona and [...] "switched from dyed blonde to dark henna and started wearing black, heavy fabrics and boots". As a result, in {{addition}} to being a musical prototype for the goth subculture, Nico became a visual one as well. Claire Marie Healy wrote, [...] "Nico's visual statement of these years speaks of the power that comes with creating a new persona for yourself" [...] and she described the singer as [...] "the first ever goth girl". By the early 1980s, many women began to dress like Nico; nicknamed [...] "Nico-teens", they were the first goth girls, encouraging a cult following for the singer.|$|E

It is initially white before turning brownish gray and eventually blackish in age. The cap margin is curved inward {{throughout most of the}} life of the fruit body. The cap cuticle can be peeled up to one-half the radius of the cap. The flesh is white, but slowly stains reddish then grayish-black after being exposed to air. This characteristic staining reaction can be slow to develop, or may not develop at all, especially in old fruit bodies where the underlying tissue has already darkened. The flesh has no distinctive odor, and a hot, bitter taste.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Henery Wise {{who visited}} Lahaina Fort, where the then {{governor}} was residing, noted: “ a large square enclosure constructed of red coral rocks, banked up fifteen feet with earth , and mounting an oddly resorted battery of some thirty pieces of artillery, {{of all sorts}} of cartridges , and claibre long, short, and medium; they commanded the usual anchorage and no doubt very well to prevent any acts of violence from merchant ships; but it is a question, if, at the second discharging of shot, they do not tremble to pieces.

500|$|VistaVision cameras {{installed}} with {{motion control}} technology {{were used for}} the photography of the live-action scenes which would be composited with animation. Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman and the Weasels would portray the animated characters during rehearsals in order to teach the actors where to <b>look</b> <b>when</b> acting with [...] "open air and imaginative cartoon characters". Many of the live-action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with either robotic arms holding the props or the props were manipulated by strings, similar to a marionette. The voice of Roger, Charles Fleischer, insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set, in order to get into character. Filming began on December 2, 1986, and lasted for seven months at Elstree Studios, with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for blue screen effects of Toontown. The entrance of Desilu Studios served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot.|$|E

[...] "Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character. When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him [...] "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999). After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth [...] "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970).

Lehman's built most of this addition inside an 1849 barn moved from Orrville, Ohio, and reassembled at the store site, using the original hand-hewn timbers and wooden pegs. Lehman's asked an Amish-staffed construction company to perform the deconstruction and reconstruction to honor the store's Amish heritage and give the structure the same integrity as it had when first built.

2500|$|In {{the prologue}} of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Jones {{is seen as}} a teenager, {{establishing}} his <b>look</b> <b>when</b> given a fedora hat. Indiana's intentions are revealed as prosocial, as he believes artifacts [...] "belong in a museum." [...] In the film's climax, Indiana undergoes [...] "literal" [...] tests of faith to retrieve the Grail and save his father's life. He also remembers Jesus as a historical figure – a humble carpenter – rather than an exalted figure when he recognizes the simple nature and tarnished appearance of the real Grail amongst a large assortment of much more ornately decorated ones. Henry Senior rescues his son from falling to his death when reaching for the fallen Grail, telling him to [...] "let it go," [...] overcoming his mercenary nature. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles explains how Indiana becomes solitary and less idealistic following his service in World War I. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Jones is older and wiser, whereas his sidekicks Mutt and Mac are youthfully arrogant and greedy, respectively.|$|E

[...] An ArtForum reviewer noted that the costume and pose of one drawing was a [...] "nearly identical copy" [...] of a Feinstein photograph in a Marc Jacobs advertisement {{from the year before}} and that the elderly model in fact looked much like Ms. Feinstein might <b>look</b> <b>when</b> she aged. The reviewer wrote the [...] "(self-)portraits" [...] felt [...] "in line with the current vogue for noble iconography" [...] and also described them as [...] "celebratory caricatures, self-indulgent and vain."
