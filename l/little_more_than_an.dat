5|$|The film premiered on June 19, 1998, in the United States, and {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. Although some enjoyed {{the style and}} effects of the film, others found the plot confusing and viewed it as <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> extended episode of the series. A sequel, entitled , was released ten years later.|$|E
5|$|To {{the left}} of the open space north of the medieval city are the steep {{southern}} slopes of the Brunkebergsåsen esker, a geological feature whose remains still stretch north through the city. Missing in the painting is the small island of Strömsborg, which was <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> insignificant cliff at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> extravagant nail in Price Brothers' coffin. The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, mostly to the interior of the building.|$|E

After <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour of fighting, however, the Canadians {{were forced to}} call the attack off. In the afternoon, the two heavily depleted companies of the Royal 22e Régiment fought off a large German counterattack on Casa Berardi, with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery firing 5,398 rounds in support of Canadian forces.|$|E
5|$|Decay {{was not a}} {{critical}} success, but was received with some positivity by video game journalists. Many reviewers felt the game was fun to play through with a friend, but that its more puzzle-oriented gameplay somewhat detracted from the overall experience. A number of reviews stated that the game simply felt <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> extra add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Soay has a {{primitive}} hut known as Taigh Dugan (Dugan's house). This is <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> excavated hole under a huge stone with two rude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from Lewis {{who came to}} St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar Mòr, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} given to the creek by Spanish explorers in the 18th century, {{although}} there are now many places in California that use the name. Historically, the creek served as the boundary between the Juaneño (Acjachemem) and Gabrieleño (Tongva) Indians. The creek's watershed then became a major portion of the 1842 Rancho Niguel Mexican Land Grant to Juan Avila, later purchased by two American ranchers. Although attempts to use the creek and its watershed as a municipal water source date to the early 20thcentury, the water it provided was of poor quality and erratic occurrence. As a result, the creek became neglected throughout the late part of the century, eventually becoming <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> open wastewater drain. Despite this general decline, the Aliso Creek watershed still supports some biodiversity, and it remains a popular recreational area.|$|E
5|$|Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's {{favourite}} {{and a man}} who {{had great}} influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. The Infanta thought Charles was <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws, which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.|$|E

In c.1781 the facade was decorated with tufa by the Marchioness of Buckingham. Her son the 1st Duke of Buckingham turned it into her memorial by adding the inscription Mater Amata, Vale!

25|$|The South Circular Road {{was in the}} 1960s, {{and remains}} still, <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> {{arbitrary}} route through the southern half of the city following roads that are mainly just single carriageway. The road planners considered the existing routing unsuitable for a direct upgrade so a new replacement motorway was planned for a route further to the south where the road could be constructed with less destruction of local communities.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Berdella saw {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of the John Fowles book The Collector.

After several weeks, the female captive dies of a contracted illness despite her captor's efforts to keep her alive. Berdella later stated this movie had formed a lasting impression on him.|$|E
