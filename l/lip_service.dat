The population for the study was determined using stratified random method of sampling. A total of 150 questionnaires were administered over a twelve month period.

40|$|International {{courts and}} tribunals are fond of paying <b>lips</b> <b>service</b> {{to the fact that}} Articles 31 - 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) reflect {{customary}} international law. This allows them to draw inspiration from the text of the VCLT even in cases where a treaty that is being interpreted was concluded either before 1980 (the date of entry into force of the VCLT), or between parties that are not parties to the VCLT. This fiction may be useful for relatively recent treaties but the question is whether it can hold water in situations where the treaties being interpreted are from the early 20 th, 19 th century or even earlier. The present Chapter examines, whether the customary rules of interpretation can indeed be considered to have remained relatively unchanged through the ages, as was briefly suggested in Kasikili/Sedudu, or whether international {{courts and tribunals}} sometimes when interpreting old treaties apply the wrong rules of interpretation in clear contravention of the non-retroactivity principle...|$|R

25|$|Descartes saw his Meditations as {{providing}} the metaphysical underpinning {{of his new}} physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn {{what he saw as}} two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes' day placed a great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator's suggestion that all one's most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will be reading the Meditations. The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay <b>lip</b> <b>service</b> to the orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded.|$|E
25|$|Unions {{have made}} some {{attempts}} to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing {{is not a new}} phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change. Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay <b>lip</b> <b>service</b> to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.|$|E

Structured questionnaire was designed and administered on construction professionals (Architects, Quantity Surveyors, Builders and Civil Engineers).

ABSTRACT: The issue of serious food and nutrition problem is now commonly associated with less developed countries. Food is understood as involving interconnected domains with questions of agriculture, socio-political, market and distribution, employment, ecological, roles of women and just to mention a few. It is surprising {{that most of the}} problems which international institutions like the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization, Economic Commission for Africa, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, International Fund for Agricultural Development and governments of developed countries have to deal with supporting the developing countries {{in the last two decades}} have revolved around the inability of agricultural sector to provide adequate food and nutrition for their populations. Nigeria government has only been paying <b>lips</b> <b>service</b> to the issue of food security as it is evident in weak policy making in the area of agriculture. For Nigeria to achieve food security, different challenges like political, social, ecological/climate change, institutional weakness, the role of women in food production among others must be taken seriously. It is recommended that all the stakeholders in agriculture: policy makers, scientists, extension workers and farmers be brought together to discuss the challenges confronting food production/security and forage the way forward.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of Philosophy. The multiplier effect of the construction industry to both developed and developing countries cannot be overemphasised. The 2012 construction sector review purports that the UK construction industry has an annual turnover of more than £ 100 billion and accounts for 10 per cent of the country’s GDP. In contrast Nigeria, which is urbanising at one of the fastest rates in the world, contributes only 3. 2 per cent in terms of Gross Domestic Product. In other words, the contributions of the construction industry warrants persistent review of its gaps; risk and uncertainty are particularly rife in most Nigerian construction projects, and the cost implications are severe enough to influence its low GDP contribution and beyond. The aim of this research effort is to understand the competitive advantage (value chain) of enshrining risk management practices up and down the construction supply chain. A literature review was first conducted to identify and categorise different risk management practices on and off a construction site. In turn, the population for the study was determined using stratified random method of sampling. The units of analysis in this case study are contractual interfaces and organisational structure, of which there can be hundreds in a typical case. After an initial scoping study – the administering of 150 questionnaires – of risk management practices amongst general contractors. Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted across a typical value chain. Drawing on principles of grounded theory, interview transcripts were analysed through a combination of content analysis and graphical representation of contractual and organisational structures. Clients and contractors were found to be risk averse even though they claimed to have formal written procedures for risk management. Their awareness of the importance of risk management in construction business is more of <b>lip</b> <b>services.</b> A graphical representation of the Nigerian contractual structure, supply chain and value chain was achieved. Consequently, a conceptual model is developed for enshrining risk management practices in developing countries.
