25|$|The thumb <b>lug</b> <b>on</b> the Umnumzaan is {{used for}} opening the knife blade, as well as serving as the stop pin that {{contacts}} the titanium handle slabs upon lockup. Around each lug is a polyurethane o-ring {{that acts as a}} shock absorber to cushion the shock of opening, and reduce the audible noise of opening. The use of the shock absorber concept was pioneered by knife designers Grant and Gavin Hawk, and is being implemented in the Umnumzaan with their consent.|$|E
2500|$|The lockback's {{blade locking}} {{mechanism}} is a refinement of the slipjoint design; both utilize a strong backspring located {{along the back}} of the knife. [...] However, the lockback design incorporates a hook or <b>lug</b> <b>on</b> the backspring, which snaps into a corresponding notch on the blade's heel when the blade is fully opened, locking the blade into position. [...] Closing the blade requires the user to apply pressure to the bar spring located towards the rear of the knife handle to disengage the hook from the notch and thus release the blade.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Planetary rovers play a {{significant}} role in surface explorations on the Moon and/or Mars. However, because of wheel slippage, the wheels of planetary rovers can get stuck in loose soil, and the exploration mission may fail because of this situation. To avoid slippage and increase the wheels’ drawbar pull, the wheels of planetary rovers typically have parallel fins called <b>lugs</b> <b>on</b> their surface. In this study, we conducted experiments using two-wheeled testbeds in a sandbox to provide a quantitative confirmation of the influence of <b>lugs</b> <b>on</b> the traversability of planetary rovers. In this paper, we report the results of the experiments, and discuss the influence of <b>lugs</b> <b>on</b> the traversability of planetary rovers. I...|$|R

2500|$|The arquebus, {{derived from}} the German Hackenbüchse, {{was a form of}} handgun that {{appeared}} in Germany during the late 15th century. Although the term arquebus was applied to many different forms of firearms from the 15th to 17th centuries, it was originally used to describe [...] "a hand-gun with a hook-like projection or <b>lug</b> <b>on</b> its under surface, useful for steadying it against battlements or other objects when firing." [...] These [...] "hook guns" [...] were in their earliest forms defensive weapons mounted on German city walls in the early 1400s, but by the late 1400s had transitioned into handheld firearms, with heavier variants known as [...] "muskets" [...] that were fired from resting Y-shaped supports appearing by the early 1500s. The musket was able to penetrate all forms of armor available at the time, making armor obsolete, and as a consequence the heavy musket as well. Although there is relatively little to no difference in design between arquebus and musket except in size and strength, it was the term musket which remained in use up into the 1800s. It may not be completely inaccurate to suggest that the musket was in its fabrication simply a larger arquebus. At least on one occasion the musket and arquebus have been used interchangeably to refer to the same weapon, and even referred to as an [...] "arquebus musket." [...] A Habsburg commander in the mid-1560s once referred to muskets as [...] "double arquebuses." [...] The definition of arquebus and similar firearms is therefore quite convoluted as the term has been applied to different sorts of firearms as well as acquiring several names like hackbut, harquebus, schiopo, sclopus, tüfenk, tofak, matchlock, and firelock. Some say that the hackbut was a forerunner of the arquebus.|$|E

50|$|Motorcycles {{typically}} {{employ a}} wet clutch with the clutch {{riding in the}} same oil as the transmission. These clutches are usually {{made up of a}} stack of alternating plain steel and friction plates. Some plates have <b>lugs</b> <b>on</b> their inner diameters that lock them to the engine crankshaft. Other plates have <b>lugs</b> <b>on</b> their outer diameters that lock them to a basket that turns the transmission input shaft. A set of coil springs or a diaphragm spring plate force the plates together when the clutch is engaged.|$|R
5000|$|Rotating bolt is {{a method}} of locking used in firearms. Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse {{developed}} the first rotating bolt firearm, the [...] "Dreyse needle gun" [...] in 1836. The Dreyse locked using the bolt handle rather than <b>lugs</b> <b>on</b> the bolt head like the Mauser M 98 or M16. The first rotating bolt rifle with two <b>lugs</b> <b>on</b> the bolt head was the Lebel Model 1886 rifle. The concept has been implemented on most firearms chambered for high powered cartridges since the 20th century.|$|R

5000|$|Both the Model 915 and Model 910 {{were made}} with only one safety/decocker lever (left side) {{in order to save}} costs. The Model 915 was made with {{all-metal}} parts, while the follow-on Model 910 substituted a plastic rear sight, plastic recoil guide rod, and plastic magazine release button to further save on manufacturing expenses. [...] The earlier Model 915 also reportedly has a <b>lug</b> <b>on</b> the barrel and a corresponding cut in the slide for tighter lock up. The later 910 has no <b>lug</b> <b>on</b> the barrel, nor a slide cut, reportedly affecting its inherent accuracy compared to the earlier 915. Both models have a reputation as reliable and robust.|$|E
