2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a <b>ladderway</b> was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E
50|$|The {{mine was}} worked by a main shaft, which {{followed}} the dip of the vein. The shaft was rectangular, {{divided into three}} compartments, the middle one being the <b>ladderway,</b> and those on either side being used respectively for winding ore and for the pump and the compressed air pipes. The ore would be wound up in a rough wooden kibble.|$|E
50|$|This was a collier's hamlet {{near the}} Maich Water. The Loch Riggs Colliery was {{abandoned}} in 1808 when the works were flooded. The rich coal seams ran under the loch and were never further exploited. In 1900 the old colliery waste was encountered by the navvies during {{the construction of}} the railway between Lochwinnoch and Kilbirnie. A nearby road was locally known as the 'Back-Stair-Heid' and {{it has been suggested that}} this refers to the location of a pit <b>ladderway</b> used to carry coal out of the mines before winding engines were in use.|$|E
60|$|Timothy Lumpy {{seemed to}} have no {{difference}} of opinion with his friend on that point. Indeed the other sixty-eight boys seemed to be marvellously united in sentiment about it, for, without an exception, they responded to that dinner-bell with a promptitude quite equal to that secured by military discipline! There was a rattling of feet on decks and <b>ladderways</b> for a few seconds, and then all was quiet while a blessing was asked on the meal.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} collapse, a miner named Alfred Maki descended the shaft and heard {{signals from the}} men trapped inside. Over the next five days, rescuers began digging from the {{neighboring}} [...] "H" [...] shaft {{to try to reach}} the trapped miners. They descended first to nearly the bottom of [...] "H" [...] shaft, where a tunnel connected the two shafts, and then began working their way up the <b>ladderway</b> of [...] "G" [...] shaft. On the fifth day, they were able to reach the trapped miners. According to news reports, the first rescuer to reach them asked what they wanted most, and when they replied that they wanted tobacco, he supplied them with a cigar.|$|E

So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90 Fathom Level, at a point 33 yd south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still 4 fathom m short of the 120 Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFire {{detector}} {{plays an}} important role in ship fire safety system. Usually, there are two types of fire detectors including fire smoke detector and heat detector, which are widely used in exit passageway, corridor, <b>ladderway,</b> and other long and narrow spaces in ship. Due to the smoke plume characteristics in these limited spaces are different to that of free plume in open place, the detection time calculating model of heat detector for these two different conditions are consequently different. This work is to develop a new detection time calculating model based on the fire plume rules including characteristics of temperature and velocity of fire smoke distributing in long and narrow spaces. Numeric method for calculating detection time is also presented. Finally, some calculations and analysis for a given fire scenario are performed. The numeric results are compared with that of the existing detection time calculating model based on free plume theory, which demonstrate the applicability of the model proposed in this article...|$|E
