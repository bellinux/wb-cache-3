5000|$|Embassy Court was {{the first}} {{building}} in England to feature penthouse suites. Other pioneering features included open-fronted balconies, lock-up garages and what the original managing agents Dudley Samuel and Harrison described as [...] "sun-admitting Vista-Glass sun parlours". Many of the [...] "sun rooms" [...] have been integrated into the flats to create extra living space. Another unique feature was a mural by Edward McKnight Kauffer in the foyer. It was created by a new method in which a series of black-and-white photographs were printed on a <b>light-sensitive</b> cellulose <b>surface.</b> The flats had built-in steel-framed tubular furniture (manufactured by Pel Ltd) and woodwork by D. Burkle & Son.|$|R
5000|$|A {{photograph}} or {{photo is}} an image created by light falling on a <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>surface,</b> usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word [...] "photograph" [...] was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel {{and is based on}} the Greek φῶς (phos), meaning [...] "light", and γραφή (graphê), meaning [...] "drawing, writing", together meaning [...] "drawing with light".|$|E
5000|$|Typically, a lens {{is used to}} {{repeatedly}} {{focus the}} light reflected from objects into real images on the <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> inside a camera during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion {{is a series of}} invisible latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically [...] "developed" [...] into a visible image. The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.|$|E

5000|$|A tablet of lithographic {{limestone}} called a [...] "litho stone" [...] was {{coated with a}} <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> composed of {{a thin layer of}} purified bitumen dissolved in benzene. A reversed halftone negative was then pressed against the coating and exposed to daylight (ten to thirty minutes in summer, up to several hours in winter), causing the bitumen to harden in proportion to the amount of light passing through each portion of the negative. Then a solvent such as turpentine was applied to remove the unhardened bitumen and retouch the tonal scale, strengthening or softening tones as required. Thus the image became imprinted on the stone in bitumen. Each tint was applied using a separate stone that bore the appropriate retouched image. The finished print was produced using at least six, but more commonly ten to fifteen, tint stones.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of photographic three-color prints on paper was pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron, whose comprehensive 1868 French patent also included the basic concepts {{of most of}} the color photographic processes which were subsequently developed. For making the three color-filtered negatives required, he was able to develop materials and methods which were not as completely blind to red and green light as those used by Thomas Sutton in 1861, but they were still very insensitive to those colors. Exposure times were impractically long, the red or orange-filtered negative requiring hours of exposure in the camera. His earliest surviving color prints are [...] "sun prints" [...] of pressed flowers and leaves, each of the three negatives having been made without a camera by exposing the <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> to direct sunlight passing first through a color filter and then through the vegetation. His first attempts were based on the red-yellow-blue colors then used for pigments, with no color reversal. Later he used the primary colors of light with color reversal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1829, Niépce {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} with Louis Daguerre, who was also seeking a means of creating permanent photographic images with a camera. Together, they developed the physautotype, an improved process that used lavender oil distillate as the photosensitive substance. The partnership lasted until Niépce's death in 1833, after which Daguerre continued to experiment, eventually working out a process that only superficially resembled Niépce's. He named it the [...] "daguerréotype", after himself. In 1839 {{he managed to get}} the government of France to purchase his invention on behalf of the people of France. The French government agreed to award Daguerre a yearly stipend of 6,000 Francs {{for the rest of his}} life, and to give the estate of Niépce 4,000 Francs yearly. This arrangement rankled Niépce's son, who claimed Daguerre was reaping all the benefits of his father's work. In some ways, he was right—for many years, Niépce received little credit for his contribution. Later historians have reclaimed Niépce from relative obscurity, and it is now generally recognized that his [...] "heliography" [...] was the first successful example of what we now call [...] "photography": the creation of a reasonably light-fast and permanent image by the action of light on a <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> and subsequent processing.|$|E

40|$|Presencing Place is {{the inaugural}} {{exhibition}} {{of a newly}} formed North East artist collective Land/Space/Place opening 22 February 2014 for four weeks. The group is comprised of post-graduate research students and staff from Northumbria University and University of Sunderland, who have come together to explore convergent themes within their research projects that broadly investigate contemporary cultural uses of space. Curator Suzy O’Hara says “Presencing Place provides us with a route from the virtual world, where contemporary digital culture is rapidly altering the shape and nature of our everyday experiences and interactions, back to our physical, sensory landscapes’ Through a series of physical, intellectual and sensory explorations, we are invited to pause and take time to observe and respond to our material, natural environments. Each work presents a distinct artistic strategy that enables us to reflect and contemplate upon how we negotiate the physicality and experience the impact our presence has upon our surroundings. The exhibition {{is part of a}} pilot Graduate Art Programme, a seven month long programme run by Whistle Art Stop. Project co-ordinator Alison Raimes explains “The programme is committed to researching how to support and develop the North East arts graduates, and Haltwhistle provides a fitting context for the group’s first showcase. ” Each artist provides a unique perspective exploring our perception and experience of land, space and place. The accepted and often unquestioned authority imbibed in traditional maps is interrogated and challenged in the work of Clare Money. Through a series of techniques that involve pushing the maps fibrous structure past its tipping point and selectively erasing specific information, she investigates if the concealment or refocusing of data can result in alternative clarities or the underlying nature of the land to emerge. Paul Goodfellow seeks to ground his experience and artistic practice in the physical, psychological and sublime landscape. For this work, he draws upon his past career in environmental research and adopts a process known as ‘ground-truthing’. This involves mapping changes in the landscape through the intepretation of satellite images and physically walking in these areas to build up a sense of how these abstract colours related to the place. By logging key information about the physical landscape during a series of ‘System Walks’, and visually interpretating the data produced, he creates what he describes as ‘Systems Art’. As most of these ‘systems’ relate, on some level to landscape, walking in the landscape and a ‘sense of place’ The images to emerge from his ‘Systems Walks’ highlight the dramatic impact that the spatial and temporal fluidity of the Internet and networked information has had on our relationship and understanding of the complex nature of space. Agnieszka Kozlowska experiments in the medium of photography and is driven by a fascination with the moment of photographic exposure, when a tangible link is formed between the <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> and the physical world. By constructing primitive cameras, using historical photographic processes and making paper, she explores the status of a photograph as a physical trace rather than purely an image. Kozlowska is interested in how such unique photographic objects affected by rays of light reflected off the scene in front of the lens can signify that which escapes pictorial representation, for example embodied perception of the environment or durational experience of long distance walking. Through a series of photographic objects, she proposes that photography, a natural phenomenon that takes place essentially independently of human intervention, can be a tool for representing what some cultural geographers have termed the ‘more-than-human’, sensuous dimensions of our interaction with the surrounding world. Jude Thomas creates momentary opportunities for reflection and contemplation by carving out space to breathe and escape. These spaces or pauses give permission to encounter and to recognise creativity. The work reflects her sense of awe of what is beyond us, what controls us and shapes the world we live in, the space of weather, of climate, of light. Thomas recognises that instead of skimming across and through the world, we need time to observe and be responsive, somewhere to contain the chaos. Thomas is interested in the layers of space presented by the sky, weather, light, land and thoughts. Through quiet contemplation of the physical object (the natural environment), she understands that nature offers us a sense of release yet also confronts us with challenge, friction and a sense of the unknown. Katie McGown work examines the translation of architectural structures into fabric forms to investigate the potential for urban spaces to be adapted to individual desire. She explores the nature of shelter and construction and how we conceive of the buildings and space around us and imagined rearrangements of the spaces and forms that hold and contain our lives. McGown draws upon personal experiences of moving to a new town, and reimaging a pretty little park whose manicured lawns and panoramic views obscure a history of windmills, plane crashes and plague pits. Her work imagines the missing foundations of past homes through repeated images of fabric blocks photographed on the site, shifting from whole shapes to fragments over the two panels. Lucy Livingstone explores the relationship between narrative and space. Using performance, site-specific installation, video screenings, photography and animation to examine philosophical questions about how we negotiate our environment and how spatial relationships are constructed through, and mediated by, cultural, political and economic imperatives. Drawing on a rich history of walking artists, which emerged from the literary lineage of Edgar Allen Poe and Walter Benjamin, and manifested in the Dadaist, The Surrealists and the Situationalists, she has developed a strategy of ‘getting lost’ on immersive walks. Her walks document the environment through lens based and aural recordings, using the material to create re-presentations of the sites.
