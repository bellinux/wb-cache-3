5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> {{earthquake}} also damaged {{some of the}} Quad buildings. Language Corner and Geology Corner {{were closed}} for repairs {{for more than five}} years; most of that time was spent negotiating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency over paying for the repairs. Memorial Church was also damaged but was repaired more quickly via private donations.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is a fireboat {{owned by}} State of California and {{operated}} {{by the city of}} San Francisco in the San Francisco Bay since 1955. Phoenix is known for helping to save Marina District buildings from further destruction by fire following the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake. Her worthy assistance resulted in a second vintage fireboat obtained for the city. Both Guardian and Phoenix are based at Firehouse No. 35 at Pier 22½ of the Port of San Francisco. Phoenix often leads parades of ships, and takes part in welcoming ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, {{purchasing}} it in 1945, {{and using}} it for sparkling wine production from 1950 to 1989. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, {{and the costs of}} seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights to the Christian Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{the ride}} {{received}} a new {{coat of paint}} with Victorian-style architecture around the station. In the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake, the Giant Dipper was almost completely untouched. The ride was closed {{for about a month}} to be inspected. The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake. In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{funds for}} the ferry system, reliant on gas taxes raised by the state, were {{left out of the}} 1989 budget because of a dispute in the state government. As a result, the MV Tyee and two {{additional}} passenger-only ferries intended to serve Vashon Island were pulled from service in June 1989. The three ferries were loaned to the San Francisco Bay Area after the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake left the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge closed for repairs. In January 1990, the ferries returned to the Seattle area, and began regular passenger service on April 23, 1990.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's damage, President George Bush {{declared}} five {{counties in}} Maine, seven counties in Massachusetts, and Rockingham County, New Hampshire to be disaster areas. The declaration {{allowed for the}} affected residents to apply for low-interest repair loans. New Jersey governor Jim Florio requested a declaration for portions of the coastline, but the request was denied because of the funding needs of other disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo, Hurricane Bob, and the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake. The American Red Cross opened service centers in four locations in Massachusetts to assist the storm victims by providing food, clothing, medicine, and shelter. The agency deployed five vehicles carrying cleanup units and food, and allocated $1.4 million to provide assistance to 3,000 families.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, {{and the future of the}} stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E
5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, in {{the middle}} of the World Series match between two Bay Area {{baseball}} teams, the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake struck and caused widespread infrastructural damage, including the failure of the Bay Bridge, a major link between San Francisco and Oakland. Even so, the Bay Area's technology industry continued to expand and growth in Silicon Valley accelerated that the United States Census confirmed that year that San Jose had overtaken San Francisco in terms of population. The commercialization of the Internet {{in the middle}} of the decade rapidly created a speculative bubble in the high-tech economy known as the Dot-com bubble. This bubble began collapsing in the early 2000s and the industry continued contracting for the next few years, nearly wiping out the market. Companies like Amazon.com and Google managed to weather the crash however, and following the industry's return to normalcy, their market value increased significantly.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area hosts an {{extensive}} freeway and highway {{system that is}} particularly prone to traffic congestion, with one study by Inrix concluding that the Bay Area's traffic was the fourth worst in the world. There are some city streets in San Francisco where gaps occur in the freeway system, partly {{the result of the}} Freeway Revolt, which prevented a freeway-only thoroughfare through San Francisco between the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the western terminus of Interstate 80, and the southern terminus of the Golden Gate Bridge (U.S. Route 101). Additional damage that occurred {{in the wake of the}} 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake resulted in freeway segments being removed instead of being reinforced or rebuilt, leading to the revitalization of neighborhoods such as San Francisco's Embarcadero. The greater Bay Area contains the three principal north-south highways in California: Interstate 5, U.S. Route 101, and California State Route 1. U.S. 101 and State Route 1 directly serve the traditional nine-county region, while Interstate 5 bypasses to the east in San Joaquin County to provide a more direct Los Angeles–Sacramento route. Additional local highways connect the various subregions of the Bay Area together.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} {{response}} to the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses. At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} brick {{buildings}} in Downtown Los Gatos were destroyed or seriously damaged in the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake, though the district was quickly rebuilt {{and has made}} a full recovery.|$|E
25|$|Oakland City Hall was {{evacuated}} {{after the}} 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake until 80M seismic retrofit and hazard abatement work was complete in 1995. City offices {{had to be}} housed in leased space and other locations.|$|E
25|$|On October 22, 1989, the San Francisco 49ers {{played a}} home {{game at the}} stadium against the New England Patriots, due to damage {{suffered}} to Candlestick Park following the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake five days earlier.|$|E
25|$|The Oakland Tribune won the Pulitzer Prize for a {{photograph}} of a small private plane narrowly missing a B-29 Superfortress in 1950, and again for photographs of the aftermath of the October 17, 1989, <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake.|$|E
25|$|One debated {{prediction}} {{came from}} the M8 algorithm used by Keilis-Borok and associates in four forecasts. The first of these forecasts missed both magnitude (M 7.5) and time (a five-year window from 1 January 1984, to 31 December 1988). They did get the location, by including most of California and half of Nevada. A subsequent revision, presented to the NEPEC, extended the time window to 1 July 1992, and reduced the location to only central California; the magnitude remained the same. A figure they presented had two more revisions, for M ≥ 7.0 quakes in central California. The five-year time window for one ended in July 1989, and so missed the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> event; the second revision extended to 1990, and so included <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{structures}} {{near the}} bay shore {{on either side}} would probably be severely affected by either a major Hayward Fault rupture or a nearby San Andreas Fault rupture. Severe effects were seen in both Oakland and northern San Francisco from the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake, even though this event was not extremely large and was centered a significant distance away in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the severe effects of that event were due to poorly responding soil conditions and design deficiencies in large structures. Only {{a portion of the}} structural deficiencies in the larger area have been addressed, and the surface motion effects of a large event are likely to be far more severe than seen in the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> event.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not officially}} a {{suspended}} game, {{the most notorious}} postponement of a World Series was the 1989 World Series in which the start of Game 3 was delayed ten days, the longest in World Series history, due to the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake striking the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake, the Cypress Street Viaduct {{double-deck}} segment of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1999. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta,</b> a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> {{earthquake}} {{was named}} for <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which lies just {{to the east of}} the mainshock epicenter. The duration of the heaviest shaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains was about 15 seconds, but strong ground motion recordings revealed that the duration of shaking was not uniform throughout the affected area (due to different types and thicknesses of soil). At sites with rocky terrain, the duration was shorter and the shaking was much less intense, and at locations with unconsolidated soil (like the Marina District or the Cypress Street Viaduct) the intensity of the shaking was more severe and lasted longer. The strong motion records also allowed for the causative fault to be determined – the rupture was related to the San Andreas Fault System.|$|E
25|$|The Key System's {{subsequent}} administrative headquarters building, {{built as}} the Security Bank and Trust Company Building in 1914, still exists at 1100 Broadway in downtown Oakland and is {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. The building suffered some damage in the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake and is currently unoccupied.|$|E
25|$|Before the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake, {{the freeway}} {{continued}} beyond Fell Street and then curved northeast, with the northbound side ending at a ramp to Golden Gate Avenue and Franklin Street, and the southbound level touching {{down to the}} northwest at Turk and Gough Streets. This land remains mainly undeveloped, filled primarily by parking lots.|$|E
25|$|After two {{previous}} failures, {{voters in the}} city passed a ballot measure in 2000 authorizing a bond measure for {{construction of a new}} library to replace the city's Carnegie library, damaged during the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake. The city also received state funds for the new library and opened the doors to the new facility in November 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} spans of {{the bridge}} east of Yerba Buena Island {{became the subject of}} concern after a section collapsed during the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake on October 17, 1989. The replacement span is engineered to withstand the largest earthquake expected over a 1500-year period, and it is expected to last at least 150 years with proper maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Pounding against {{adjacent}} building. This is {{a photograph}} of the collapsed five-story tower, St. Joseph's Seminary, Los Altos, California which resulted in one fatality. During <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake, the tower pounded against the independently vibrating adjacent building behind. A possibility of pounding depends on both buildings' lateral displacements which should be accurately estimated and accounted for.|$|E
25|$|Gulker {{moved to}} Menlo Park, CA, after the Herald-Examiner closed in 1989, {{and joined the}} San Francisco Examiner, where he {{initially}} served as picture editor and led the photography staff's transition from film to digital cameras. His work made possible an all-Macintosh-produced edition of The Examiner after the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake led to a power shutdown that idled the newspaper's publishing system.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century through the late 20th century, {{more than a third}} of the {{original}} bay was filled and often built on. The deep, damp soil in these areas is subject to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, and most of the major damage close to the Bay in the <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake of 1989 occurred to structures on these areas.|$|E
25|$|The Temple's {{buildings}} in Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Redwood Valley are intact, {{and some are}} used by church congregations. The Central Spanish Seventh-day Adventist Church is currently located at the Temple's former Los Angeles building at 1366 South Alvarado St. The Temple's former San Francisco headquarters (1859 Geary Blvd.) was destroyed in the 1989 <b>Loma</b> <b>Prieta</b> earthquake; the site is now occupied by a Post Office branch.|$|E
