5000|$|Burt {{works to}} {{commission}} {{although he has}} also designed pieces such as garden benches or public seating {{that can be made}} to order as 'standard' ranges. Some of his early commissions emphasised the playful dexterity of making wood do seemingly impossible things. A chair for an annual competition run by the arts development agency Southern Arts carried this exuberance to extremes, responding to a brief set by the organisation’s literature development officer to design and make a chair that has wit and speaks of its interest. Burt forced the idea of the essential framework or 'exo-skeleton' of a piece of furniture to the furthest point in his Ruminative Chair (1989) made of wych elm, English elm, burr elm and sycamore, replete with a floating seat pad, twisted stems, inlays, and moveable balls set at the ends of the arms, in a gothic-like seat. The chair was intended to make the impossible look plausible.This chair is about as close to postmodernism as Burt allows himself to get. He has focused more recently on a cleanliness of line and, sometimes, a subtle and sinuous curve (for example in the complex edge of his <b>Leaf</b> <b>Table</b> (2007) or the Pyramalised dresser 1. These designs combine dexterity of hand skill with the advances made possible by computer assisted drawing technology. In Burt’s view, using sophisticated equipment as a means of advancing practice is both plausible and efficient. He may find a wistful and reflective admiration for the honest toil and tools of the Arts and Crafts furniture makers, but his work has to survive in a challenging contemporary marketplace, and the high prices that are charged for this commissioned work necessarily take into account high labour and studio costs as well as the intensive design and fitting stages of complex pieces for sometimes mercurial clients. Good Woodworking magazine wrote: [...] "Today Matthew Burt is a recognised and well-respected brand, known for creating furniture that is neither gratuitously experimental or stagnantly nostalgic." ...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the clinical effect of pills of six ingredients with rehmannia combined with ginkgo biloba <b>leaf</b> <b>table</b> {{in the prevention}} and treatment of early retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS:A total of 82 patients(82 eyes) with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were treated with endoscopy from January 2013 to January 2015 were randomly divided into observation group and control group according to the random number table method. The control group was given conventional western medicine treatment, the observation group {{in the control group}} was given pills of six ingredients with rehmannia combined with ginkgo <b>leaf</b> <b>table</b> treatment besides the control group treatment. The diabetic retinopathy was assessed in both groups, as well as changes in blood glucose, blood pressure, and glycosylated hemoglobin. We recorded the occurrence of adverse reactions during and after treatment. RESULTS: The new diagnosed rate and the progress rate of observation group were lower than those of the control group, remission rate was higher, and the difference was statistically significant(P P > 0. 05). The incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups was not statistically significant(P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with pills of six ingredients with rehmannia combined with ginkgo biloba <b>leaf</b> <b>table</b> can effectively control the rate of retinopathy, the rate of progress, improve the rate of remission with high drug safety, and have the significance of further clinical research...|$|E
40|$|On a déterminé, par des dosages immunochimiques, la teneur en ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygénase (rubisco) de feuilles situées sur la tige {{principale}} de plantes ayant atteint le stade «liseré violet». En partant du haut de la tige, cette teneur augmente jusqu’à la feuille à l’aisselle de laquelle est située la première inflorescence au stade «liseré violet» (rang 0) puis décroît régulièrement jusque vers la base de la tige. La teneur en rubisco de la feuille de rang 0 a été déterminée, aux époques de récolte, sur 11 génotypes. Elle ne semble pas corrélée aux teneurs en matière sèche ou en azote de cette feuille mais varie entre 5 et 15 % de la teneur en matière sèche selon le cycle de récolte et le génotype. La teneur en rubisco augmente nettement entre le 1 er et le 2 e cycle puis reste sensiblement constante du 2 e au 4 e pour les types méditerranéens. Dans le cas des types flamands, on observe une teneur maximale marquée au 2 e ou au 3 e cycle. The {{content of}} ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) {{has been determined}} in leaves on the main stem of plants at the late budding stage by an immunochemical method. Starting from the stem top, the content of rubisco increases up to the leaf where the 1 st inflorescence at the late budding stage is located (0 level) and then decreases towards the oldest part of the main stem (table I). Rubisco content of the 0 level leaf has been determined at the cutting (late budding) stages in 11 populations of alfalfa (table II, fig 1). Rubisco content varies much more than dry matter or nitrogen, and varies more between cutting stages than between populations (table III). Rubisco content {{does not seem to}} be correlated with dry matter or nitrogen content of the 0 level <b>leaf</b> (<b>table</b> IV), but ranges between 5 and 15 % of the dry weight, depending on the population and on the cutting stage. The content of rubisco clearly increases from the first to the second cutting stage and remains nearly constant from the second to the fourth cutting stage in mediterranean type populations. With Flemish type populations, a maximum content is noted at the 2 nd or 3 rd cutting stage (fig 1). There is no simple correlation between these trends and the variations in climatic data (temperature, period of sunshine or radiation energy). Insofar as these results can be extended from a single leaf to the whole crop, they should have general consequences on the structure of plant nitrogen and on the way alfalfa is used for animal feeding, for dehydration or leaf protein extraction...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the impact of selected configuration parameters that govern multileaf collimator (MLC) transmission and rounded leaf offset in a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) (Pinnacle 3, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) on the accuracy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose calculation. The MLC leaf transmission factor was modified based on measurements made with ionization chambers. The table of parameters containing rounded-leaf-end offset values was modified by measuring the radiation field edge as a function of leaf bank position with an ionization chamber in a scanning water-tank dosimetry system and comparing the locations to those predicted by the TPS. The modified parameter values were validated by performing IMRT quality assurance (QA) measurements on 19 gantry-static IMRT plans. Planar dose measurements were performed with radiographic film and a diode array (MapCHECK 2) and compared to TPS calculated dose distributions using default and modified configuration parameters. Based on measurements, the leaf transmission factor was changed from a default value of 0. 001 to 0. 005. Surprisingly, this modification resulted in a small but statistically significant worsening of IMRT QA gamma-index passing rate, which revealed that the overall dosimetric accuracy of the TPS depends on multiple configuration parameters in a manner that is coupled and not intuitive because of the commissioning protocol used in our clinic. The rounded <b>leaf</b> offset <b>table</b> had little room for improvement, with the average difference between the default and modified offset values being − 0. 2 ± 0. 7 mm. While our results depend on the current clinical protocols, treatment unit and TPS used, the methodology used in this study is generally applicable. Different clinics could potentially obtain different results and improve their dosimetric accuracy using our approach...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{tremendous}} growth {{in the field of}} indoor and outdoor positioning sensors continuously producing huge volumes of trajectory data that has been used in many fields such as location-based services or location intelligence. Trajectory data is massively increased and semantically complicated, which poses a great challenge on spatio-temporal data indexing. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal data indexing method, named HBSTR-tree, which is a hybrid index structure comprising spatio-temporal R-tree, B*-tree and Hash table. To improve the index generation efficiency, rather than directly inserting trajectory points, we group consecutive trajectory points as nodes according to their spatio-temporal semantics and then insert them into spatio-temporal R-tree as <b>leaf</b> nodes. Hash <b>table</b> is used to manage the latest leaf nodes to reduce the frequency of insertion. A new spatio-temporal interval criterion and a new node-choosing sub-algorithm are also proposed to optimize spatio-temporal R-tree structures. In addition, a B*-tree sub-index of leaf nodes is built to query the trajectories of targeted objects efficiently. Furthermore, a database storage scheme based on a NoSQL-type DBMS is also proposed for the purpose of cloud storage. Experimental results prove that HBSTR-tree outperforms TB*-tree in some aspects such as generation efficiency, query performance and query type...|$|R

Mor­fometrijsko istraživanje unutarpopulacijske i međupopulacijske varijabilnosti provedeno je na osnovi 10 morfoloških svojstava listova, pri čemu su kori­štene multivarijatne i deskriptivne statističke metode. Konstatirana je visoka varijabilnost istraživanih morfoloških značajki, te se koeficijent varijabilnosti na razini svih populacija kretao od 17, 63 % za svojstvo broja primarnih zu­baca subapikalne regije lista do 52, 94 % za svojstvo bazalne asimetrije. Unu­tarpopulacijska varijabilnost bila je veća nego međupopulacijska, osim za svojstvo broja sekundarnih i tercijarnih žila subapikalne regije i duljinu pe­teljke. Klasterskom i diskriminantnom analizom utvrđeno je da su međusobno najsličnije populacije Svibovica, Gotalovo i Banov Brod. Populacija Veliko Polje od ostalih se populacija izdvaja zbog jakog negativnog antropogenog utjecaja, dok je odvajanje najsjevernije populacije Varaždin uvjetovano nje­nim zemljopisnim položajem i specifičnim staništem. Due to the Dutch elm disease elms (Ulmus L.) {{have been}} cate­gorized as a {{threatened}} genus within European flora, {{so that the}} protection of their genetic resources has been set as the main goal of many multilateral Eu­ropean projects. Due to exceptional sensitivity to the Dutch elm disease, {{as well as the}} high variability of morphological features, special emphasis in these studies has been put on the research of morphological and genetic va­riability of the European field elm, as well as the delimitation of species within U. minor Mill. sensu latissimo complex. The taxonomic structure of this com­plex, despite very intensive research, including combining of morphometric and molecular-biological methods, still represents an unknown. In Croatia, the field elm appears in very different ecological conditions, and it is assumed that populations, especially the ones from climatically con­trasting and geographically remote stands, differ from each other. Croatian Drava River valley is a place of exceptional natural value and very high biological and landscape diversity. This area is protected by law by establishing Regional Park Mura-Drava, which {{is a part of the}} future Mura­Drava-Danube Biosphere Reserve. Along the Drava River banks, numeruos anthropogenic activities took place (gas and oil exploitation, hydroelectric power plants, hydroregulation by building of dams and canals, excavating of sand and gravel from river bed). These activities resulted in changes in water relations and caused tree dieback in lowland forest ecosystems, which had drastic negative impact on biodiversity of this area. As a consequence of above mentioned activities, the field elm (Ulmus minor Mill. sensu latissimo) is threatened twofold. First - by negative human impact and second – by Dutch elm disease. Therefore, in this study the variability of five field elm populations (Ulmus minor Mill. sensu latissimo) from Drava River valley, Northwest Croatia has been researched: Banov Brod, Gotalovo, Svibovica, Varaždin and Veliko Polje (Figure 1). Morphometric research of the intra- and interpopulational varia­bility was done on the basis of 10 morphological leaf traits (Figure 2). Des­criptive statistics and multivariate methods were used. It was concluded that the analysed morphological traits were very variable. The variability coeffi­cient for populations in total varied from 17, 63 % for number of primary teeth in the subapical region to 52, 94 % for the <b>leaf</b> base asymmetry (<b>Table</b> 1). There were significant differences among trees within populations and among populations for all measured <b>leaf</b> traits (<b>Tables</b> 2 and 3), except for two traits on populational level: leaf blade length, measured along the shorter side of lamina, starting from the leaf base to the point of maximum leaf breadth (PMPW) and leaf blade width at 90 % of leaf blade length, measured along the shorter side of lamina (PW 2). Intrapopulational variability was higher than the interpopulational one (Table 4), except for the following traits: num­ber of secondary and tertiary veins in the subapical region of the leaf (NPSV) and petiole length (PL). According to the results of discriminant and cluster analysis (Tables 5 and 6, Figures 3 and 4), the most similar populations were Svibovica, Gotalovo and Banov Brod. Populacija Veliko Polje differed from other four populations due to strong negative antropogenic influence on its variability. Differentiation of the northernmost population Varaždin can be explained through its geographical position and specific habitat. The results of this study form an initial base for further research of the field elm in Croatian Drava River valley, where in order to preserve genetic resour­ces of this species, combined morphometric and molecular survey approach is required...|$|R

Sur {{le filtrat}} de culture, {{fortement}} toxique à l’égard de feuilles de tabac, un schéma de purification a été mis au point afin d’isoler et de caractériser la substance toxique. Après dialyse et précipitation au sulfate d’ammonium (50 p. 100 P/v), le culot est chromatographié sur D. E. A. E. cellulose (fig. 1); la fraction non liée (DI), toxique, est alors chromatographiée sur C. M. cellulose, où elle se sépare en 2 pics dont seul le pic lié (CII) est toxique (fig. 2). La fraction (CII) est ensuite purifiée sur Sephadex G 50 (fig. 4 A) : le pic GI, renfermant surtout glucose et mannose, n’est pas toxique, le pic GII, toxique, est de nature peptidique (tabl. 2). Toutes les fractions obtenues lors des diverses étapes de purification ont été testées quant à leur toxicité vis-à-vis de feuilles détachées de tabac (tabl. 1) et le schéma de purification, appliqué 3 fois à 2 filtrats de culture, a donné des résultats identiques. Enfin, filtrat brut et fraction purifiée (CII) se montrent également sensibles à la température et à l’action de la pronase (tabl. 3 et 4). A strain of Phytophthora cryptogea was grown on PLICH liquid medium (stationary culture for 21 days at 24 °C). Crude culture filtrate was highly toxic to tobacco leaves and consequently a purification procedure was devised {{to isolate the}} toxic substance. The toxicity was assayed at each step of purification using the tobacco <b>leaf</b> test (<b>table</b> 1). After dialysis and precipitation with ammonium sulfate (50 % W/v), the toxic pellet was chromatographed on D. E. A. E. cellulose with 10 mM tris-acetate buffer (pH 8) and the same buffer containing 0. 25 and 1 M NaCI (fig. 1). The non-bound fraction (DI) proved toxic and was further fractionated on CM-cellulose with 10 mM sodium acetate-acetic acid (pH 5) alone and with 0. 5 NaCI. The (DI) fraction was resolved into a non-bound peak (CI), devoid of toxicity and a second peak (CII) eluted with 0. 5 M NaCl and toxic to tobacco leaves (fig. 2). The CII fraction was then further purified by exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G 50 eluted with water (fig. 4 A). The excluded peak (GI) was not toxic but a second one (GII) proved toxic and behaviour on Sephadex G 25 is shown on fig. 4 B. The crude culture filtrate and the (CII) fraction lost their toxicity on tobacco when heated (30 min at 120 °C) at pH 8 or 10 (the toxicity being preserved if heated at pH 4 and 6) or digested by Pronase (Tables 3 and 4). Chemical analysis (Table 2) indicated that fraction (GI) contained mainly mannose and glucose and that (GII) appeared to be probably a peptide. The purification procedure applied three times on two different culture filtrates of the same strain gave identical results...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic sliding gap multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) {{fields are}} used to model MLC properties within the treatment planning system (TPS) for dynamic treatments. One of the key MLC properties in the Eclipse TPS is the dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) and precise determination of this parameter is paramount to ensuring accurate dose delivery. In this investigation, we report on how the spacing between control points (CPs) for sliding gap fields impacts the dose delivery, MLC positioning accuracy, and measurement of the DLG. The central axis dose was measured for sliding gap MLC fields with gap widths ranging from 2 to 40 mm. It was found that for deliveries containing two CPs, the central axis dose was underestimated by the TPS for all gap widths, with the maximum difference being 8 % for a 2 mm gap field. For the same sliding gap fields containing 50 CPs, the measured dose was always within ± 2 % of the TPS dose. By directly measuring the MLC trajectories we show that this dose difference {{is due to a}} systematic MLC gap error for fields containing two CPs, and that the cause of this error is due to the <b>leaf</b> position offset <b>table</b> which is incorrectly applied when the spacing between CPs is too large. This MLC gap error resulted in an increase in the measured DLG of 0. 5 mm for both 6 MV and 10 MV, when using fields with 2 CPs compared to 50 CPs. Furthermore, this change in DLG was shown to decrease the mean TPS-calculated dose to the target volume by 2. 6 % for a clinical IMRT test plan. This work has shown that systematic MLC positioning errors occur for sliding gap MLC fields containing two CPs and that using these fields to model critical TPS parameters, such as the DLG, may result in clinically significant systematic dose calculation errors during subsequent dynamic MLC treatments...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Corn (Zea mays L.) {{is one of}} {{the main}} cereals in the {{tropical}} and temperate regions of the world. Sweet corn obtained from a genetic mutation on chromosome 4 locus SU conventional maize resulting accumulation of sugars and polysaccharides which are soluble in seed endosperm. Unlike other types of corn, sweet corn endosperm contains a lot of sugar to starch, which is called Amylodextrin and it is soluble in water. Producing healthy and uniform plants {{is one of the}} requirements of modern agriculture. Considering the unsuitable climatic condition in Iran (arid and semiarid) transplantation is one of the requirements for sustainable agriculture particularly in sweet corn production with high water requirement where transplantation is able to save at least 2 - 3 times of irrigations. Therefore, producing high quality transplants is an important practice for successful seedling establishment. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of seed priming and substrate types on the characteristics of sweet corn transplants. Materials and Methods This experiment was conducted as factorial based on a completely randomized design with three replications. Treatments were three levels of seeds pretreatment: no priming (p 1), hydropriming (p 2) and biopriming (p 3), and another factor was seedbeds types in seven levels including: vermicompost (b 1), perlite (b 2), cocopeat(b 3), vermicompost+perlite(b 4), vermicompost+ cocopeat (b 5), perlite+ cocopeat (b 6) and vermicompost+ cocopeat +perlite (b 7). Biopriming using bioaminopalis biological fertilizer applied on the seeds for 24 hours in a solution containing micro-organisms such azotobacter and Pseudomonas. Then the non-primed and the primed seeds were sown in the plastic pots and grown in a greenhouse with average temperature of 22 - 25 ° C. Samples were taken three weeks after planting. Results and Discussion Mean emergence time Emergence is shoot elongation and growth leading the shoots out of the soil. Shorter mean emergence time indicates the plants emergence more quickly as a desirable characteristic. Results from analysis of variance showed that the mean emergence time was significantly influenced by seed priming treatments (P≤ 0. 01). The type of seedbed and interaction of two factors, seedbed and priming had no significant effect on mean emergence time (Table 1). Non treated seeds (P 1) had the longest mean emergence time of 3. 06 days compared with treated seeds (P 2, P 3) (Table 2). Shoot length The results showed that the type of the seedbed and seed priming pretreatment had a significant effect on the shoot length on the sweet corn transplants. The interaction between these two factors on shoot length was also significant (Table 1). Bioprimed seeds produced transplants with 17. 86 cm shoot length superior to the non-primed seeds, while it did not show statistically significant difference with the hydroprimed seeds. Sweet corn seeds inoculation with bacteria resulted a significant increase in the seedling shoot length. Sayed-Sharifi and Khavazi (2011) also found similar results. Seed bed also had a significant effect on sweet corn seedling shoot length. As the vermicompost + cocopeat and vermicompost seedbeds produced seedlings with shoot length of 21 and 20. 68 cm respectively, while perlite+coco peat and perlite showed the lowest shoot length of 10. 98 and 11. 08 respectively (table 2). Nicknam et al. (2012) also investigated the influence of different substrates on the growth of two cultivars of lily (Lilium ledebourii) and found that seedbeds containing vremikvlayt and perlite produced transplants with a shorter shoot length. P 3 b 5 treatment where the seeds primed with microorganisms such as pseudomonas and the seedlings grown in the vermicompost resulted in the highest (24 cm) shoot length possibly due to more availability of the nutrients while P 1 b 2 treatments produced the shortest (9. 9 cm) shoot length seedlings (Figure 1) Leaf area The seeds pretreatment (P≤ 0. 05), the kind of seedbed and the interactions between these factors (P≤ 0. 01) have significant effect on the sweet corn <b>leaf</b> area (<b>Table</b> 1). The seedlings of the bioprimed seeds produced a higher leaf area of 60. 65 cm 2 compared with the control and hydropriming treatments possibly due to more availability of the nutrients. Seed pretreatment with biological fertilizer of bioaminopalis that contained bacteria, azotobacter and pseudomonas had direct and indirect effects on plant growth leading to expansion of the leaf area. The direct effects of these bacteria could be used in producing chemical components needed for plant growth, facilitating nutrients uptake, atmospheric nitrogen fixation and plant hormones production such as auxin and gibberellins, enhancing plant growth in various stages of development, or construction of enzymes involved in the plant growth. Conclusions Seed priming and vermicompost seedbed improved the quality of the produced transplants. This system was recommended for sweet corn production in Iran using transplants in order to save at least 2 - 3 times of the irrigation per year where the country is suffering from serious water crises...|$|R
