40|$|The {{game meat}} {{fermented}} sausages “luganeghe” {{have a great}} gastronomic and cultural value in the north-east Alpine regions. Traditionally, they are made with chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), wild boar (Sus scrofa scrofa), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus), mixed with pork (40 - 60 %). The microbiological conditions of large game meat can be compromised by poor placement of shots, evisceration and further dressing in the field, and ageing of the carcasses at ambient temperatures. However, the microbiological quality of meat from <b>large</b> <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> is {{generally considered to be}} similar to that of livestock (ATANASSOVA et al., 2008). Several risk assessments have been already undertaken in the meat industry, but neither risk assessment has been carried out specifically for <b>large</b> <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> meat, nor are there specific microbiological criteria for such meat within European Union legislation...|$|E
40|$|Currently in Italy, in {{contrast}} to other EU countries, a supply chain for hunted game meat does not exist. Nevertheless there are the conditions for its development (Gaviglio et al., 2017); in fact game meat dishes’ has {{always been part of}} Alpine area’s culinary tradition and furthermore, management measures aimed at reducing the overpopulation of large wild ungulates leaded to an increase in the availability of their meat. In this context, the present research aims at analyze the dynamics of the value in the local non-existent supply chain of the <b>large</b> <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> meat by the application on the case study of the Valle Ossola (Piedmont, Italy). Due to its representativeness among Italian wild ungulates, the research focus on red deer meat. The data has been collected in 2016 through in-depth interviews and focus groups with the stakeholders involved in the supply chain: hunters, transformers and restaurateurs. Results show that for the hunter the red deer reach a hypothetical price of 6, 00 €/kg. From a meat processing targeted at the maximum enhancement of the carcass, without any waste, the transformers can reach a hypothetical price of 9, 80 €/kg. Whereas for the restaurateur, the red deer meat can reach a final price range between 22, 88 and 51, 47 €/kg (hypothesizing maximum sales of high value-added course). Through the maximization of the meat’s quality, hunter and transformers profits can increase significantly, with a redistribution of the added value throughout the supply chain. A limitation {{of this study is that}} the calculated values does not take into consideration the stakeholders’ production costs (that increasing along the supply chain). Considering our findings, the development of sustainable supply chain of the local game meat could be economically interesting. Thus, wild ungulates could represent an economic resource for the population rather than an environmental and social cost for the mountain areas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Human neurotrichinellosis {{is seldom}} reported. This is likely {{the result of}} the low {{incidence}} of parasites from the genus Trichinella in the United States domestic food supply, as well as difficulties in diagnosing the disease, especially when neither the organism nor the source of the infection are readily available. Although trichinellosis from domestic food supplies has been decreasing for many years, a resurgence has occurred in cases derived from the consumption of <b>wild</b> <b>game.</b> We report a rare case of neurotrichinellosis in the United States and implicate <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> as the source of the infection. These results suggest that clinicians should consider the potential for Trichinella infection in cases where <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> is common in the diets of the patients...|$|R

40|$|Forests in Africa and Asia host various {{wildlife}} {{populations that}} cause {{varying levels of}} damages to forest resources. The economic damage is more severe in forest plantations meant for timber production that require huge financial outlays. Like many countries most forest ecosystems in Kenya contain many forest plantations and <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> conservation units. Despite the heavy losses to plantation crops by <b>wild</b> <b>game,</b> {{the extent of the}} loss as well as existence of a balance between <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> conservation and plantation forestry remains unknown. The study therefore attempts to deepen the knowledge on the impacts of game damage on forest ecosystems in particular plantations and also provide some option to forest managers to counter minimize damage levels. To minimize <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> damages in Key ecosystems of Mt. Kenya and Aberdares in Kenya game moats were constructed. Recently, electric fences were introduced into parts of the Aberdares to keep away wild animals from plantations and farms. The use of physical structures has been successful in reducing damage from large game such as elephants and buffaloes but controlling smaller game mostly monkeys, porcupines, and moles remain a challenge. This paper focuses on the benefits and challenges of restricting <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> movement in forest plantations management as well as the ecological and economic impacts in Mt Kenya and Aberdare ecosystems. The study was carried out through assessments of the damage intensity of foliage, tree lim...|$|R
