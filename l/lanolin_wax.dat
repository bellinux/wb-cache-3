50|$|The Loaghtan's wool {{has a high}} {{coating of}} <b>lanolin</b> <b>wax,</b> also known as wool wax or wool grease. Warm weather makes the lanolin viscous, which aids shearing. Some {{specialty}} soap producers also use the lanolin as an ingredient in a mild soap.|$|E
50|$|A subfraction of <b>Lanolin</b> (Wool <b>Wax),</b> {{a mixture}} of {{hydrocarbons}} that imparts emulsifying properties and provides emolliency (skin smoothing properties). Lanolin Alcohol is composed of Cholesterol, other sterols, and free fatty acids. Moisturizers containing Cholesterol and fatty acid mixtures {{have been shown to}} provide skin benefits.|$|R
40|$|Salam fruit (Syzygium polyanthum (Wight) Walp.) {{is one of}} the {{potential}} plants {{to be used as a}} natural colorant because it contains anthocyanin. This research is an experimental study to formulate lipstick from natural colorant which contained in salam fruit. Lipstick formula consisted of components such as castor oil,cera alba, <b>lanolin,</b> carnauba <b>wax,</b> cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, nipagin, strawberry perfume, and addition of salam fruit extract as colorant with of 10...|$|R
50|$|Pomades {{were once}} much {{more popular than}} they are today, {{although}} {{they have made a}} comeback in the 2010s with recent additions to the marketplace, which feature far less <b>lanolin</b> or bees <b>wax</b> in their formulation. Modern hairstyles involving the use of pomade include the ducktail, pompadour, and quiff.|$|R
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, <b>lanolin,</b> turpentine, <b>wax</b> (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} known animal wax is beeswax, but other insects secrete (release) waxes. A {{major component of}} the beeswax used in constructing honeycombs is the ester myricyl palmitate which is an ester of triacontanol and palmitic acid. Its melting point is 62-65 °C. Spermaceti occurs in large amounts in the head oil of the sperm whale. One of its main constituents is cetyl palmitate, another ester of a fatty acid and a fatty alcohol. <b>Lanolin</b> is a <b>wax</b> obtained from wool, consisting of esters of sterols.|$|R
40|$|Sardinian folk {{medicine}} {{has given rise}} to a renewed interest in treatment of different diseases, particularly skin burns and inflammatory disorders. Rubus ulmifolius Schott shoots have been used to treat burns of different degree. During this work, a new and more effective extraction method was developed using olive oil at room temperature for 10 days. The R. ulmifolius oleolite components were mainly represented by polyphenolic compounds and tannins. To obtain a suitable topical formulation, the Rubus oleolite was incorporated in an ointment composed of anhydrous <b>lanolin,</b> white <b>wax,</b> olive oil, and Europhea oil unsaponifiables. Both R. ulmifolius oleolite and ointment were able to scavenge DPPH free radicals in vitro in a way very similar to quercetin, used as reference. In addition, R. ulmifolius ointments were biocompatible in vitro on 3 T 3 fibroblasts and did not cause any malformation or cell degeneration. Moreover, in vivo studies on Sprague-Dawley rats confirmed the ability of Rubus ointment to improve skin regeneration after burns...|$|R
40|$|Allergy to wool {{alcohols}} What are {{wool alcohols}}? Wool alcohols are the principle component of lanolin in which allergens are found. Lanolin {{is a natural}} product obtained from the fleece of sheep. Sebum is extracted from the wool, cleaned and refined to produce anhydrous lanolin. This comprises 3 parts, wool alcohols, fatty alcohols and fatty acids. Currently the wool alcohols are considered the main sensitisers in lanolin but whether they are the sole sensitisers, needs further investigation. Nowadays there is also chemically modified lanolin that may be less sensitising than natural lanolin. Wool alcohols, wool fat, anhydrous lanolin, <b>lanolin</b> alcohol, wool <b>wax</b> and wool grease {{are just some of}} the terms used interchangeably with lanolin. In this article we will use wool alcohols, as it is this fraction of lanolin that is the main cause of contact allergies. What products contain wool alcohols? Lanolin is a good emulsifier; this means it binds well with water thus it is particularly useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. Wool alcohols are found in many pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics and toiletries. They also have some industrial uses...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS) {{is widely}} recognized as a versatile technique for evaluating the kinetics of corrosion process and, in particular, the degree of protection afforded by oxide, organic and other insulating coatings. In this work we have used the EIS method to study the behavior of coated and uncoated airframe aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3 corroding in 0. 5 M aqueous NaCl; crevice corrosion in this alloy has also been studied via use of simulated joints. ^ The EIS spectra observed on coated specimens yield a characteristic, two time constant spectrum that can be modeled by a circuit incorporating a geometric coating capacitance, a 2 ̆ 2 pore 2 ̆ 2 resistance, a polarization resistance and a double layer resistance and the decrease of coating capacitance and polarization resistance {{can be related to}} the degradation of the coating. ^ The EIS spectra for coated 2024 -T 3 aluminum with simulated joint showing crevice corrosion display three semicircles on the Nyquist plot, which can be modeled by a circuit with three time constant. For the third time constant, a crevice-related capacitance and a charge transfer resistance corresponding to the crevice were used to model the impedance spectra with good fitting results; and values of the crevice resistance can be justified with results from measuring the surface morphology changes for simple crevice geometry created by placing a micro slide on top of 2024 -T 3 aluminum in aqueous 0. 5 M NaCl solution. ^ The corrosion behavior in aqueous 0. 5 M NaCl of 2024 -T 3 aluminum treated with a wool <b>wax</b> (<b>lanolin)</b> based corrosion preventive coating was studied via EIS and DC electrode polarization. The wool wax coating was found to be very corrosion preventative for this alloy in the aqueous saline environment whether applied to freshly prepared surfaces or to corroded specimens removed from simulated service. ^ An EIS procedure can be designed that contributes a new NDE technique for the detection of corrosion on aircraft structures. This is especially sensitive to crevice corrosion which cannot be detected by other NDE methods. ...|$|R
