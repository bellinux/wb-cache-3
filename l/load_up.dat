5|$|On {{the day of}} transport, {{they are}} {{surprised}} when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get {{the car to the}} target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop the part of the road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they <b>load</b> <b>up</b> the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E
5|$|Thief {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a 3D environment, with the game's story taking place over {{a series of}} missions, in which the player character is able to perform various actions such as leaning, crouching, swimming, climbing, running and fighting, amongst other abilities. Levels are largely unscripted, and allow for emergent gameplay; while non-player characters (NPCs) may either remain stationary or walk about on a patrol route, players {{have the freedom to}} choose how to get around them and the obstacles in a level's environments in order to complete specific tasks, such as getting through a locked door. In each level, the player is given a set of objectives to complete, such as stealing a specific object, which they must complete in order to progress to the next level; the player can choose to play on one of three difficulty settings before starting a level, which they can change between missions, with higher difficulties adding additional objectives such as not killing human NPCs or stealing a certain amount of loot from the amount available in a level, changing the amount of health the player character has, and changing how sensitive a NPC is to their environment. In some missions, players may find objectives being changed or new ones being added, due to certain circumstances they encounter, while failing a key objective or dying, will fail a level, forcing a player to either replay it or <b>load</b> <b>up</b> a previous save.|$|E

25|$|Lift {{bags are}} used to bring the <b>load</b> <b>up</b> in stages: a long chain or sling is used to connect the load to a lift bag just below the surface, which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the <b>load</b> <b>up</b> further. This {{procedure}} continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work {{on or near the}} lifting gear when under load.|$|E
25|$|The Docks' design {{allowed a}} ship {{arriving}} from the West Indies to unload {{in the northern}} dock, sail round to the southern dock and <b>load</b> <b>up</b> with export cargo in {{a fraction of the}} time it had previously taken in the heavily congested and dangerous upper reaches of the Thames.|$|E
25|$|On other occasions, the C-123s would <b>load</b> <b>up</b> {{troops from}} the South Vietnamese {{airborne}} brigade in Saigon to fly to the relief of a village that had come under attack. Over the village, the C-123 pilot would reduce power, drop flaps, and spiral down to the drop altitude and give the paratroopers a green light to jump.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} power, the L class outclassed {{most of the}} Victorian Railways fleet when {{introduced}} in 1953, surpassed only by steam locomotive H220. L1150 was able to better {{the performance of the}} famed S class in hauling a 600-ton <b>load</b> <b>up</b> the 1 in 50 gradient of Glenroy Bank. The L was also able to haul an 1,100 ton load between Dandenong and Oakleigh stations in around half the time taken by VR's most powerful freight locomotive, the X class, allowing heavy freight trains from Gippsland to avoid delaying suburban passenger services sharing the same route.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods can}} used to prepare {{cross-linked}} polyethylene (PE-X) from thermoplastic polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature impact strength, abrasion resistance and environmental stress cracking resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical <b>load</b> <b>up</b> to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.|$|E

25|$|The Royals countered {{in the top}} of {{the third}} inning where they batted around. Alcides Escobar singled with one out. Alex Gordon {{grounded}} into a forceout for the second out of the inning, then stole second base. Consecutive infield singles by Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer brought Gordon home to tie the game. Mike Moustakas then walked to <b>load</b> <b>up</b> the bases. Omar Infante singled to center to score Cain and Hosmer to make it 3–1 Royals. Salvador Pérez followed with another single to score Moustakas and knock Vogelsong out of the game. Jean Machi came in and walked Jarrod Dyson, but struck out the pitcher with the bases loaded to end the threat.|$|E
25|$|To {{find out}} the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area. Huck learns from her about the news of his own {{supposed}} murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away {{he is also a}} suspect and a reward for Jim's capture has initiated a manhunt. Mrs. Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests. Once he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing. Huck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson's Island that very night. The two hastily <b>load</b> <b>up</b> the raft and depart.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Zheng He {{may have}} left the Chinese coast {{in the autumn of}} 1417. Admiral Zheng He first made port at Quanzhou to <b>load</b> <b>up</b> the fleet's cargoholds with {{porcelain}} and other goods. Archaeological finds of contemporary Chinese porcelain have been excavated at the East African places visited by Zheng He's fleet. A Ming tablet at Quanzhou commemorates that Admiral Zheng He burned incense for divine protection for this voyage on 31 May 1417. The fleet visited the following places: Champa, Pahang, Java, Palembang, Malacca, Semudera, Lambri, Ceylon, Cochin, Calicut, Shaliwanni (possibly Cannanore), Liushan (Maladive and Laccadive Islands), Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and Malindi. For Arabia and East Africa, the most-likely route was Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and then Malindi. Duyvendak suggested that Zheng He made a show of military force at Mogadishu and Lasa due to the unwelcome reception by the locals.|$|E

500|$|In November 1939, Roosevelt {{signed the}} Fourth Neutrality Act forbidding American ships from {{entering}} the [...] "war zone", which {{was defined as a}} line drawn from Spain to Iceland. Cargoes intended for Ireland were shipped to Portugal. It was up to the Irish to fetch them from there. This route, known as the Iberian Trade or the Lisbon run. Setting sail from Ireland, the ships would carry agricultural products to the United Kingdom. There they would discharge their cargo, <b>load</b> <b>up</b> on fuel, pick up a British export (often coal), and carry it to Portugal. In Portugal, usually Lisbon, Irish ships loaded the waiting American cargo, such as fertilizer or agricultural machinery.|$|E
