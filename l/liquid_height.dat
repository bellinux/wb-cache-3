For a conical capillary {{made from}} a hydrophobic surface and dipped in a liquid reservoir, the equilibrium <b>liquid</b> <b>height</b> depends on the cone opening angle α, the Young-Dupré contact angle θ, the cone radius at the reservoir's level R_ 0 and the capillary length κ^- 1.

40|$|This is {{a report}} on free {{entrainment}} measurements in a small (0. 20 m x 0. 20 in) air-water column. An adjustable weir controlled the <b>liquid</b> <b>height</b> on a test tray. Several sieve and valve trays were studied. The results were interpreted with a two- or three-layer model of the two-phase mixture on the tray. The top or spray layer is gas continuous: in the other layers, the liquid is continuous and contains small babbles. Large bubbles erupt from the liquid-continuous phase, ejecting drops into the top layer. The distribution of the ejection velocities is taken to be Gaussian. The model allows prediction of the entrainment at different heights and for different gas velocities. As a result, a new equation for the maximum allowable vapour velocity can be presented. Two regimes were recognized: a 'low-liquid-height' and a 'high-liquid-height' regime. In the low-liquid-height regime, {{there are only two}} layers. Here the entrainment decreases with increasing <b>liquid</b> <b>height</b> and depends strongly on the type and geometry of the tray deck. At the transition, an intermediate liquid continuous layer develops. In the high-liquid-height regime, there are three layers. Here a further increase in <b>liquid</b> <b>height</b> causes the entrainment to increase. Moreover the entrainment is independent of the type and geometry of the tray deck. The results are compared with measurements from Fractionation Research Inc. on a large tray column. Similar conclusions can be drawn from these measurements, although there are differences owing to the difference in scale of the equipment. The model suggests that potentially large gains in the maximum allowable vapour rate of trays should be possible.

As a result, {{an understanding of}} microgravity fluid physics is essential {{in the development of}} many space technologies ranging from life support systems on the International Space Station to propellant management devices in spacecraft fuel tanks. Microgravity fluids research has been conducted for decades in drop towers, parabolic aircraft, sounding rockets, the Space Shuttle, and the International Space Station. Recently, flight opportunities for microgravity research experiments are becoming available on commercial suborbital vehicles. Advantages of commercial suborbital space flight include low-cost access to the microgravity environment, multiple launch opportunities in a single day, access to experimental hardware up to minutes before launch, and access to experimental data immediately upon landing. In addition, the initial development of many commercial suborbital vehicles was largely for space tourism meaning that safety requirements for manned missions are in place making autonomous control unnecessary and allowing hands-on experimentation during flight. Suborbital space flights also provide significantly more low-gravity time (approximately 3 to 5 minutes) compared to current drop towers. ^ The emerging market for microgravity research in commercial suborbital space-flight has provided an opportunity to explore critical wetting in a three-dimensional geometry. This thesis discusses the design of a microgravity experiment scheduled to launch on New Shepard vehicle designed by Blue Origin, LLC. The experiment includes a 5 -inch diameter spherical tank and two rotating vane structures of different thicknesses The design of the tank and vane structures was completed using the Surface Evolverwhich is a computational tool used to model steady-state low-gravity capillary fluids problems. The critical wetting phenomenon in the gap between the vane and the tank wall was studied. ^ The results obtained from Surface Evolver conclude that the capillary behavior of the liquid in the gap is significantly affected by differences in vane thickness, vane width, contact angle, and the non-circular shape of the vane, or vane spiral. Decreasing the thickness of only one vane reduces the <b>liquid</b> climb <b>height</b> in the vane gap of the thinner vane while the <b>liquid</b> climb <b>height</b> increases in the vane gap of the thicker vane. The same result is observed when the vane width is decreased. Increasing the contact angle increases the <b>liquid</b> climb <b>height</b> in the thick vane gap and decreases the <b>liquid</b> climb <b>height</b> in the thin vane gap for vane angles less than 10 °. Lastly, increasing the vane gap by increasing the vane spiral causes the <b>liquid</b> climb <b>height</b> in the thick vane gap to decrease while the <b>liquid</b> climb <b>height</b> in the thin vane gap closely follows the baseline until about 10 °. ^ The final vane design was chosen based on the conclusions of this work.

Moreover, the Simulink model of the system was developed using the obtained transfer functions of the model. Thereafter, the dynamics of the system was investigated by simulating the Simulink model through the application of input steps to the liquid feed flow rate and the steam temperature of the system. The results obtained from the development of the transfer function models and the simulations carried out when steps were applied to the input variables of the system revealed that the steam temperature had not any effect on the liquid level of the system as their transfer function was found to be zero, and the application of a step to steam temperature did not result into any change in the steady-state value of the liquid level.

As {{a result of the}} conducted experiments, most convenient TLD models considering both displacement and acceleration behavior are determined. It is observed that all the damping models cause significant levels of reduction in seismic behavior of the structure under harmonic loading...|$|R
40|$|International audienceValve trays column {{design for}} gas {{treatment}} still relies on empirical correlations developed on pilot units. The available correlations lead to large discrepancies {{and thus more}} experimental works are needed. The present hydrodynamic study was carried out on a Plexiglas 1. 26 m per 0. 1905 m absorption column containing four V- 4 Glitsch valve trays. Water/air system was used at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. Liquid rate per weir unit length was varied between 3. 2 × 10 − 3 m 3. (m. s) − 1 and 24. 3 × 10 − 3 m 3. (m. s) − 1 and the kinetic gas factor between 0 and 3. 5 Pa 0. 5. The following hydrodynamic parameters were determined: tray pressure drop, valves pressure drop, clear <b>liquid</b> <b>height,</b> mean emulsion height and liquid mean hold up on the tray. Correlations for clear <b>liquid</b> <b>height,</b> liquid mean hold up and emulsion height are proposed. Emulsion profiles characterisation was possible due to video records post-processing. Four different behaviours are identified for emulsion profiles according to liquid and gas velocities. Significant behaviour changes on the hydrodynamic parameters allowed the identification of three system limits: dumping, weeping and pre-flooding. Correlations are proposed for these limits and an operational diagram is presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a CFD {{characterization}} of the flow generated by curved-blade impellers in a cylindrical unbaffled vessel was carried out. The tank diameter was 300 mm, with a flat bottom. The <b>liquid</b> <b>height</b> was equal to the vessel diameter. The fluids simulated have a shear thinning behavior. Analyses concern {{the effect of the}} impeller speed, the fluid rheology and the number of impeller blades on the induced flow patterns and the power consumption. The predictions were compared with literature data and a satisfactory agreement was found...|$|E

The liquid sample is held in a partially filled, cylindrical open-topped tube within a vertically flowing gas stream. A simple model appropriate to this geometry is found {{to account for the}} variation of rate with <b>liquid</b> <b>height</b> within the sample tube and gas flow rate. Evaporation rates for a range of pure liquids with vapour pressures ranging from 0. 1 to 500 Torr were determined and showed reasonable agreement with theoretical values estimated using literature values of the vapour pressures and vapour di†usion coefficients in air...|$|E

It is found that variation of water vapor density and cloud <b>liquid</b> with <b>height</b> in addition to temperature variation plays {{a critical role in}} this phenomenon. It is shown that temperature lapse rate and wet adiabatic lapse rate play a major role.

40|$|Two-phase {{horizontal}} {{intermittent flow}} in straight pipes is experimentally investigated. A new procedure is proposed {{to characterize the}} flow through the statistical analysis of the instantaneous cross-sectional averaged void fraction obtained by means of ring impedance probes. The algorithm, based on the statistical analysis of the void fraction records, allows the main intermittent flow parameters, such as slug frequency and length, time average void fraction, minimum and average <b>liquid</b> film <b>height</b> to be evaluated. The procedure is validated through flow visualizations, as obtained from a fast digital video camera. Experiments on air-water horizontal flows in 40 mm and 60 mm inner diameter pipes are performed. The operating conditions cover the 0. 3 - 4. 0 m/s and 0. 6 - 3. 0 m/s gas and liquid superficial velocity ranges, respectively. An extensive comparison with literature data shows a general agreement with present measurement. The reliability of both the instrumentation and the signal analysis procedures allows new correlations for minimum and average <b>liquid</b> film <b>height</b> in stratified regions to be proposed. Finally proper dimensionless numbers were applied to correlate frequency data {{in a wide range}} of superficial velocity values...|$|R
