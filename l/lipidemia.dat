50|$|The {{importance}} of LXRs in physiological lipid and cholesterol metabolism {{suggests that they}} may influence the development of metabolic disorders such as hyper <b>lipidemia</b> and atherosclerosis. Evidence for this idea has been observed by recent studies that linked LXR activity to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. LXRα knockout mice are healthy when fed with a low-cholesterol diet. However, LXRα knockout mice develop enlarged fatty livers, degeneration of liver cells, high cholesterol levels in liver, and impaired liver function when fed a high-cholesterol diet. LXRβ knockout mice are unaffected by a high-cholesterol diet, suggesting that LXRα and LXRβ have separate roles. LXRs regulate fatty acid synthesis by modulating the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). LXRs also regulate lipid homeostasis in the brain. LXRα and LXRβ double knockout mice develop neurodegenerative changes in brain tissue. LXRβ knockout mice results in adult-onset motor neuron degeneration in male mice.|$|E

Three groups of twelve patients were treated either with 200 mg filgotinib in a single dose, 200 mg divided in two doses or placebo. The primary end-point was the ACR20 score, which monitors improvements in the symptomatology of the patient. After the scheduled 4 weeks of treatment, 83% of the respondents showed an improved ACR20-score. Half of the treated patients showed a complete (or near complete) remission of the disease. There were no reports of anemia nor changes in <b>lipidemia.</b> The company stated in their press release that filgotinib is the first selective JAK1 inhibitor that shows clinical efficacy.

40|$|I {{am pleased}} to {{announce}} the launch of Nutrition and Metabolic Insights—a new peer reviewed open access journal published by Libertas Academica. Nutrition and Metabolic Insights is focused on all aspects of nutrition and metabolism, including the biochemistry of metabolism, exercise, and associated physical processes. The journal encompasses research at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels and also covers clinical articles that relate to metabolism, such as obesity, <b>lipidemias</b> and diabetes. Other areas of interest include gene-nutrient interactions, the effects of hormones, models of metabolic func-tion, macronutrient interactions, outcomes of changes in diet, and pathophysiology. The last few decades have shown tremendous changes in the health and lifestyle habits of people in various populations across the globe (1). We are suddenly faced with a rapid rise in the obesity preva-lence, huge changes in dietary habits and patterns of physical activity, and increasing proportion of older people living longer (2). The impact of these changes on bodily function and human health is less understood and therefore brings about new scientifi c challenges and pose exciting opportunities to produce novel research particularly in the fi eld of nutrition and metabolism. Furthermore, {{there is a need}} to keep at pace with the expanding knowledge on the genetic basis of various common metabolic diseases.

40|$|Activation of {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -α which regulates {{lipid metabolism}} in peripheral tissues {{such as the}} liver and skeletal muscle, decreases circulating lipid levels, thus improving hyperlipidemia under fasting conditions. Recently, postprandial serum lipid levels {{have been found to}} correlate more closely to cardiovascular diseases than fasting levels, although fasting hyperlipidemia is considered an important risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of PPARα activation on postprandial <b>lipidemia</b> has not been clarified. In this study, we examined the effects of PPARα activation in enterocytes on lipid secretion and postprandial <b>lipidemia.</b> In Caco- 2 enterocytes, bezafibrate, a potent PPARα agonist, increased mRNA expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes, such as acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, and acyl-CoA synthase, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and suppressed secretion levels of both triglycerides and apolipoprotein B into the basolateral side. In vivo experiments revealed that feeding high-fat-diet containing bezafibrate increased mRNA expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes and production of CO(2) and acid soluble metabolites in enterocytes. Moreover, bezafibrate treatment suppressed postprandial <b>lipidemia</b> after oral administration of olive oil to the mice. These findings indicate that PPARα activation suppresses postprandial <b>lipidemia</b> through enhancement of fatty acid oxidation in enterocytes, suggesting that intestinal lipid metabolism regulated by PPARα activity is a novel target of PPARα agonist for decreasing circulating levels of lipids under postprandial conditions...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{influence}} of the amount and type of carbohy-drates in the diet on risk factors for obesity, diabetes, and car-diovascular disease remains unclear. Objective: We investigated the effects of 2 low-fat diets (high-sucrose and high-starch) and a high-fat diet on gly-cemia, <b>lipidemia,</b> and hormonal responses in never-obese and postobese women. Design: Eighteen normal-weight women (8 postobese and 10 never-obese) consumed 3 ad libitum diets (high-fat, high-starch, and high-sucrose) for 14 d each. On day 15, we meas-ured fasting and postprandial glucose, lactate, insulin, triacyl-glycerol, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glycerol, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon-like peptide 1. Results: The high-sucrose diet induced significantly lower total areas under the curve (AUCs) for glucose and NEFA and a signi-ficantly higher lactate AUC than did the high-fat and high-starch diets; {{there were no significant}} differences in the insulin AUCs. The triacylglycerol AUC was greater with the high-fat and high-sucrose diets than with the high-starch diet. Gastrointestinal hor-mone concentrations differed between diets, but not between the 2 subject groups. Comparisons between subject groups for all diets combined showed lower relative insulin resistance and lower AUCs for glucose, insulin, and triacylglycerol in the pos-tobese group. Conclusions: High-starch and high-sucrose diets had no adverse effects on postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, or <b>lipidemia</b> com-pared with a high-fat diet. A sucrose-rich diet may improve glu-cose metabolism, but may have an adverse effect on <b>lipidemia,</b> compared with a starch-rich diet.

However, PANDER 2 ̆ 7 s overall role in glycemic regulation and glucose homeostasis {{has yet to be}} studied in a purebred C 57 BL/ 6 J PANDER knockout model. Here we present the first phenotypic characterization of our global PANDER knockout mouse on a C 57 BL/ 6 J background (PANKO-C 57) where we examined metabolics through glucose/insulin tolerance testing, fasting glycemia, and body weights, the concentrations of hormonal analytes along with lipids and corticosterones, and full elucidation of hepatic insulin signaling through the insulin signaling cascade. Overall, the PANKO-C 57 mice exhibited increased body weights with enhanced glucose tolerance and lower fasting glycemia, similar peripheral insulin sensitivities, increased hepatic <b>lipidemia,</b> and enhanced hepatic insulin signaling at critical insulin signaling molecules. Taken together, the PANKO-C 57 demonstrates that the disruption of PANDER results in selectively enhanced hepatic insulin signaling yet with increased <b>lipidemia</b> and overall body weight.

40|$|Objective: Predictors of {{subclinical}} inflammatory obesity (SIO) can {{be important}} tools for early therapeutic interventions in obesity-related comorbidities. Waist circumference (WC) and BMI have different SIO sensitivity. We aimed to i) identify SIO predictors and ii) investigate whether CD 16 + monocytes {{are associated with}} BMI- (generally) or WC-defined (centrally) obesity. Methods: Anthropometric and metabolic/endocrine (namely catecholamines, adrenaline and noradrenaline) parameters were evaluated, and CD 16 + monocytes were studied by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood from 63 blood donors, and compared and correlated to each other. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify variables that best predict SIO. Results: CD 16 + monocyte counts were similar in BMI and WC groups. CD 16 + monocytes from centrally obese (CO) showed a more inflammatory pattern, as compared to non-CO subjects. WC was sensitive to <b>lipidemia</b> and, in CO subjects, <b>lipidemia</b> {{was associated with a}} more inflammatory phenotype of CD 16 + monocytes. These differences were not noticed between BMI groups. Adrenaline was correlated with CD 16 + monocyte expansion with a lower inflammatory pattern. Leptin, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and CD 14 expression of CD 16 + monocytes were found to be CO predictors. Conclusions: WC-, but not BMI-defined obesity, was associated with a more inflammatory pattern of CD 16 + monocytes, without monocyte expansion, suggesting that a monocyte maturation process rather than an independent arise of CD 16 + monocytes occurs in CO. Thus, in a population with low cardiovascular risk, leptin, VLDL-C, and CD 14 expression of CD 16 + monocytes predict CO, constituting a putative tool for screening of SIO...|$|E

At the same time, they are potentially nephrotoxic drugs with influence on onset and progression of renal graft failure. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the outcome of a conversion from CNIbased immunosuppressive protocol to sirolimus (SRL) in recipients with graft in chronic kidney disease (CKD) grade III and proteinuria below 500 mg/day. Methods. In the period 2003 - 2011 24 patients (6 famale and 18 male), mean age 41 ± 12. 2 years, on triple immunosuppressive therapy: steroids, antiproliferative drug [mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathiopirine (AZA) ] and CNI were switched from CNI to SRL and followe-up for 76 ± 13 months. Nine patients (the group I) had early postransplant conversion after 4 ± 3 months and 15 patients (the group II) late conversion after 46 ± 29 months. During the regular outpatient controls we followed graft function through the serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria, <b>lipidemia</b> and side effects. Results. Thirty days after conversion, in all the patients GFR, proteinuria and <b>lipidemia</b> were insignificantly increased. In the first two post-conversion months all the patients had at least one urinary or respiratory infection, and 10 patients reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or disease, and they were successfully treated with standard therapy. After 21 ± 11 months 15 patients from both groups discontinued SRL therapy due to reconversion to CNI (10 patients) and double immunosuppressive therapy (3 patients), return to hemodialysis (1 patient) and death (1 patient). Nine patients were still on SRL therapy. By the end of the follow-up they significantly improved GFR (from 53. 2 ± 12. 7 to 69 ± 15 mL/min), while the increase in proteinuria (from 265 ± 239 to 530. 6 ± 416. 7 mg/day) and <b>lipidemia</b> (cholesterol from 4. 71 ± 0. 98 to 5. 61 ± 1. 6 mmol/L and triglycerides from 2. 04 ± 1. 18 to 2. 1 ± 0. 72 mmol/L) were not significant. They were stable during the whole follow-up period. Ten patients were reconverted from SRL to CNI due to the abrupt increase of proteinuria (from 298 ± 232 to 1639 ± 1641 /mg day in 7 patients), rapid growth of multiple ovarian cysts (2 patients) and operative treatment of persisted hematoma (1 patient). Thirty days after reconversion they were stable with an insignificant decrease in GFR (from 56. 10 ± 28. 09 to 47 ± 21 mL/min) and significantly improved proteinuria (from 1639 ± 1641 to 529 ± 688 mg/day). By the end of the follow-up these patients showed nonsignificant increase in the serum creatinine (from 172 ± 88 to 202 ± 91 mmol/L), decrease in GFR (from 56. 10 ± 28. 09 to 47 ± 21 mL/day) and increased proteinuria (from 528. 9 ± 688 to 850 ± 1083 mg/min). Conclusion. In this small descriptive study, conversion from CNI to SRL was followed by an increased incidence of infections and consecutive 25 - 50 % dose reduction in the second antiproliferative agent (AZA, MMF), with a possible influence on the development of glomerulopathy in some patients, which was the major reason for discontinuation of SRL therapy in the 7 (29 %) patients.

Background: MetS is known to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance and poor glycemic control. Consumption of a meal high in readily available carbohydrates and fat causes postprandial increases in glycemia and <b>lipidemia</b> and markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and insulin resistance.

40|$|Obesity {{contributes}} to metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance, {{all of which}} are risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. The growing prevelance of metabolic syndrome seems to be an end result of our current lifestyle which promotes high caloric, high-fat foods and minimal physical activity, resulting in a state of positive energy balance. Increased adiposity and physical inactivity may represent the beginning of the appearance of these risk factors. Understanding the metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances associated with diet and exercise habits is a crucial step towards reducing the risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Although considerable research has been conducted linking chronic fructose ingestion to the increased prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome risk factors, these studies have mainly been performed on animals, and/or in a post-absorptive state. Further, the magnitude of the effect of fructose may depend on other aspects of the diet, including the total amount of carbohydrates and fats in the diet and the overall consumption of meals.

40|$|Background: Dyslipidemia {{has been}} noted to play an {{integral}} role in the pathogenesis and progression of micro and macrovascular complications in diabetes mellitus patients. The complications exemplified by renal vascular and cardiovascular disease cause the most morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. This study is aimed at understanding the pattern of dyslipidemia among type 2 diabetic patients. Patients and Methods: A total of 108 consenting adult type 2  diabetic patients seen in medical unit of Nepalgunj medical college and Teaching Hospital, Banke, Nepal from January 2012 to November 2012 were evaluated in this cross sectional study. Their fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, weight, height and blood pressure were evaluated. Results: The prevalence of dyslipidemia (at least one bnormal lipid profile) was 90. 7 %. The 24. 1 % had single dyslipidemia while 66. 6 % had combined dyslipidemia. Reduced HDL constituted the highest single abnormality (62 %) followed by hypertriglyceridemia (56. 5 %), hypercholesterolemia (53. 7 %) and high LDL in (44. 4 %). The duration of DM was not significantly associated with dyslipidemia (p > 0. 05). Conclusion: Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent among type 2 diabetic patients in Nepal {{with the majority of}} the patients having combined dyslipidemia. We recommend that aggressive treatment of <b>lipidemia</b> and hyperglycemia can be instituted {{to reduce the risk of}} macro and microvascular complications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Propofol is {{used for}} {{treating}} refractory status epilepticus, which has high rate of mortality. Propofol infusion syndrome is a rare but often fatal syndrome, characterized by lactic acidosis, <b>lipidemia,</b> and cardiac failure, associated with propofol infusion over prolonged periods of time. We investigated the clinical factors that characterize propofol infusion syndrome to know the risk of them in refractory status epilepticus. Methods: This retrospective observation {{study was conducted in}} Samsung medical center from Jan. 2005 to Dec. 2009. Thirty two patients (19 males, 13 females, aged between 16 and 64 years), with refractory status epilepsy were included. Their clinical findings and treatment outcomes were evaluated retrospectively. We divided our patients into established status epilepticus (ESE) and refractory status epilepticus (RSE). And then the patients with RSE was further subdivided into propofol treatment group (RSE-P) and the other anesthetics treatment group (RSE-O). We analyzed the clinical characteristics by comparison of the groups. Results: There were significant differences of hypotension and lipid change between ESE and RSE (p< 0. 05). However, {{there was no significant difference}} between RSE-P and RSE-O groups. The hospital days were longer in RSE than in ESE (p= 0. 012) and treatment outcome was also worse in RSE than i...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the clinical characteristics of ischemic stroke and its associa- tions with hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetic microangiopathy {{in patients with}} diabetes mellitus, we estimated the average period between onset of diabetes and ischemic stroke, and the incidences of complications. A total of 544 patients with diabetes mellitus who were admitted to our hospital over the past 10 years were analyzed, forty of whom were diabetic patients who suffered ischemic stroke as diagnosed by clinical exami- nation. As controles, 40 subjects matched for sex, age, and duration of diabetes were identified, one for each patient with ischemic stroke. The average period between onset of diabetes and ischemic stroke was significantly shorter for patients with hypertension than for normotensive patients; however, {{there were no differences}} in the length of this period between the groups with and without obesity or hyperlipidemia. Hypertension was present in 63 % of patients with ischemic stroke, and the incidence of hypertension was significantly higher in the stroke group than in the control group. There was no difference between the groups with and without ischemic stroke with respect to the incidence of obesity, hyper- <b>lipidemia,</b> retinopathy and nephropathy. We conclude that diabetic patients with hyperten- sion appear to be at high risk for ischemic stroke...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of thymectomy and sublethal irradiation (Tx-X) consistently induced diabetes in female rats of the PVG/c strain. The incidence of diabetes varied from 10. 7 % to 53. 4 % in seven successive Tx-X groups (mean 29. 7 %). Both clinical and subclinical disease was observed {{with the majority}} of affected animals developing the former condition. This was acute in onset, rapidly fatal (1 - 4 days) and characterized by ketosis and <b>lipidemia.</b> Overtly diabetic rats had markedly raised plasma glucose concentrations compared to normal rats of the same strain and plasma immunoreactive insulin concentrations were correspondingly depressed in this group. Histopathological change within the islets of Langerhans correlated with clinical status and ranged from diffuse atrophy in the majority of the acutely diabetic rats to mild and focal lymphocytic insulitis in a proportion of the non-diabetic rats. Islet cell autoantibodies were demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence in approximately 25 % of clinically diabetic animals. The majority of diabetic rats were found to be responsive to insulin and the clinical signs could be reversed by daily parenteral insulin administration. These observations implicate the immune system in diabetes generation and are consistent with an immune mediated pathogenesis as the underlying cause of the islet cell destruction. This syndrome may thus be a potentially useful animal model for type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes in man...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT − Repeated oral {{administration}} of hydrochlorothiazide, a loop diuretic, due to transient high blood levels, may cause adverse effects such as gastric disturbance, nausea, high blood sugar, and hyper <b>lipidemia.</b> Transdermal administration could avoid {{some of these}} systemic side effects and gastric disorders. We have developed a matrix using ethylene-vinyl ace-tate (EVA), a heat-processible and flexible material, for transdermal delivery of hydrochlorothiazide. Drug solubility was highest at 40 % PEG- 400 volume fraction. Drug release increased as concentration increased with a linear relationship between the release rate and the square root of loading dose. Increasing temperature increased drug release from the EVA matrix. The activation energy, measured from the slope of log P versus 1000 /T, was 11. 9 kcal/mol for a 2. 5 % loading dose from EVA matrix. Diethyl phthalate had the highest plasticizing effects on the release of hydrochlorothiazide. To increase the skin permeation of hydrochlorothiazide from the EVA matrix, enhancers such as the saturated fatty acids, the unsaturated fatty acids, and the non-ionic surfactants {{were added to the}} EVA matrix, and skin permeation was evaluated using a modified Keshary-Chien diffusion cell fitted with intact excised rat skin. Polyoxyethylene 23 -lauryl ether showed the highest enhanc-ing effects. In conclusion, transdermal delivery of hydrochlorothiazide could be improved from an EVA matrix containing plasticizer and permeation enhancer...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{composition}} of the medical costs incurred by people treated for basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas (hereafter keratinocyte cancers) is not adequately understood. We sought to compare the medical costs of individuals with or without keratinocyte cancers. Methods: We used national health insurance data to analyze the direct medical costs of 2000 cases and 2000 controls nested within the QSkin prospective cohort study (n[*]=[*] 43, 794) conducted in Australia. We reconstructed the medical history of patients using medical and pharmaceutical item codes and then compared the health service costs of individuals treated for keratinocyte cancers with those not treated for keratinocyte cancers. Results: Individuals treated for keratinocyte cancers consumed on average AUD$ 1320 per annum more in medical services than those without keratinocyte cancers. Only 23. 2 % of costs were attributed to the explicit treatment of keratinocyte cancers. The principal drivers of the residual costs were medical attendances, surgical procedures on the skin, and histopathology services. We found significant positive associations between history of treatment for keratinocyte cancers with treatments for other health conditions, including melanoma, cardiovascular disease, <b>lipidemia,</b> osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and tuberculosis. Conclusion: Individuals treated for keratinocyte cancers have substantially higher medical costs overall than individuals without keratinocyte cancers. The direct costs of skin cancer excision account for only one-fifth of this difference...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of correction of modifiable risk factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD), and treatment compliance within 6 months of observation in group of men and group of women after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Material and methods. Patients (n= 147 : 100 men and 47 women) aged under 70 years who underwent ACS were examined. Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and frequency of basic drugs taking were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months. The efficacy of risk factors correction in men was compared with this in women. Results. A general number of patients with effective blood pressure (BP) control as well as patients who reached the target levels of total cholesterol (TC) < 4. 5 mmol/l and cholesterol of low density lipoproteins (LDC) < 2. 5 mmol/l after 6 months increased significantly in comparison with this before observation. Taking of drugs from all main groups left unsatisfactory and did not reach the advisable values. Women have better antihypertensive treatment compliance, but worse <b>lipidemia</b> level control; they more often have glucose metabolism disorders, arterial hypertension and obesity. Men smoked more often, but have better BP, TC and cholesterol LDC control. Conclusion. The high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors requires intensification of preventive activity regarding IHD onset and progression among both men and women...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{progesterone}} (P 4) on fructose rich diet (FRD) intake-induced metabolic, endocrine and parametrial adipose tissue (PMAT) dysfunctions was {{studied in the}} adult female rat. Sixty day-old rats were i. m. treated with oil alone (control, CT) or containing P 4 (12 mg/kg). Rats ate Purina chow-diet ad libitum throughout the entire experiment and, between 100 and 120 days of age drank ad libitum tap water alone (normal diet; CT-ND and P 4 -ND) or containing fructose (10 % w/v; CT-FRD and P 4 -FRD). At age 120 days, animals were subjected to a glucose tolerance test or decapitated. Plasma concentrations of various biomarkers and PMAT gene abundance were monitored. P 4 -ND (vs. CT-ND) rats showed elevated circulating levels of lipids. CT-FRD rats displayed high (vs. CT-ND) plasma concentrations of lipids, leptin, adiponectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1). <b>Lipidemia</b> and adiponectinemia were high (vs. P 4 -ND) in P 4 -FRD rats. Although P 4 failed to prevent FRD-induced hyperleptinemia, it was fully protective on FRD-enhanced plasma PAI- 1 levels. PMAT leptin and adiponectin mRNAs were high in CT-FRD and P 4 -FRD rats. While FRD enhanced PMAT PAI- 1 mRNA abundance in CT rats, this effect was absent in P 4 rats. Our study supports that a preceding P 4 -enriched milieu prevented the enhanced prothrombotic risk induced by FRD-elicited high PAI- 1 production...|$|E
