5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E

These include maize, sugarcane and, more recently, sweet sorghum.

40|$|Due to sparse {{sampling}} across races, {{studies on}} various strains of Botryococcus braunii have effectively been indiscriminate, {{and so the}} target strains for energy production have not come clearly into focus. This study compares extractable <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> content, bioenergy content and hydrocarbon content across 16 strains B. braunii (A, B and L races) by direct combustion of algal biomass using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), pressure differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). All B. braunii strains were cultured in the same environmental conditions in 250 ml flasks, and were harvested for analysis when algae reached the exponential growth phase. Significant differences were detected within and between races A, B and L. The ranges of variation in extractable <b>liquid,</b> <b>biofuel</b> energy and hydrocarbon contents in algal dry biomass were 10 – 40 %, 10 – 60 % and 4 – 25 %, respectively. The race B strains (Ayame 1, Kossou 4, Overjuyo 3 and Paquemar) had more than 21 % of dry weight comprising C 31 -C 36 hydrocarbons, which are suitable for biofuel and bioenergy production. The Overjuyo 7 and CCAP 807 / 2 strains in race A and the Madras 3 and Yamoussoukro 4 strains in race L also showed high biofuel production with extractable <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> accounting for > 30 % of dry weight.

40|$|China, {{like many}} other countries, is {{promoting}} the development of <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel,</b> including bioethanol and biodiesel. The Chinese government has set biofuel development targets for the coming decade and sanctioned a series of supportive policies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of current <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> development in China, related government policies, and the potential opportunities and challenges for its future expansion. Our assessment is based on two rounds of in-depth fieldwork and a thorough literature review. The assessment shows that the prevailing concern on food security has pushed China to move from cereal-based to non-cereal-based biofuel production. Emphasis has also been put on utilizing new marginal land for feedstock production. Our assessment indicates that the targets of China’s biofuel development are cautious and feasible, {{but on the other}} hand there are still severe challenges for the sustainability of such development.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to utilize fiber sludge, waste fibers from pulp mills and lignocellulose-based biorefineries, for combined production of <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> and biocatalysts was investigated. Without pretreatment, fiber sludge was hydrolyzed enzymatically to monosaccharides, mainly glucose and xylose. In {{the first of}} two sequential fermentation steps, the fiber sludge hydrolysate was fermented to cellulosic ethanol with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the final ethanol yields were similar, the ethanol productivity after 9. 5 h was 3. 3 g/l/h for the fiber sludge hydrolysate compared with only 2. 2 g/l/h for a reference fermentation with similar sugar content. In the second fermentation step, the spent fiber sludge hydrolysate (the stillage obtained after distillation) was used as growth medium for recombinant Aspergillus niger expressing the xylanase-encoding Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) xyn 2 gene. The xylanase activity obtained with the spent fiber sludge hydrolysate (8, 500 nkat/ml) was higher than that obtained in a standard medium with similar monosaccharide content (1, 400 nkat/ml). Analyses based on deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F suggest that {{the main part of the}} recombinant xylanase was unglycosylated and had molecular mass of 20. 7 kDa, while a minor part had N-linked glycosylation and molecular mass of 23. 6 kDa.
