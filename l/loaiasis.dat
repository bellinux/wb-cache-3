50|$|<b>Loaiasis</b> is {{hyperendemic}} in this area, but {{is regarded}} as a generally mild and painless disease... It is reported that about 17% of the population in this area carry HIV/Aids, however the survey is based on urban surveys in the capital.|$|E
50|$|Synonyms for {{the disease}} include African eye worm, <b>loaiasis,</b> loaina, Loa loa filariasis, filaria loa, filaria lacrimalis, filaria subconjunctivalis, Calabar swellings, Fugitive swellings, and microfilaria diurnal. Loa loa, the {{scientific}} name for the infectious agent, is an indigenous term itself {{and it is likely}} that there are many other terms used from region to region.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{observation}} perfectly {{illustrates the}} main epidemiological, clinical and biological peculiarities of this parasitic disease. Particularly, as it concerns a tourist who travelled across Africa {{for a short}} period of time it is possible to assess the time of exposure to infecting mosquito bites, the maturation period of time as well as the time of clinical incubation. On the other hand the value of the immunological techniques to make the diagnosis of <b>loaiasis</b> as well as the difficulties to treat this affection are stressed upon...|$|E
40|$|By mark-release-recapture experiments, we {{assessed}} {{the density of}} loaisis vectos, #Chrysops dimidiata$ Wulp plus some #Chrysops silacea$ Austen (Diptera : Tabanidae) and estimated their range of flight in the secondary forest of southern Cameroon. In 1993, the release point was at {{the centre of the}} study area and recapture points were at 1100 m radius. In 1994, releases were {{on the periphery of the}} study area and recapture sites were 400 - 8000 m from the release points. Results were concordant and showed #Chrysops$ female densities of 785 - 3682 flies/km 2. The theoretical flight range was less than 6000 m, with a maximum distance of 4500 m observed. These results are considered promising for the use of vector control methods against <b>loaiasis.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Imo River Basin, Nigeria is endemic for onchocerciasis, bancroftian filariasis, <b>loaiasis</b> and mansonellosis. This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} the clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis in this region. Methods: A cross-sectional study {{was carried out in}} 2006 in Umuowaibu I and Ndiorji commu-nities in Okigwe Local Government Area of Imo State, Nigeria. Consenting individuals were ex-amined for various gradations of skin manifestations, subcutaneous nodules, and visual impair-ments by qualified medical doctors. Five categories of skin manifestations were observed, namely permanent itching, onchodermatitis, atrophy of skin, leopard skin, and sowda. A total of 1024 individuals were examined. Results: The prevalence of the skin manifestations were permanent itching (2. 5 %), onchoderma-titis (3. 9 %), atrophy of the skin (5. 8 %), leopard skin (22. 1 %), and sowda (0. 1 %). The prevalence of subcutaneous nodules was 25. 3 %, but 88. 9 % among the oldest age group, and mostly found in lower half of body. The majority of cases of visual acuity problems (6. 8 % overall prevalence) were in the oldest age groups. Among those who were ≥ 20 years old, the prevalence of visual acuity problems was significantly higher in females than in males (χ 2 -test; P< 0. 05). Only two of the examined persons were observed to be blind. Conclusion: Clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis are perhaps more intense in the area prob-ably because of presence of endemic infections of other filarial species...|$|E
