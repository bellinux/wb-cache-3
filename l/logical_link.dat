The Onehunga interchange (known as the Gloucester Park Interchange) was to be significantly reworked, to provide a more <b>logical</b> <b>link</b> with the motorway, and to ease congestion along Onehunga Harbour Drive. A standard diamond interchange was initially chosen by Transit, but after consultation with Auckland City Council this was then reworked into a quarter-diamond design, with the northbound onramp hooking underneath a proposed Neilson Road bridge.|$|E

30|$|The MR-MC {{solution}} {{has attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} with the benefits of interference reduction and network scalability improvement in wireless mesh networks. Nevertheless, the MR-MC model also poses technical issues to be dealt with [10]. As mentioned before, the number of available channels is limited to 3 or 12 within the IEEE 802.11 frequency bands. This implies that some <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> may be assigned the same channel. In this case, interference occurs if these <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> are close to each other, and hence the interfering links cannot be active simultaneously. Furthermore, the number of available NICs is also limited, and hence some <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> in a router need to share a NIC to transmit and receive the data packets. When two <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> in a router share a NIC, they are required to operate over the same frequency channel, and cannot be active simultaneously. Thus, it significantly reduces their effective capacity. The effective link capacity can be increased by removing some of the <b>links</b> from the <b>logical</b> topology. However, when some of the links are not activated, the number of hops through some routing paths may be increased, and the logical topology may not even be connected. Therefore, how many <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> should be assigned between neighboring routers, how to allocate interfaces and channels, and through which <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> should the packets be forwarded need to be considered in MR-MC WMNs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{addresses}} an {{optimization problem}} related to dimensioning links in a resilient two-layer network. A particular {{version of the}} problem which assumes that links of the upper layer are supported by unique paths in the lower layer is considered. Two mixed-integer programming formulations of this problem are presented and discussed. Direct resolving of these formulations requires pre-selection of “good” candidate paths in the upper layer of the network. Thus, the paper presents an alternative approach {{which is based on}} decomposing the resolution process into two phases, resolved iteratively. The first phase subproblem is related to designing lower layer path flows that provide the capacities for the <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> of the upper layer. The second phase is related to designing the flow patterns in the upper layer with protection assured through diversity of paths. In this phase we take into account the failures of the <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> that result from the failures of the lower layer links (so called shared risk link groups) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{demands of}} Internet {{applications}} have grown significantly {{in terms of}} required resources and types of services. Overlay networks have emerged to accommodate such applications. The performance of an overlay network is, however, highly dependent on its topology; keeping <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> in an overlay network from interfering with each other is crucial in achieving high throughput. In this thesis, I propose a novel technique that uses wavelet analysis to find bottlenecks caused by the interference between <b>logical</b> <b>links.</b> Based on this technique, I design an algorithm that eliminates all such bottlenecks from a multicast tree, and prove that there remains no such bottleneck in the tree upon termination of the algorithm. The scalability of the shared congestion detection technique is improved using an indexed multidimensional space, which reduces its computational complexity from O(N 2) to O(N log N). This research will let bandwidth-demanding applications build more efficient overlay networks to achieve higher throughput...|$|R

40|$|Overlay {{networks}} are application-layer networks that {{are constructed using}} the existing Internet infrastructure. Nodes in an overlay network construct <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> toward other nodes to form an overlay topology.

Previous work has demonstrated that overlay networks can be used to improve routing performance in the Internet. These quality of service improvements make overlay networks attractive for a variety of network applications. Recently, game-theoretic approaches to constructing overlay network topologies have been proposed. In these approaches, nodes establish <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> toward other nodes in a decentralized and selfish manner.
