The games have received positive reviews from critics, and as of March 2014, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million, making the two games combined the eight best-selling DS game of all time.|$|E
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

5|$|In Cesena in 1502, Leonardo {{entered the}} service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a {{military}} architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron. Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola {{in order to win}} his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon HeartGold Version and SoulSilver Version are {{enhanced}} remakes of Pokémon Gold and Silver. The {{games are}} part of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. First released in Japan on September 12, 2009, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe during March 2010. Game director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. Reception to the games was highly positive, the two being amongst the highest rated DS games of all time on Metacritic. Commercially, the two are among the best-selling Nintendo DS games of all time, with combined sales of 10million units as of July 29, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil's main {{thesis is}} that these {{hierarchical}} pattern recognizers are used not just for sensing the world, but for nearly all aspects of thought. For example, Kurzweil says memory recall {{is based on the}} same patterns that were used when sensing the world in the first place. Kurzweil says that learning is critical to human intelligence. A computer version of the neocortex would initially be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> born baby, unable to do much.

During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, always like a family away from home.

25|$|Though {{the film}} was simply titled The Empire Strikes Back in its {{original}} promotional materials, the film still started with the title Star Wars on-screen which {{was followed by the}} opening crawl that gave the film's subtitle as Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, causing some surprise among cinema goers at the time as the original Star Wars film had not been given an episode number or subtitle for its first release in 1977. However, Episode IV: A New Hope was added to its opening crawl from its 1981 re-release onwards. <b>Like</b> <b>A</b> <b>New</b> Hope, The Empire Strikes Back was rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America, and certificate U in the United Kingdom. This original version was released on CED in 1984 and on VHS and Laserdisc several times during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

However, the master tapes of the {{unreleased}} recordings {{were said to}} have been destroyed in a fire at the record label's warehouse in 1976. The Library of Congress has a 1964 recording of an Ibn Ali solo improvisation, recorded at Roach's home.

500|$|The {{original}} Destruction Derby {{was developed}} in seven months, resulting in a few design flaws and the cutting of several ideas {{that could not be}} implemented within that time frame. According to producer Martin Edmondson, Destruction Derby 2 is a rewrite of the original, with only the 2D collision algorithms remaining intact. The engine was rewritten to handle the larger tracks incorporating obstacles such as hills and jumps, while the car dynamics were also redesigned. The collision routines were extended so cars can handle being flipped over. [...] Edmondson stated that Destruction Derby 2 felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> game rather than merely a sequel with more tracks.|$|E

Bach uses recitative to introduce the chorale by evoking the [...] "gift of communion", while the chorale stanza expresses the longing for this gift, mentioning thirst and hunger. The melody sounds sometimes <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> melody, expressing that a personal longing. The violoncello piccolo in continuous motion [...] "envelops the soprano's voice in a quasi womb-like blanketing of divine reassurance",as Mincham phrases it.|$|E

His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem. Overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round. The result of the fight remains controversial, as Overeem tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone prior to his next fight. Lesnar then announced his retirement from MMA, mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying [...] "tonight was the last time you'll see me in the octagon".|$|E
500|$|Spiderland {{has also}} been said by Michael Alan Goldberg {{to have been a}} {{considerable}} influence on post-rock bands Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Isis and Explosions in the Sky.

[...] PJ Harvey has included Spiderland in a list called Ten For Today, which were records she was enjoying listening to in 1992. Bob Nastanovich of Pavement and Mark Clifford of Seefeel have also cited Spiderland as among their favorite albums. The album cover of Spiderland was recreated by The Shins in the music video for [...] "New Slang".|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Columbia {{released}} [...] {{as both a}} two-CD set and a three-CD {{version with}} a 150-page hardcover book. The set contains live performances and outtakes from selected studio albums from Oh Mercy to Modern Times, as well as soundtrack contributions and collaborations with David Bromberg and Ralph Stanley. The pricing of the album—the two-CD set went on sale for $18.99 and the three-CD version for $129.99—led to complaints about [...] "rip-off packaging" [...] from some fans and commentators. The release was widely acclaimed by critics. The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to one reviewer that this volume of old outtakes [...] "feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Bob Dylan record, {{not only for the}} astonishing freshness of the material, but also for the incredible sound quality and organic feeling of everything here." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterlife {{beliefs in}} the Isis cult were {{probably}} connected with Osiris. The ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris lived on in the Duat after death, {{thanks in part to}} Isis's help, and that after their deaths they could be revived like him with the assistance of other deities, including Isis. These beliefs may well have carried over into the Greco-Roman Isis cult. The symbolism found in Lucius's first initiation, with its references to death and to the sun in the Egyptian underworld, suggests that it involved Osirian afterlife beliefs, even though Osiris is not mentioned in the description of the rite. As Robert Turcan puts it, when Lucius is revealed to the crowd after his initiation he is [...] "honoured almost <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Osiris, saved and regenerated through the ineffable powers of Isis. The palms radiating from his head were the signs of the Sun triumphing over death." ...|$|E
