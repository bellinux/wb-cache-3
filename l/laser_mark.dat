50|$|A {{new method}} of <b>marking</b> using <b>lasers</b> is now available, which is {{especially}} valuable for delicate items and hollowware, {{which would be}} damaged or distorted by the punching process. <b>Laser</b> <b>marking</b> also means that finished articles {{do not need to}} be re-finished. <b>Laser</b> <b>marking</b> works by using high power lasers to evaporate material from the metal surface. Two methods exist, 2D and 3D <b>laser</b> <b>marking.</b> 2D <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> burns the outline of the hallmarks into the object, while 3D <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> better simulates the marks made by punching.|$|R

50|$|Marking and {{printing}} {{is the first}} and foremost step of the UID Compliance process. This marking is nothing but the 2D data matrix code. Dot peen, chemical etch, <b>laser</b> <b>mark,</b> durable polyester or ink jet are generally used for marking. After conforming to the set standards with regard to printing and marking, {{the next step is}} syntax and formatting. Before the items are ready to be received they must be scanned and tracked for checking accuracy and hence this step is crucial. Then comes the reporting phase where the UID meeting requirements are tracked to the item-specific location. The UID data is submitted to the WAWF (Wide Area Work Flow) and UID Registry In the last step of UID compliance. All the contracts, deliverables and government properties possessed by the contractors need to be marked with this 2D data matrix code standard.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> {{as one of the}} progressive and environment friendly technologies with utilisation in many branches of industry. Engraving and other types of <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> of different types of materials are very actual technologies these days. <b>Laser</b> <b>marking</b> decreases the waste creation in comparison with the other classical marking technologies, which use paintings or created chips. In this experimental investigation the <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> surface texturing of material AL 99, 7 according to STN 42 4003 : 1993 - 08 (STN EN 573) has been conducted.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a secure anti-counterfeiting {{solution}} {{based on the}} ex- traction of a unique identifier out of the random profile of laser marks that are engraved on the surface or in the bulk of physical objects.

Indeed, reproducing a mark would be so expensive that it thwarts any attempt to build a twin of a given mark. Actually, we rely on the resolution difference {{that can be achieved}} between the engraving which can be seen as pretty coarse, and the much more precise reading process.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the question;“ does permanent <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> affect the mechanical {{performance of a}} metallic medical component?” The literature review revealed the surprising fact that very little has been presented or studied even though intuition suggests that its effect could be detrimental to a component's fatigue life. A brief investigation of <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> suggests that defects greater than 25 [*]μm are possible. A theoretical investigation further suggests that this is unlikely to cause issues with relation to fast fracture but is highly likely to cause fatigue life issues. An experimental investigation confirmed that <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> reduced the fatigue life of a component. This combination of lines of evidence suggests, strongly, that positioning of <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> is highly critical {{and should not be}} left to chance. It is further suggested that medical device designers, especially those related to orthopaedic implants, should consider the position of <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> in the design process. They should ensure that it is in an area of low stress amplitude. They should also ensure that they investigate worst-case scenarios when considering the stress environment; this, however, may not be straightforward...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) {{provides}} a circumferential {{scan of the}} esophageal wall layers and has potential to improve detection of neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE). The novel VLE <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> system enables direct in vivo marking of suspicious areas as identified on VLE. These <b>laser</b> <b>marked</b> areas can subsequently be targeted for biopsies. The aim was to evaluate the visibility and positional accuracy of <b>laser</b> <b>marks</b> (LMs) in different esophageal tissue types on white light endoscopy (WLE) and VLE. Methods: Patients with BE with or without neoplasia underwent imaging with VLE. Protocol refinements were practiced in a learning phase. In the second phase, visibility of LMs was assessed by random marking in squamous, BE, and gastric tissue. In phase 3, positional accuracy of the LMs was tested by identifying and <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> surrogate targets (endoscopically placed cautery marks). In the final phase, the most suspicious areas for neoplasia were identified in each patient using VLE, targeted by LMs, and biopsy samples subsequently obtained. Results: Sixteen patients with BE were included (14 men; median age, 68 years), 1 of whom was included twice in different study phases. Worst histologic diagnoses were 9 non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE), 3 low-grade dysplasia (LGD), 4 high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and 1 early adenocarcinoma (EAC). In total, 222 LMs were placed, of which 97 % was visible on WLE. All LMs were visible on VLE directly after marking, and 86 % could be confirmed during post hoc analysis. LM targeting was successful with positional accuracy in 85 % of cautery marks. Inaccurate targeting was caused by system errors or difficult cautery mark visualization on VLE. In the final phase (5 patients), 18 areas suspicious on VLE were identified, which were all successfully targeted by LMs (3 EAC, 3 HGD, 1 LGD, and 11 NDBE). Mean VLE procedure time was 22 minutes (+/- 6 minutes standard deviation); mean endoscopy time was 56 minutes (+/- 17 minutes). No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This first-in-human study of VLE-guided <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> {{was found to be}} feasible and safe in 17 procedures. Most LMs were visible on WLE and VLE. Targeting VLE areas of interest proved to be highly successful. VLE-guided <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> may improve the detection and delineation of Barrett's neoplasia in the futur...|$|R
