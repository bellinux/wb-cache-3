To-morrow I propose taking her out before {{the heat of the day}} begins--not merely to avoid embarrassment, after what has happened with Mrs. Lecount, but because the morning air and the morning quiet are essential in these nervous cases. We are early people here--we shall start at seven o'clock. If you are early, too, and if you would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> I need hardly say that we can feel no objection to your company on our morning walk. The hour, I am aware, is an unusual one--but later in the day my niece may be resting on the sofa, and may not be able to see visitors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} {{absolutely}} impossible," [...] the Pole said, [...] "for you {{to succeed in}} making your way in safety. Every town is full of Russian troops, who are forever scouring the roads. It {{would be out of}} the question for any one except a native to succeed in getting through, and even a Pole would find difficulty, so strictly is every one questioned. Of course their object is to prevent our bands from increasing, and to capture any of us who may be returning to our homes. We only manage to assemble by marching constantly in the woods by paths known only to villagers. You would find it, too, a matter of extreme difficulty to cross the frontier, even should you gain it, as there is a perfect cordon of troops posted along the frontier, to prevent any one from escaping. Once in Austria, you would be safe, but you could not cross into Prussia, even if you succeeded in passing the Russian troops stationed along that line; for Prussia, who is as harsh a master to the Poles under her rule as is Russia, acts as policeman for the latter, and turns all fugitives back who may cross the frontier. At present I fear I can give you no assistance; but there is a talk of a union of several of our bands further west, and in that case you might travel with us, and we might pass you on, and see that you had guides. For the present I can either lodge you in the village where our wounded are now taken, and where it is not likely that the Russians will find you, at any rate for the present; or if you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> I need not say how glad we shall be to receive you as comrades. England has always been the friend of Poland and more than one of your countrymen has fought in the Polish ranks. As England is at war at present with Russia, you will be doing as much service by fighting her here as in the Crimea. Here, too, you will have the satisfaction that you are fighting for an oppressed people struggling for freedom against tremendous odds." ...|$|E
5000|$|Concepts from Fluxus art {{were used}} for the album; Ono has used ideas from it before. The album opens with an improvised {{recording}} titled [...] "Cambridge 1969", recorded on 2 March 1969 at Cambridge University, before a live audience, which became Lennon and Ono's second performance together, but their first released performance and the first performance by a Beatle without the rest of the band since their main line-up's formation. The piece takes up all of side one and consists of Ono's vocalisations and screaming accompanied by electric guitar feedback from Lennon. Saxophonist John Tchicai and percussionist John Stevens join Ono and Lennon {{near the end of the}} piece. Throughout the performance, Lennon kept his back to the audience. The original version of the piece was longer. In a 2010 interview with Cambridge News, Tchicai said that the concert was split in two: the first set was Lennon and Ono, and the other consisted of jazz improvisation players. Recalled Tchica, Lennon and Ono said to the players: [...] "If you would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> for some improvisation, please do." [...] Barnett said that Lennon had been [...] "trying to show off and be more avant-garde than anyone in avant-garde music".|$|E

The announcement was immediately hailed by Texas Congressman Pete Sessions, chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, who said, [...] "we need Republicans <b>like</b> Andy Barr <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in Congress <b>to</b> cut spending, lower taxes and reduce the national debt." [...] Chandler responded to the announcement by declaring, [...] "Next year, voters will have a very simple choice to make: whether to protect and save Social Security and Medicare, or to end them," [...] an allusion to Barr's publicly expressed support for Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan's budget proposal.|$|R
30|$|Pragmatics {{research}} has shown that conventionality can enhance implicature strength (Taguchi 2008, 2009). Conventionality refers to “common knowledge of the way things are done” and comprises of conventions of language and conventions of usage (Morgan 1978, p. 279). Concerning conventions of language, certain linguistic forms are conventionalized to convey pragmatic functions (hereafter Lin). For example, people say there you go to express agreement. For conventions of usage, certain discourse patterns can reliably convey communicative functions (hereafter Dis). For example, people often provide a reason (e.g., I have already had another plan.) without explicitly saying no to reject an invitation (e.g., Would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> for dinner?). When implicatures are conveyed through conventionalized linguistic forms (Lin) or predicable discourse patterns (Dis), listeners do not have to extensively process contextual cues for meaning interpretation, because meaning can be derived directly from those conventionalized features. Consequently, the processing effort involved in implicature comprehension is reduced.|$|E
40|$|Several China Beat {{contributors}} {{have just}} returned from {{the annual meeting of}} the American Historical Association, held this year in New York City from January 2 - 5. While there was normal association business aplenty (including presenting historical research, catching up with colleagues from other institutions, and for some of us hearing Eugenia Lean give a stimulating talk after the Conference on Asian History’s luncheon, in which she explored the interplay between science and gender in the Republican period), the meeting also gave the editors of China in 2008 : A Year of Great Significance a chance to sit down with Rowman 2 ̆ 6 Littlefield editor Susan McEachern to chat about the book’s final months of production. Meeting over breakfast, we talked about the final pieces still to finish (a highlight: Ken Pomeranz’s “Afterword” that takes stock of the event-filled final months of 2008 and draws attention to some environmental issues that don’t always get the attention they deserve) as well as more pragmatic issues like how to promote the book (we’ll be flogging it in various locations and will give you plenty of heads up in advance, in case you’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> at any signings and the like). It’s rare for turn-around on a book to be quite this quick–we’re planning a mid-March launch–but it certainly suits the timeliness of the blog format...|$|E

For this reason, FEPSAC must now run a yearly General Assembly – the second took place on the 15 th of March 2017. During this General Assembly, President Anne-Marie Elbe, General Secretary Nadine Debois, and Treasurer Antonis Hatzigeorgiadis presented their reports and all reports were unanimously accepted by the FEPSAC members. Furthermore, to respond to the demand of European sport psychologists to meet more frequently than every four years, it was decided to change our 4 -yearly FEPSAC Congress onto a bi-annual periodicity. Therefore, after the forthcoming FEPSAC Congress being held in Münster, Germany in 2019, the following congress will then take place in 2022. We encourage our FEPSAC group members to submit their candidature in order to host such a great event as soon as the call is open. Please do not hesitate to visit our website and contact us should you require further information. FEPSAC evening at the ECSS congress in Essen FEPSAC organises a networking evening for all interested in sport and exercise psychology during the Congress of the European College of Sport Science (ECSS) in Essen, Germany. The evening, open to all, will take place on the 5 th of July as of 21 : 30 at the location “Das Schön”. FEPSAC members will be offered a free drink. Please send an email to office@fepsac. com by June the 15 th should you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in order to book you in. Review of FEPSAC internship programme In light with our goal to increase mobility and improve the quality and breadth of educational experience within Europe, FEPSAC provided an internship platform on the website as from July 2016. In the year 2016, a total of 18 interested potential supervisees used this opportunity to contact the supervisors, leading to five successfully arranged internships. The supervisees were integrated in ongoing research projects by helping with data collection (e. g., during an experiment), data analysis, reviewing of literature and writing up short reports. In order to further promote this initiative, we would like to encourage more potential supervisors to provide internship opportunities on our website and, thereby, support the growth of sport and exercise psychology within Europe. Further information available at: [URL] FEPSAC and social media – keep in touch with FEPSAC Facebook ([URL] Twitter ([URL] On behalf of the MC, we would like to thank all those who contributed to the making of this Newsletter. We look forward to receiving more contributions for forthcoming Issues so do not hesitate to send them by email to office@fepsac. com...|$|E
60|$|Clive was {{not easy}} until he had the sea {{between him and his}} misfortune: and now Thomas Newcome had the chance of making that tour with his son, which in early days had been such a {{favourite}} project with the good man. They travelled Rhineland and Switzerland together--they crossed into Italy--went from Milan to Venice (where Clive saluted the greatest painting in the world--the glorious 'Assumption' of Titian)--they went to Trieste and over the beautiful Styrian Alps to Vienna--they beheld Danube, and the plain where the Turk and Sobieski fought. They travelled at a prodigious fast pace. They did not speak much to one another. They were a pattern pair of English travellers: I dare say many persons whom they met smiled to observe them; and shrugged their shoulders at the aspect of ces Anglais. They did not know the care in the young traveller's mind; and the deep tenderness and solicitude of the elder. Clive wrote to say it was a very pleasant tour, but I think I should not have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> it. Let <b>us</b> dismiss it in this single sentence. Other gentlemen have taken the same journey, and with sorrow perhaps as their silent fellow-traveller. How you remember the places afterwards, and the thoughts which pursued you! If in after days, when your grief is dead and buried, you revisit the scenes in which it was your companion, how its ghost rises and shows itself again! Suppose this part of Mr. Clive's life were to be described at length in several chapters, and not in a single brief sentence, what dreary pages they would be! In two or three months our friends saw a number of men, cities, mountains, rivers, and what not. It was yet early autumn when they were back in France again, and September found them at Brussels, where James Binnie, Esq., and his family were established in comfortable quarters, and where we may be sure Clive and his father were very welcome.|$|R
