40|$|Dwell {{sensitivity}} in {{titanium alloys}} is generally {{attributed to the}} phenomenon of load shedding, which is a time dependent redistribution of stress from weak grains, with their c-axis perpendicular to the loading direction, to strong grains, with their c-axis approximately parallel to the loading direction. This leads {{to the formation of}} internal quasi-cleavage facets on the basal planes of strong grains. In this paper, the effect of <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> on the fatigue behaviour of drawn Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wires is investigated, because these wires do not contain strong α grains. It has been found that this leads to a different dwell fatigue behaviour compared to what has been described in literature. In the case of drawn wires, introducing <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> promoted crack initiation at the surface, through the formation of a facet on a prismatic plane of a surface grain that was oriented for very easy prismatic slip. This was confirmed by sectioning facets, using focused ion beam milling, and electron backscatter diffraction measurements. Because of the specific crystallographic texture of drawn wires, the phenomenon of load shedding is less pronounced, and there is no formation of internal facets. The amount of cycles to failure was reduced by two to three orders of magnitude compared to fatigue tests without <b>load</b> <b>holds.</b> The time to failure remained similar, and was even higher for some dwell fatigue tests. There was a significant amount of strain accumulation during dwell fatigue tests. The maximum strain increased more rapidly in tests with 30 s <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> compared to tests with 120 s <b>load</b> <b>holds,</b> due to creep recovery during the periods in between <b>load</b> <b>holds.</b> During these periods, the strain decreased, even though a small tensile load was still applied. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the long-term mechanical, hydraulic, and transport characteristics of rock fractures should be predicted in advance by considering {{the issue of the}} underground deposits of the energy byproducts of high-level radioactive waste. This paper presents slide-hold-slide direct shear–flow coupling experiments conducted for mortar and granite specimens with single fractures so as to investigate the effects of <b>load</b> <b>holding</b> on the mechanical properties of rock joints. From the experimental results, it is confirmed that the shear strength of the mortar replica specimens increases and the permeability decreases during 3 days of <b>load</b> <b>holding.</b> However, no significant changes are observed for the mechanical or the hydro-mechanical properties of the granite specimen even after 20 days of <b>load</b> <b>holding.</b> It is also confirmed that the shear strength of the mortar specimens increases in both short- and long-time holding cases. However, the {{evolution of}} shear strength recovery is found to be different for the two cases. This is because the dominant factor in the shear strength recovery during short-time holding may be attributed to a purely mechanical process, like creep deformation at the contacting asperities, while the shear strength recovery during long-time holding is affected by both mechanical and chemical processes. Moreover, to reproduce the shear strength recovery during short-time holding, we develop a direct shear model by employing a temporal variation in the dilation that occurs during <b>load</b> <b>holding.</b> The model predictions are in relatively good agreement with the experimental observations in the range of the short-holding period...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{compression}} {{experiments on}} micrometre-sized aluminium pillars, fabricated by focused-ion beam milling, using a flat-punch nanoindenter revealed that post-yield deformation during constant-rate loading was jerky with interspersing strain bursts and linear elastic segments. Under <b>load</b> <b>hold,</b> the pillars crept mainly {{by means of}} sporadic strain bursts. In this work, a Monte Carlo simulation model is developed, with two statistics gathered from the load-ramp experiments as input, {{to account for the}} jerky deformation during the load ramp as well as <b>load</b> <b>hold.</b> Under load-ramp conditions, the simulations successfully captured other experimental observations made independently from the two inputs, namely, the diverging behaviour of the jerky stress-strain response at higher stresses, the increase in burst frequency and burst size with stress and the overall power-law distribution of the burst size. The model also predicts creep behaviour agreeable with the experimental observations, namely, the occurrence of sporadic bursts with frequency depending on stress, creep time and pillar dimensions. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paralyzed {{musculoskeletal}} system retains a remarkable degree of plasticity after {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). In response to reduced activity, muscle atrophies and shifts toward a fast-fatigable phenotype arising from numerous changes in histochemistry and metabolic enzymes. The loss of routine gravitational and muscular loads removes a critical stimulus for maintenance of bone mineral density (BMD), pre-cipitating neurogenic osteoporosis in paralyzed limbs. The pri-mary adaptations of bone to reduced use are demineralization of epiphyses and thinning of the diaphyseal cortical wall. Elec-trical stimulation of paralyzed muscle markedly reduces dele-terious post-SCI adaptations.

40|$|International audienceCallovo-Oxfordian argillite, {{obtained}} from the ANDRA underground research laboratory in Meuse/Haute-Marne (France), is characterized as a multiphase material. The argillite is composed of carbonate inclusions (10 - 50 mu m) embedded in an argillaceous matrix (representing expanding clay minerals, such as smectites). The matrix itself is also multiphase, composed of clay aggregates of 1 pm-size carbonate and quartz inclusions. The high sensitivity of the mechanical behaviour of argillite to saturation is an important characteristic of this material {{as it has been}} previously demonstrated in macro-scale mechanical experiments performed under varying degrees of humidity. The study presented here consists of grids of nano-indentation tests performed under controlled saturation conditions. The influence of the <b>load</b> <b>hold</b> time before unloading has been studied. Series of indentations were performed without or with <b>load</b> <b>hold,</b> which led to consider instantaneous or deferred unloading moduli respectively. The experimental procedure employed allows the micro-mechanical properties of the different phases (matrix and inclusions) to be determined under controlled hydration and therefore under partially, saturated conditions. Several series of measurements were performed at relative humidity levels of 50 %, 85 %, 90 % and 95 %, and at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. A statistical analysis enabled to discriminate the deferred unloading modulus of the different phases. At 50 % humidity, we measured a mean deferred unloading modulus of 16 GPa for the clay matrix (a mean instantaneous unloading modulus of 13 GPa was observed for the clay matrix and moduli higher than 70 GPa were measured for the carbonate macro-inclusions). The mean deferred unloading modulus of the matrix appears to decrease with increasing saturation; at 95 % humidity (near-saturation) it is less than 5 GPa. However, it was impossible to verify the instantaneous unloading modulus of the carbonate macro-indusions at this high-level of saturation...|$|R
