5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy and how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> learn a dance program, there is, {{generally}} speaking, universal {{agreement that}} the result should be confident dancers that can handle themselves on a public dance floor {{with a variety of}} callers, unfamiliar choreography, and the challenge of dancing with strangers at the learned level.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{typically}} a dedicated machine tool is used. It has {{four to eight}} spindles and usually a rotary table. The cycle time {{for this type of}} setup is determined by the longest individual operation, which in this situation is determined by how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> plunge and retract the tool through the bore. Throughput can be increased by completing two workpieces on each cycle; this is achieved by having two identical stations for each tool size so that two workpieces can be operated on concurrently.|$|E

500|$|Dessau {{considered}} the episode [...] "genius", {{and described the}} twist ending as [...] "genuinely unexpected". In The Observer, Mike Bradley called [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] a [...] "priceless silent farce", but, in the newspaper's sister publication The Guardian, Luke Holland was more critical. He said the episode was [...] "an almost wordless half-hour of physical comedy", and that [...] "it plays out like a French farce, its comedic strokes far broader" [...] than those of [...] "Sardines". [...] "If you find two men silently mime-arguing about how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> have a poo funny", he continued, [...] "you're on sturdy ground here". Later, a review by Phelim O'Neill of the Inside No. 9 series 1 boxset published on theguardian.com described [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "engaging, tense, funny, frightening– and accessibly experimental". The episode was compared negatively to the later instalment [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] in an Irish Daily Mail review—"A Quiet Night In" [...] was called [...] "patchy"—but was compared positively to [...] "Last Gasp" [...] by Rebecca McQuillan of The Herald, who said that [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] was [...] "something close to comedy genius". An anonymous review in the South African newspaper The Saturday Star picked out [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as the strongest episode of the first series.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Christgau {{was less}} enthusiastic, writing in MSN Music that Maxwell [...] "really {{believes}} {{that the quality of}} the sex is measured by its curlicues—and by how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> come true"; he named [...] "Badhabits" [...] and [...] "Helpsomebody" [...] as the album's highlights. The Observers Paul Mardles was more critical, accusing Maxwell of exhibiting a [...] "fondness for cliche". Allison Stewart from The Washington Post called the album [...] "cerebral but impersonal" [...] and felt that it [...] "never quite breaks free of its self-imposed restraints". Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt said Maxwell's [...] "sentiments rarely transcend the boudoir — and listeners lulled by the album's unvaryingly sleek, high-gloss beats may just drift off to dreamland before they get there". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis wrote that several songs [...] "never rise above the level of pleasant background music", which he nonetheless found [...] "gorgeously recorded, tastefully arranged and beautifully played".|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} {{permutation}} patterns {{began in earnest}} with Donald Knuth's consideration of stack-sorting in 1968. [...] Knuth showed that the permutation π can be sorted by a stack {{if and only if}} π avoids 231, and that the stack-sortable permutations are enumerated by the Catalan numbers. [...] Knuth also raised questions about sorting with deques. [...] In particular, Knuth's question asking how many permutation of n elements are obtainable {{with the use of a}} deque remains open. [...] Shortly thereafter, [...] investigated sorting by networks of stacks, while [...] showed that the permutation π can be sorted by a deque if and only if for all k, π avoids 5,2,7,4,...,4k+1,4kminus&2,3,4k,1, and 5,2,7,4,...,4k+3,4k,1,4k+2,3, and every permutation that can be obtained from either of these by interchanging the last two elements or the 1 and the 2. [...] Because this collection of permutations is infinite (in fact, it is the first published example of an infinite antichain of permutations), it is not immediately clear how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> decide if a permutation can be sorted by a deque. [...] later presented a linear (in the length of π) time algorithm which determines if π can be sorted by a deque.|$|E

6000|$|My uncle {{smiled at}} these sallies at the time, but afterwards, when I went {{back with him}} to the Pharmacy--the low-class {{business}} grew brisker in the evening and they kept open late--he reverted to it in a low expository tone.

6000|$|Since tea I {{have taken}} a stroll from the hotel in a {{different}} direction from heretofore, and passed the Swan Inn, where Scott used to go daily to get a draught of liquor, when he was visiting Wordsworth, who had no wine nor other inspiriting fluid in his house. It stands directly on the wayside,--a small, whitewashed house, with an addition in the rear that seems to have been built since Scott's time. On the door is the painted sign of a swan, and the name [...] "Scott's Swan Hotel." [...] I walked a considerable distance beyond it, but, a shower cooling up, I turned back, entered the inn, and, following the mistress into a snug little room, was served with a glass of bitter ale. It is a very plain and homely inn, and certainly could not have satisfied Scott's wants if he had required anything very far-fetched or delicate in his potations. I found two Westmoreland peasants in the room, with ale before them. One went away almost immediately; but the other remained, and, entering into conversation with him, {{he told me that he}} was going to New Zealand, and expected to sail in September. I announced myself as an American, and he said that a large party had lately gone from hereabouts to America; but he seemed not to understand that there was any distinction between Canada and the States. These people had gone to Quebec. He was a very civil, well-behaved, kindly sort of person, of a simple character, which I took to belong to the class and locality, rather than to himself individually. I could not very well understand all that he said, owing to his provincial dialect; and when he spoke to his own countrymen, or to the women of the house, I really could but just catch a word here and there. How <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> melt English down into a homogeneous mass! He told me that there was a public library in Grasmere to which he has access in common with the other inhabitants, and a reading-room connected with it, where he reads The Times in the evening. There was no American smartness in his mind. When I left the house, it was showering briskly; but the drops quite ceased, and the clouds began to break away before I reached my hotel, and I saw the new moon over my right shoulder.|$|E
