5|$|Besides the Holy See, another Catholic see has {{the right}} to bear the triple tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of <b>Lisbon.</b> The title of Patriarch of <b>Lisbon</b> was created in 1716 and is held by the {{archbishop}} of <b>Lisbon</b> since 1740. While the coat of arms of the Holy See combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the <b>Lisbon</b> Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and a pastoral staff.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} in ratifying the <b>Lisbon</b> Treaty, the seventh {{parliament}} was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the <b>Lisbon</b> Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the <b>Lisbon</b> Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.|$|E

5|$|Marcus Alonzo Hanna {{was born}} on September 24, 1837, in New <b>Lisbon</b> (in 1895 renamed <b>Lisbon),</b> Ohio, to Dr. Leonard and Samantha Hanna. Leonard's father, Benjamin Hanna, a Quaker of Scotch-Irish descent, was a wealthy store owner in New <b>Lisbon.</b> Dr. Hanna practiced in Columbiana County, where New <b>Lisbon</b> was located, until he {{suffered}} a spinal injury while riding. After the accident, he joined the family business, B., L., and T. Hanna, by now a major grocery and goods brokering firm. Samantha, née Converse, and her parents had journeyed west from Vermont when she was 11; she was of English, possibly Irish, and French Huguenot descent.|$|E
5|$|Anshei Israel Synagogue is a {{historic}} synagogue located in <b>Lisbon,</b> Connecticut, United States. The Orthodox congregation was founded with 15 families and constructed the synagogue in 1936. It was built by George Allen & Sons. The interior is a single room that is lined with five benches before an altar which held the sacred ark. The congregation's membership dwindled throughout the 1940s and 1950s, limiting the services to holidays before finally closing in the early 1980s. Rules in the congregation were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World, as there was no curtain to separate the sexes and distant members were allowed to drive {{part of the way}} to its services. The Town of <b>Lisbon</b> took ownership of the property in the 1980s. The synagogue is currently maintained by the <b>Lisbon</b> Historical Society. The synagogue was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Fielding died {{approximately}} two years later, his death {{caused by the}} gout and asthma that had, in part, compelled him to end the Journals run. In his final year, he travelled to Portugal {{in the hope of}} recovery. He wrote an account of his travels during this time, entitled The Journal of a Voyage to <b>Lisbon,</b> which was published in England in 1755. Fielding died in <b>Lisbon</b> on 8 October 1754, and was buried in the Os Cyprestes cemetery, a local English burial ground.|$|E

5|$|The Celtic {{team from}} that year has also {{received}} much recognition. They have {{become known as}} the <b>Lisbon</b> Lions and are widely considered the greatest team in Celtic's history. All of Celtic's players were born within a 30-mile radius of Glasgow. In 2000, Celtic named a stand at Celtic Park after the <b>Lisbon</b> Lions. They also won the BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The FA Cup win in 1973 {{meant that}} Sunderland, {{for the first}} time in their history, had {{qualified}} for a European competition, in this case the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were first drawn against Hungarian side Vasas Budapest, who they beat 3–0 on aggregate. In the next round Sunderland were drawn against Sporting <b>Lisbon.</b> They won the first leg 2–1 at Roker Park, but in the return leg in <b>Lisbon</b> they were beaten 2–0, and were thus knocked out of the competition in the second round.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, {{settling}} in New <b>Lisbon</b> (now <b>Lisbon).</b> He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New <b>Lisbon,</b> Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church {{at the age of}} sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.|$|E
5|$|According to Harmetz, {{the usual}} route out of Germany, {{at least for}} people in the film industry, was not via Morocco and <b>Lisbon</b> but via Vienna, Prague, Paris, and England.

5|$|Back in <b>Lisbon,</b> the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave <b>Lisbon</b> with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Before the Treaty of <b>Lisbon</b> {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use. This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of <b>Lisbon,</b> after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.|$|E
5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged {{to allow a}} {{referendum}} on the EU Treaty of <b>Lisbon.</b> On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in <b>Lisbon</b> of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of the}} House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public {{a referendum on the}} original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha is {{the seat}} of the Comunidade Intermunicipal do Oeste (OesteCIM, Intermunicipal Community of the West). For {{statistical}} purposes, Caldas is in the NUTS III Oeste (West) subregion— with OesteCIM—within the NUTS II Centro (Centre) region, {{which is part of the}} NUTS I division called Continente (Continental, or Mainland, Portugal). The municipality is part of the Comissão de Coordenação e Desenvolvimento Regional de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (CCDR LVT, Regional Commission for Coordination and Development of <b>Lisbon</b> and Tagus Valley). Caldas da Rainha belongs to the historical province of Estremadura and to the district of Leiria. In the Roman Catholic Church, the parish of Caldas da Rainha belongs to the Caldas da Rainha - Peniche vicariate of the Patriarchate of <b>Lisbon.</b>|$|E

5|$|In June 1904, Beilhart {{invited the}} public to an 'open house' where he {{attempted}} to explain the motives and beliefs of the society. Over 400 people attended the gathering. Among them, it has been claimed, were Clarence Darrow and Elbert Hubbard but {{this has not been}} documented, although Beilhart is known to have visited Hubbard in East Aurora and Darrow was a frequent visitor to the society during the Chicago and Ingleside years. In the end, the society's rejection of marriage {{on the grounds that it}} made a 'slave of the woman', and the misinterpretations of their views on free-love were too much for the people of <b>Lisbon</b> to accept. In late 1904, the group left <b>Lisbon</b> for Chicago, in the hope that their progressive ideas might be better tolerated there.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's <b>Lisbon</b> mission {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key {{link between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal bowed to British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in <b>Lisbon</b> remained open. With the Carnation Revolution of 1974, Portugal's African policy was suddenly reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories to maintain it, the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist guerrillas in each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975. Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered {{the closure of the}} Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in <b>Lisbon</b> formally closed on 1 May 1975.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's naval {{campaign}} formed two phases. The first involved the Royalist fleet sailing from Kinsale in Ireland to <b>Lisbon</b> in Portugal. He took three large ships, , the Convertine and the Swallow, accompanied by four smaller vessels. Rupert sailed to <b>Lisbon</b> taking several prizes on route, {{where he received}} a warm welcome from King John IV, the ruler of recently independent Portugal, who was a supporter of Charles II. Blake arrived shortly afterwards with a Parliamentary fleet, and an armed stand-off ensued. Tensions rose, skirmishes began to break out and King John became increasingly keen for his Royalist guests to leave. In October 1650, Rupert's fleet, now comprising six vessels, broke out and headed into the Mediterranean. Still pursued by Blake, the Royalist fleet manoeuvred up the Spanish coast, steadily losing vessels to their pursuers.|$|E
5|$|Spanish railway {{operator}} RENFE said in 2009 that it {{was interested}} in running AVE services from Spain to London via Paris, Lyon, Barcelona, Madrid and <b>Lisbon</b> (using the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line) once its AVE network was connected to France via the Barcelona to Figueres and Perpignan to Figueres lines in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The crusaders {{agreed to}} help the King attack <b>Lisbon,</b> with a solemn {{agreement}} that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The Siege of <b>Lisbon</b> lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, {{but some of them}} set sail and continued to the Holy Land. Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped capture Santarém earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer Sintra, Almada, Palmela and Setúbal, and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{unrest in}} Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the Carnation Revolution, a {{peaceful}} leftist military coup d'état in <b>Lisbon,</b> ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of Marcelo Caetano. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, {{and the new}} head of government, General António de Spínola, called for a ceasefire. With the change of government in <b>Lisbon,</b> many soldiers refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the Lusaka Accord signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete hand-over of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary of the founding of FRELIMO.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in June 1950 was crucial for NATO as it raised the apparent threat of all Communist countries working together, and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans. Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) was formed to direct forces in Europe, and began work under Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower in January 1951. In September 1950, the NATO Military Committee called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets, subsequently reaffirming this position at the February 1952 meeting of the North Atlantic Council in <b>Lisbon.</b> The <b>Lisbon</b> conference, seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO's Long-Term Defence Plan, called for an expansion to ninety-six divisions. However this requirement was dropped the following year to roughly thirty-five divisions with heavier use {{to be made of}} nuclear weapons. At this time, NATO could call on about fifteen ready divisions in Central Europe, and another ten in Italy and Scandinavia. Also at <b>Lisbon,</b> the post of Secretary General of NATO as the organization's chief civilian was created, and Lord Ismay was eventually appointed to the post.|$|E
5|$|The post {{was created}} by the Treaty of <b>Lisbon</b> and was subject to a debate over its exact role. Prior to <b>Lisbon,</b> the Presidency rotated in {{accordance}} with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an office of a head of state, merely a primus inter pares (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task of representing the Union externally. Now the leader of the Council Presidency country can still act as president when the permanent president is absent.|$|E
