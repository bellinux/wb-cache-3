40|$|The {{offshore}} {{petroleum industry}} is {{of critical importance}} to the global economy. <b>Offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations</b> are considered elements of critical national infrastructure in many nation-States and their security may have significant implications for national security and economic wellbeing. Violence at sea is a very common occurrence today and major petroleum producing and consuming States {{are concerned about the}} protection of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations</b> from attacks and unlawful interferences, especially acts of terrorism. In recent years, the international community has taken a number of regulatory measures to enhance the security of the maritime transport and offshore petroleum sectors. The thesis examines the types of security threats to <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations,</b> the types of attacks that have been carried out against <b>offshore</b> <b>installations,</b> and factors that make <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> attractive targets including their vulnerabilities and potential impacts that can result from deliberate attacks on these vital facilities. This thesis also analyses the international legal framework for maritime and offshore petroleum security with the aim of determining whether the international legal framework adequately addresses the protection and security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations.</b> Specifically, it analyses {{the law of the sea}} framework established under the umbrella of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 as well as other international legal instruments and regulatory measures pertaining to the security of <b>offshore</b> <b>installations.</b> The original contribution made by this thesis includes the compilation of a comprehensive chronology of attacks on and interferences with <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations,</b> the analysis of various security threats faced by <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations,</b> examination of factors that make <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations</b> attractive targets, and a detailed analysis of the international regulatory framework. The thesis concludes that there are gaps and limitations in the current international regulatory framework for the protection and security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations.</b> It argues that there is a scope for improvement in the international legal framework and that further regulatory changes are necessary at the international level in order to enhance security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations.</b> The thesis also provides several specific suggestions that would improve the international legal framework for the protection and security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{floating}} sheerlegs of SMIT {{are used}} for a large variety of tasks in sheltered, near shore as well as offshore environments. Generally the tasks vary from recovering operations (salvage) to inshore installation work. Originally, the usage of floating sheerlegs was driven by their robustness, needed for recovering work and shallow draft, needed for working near shore. In the past years the sheerlegs of SMIT became increasingly utilized for <b>installation</b> work <b>offshore.</b> As a result, {{the need for more}} detailed analysis showing the feasibility, related safety and reliability of operations emerged. In the engineering phase of such <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> projects these aspects are analyzed for each operational phase from load-out, towage to <b>offshore</b> lifting and <b>installation.</b> This paper addresses the crucial elements {{that need to be addressed}} when a floating sheerlegs is utilized for <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> work.

40|$|The Norwegian oil {{and energy}} {{department}} instructs operators {{to look at}} the possibility for electrification of future <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> with power from shore. The <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> at the Utsira formation may be suitable for this due to a high power demand and the distance from shore. The objective of this thesis has been to investigate requirements for an electrical power distribution system for these installations. A power distribution platform recieves power from the onshore grid through a HVDC link and distributes it through high-voltage AC cables to the <b>offshore</b> <b>installations.</b> The focus has been on the high-voltage AC part of the distribution system. Requirements and capacities for the following components have been investigated: Voltage source converter Transformers Circuit breakers HVAC Transmission cables In addition the option of integrating an offshore wind power plant in the high-voltage AC distribution system has been evaluated, as well as the modifications required for the mentioned components and the topology of the distribution system. A Simulink model of the distribution system was developed to test the solution for different load conditions. The <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> were modelled as a number of 28 MWinduction motors with a power factor of 0. 9. The voltage source converter was simplified to a constant power source and modelled as two PI controllers for power and voltage. The system currents and voltage levels from the steady state analysis are regarded as good estimates for the future realization of the distribution system with only power from shore. Future steady state analysis of the distribution system should look to the values presented in this thesis in order to verify if their results are within reasonable range. With a wind power plant (WPP) the system components must be able to withstand a higher short circuit current and the circuit breaker ratings must be modified. To avoid this, a current limiter (Is-limiter) could be introduced, which will prohibit the short circuit current contribution from the wind power plant. A new transformer will be required within the distribution system, and the capacity must be equal to the maximum capacity of the wind power plant. If the floating wind turbine technology evolves, a WPP together with power from shore should be capable of supplying <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> with power. The fast response and versatile control of the voltage source converter makes it well suitable for balancing the power of the WPP. The balancing would also require a maximum power reserve equal to the WPP capacity in the onshore grid. The <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> at Utsira formation is planned to start production in 2016 and will be operational to 2060. These installation could either be run with gas driven turbines located on the platforms or be supplied with power from onshore. Global warming and the world’s demand for gas may call for measures to supply future <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> with power from shore.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{the performance of a}} wind integrated oil & gas <b>offshore</b> <b>installation.</b> The motivation behind this is to reduce emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases from <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> that utilize natural gas turbines. A model of the wind integrated oil & gas installation is built and implemented in Matlab/Simulink. The simulations are focused on investigating the performance of the system for transient contingency conditions. Two subsystems are investigated separately. The wind energy system is implemented as a 6 MW direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generator. The generator connects to the oil & gas installation by a 2 -level back-to-back voltage source converter. An extensive control system allows for variable-speed operation to optimize power production. The configuration is found advantageous for use with oil & gas installations as the generator is decoupled from the platform transients by a DC-link. The oil & gas <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> is implemented as a 46 MVA gas turbine synchronous generator, two 8 MVA induction motor drives and a passive load of 16 MW. The gas turbine is shown to have a fast response in handling transients, and the induction motor drive is shown to have excellent speed and torque control. The wind integrated oil & gas <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> combines the two subsystems through a transmission line. The complete system is simulated for both varying wind speed operation and selected contingency events. The loss of passive load is found to give the biggest voltage transient. The biggest frequency transient is seen for the loss of one of the two gas turbines. All results are compared with the transient limits found in the NORSOK/IEC standards, and found to be within the requirements. The wind turbine is allowed to produce at maximum throughout the simulations, while the gas turbine is seen to balance the system to maintain the system frequency. The conclusion of the thesis is that integration of a wind turbine with an oil & gas <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> is feasible within the NORSOK/IEC standards. This is true for all scenarios and contingencies tested in this thesis. The results are discussed further in the thesis, with challenges and suggested further work pointed out...|$|R
