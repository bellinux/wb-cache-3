40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the social protection, if any, afforded to migrant workers in South Africa. To accomplish this purpose, the ambit {{of the concept of}} ‘social protection’ is investigated and the legal status and different categories of migrant workers are probed. The strands of social protection identified and evaluated in the study are: •	social assistance; •	social insurance; and •	<b>labour</b> <b>security.</b> Each of the categories that define the social protection afforded to migrant workers is examined. The ILO, UN and SADC have numerous standards and instruments dedicated to the extension of social protection as well as the protection of migrant workers globally. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, acknowledges that international law must be considered when interpreting the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, the courts must prefer a reasonable interpretation of legislation, consistent with international law. Each component of social protection, as well as migration, is regulated by different legislative instruments. South Africa has legislative instruments dedicated to the regulation of social assistance, social insurance and <b>labour</b> <b>security.</b> In South Africa, irregular migrants receive limited social protection. The South African courts have played a positive role in the development and broadening of the social protection afforded to migrant workers, especially in the form of <b>labour</b> <b>security.</b> The limitations in the legislative instruments that regulate <b>labour</b> <b>security</b> are being extended to give effect to the courts’ decisions. Most of South Africa’s neighbouring countries have some form of social protection, but other SADC countries can receive lessons from South Africa with regard to the development of social protection, specifically in the form of <b>labour</b> <b>security.</b> Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. gm 2014 Mercantile Lawunrestricte...|$|E

The increased polarization and variability of hours worked, declining union densities and increased wage inequality provide evidence of growing labour insecurity in both countries.

40|$|This {{working paper}} explores {{the impact of}} the {{globalization}} process 1970 - 2000 on two manufacturing industries in the Gothenburg area – SKF and Volvo. Three aspects of the process are highlighted: the development of new Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the increased mobility of capital, and the increased importance of knowledge in manufacturing industry. The history of the two companies is analyzed from the early 1970 s to the turn of the century, using literature and interviews. Firstly, the paper explores the organizational development of the two companies. The study shows how SKF and Volvo during these years transformed from being organized as nationally oriented hierarchies to become nodes in global networks. Secondly, a number of specific themes are explored, such as ownership, branding, R&D, and outsourcing. The international ownership increased and the production is now coordinated on a global scale. The main conclusion of this working paper is that SKF and Volvo are representatives of an emerging informational economy. The flexibility generated by new ICT and more liquid financial markets has proven to promote economic growth, {{while at the same time}} generate social conflicts as the <b>labour</b> <b>security</b> decreases...|$|E

40|$|The {{current crisis}} in Greece, an EU member for over 30 years, {{has brought to}} the surface the {{character}} of the Greek politico-administrative system as it handles employment, migration and associated forms of social protection. Similarly, recent attempts at legislative reforms of the operation of social economy enterprises have yet to be implemented, while the current legislation governing them, i. e. as Foundations, dates back to [...] . 1939. The difficulties in recognising and regulating the social economy sector seem to emanate from the organisation of the overall employment security system in place. The employment relationship seems to be embedded within a bifurcated system of labour whereby the employment relationship is secure only in the public sector while the private sector is controlled by a precarious system of <b>labour</b> <b>security,</b> a separate health system and with its own political organisation. The lack of a unified national labour system does not allow the formation of a national system of employment (qualifications) and, hence, a way to overcome nepotism and the political (party) patronage system which defines, in a determining way, labour relations. This division is maintained by the politico-administrative labour regime put in place, under the extra-ordinary political situation that emerged after World War II (WWII). The paper explores this hidden reality defining the organisation of the employment system in Greece, its politico-administrative controls that seem to aim at ‘arresting’ the emergence of a social economy. This leads to a hidden social economy of a fragmented private labour market, which is regulated separately from the secure “public” employment sector. This rather anachronistic and discriminatory system of political order of labour divides workers in Greece. La actual crisis en Grecia, miembro de la UE desde hace más de 30 años, ha revelado el verdadero carácter del sistema político-administrativo griego, de la forma en la que gestiona el empleo, la migración y la protección social. Del mismo modo, los recientes intentos de reformas legislativas en relación a empresas de economía social todavía no se han implementado, mientras que la legislación vigente sobre este tipo de instituciones (por ejemplo, Fundaciones), se remonta a [...] . 1939. Las dificultades en el reconocimiento y la regulación del sector de la economía social parecen surgir de la organización general del sistema de seguridad en el empleo. Las relaciones laborales están enmarcadas en un sistema de trabajo bifurcado, en el que la seguridad laboral sólo existe en el sector público, mientras que en el sector privado predomina la precariedad, tiene un sistema de salud diferenciado, y su propia organización política. La falta de un sistema nacional unificado de trabajo no permite la formación de un sistema nacional de empleo (titulaciones) ni, por tanto, superar el nepotismo y la influencia política (el partido) que define, de una manera determinante, las relaciones laborales. Esta división político-administrativa surgió a raíz de la situación política extraordinaria que se dio tras la 2 ª Guerra Mundial, y se mantiene hasta la actualidad. El ensayo analiza esa realidad oculta, definiendo la organización del sistema laboral griego, sus controles político-administrativos, aparentemente destinados a 'detener' el surgimiento de una economía social. Esto ha dado lugar a una economía social sumergida, dentro de un mercado laboral privado fragmentado, regulado de forma diferente al sector de empleo “público”. Este sistema, anacrónico y discriminatorio, divide a los trabajadores en Grecia. DOWNLOAD THIS PAPER FROM SSRN : [URL] </p...|$|E
