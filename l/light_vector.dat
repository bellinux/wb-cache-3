40|$|This paper {{presents}} a method taking global illumination {{into account in}} a ray tracing environment. A vector approach is introduced, which allows {{to deal with all}} the types of light paths and the directional properties of materials. Three types of vectors are defined: Direct <b>Light</b> <b>Vectors</b> associated to <b>light</b> sources, Indirect <b>Light</b> <b>Vectors</b> which correspond to light having been diffusely reflected at least once and Caustic <b>Light</b> <b>Vectors</b> which are associated to light rays emitted by sources and reflected and/or transmitted by specular surfaces. These vectors are estimated at a small number of points in the scene. A weighted interpolation between known values allows to reconstruct these vectors for the other points, {{with the help of a}} gradient computation for the indirect component. This approach also allows to take uniform area light sources (spherical, rectangular and circular) into account for all the types of vectors. Computed images are thus more accurate and no discretizing of the geometry of the scene is needed. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we show that}} the {{effective}} Lagrangian models, encoding the relevant symmetries of the underlying fundamental gauge theory for strong interactions (QCD), provide a reasonable understanding of the interactions among light mesons at intermediate energies {{as well as of}} the properties of Heavy baryons. In the first part of the thesis we show that it is possible to build a chiral and crossing symmetric model for light meson interactions at intermediate energies, which we have called the Chiral Resonance Model (ChRM). Using the previous scheme we can understand ππ−scattering up to the 1 GeV region by considering the resonance exchange together with the contact term contributions. We also observe that to fully describe low energy ππ−scattering in the Chiral Resonance framework a broad scalar σ(550) particle is needed. In the second part of the thesis we investigate the heavy baryon spectra in the bound state picture. In this picture the heavy baryon is treated as a heavy spin multiplet of mesons (Q¯q) bound in the background field of the nucleon (qqq), which in turn arises as a soliton configuration of light meson fields. We show that a relativistic model with <b>light</b> <b>vectors</b> gives a very satisfactory account of the Σ ∗ c − Σc hyperfine splitting in contrast to the model without <b>light</b> <b>vectors.</b> In the last chapter we also present a generalization of the bound state model.
