50|$|The Philippines {{spent only}} 3.6% of their GDP {{on health care}} and {{facilities}} in 2011, ranking them 170th in health spending according to the World Health Organization. Their health system, particularly in rural areas, has been underfunded, understaffed and lacking advancements in health technologies, causing retention difficulties and poor access to services. However, with reported figures of Filipino nursing graduates reaching 27,000 between 1999 and 2003, and jumping to a total of 26,000 in 2005 alone, there are clear discrepancies between skilled Filipino nurses and availability of health services in the country.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the Rockies' role in stonewalling Harrington and {{attempting}} to undermine his relationship with Tanzer, Tanzer sued the Colorado Rockies, Scott Boras, agent Jeff Moorad, agent Brian Peters, and writer Tracy Ringolsby of the Rocky Mountain News for tortious interference, fraud and libel. The suit against Ringolsby was dismissed, and Tanzer was ordered to pay legal fees totallying nearly $70,000 for his frivolous suit against Ringolsby. The other suits lasted four years and was settled for the result of nothing but a public apology from the Colorado Rockies for its wrongdoing. During this period, Boras, working on a contingency fee for the Harringtons, sued Tanzer for his inability to close the deal with the Rockies. That suit was settled in a three-way mediation, which included Lloyd's of London. Tanzer and his associates had encouraged Harrington to purchase a $5 million net ascertained, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> policy from the insurance giant as talks with the Rockies broke down. At the mediation, when Boras became aware of the Lloyd's policy, the attention shifted from Tanzer to the insurance company. Within days, Harrington and Boras dropped the suit against Tanzer and agreed on a $2.5 million settlement with Lloyd's, which was tax-free, and was the equivalent to the amount Harrington would have received, after taxes, from the Rockies' $4.95 million bonus. However, Harrington did not realize the full amount, because of an agreement to pay Boras a 40% contingency fee.|$|E
5000|$|Access to {{resources}} {{play an important}} role in educational inequality. In addition to the resources from family mentioned earlier, access to proper nutrition and health care influence the cognitive development of children. Children who come from poor families experience this inequality, which puts them at a disadvantage from the start. Not only important are resources students may or may not receive from family, but schools themselves vary greatly in the resources they give their students. On December 2, 2011, the U.S. Department of Education released that school districts are unevenly distributing funds, which are disproportionately underfunding low-income students. This is holding back money from the schools that are in great need. High poverty schools have less-qualified teachers with a much higher turnover rate. [...] In every subject area, students in high poverty schools are more likely than other students to be taught by teachers without even a minor in their subject matter. Better resources allows for the reduction of classroom size, which research has proven improves test scores. It also increases the number of after school and summer programs—these are very beneficial to poor children because it not only combats the increased <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> over the summer but keeps them out of unsafe neighborhoods and combats the drop-out rate. [...] There is also a difference in the classes offered to students, specifically advanced mathematics and science courses. In 2012, Algebra II was offered to 82% of the schools (in diverse districts) serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, while only 65% of the schools serving the most African American and Hispanic students offered students the same course. Physics was offered to 66% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 40% serving the most.

5000|$|The word “caesarian” {{possibly}} {{derives from}} the ancient Roman ruler Julius Caesar, because {{it was believed that}} Caesar was delivered through this procedure. However, this is probably based more on tradition and myth than historical accuracies. Another possibility for the etymology of the word “caesarian” is the Latin word caedere, meaning “to cut”. This practice is probably much older than Julius Caesar, but [...] "C-sections", as performed by the Romans, were done to rescue the baby from a dying or already dead mother, and were performed post-mortem. Evidence suggests that Jews in ancient Rome successfully practiced C-sections on living mothers who were not in danger of dying. Evidence of these procedures is found in several collections of ancient Roman rabbis, the most famous of which is called the Mishnah. Greeks and Egyptians did not perform C-sections, either post-mortem or on living mothers. However, Greeks would have had at least some knowledge of the Caesarian operation and the procedure involved. The Greek god Aesclepius was fabled to have been extracted from his mother’s womb through this procedure. Other than the evidence of Jews practicing C-sections in antiquity (very little in ancient Rome, even less in ancient Greece), not much more evidence exists regarding Caesarian-operation birth. One reason could have been that C-sections were not performed very often because of medical complications or superstitions surrounding C-sections. In early Christian Rome, C-sections were almost non-existent. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> is a possibility for the lack of C-sections. Infant mortality rates were high in antiquity, so C-sections certainly could have been useful. However, early Christian doctors could have disregarded C-sections as a socially acceptable operation because of religious beliefs. Disease, a perceived need for secrecy, and social discouragement could have also been factors that lead to the decline in C-sections among early Christians in Rome. Almost no evidence exists for C-sections in the Christian world until the 10th century.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There is {{evidence}} that workers ’ skills erode during periods of unemployment. This issue seems of particular concern now that unemployment duration has increased in the Great Recession. I argue that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> during unemployment generates an externality in job creation: firms ignore how their hiring decisions affect the skill composition of the unemployment pool, and hence the output produced by new hires. Overall, job creation is too low, but contrary to conventional wisdom less so in recessions than in booms. The larger share of job-seekers with eroded skills in the unemployment pool in recessions lowers the social cost of having a worker losing her skills because it decreases the expected difference in productivity between a new hire and a job-seeker with eroded skills. As a consequence, everything else equal, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> during unemployment may warrant procyclical employment subsidies...|$|E

Standard real business cycle models with search frictions but homogeneous labor force {{are able to}} generate some persistence, {{but not enough to}} match the empirical evidence. Moreover, empirical studies emphasize the importance of the heterogeneity of the unemployment pool to fully understand unemployment dynamics. In particular, in most European countries the incidence of long term unemployment is big and well known. One of the causes/consequences of long-term unemployment is the skill deterioration of the unemployment pool. In this paper we introduce the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> mechanism, and therefore an heterogeneous labor force, in a New Keynesian framework with search frictions. Calibrating the model to the Spanish economy, we show that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> mechanism helps to explain the persistence in the response of unemployment to monetary shocks. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{sensitivity}} of the prediction of Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) events to different aspects of the sea surface temperature (SST) in the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. The impact of temporal resolution of SST on the MJO is first evaluated via a set of monthly hindcast experiments. The experiments are conducted with an atmosphere forced by persisted SST anomalies, monthly and weekly SSTs. Skill scores are clearly degraded when weekly SSTs are replaced by monthly values or persisted anomalies. The new high resolution OSTIA SST daily reanalysis would in principle allow to establish the impact of daily versus weekly SST values on the MJO prediction. It is found however that OSTIA SSTs provide lower skill scores than the weekly product. Further experiments show that this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> cannot be attributed to either the mean state or the daily frequency of OSTIA SSTs. Additional diagnostics show that the phase relationship between OSTIA SSTs and tropical convection is not optimal with repspect to observations.

Nigeria is an emerging economy with various challenges imposed by globalisation and climatic change agents. Strategies adopted and their efficacy in motivating technical staff are expected to result in better appreciating and handling of environmental/climatic changes, satisfaction and improved productivity of the staff. The study investigated the peculiar characteristics of technical staff, the effects of monetary rewards on the technical staff, the effects of ‘private practice ’ and non-provision of work on technical staff. A sample of 110 technical staff was selected. The findings indicate that junior technical staff (artisans and foremen) preferred monetary rewards, while senior technical staff (technical officer cadre) preferred non-monetary rewards.

The system is based on multiple regression equations that specify monthly mean anomalies of temperature, dew-point, precipitation and wind speedfrom concurrent anoma-lies of the 700 -mb height field plus local persistence. The equations are derived by applying a forward selection (screening) procedure, with cutoff criteria determined by Monte Carlo simulations and physical reasoning. Averaged over all months, the equations explain 68 % (72 %) of the temperature variance in the contiguous United States (Alaska) by means of only four variables. The corres-ponding statistics for dewpoint are 57 % (65 %) and 3 terms, precipitation 41 % (43 %) and 3 terms, and wind speed 37 % (32 %) and 2 terms.

40|$|Objectives: Quality {{of life is}} an {{important}} focus of research on dementia, with interest in direct reports of people with dementia and proxy reports of their carers. By exploring the subjective perspectives of unpaid family carers and paid care workers, this study aims to understand how carers construct meaning in narratives about quality of life with dementia. Method: A case-centred approach involved biographical narrative interviews with ten carers to explore what was important for people with dementia {{to have a good}} quality of life. Detailed narrative analysis attended to the linguistic and structural features of accounts to consider how dementia is conceptualised by carers in the framing of quality of life. Results: An individual’s perception of how dementia impacts on awareness and behaviour was central to their understanding of quality of life. Carers who constructed dementia as a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> and abilities were able to represent quality of life in positive terms despite the challenges of dementia. Carers who constructed dementia as eroding identity represented quality of life less positively and centred on their own means of coping with a challenging care situation. Conclusion: Findings highlight the importance of helping carers develop positive constructions of quality of life that are associated with understanding dementia as a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> and abilities, rather than as a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> self. Engaging with subjectivity in carers’ biographical narrative accounts is important in the development of quality of life assessment to understand the meanings and emotions that underlie proxy perspectives...|$|R
