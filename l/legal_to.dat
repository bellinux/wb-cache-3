5|$|After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the MTA {{exercised}} {{extreme caution}} regarding anyone taking photographs or recording video inside {{the system and}} proposed banning all photography and recording in a meeting around June 2004. However, due to strong response from {{both the public and}} from civil rights groups, the rule of conduct was dropped. In November 2004, the MTA again put this rule up for approval, but was again denied, though many police officers and transit workers still confront or harass people taking photographs or videos. However, on April 3, 2009, the NYPD issued a directive to officers stating that it is <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> take pictures within the subway system so long as it is not accompanied with suspicious activity.|$|E

5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E

This <b>legal</b> obligation <b>to</b> report results from Article 162 of the Penal Code. Partly because of parliamentary questions about this <b>legal</b> obligation <b>to</b> report, the need has arisen to gain insight into the value of this leg-islative article and to explore whether the present form of the <b>legal</b> obligation <b>to</b> report is satisfactory. Moreover, since the Dutch Cabinet has indicated its intention to pro-mote attention for recognizing, signalling and reporting corruption, the Dutch Scientific Research and Documentation Centre of the Ministry of Justice has commissioned Beke Consultancy and Research to conduct a study into the way the civil servants’ <b>legal</b> obligation <b>to</b> report functions...|$|R

5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E
5|$|After her obverse {{design was}} approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint {{engraving}} department {{six times in}} order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese brass (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the copper-nickel Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins. Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.|$|E

5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1929, {{but did not}} become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003 at which point it was <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> produce and possess in many countries. By 2007, mephedrone {{was reported to be}} available for sale on the internet, by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound, and by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made illegal in many European countries and in December 2010, the EU ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand and the United States, it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the US Federal Analog Act. In September 2011, the US temporarily classified mephedrone as a Schedule I drug, effective October 2011. This classification was made permanent in July 2012 {{with the passage of the}} Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act (SDAPA).|$|E
5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E

The match ended when Cage performed a frog splash aerial maneuver onto Ray from atop a ladder, followed up by Rhino performing his signature Gore maneuver into Ray against a table placed up in the ring corner. Rhino then pinned Ray to win the contest at 15 minutes and 22 seconds. After the match, Team 3D's associate Johnny Devine came out to help attack Cage and Rhino, however, Abyss came to their rescue and slammed Devine back-first onto the mat with his trademark Black Hole Slam maneuver while Team 3D made their retreat.|$|E

5|$|The main {{threat to}} {{crocodilians}} {{around the world}} is human activity, including hunting and habitat destruction. Early in the 1970s, more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded, driving down the majority of crocodilian populations, in some cases almost to extinction. Starting in 1973, CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals, such as the skins of crocodiles. This proved to be problematic in the 1980s, as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa, and it was <b>legal</b> <b>to</b> hunt them. At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983, it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell the lawfully hunted skins. In the late 1970s, crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries, started from eggs taken from the wild. By the 1980s, farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians. By 2000, skins from twelve crocodilian species, whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed, were traded by thirty countries, and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished.|$|E
