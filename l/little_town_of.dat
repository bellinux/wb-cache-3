The name has been documented as meaning [...] "the metal-worker's village", which may derive from the Old English fæfere, which in turn comes from the Latin [...] "faber" [...] meaning [...] "craftsman" [...] or [...] "forger". The town had established itself as a seaport by the Middle Ages, and became part of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports in the 13th century, providing a vessel to Dover.
