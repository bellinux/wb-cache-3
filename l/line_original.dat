5000|$|The {{line was}} renamed from Lehigh Valley Mainline to Lehigh Line during the Conrail ownership. [...] With the line {{now known as}} the [...] "Lehigh Line", Conrail {{maintained}} the <b>line's</b> <b>original</b> route ever since the line opened on June 11, 1855. However, Conrail kept most of the Lehigh <b>Line's</b> <b>original</b> right of way that represented the <b>line's</b> <b>original</b> route and Conrail did not retain all of the <b>line's</b> <b>original</b> right of way that represented the <b>line's</b> <b>original</b> route.
