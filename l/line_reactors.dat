5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is {{regulated}} according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and <b>line</b> <b>reactors.</b> Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power system amongst other things, to suppress overvoltages in the network during network switching, auto reclosing of transmission lines and under low loading condition of the network. Traditionally, shunt reactors of fixed type have been used and these have been permanently connected to the system. This research work investigated the feasibility of replacing the fixed shunt <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> with a reactor, whose parameters are automatically varied depending on the system reactive power requirements, in a mature power system overlaid with high voltage lines to improve amongst, other things voltage stability. However, in a mature system overlaid with parallel higher voltage lines, power tend to flow on the matured system rather than higher voltage system as predetermined by various impedances of the power system. It is therefore desirable that loading of higher voltage lines be increased because of their higher power transfer capability and fact that higher voltage networks generate capacitive power which is substantially more than for each line at the original voltage. However, replacing {{a large number of}} fixed <b>line</b> <b>reactors,</b> at low loadings of higher voltage lines, even when system collapse is averted by increasing the number of reactors inserted into the system, overvoltage problems may still be an issue, until a certain number of must-run reactors, operating at full reactance, are put into service. If too much inductive reactance is removed from the system when the loading levels are extremely low, the power system will collapse. Therefore, there was no economic benefit in replacing all the fixed shunt <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> with controllable type when the loading was still relatively low. Thus, the majority of the converted reactors were operating in their full rating as there was still more reactive power to be absorbed. However, when the power was diverted to flow on the higher voltage system through the use of series compensation of the higher voltage system, there was a possibility of making some fixed shunt <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> on the higher voltage network controllable. This also allowed more power to be transferred in the higher voltage system thus improving its utilisation. Also, a positive impact on active system losses was realised...|$|E

The over-voltage conditions are mitigated by switching-in shunt reactors, taking off switchable capacitor banks, reducing taps of connected transformers, and at last opening the lightly loaded lines if they are relevant. Under voltage conditions are controlled by switching shunt reactors off, switching capacitor banks in, switching <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> off, tap operation of transformers, and at last loads are shedded only if the condition is critical.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Glass <b>lined</b> <b>reactor</b> vessel for {{mixing and}} storage {{has a unique}} {{advantage}} of higher corrosion resistance, retention of product flavour and purity, improved heat transfer and less frequent cleaning. Welding close to the glass-lined surface is at times the unavoidable need. However, such needs are to be dealt critically as {{the rise in the}} temperature of the glass-lined surface can lead to a failure of glass-lining. This failure results in considerable delay as rework in lining the glass takes 5 - 7 days and it involves considerable extra cost of reworking. The glass <b>lined</b> <b>reactor</b> vessels are provided with jacket for thermal insulation. The jacket is welded to main vessel by a closure ring. CO 2 welding in the root run and Sub-merged Arc Welding (SAW) process for subsequent passes. The cooling time of 15 to 20 minutes is provided between the successive SAW passes so that the shell surface cools down and temperature does not exceed the failure limit of glass-lining. The temperature measurements were initially measured with infrared pyrometer and Results are compared with thermal analysis by FEA. We see in the final pass of SAW process the temperature exceeds 100 ˚C though the cooling time of 15 - 20 minutes is provided between the successive passes and temperature does not exceeds the failure limit of 150 ˚C as well as the 3 - 4 ˚C/min temperature difference in heating and cooling rates...|$|R

40|$|Alternating current {{electric}} motors rotate at a nearly constant speed that {{is determined by}} motor design and line frequency. Energy savings of 50 % or more may be available when fixed speed systems are modified to allow for variable load requirements of a centrifugal fan or pump. 1 Loads that vary by 30 % of full load over time offer good opportunities for cost-effective adjustable speed drive (ASD) retrofits. Market assessment studies indicate that in light and medium industries, 26 % of motors exhibit fluctuating loads; 22 % of these are in process industries and 35 % are in other heavy industries. However, industrial ASD installations remain relatively low. The majority of ASD-equipped industrial motor systems are 20 horsepower (hp) or less—and often the ASD is installed to improve control over the production process versus energy savings. 2 Thus potential energy and costs savings from ASD installations are significant. Variable Frequency Drives The electronic pulse-width-modulated variable frequency drive (VFD) {{is the most common}} type of ASD and is the state-of-the-art speed control. Because of energy efficiency and control capabilities, VFD and motor combinations have replaced constant speed motors in virtually every type of industrial plant. Although VFDs have been available for many years, they are not suited for all applications. Many industrial plants use medium voltage (> 600 to 6, 600 volts [V]) to supply power to motors rated as low as 150 hp. Semiconductors for medium voltage motor applications are particularly expensive. Depending on the situation, other factors that can discourage the use of VFDs include: • Creation of harmonics, which requires installation of <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> or harmonic filters • Voltage spikes that can lead to early motor failure • Motor bearing failures caused by induced shaft currents that flow to ground through the bearing’s rolling elements • Nuisance tripping • Limitations on the distance between the motor and VFD...|$|E
