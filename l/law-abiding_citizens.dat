The earliest martyr narrative has {{the spokesman for the}} persecuted present a defense in the apologetic mode: Christianity was a rational religion that worshiped only God, and although Christians were <b>law-abiding</b> <b>citizens</b> willing to honor the emperor, their belief in a single divinity prevented them from taking the loyalty oaths that acknowledged the emperor's divinity.|$|E

25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 2000s, {{the rapid growth of}} {{legislation}} and regulations allowing concealed carry by <b>law-abiding</b> <b>citizens</b> in various jurisdictions created a large market for handguns manufactured specifically for such use. Desirable characteristics for firearms of this type include: small size, thinness, high magazine capacity, lightweight construction (often achieved through the use of polymer frames), stealthy darkened stainless steel slides, high visibility and/or night sights, and large ergonomic ambidextrous manual thumb safeties and magazine releases. Ruger specifically designed the SR9 pistol to address the very active and profitable concealed-carry handgun market segment and it possesses the majority of the aforementioned attributes.|$|E

25|$|The {{conditions}} of probation {{must be provided}} to the defendant {{in a written statement}} that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required. The District Court must state its reasons for imposing a term of supervised release where none is required by statute; appellate courts deem it inappropriate to assume that the sentencing court's reason for imposing a prison term likewise extends to its decision regarding supervised release. The conditions for probation must be reasonably related to the purposes of the Federal Probation Act, and the purposes sought to be served by probation (including rehabilitation of the probationer), the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by <b>law-abiding</b> <b>citizens</b> should be accorded to probationers, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement are factors considered in determining whether a reasonable relationship exists. The trial court is given wide discretion in establishing {{conditions of}} probation, and the order of the district judge providing for probation will be overturned only if it is abuse of discretion.|$|E

In this regard, Chief Justice Yong considered {{the concerns of the}} Assistant Director of Manpower of the Ministry of Defence – if the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses were recognized, a select group of people would enjoy the social and economic benefits of their country without having to share the responsibility of defending the community's social and political institutions.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man X {{takes place}} in an {{unspecified}} time during the 22nd century (2120) and approximately 100 years after the original Mega Man series. A human archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers {{the ruins of a}} robotics research facility that had once been operated by the legendary robot designer Dr. Thomas Light. Among the ruins, Cain finds a large capsule which contains a highly advanced robot with human-level intelligence and emotions, and even free will, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Light had wished to instill within his creation reasonable sanity, good nature, and an understanding of the more controversial aspects of human morality. The robot was buried while running a 30-year diagnostic program to ensure these features. Cain spends the next several months studying the robot, who is named Mega Man X, or simply [...] "X". Cain decides to duplicate X and, within several months, completes the first [...] "replicate android" [...] or [...] "Reploid", a robot who can think, feel, learn, and grow exactly like a human. Within the year, the design is standardized and Reploids are mass-produced. However, with the free will given to a Reploid comes the possibility of criminal activity; such rogue Reploids are branded as [...] "Mavericks" [...] by <b>law-abiding</b> <b>citizens.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Congress {{passed the}} Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), which relaxed certain {{controls}} in the Gun Control Act and permitted licensed firearm dealers to conduct business at gun shows. Specifically, FOPA made it legal for FFL holders to make private sales, provided the firearm {{was transferred to}} the licensee's personal collection at least one year prior to the sale. Hence, when a personal firearm is sold by an FFL holder, no background check or Form 4473 is required by federal law. According to the ATF, FFL holders are required to keep a record of such sales in a bound book. The United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) said the stated purpose of FOPA was to ensure the GCA did not [...] "place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on <b>law-abiding</b> <b>citizens,</b> but it opened many loopholes through which illegal gun traffickers can slip." [...] The scope of those who [...] "engage in the business" [...] of dealing in firearms (and are therefore required to have a license) was narrowed to include only those who devote [...] "time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms." [...] FOPA excluded those who buy and sell firearms to [...] "enhance a personal collection" [...] or for a [...] "hobby," [...] or who [...] "sell all or part of a personal collection." [...] According to the USDOJ, this new definition made {{it difficult for them to}} identify offenders who could claim they were operating as [...] "hobbyists" [...] trading firearms from their personal collection. Efforts to reverse a key feature of FOPA by requiring criminal background checks and purchase records on private sales at gun shows were unsuccessful.|$|E

[...] Paul also argues that weapons bans only keep them out of the hands of <b>law-abiding</b> <b>citizens,</b> not dangerous criminals. He sees school shootings, plane hijackings, and other such events as a result of prohibitions on self-defense.
