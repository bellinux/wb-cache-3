5|$|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them {{held its}} world premiere at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on 10 November 2016. The film was {{released}} worldwide on 18 November 2016, in 2D, 3D {{and the new}} IMAX 4K <b>Laser</b> <b>system.</b> It would premiere one day earlier {{in a number of}} other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany and Italy, on 17 November. The film will be released in a total of 1,028 IMAX screens worldwide (388 screens in the United States and Canada, 347 screens in China, 26 screens in Japan and 267 screens in other countries). This marked the second time – after Doctor Strange – that a film secured a release in over 1,000 IMAX screens worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Laser-assisted NPDS is {{performed}} {{with the use of}} a CO2 <b>laser</b> <b>system.</b> The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.|$|E
25|$|After {{gradually}} {{altering the}} wavelength of the laser, {{they were able}} to compress a spherical capsule evenly, and were able to heat it up to 3.3 million kelvins (285 eV). The capsule contained cryogenically cooled gas, acting as a substitute for the deuterium and tritium fuel capsules that will be used later on. Plasma Physics Group Leader Dr. Siegfried Glenzer said they've shown they can maintain the precise fuel layers needed in the lab, but not yet within the <b>laser</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{expected}} this will cause about 20MJ of fusion energy to be released, {{resulting in a}} net fusion energy gain of about 15 (G=Fusion energy/UV laser energy). Improvements in both the <b>laser</b> <b>system</b> and hohlraum design are expected to improve the energy absorbed by the capsule to about 420kJ, which, in turn, could generate up to 100-150MJ of fusion energy. However, the baseline design allows for a maximum of about 45MJ of fusion energy release, due {{to the design of}} the target chamber. This is the equivalent of about 11kg of TNT exploding.|$|E

40|$|The {{continually}} increasing {{amount of}} orbital debris in near Earth space poses an increasing challenge to space situational awareness. Recent collisions of spacecraft caused abrupt {{increases in the}} density of {{both large and small}} debris in near Earth space. An especially challenging class of threats is that due to the increasing density of small (1 mm to 10 cm dimension) orbital debris. This small debris poses a serious threat since: (1) The high velocity enables even millimeter dimension debris to cause serious damage to vulnerable areas of space assets, e. g., detector windows; (2) The small size and large number of debris elements prevent adequate detection and cataloguing. We have identified solutions to this threat in the form of novel <b>laser</b> <b>systems</b> and novel ways of using these <b>laser</b> <b>systems.</b> While implementation of the solutions we identify is challenging we find approaches offering threat mitigation within time frames and at costs of practical interest. We base our analysis on the unique combination of coherent light specifically structured in both space and time and applied in novel ways entirely within the vacuum of space to deorbiting small debris. We compare and contrast laser based small debris removal strategies using ground based <b>laser</b> <b>systems</b> with strategies using space based <b>laser</b> <b>systems.</b> We find <b>laser</b> <b>systems</b> located and used entirely within space offer essential and decisive advantages over groundbased <b>laser</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{physical}} {{scale of}} the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the “conventional facility” (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the <b>laser</b> <b>system</b> from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent {{of the rest of}} the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, a major {{article was}} {{published}} in Physics Today by Robert McCory at the Laboratory for laser energetics outlying {{the current state of}} ICF and advocating for a national ignition facility. This was followed up by a major review article, from John Lindl in 1995, advocating for NIF. During this time a number of ICF subsystems were developing, including target manufacturing, cryogenic handling systems, new laser designs (notably the NIKE laser at NRL) and improved diagnostics like time of flight analyzers and Thomson scattering. This work was done at the NOVA <b>laser</b> <b>system,</b> General Atomics, Laser Mégajoule and the GEKKO XII system in Japan. Through this work and lobbying by groups like the fusion power associates and John Sethian at NRL, a vote was made in congress, authorizing funding for the NIF project in the late nineties.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{detail of}} stimulated emission {{is that the}} induced photon has the same frequency and phase as the incident photon. In other words, the two photons are coherent. It is this property that allows optical amplification, {{and the production of}} a <b>laser</b> <b>system.</b> During the operation of a laser, all three light-matter interactions described above are taking place. Initially, atoms are energized from the ground state to the excited state by a process called pumping, described below. Some of these atoms decay via spontaneous emission, releasing incoherent light as photons of frequency, ν. These photons are fed back into the laser medium, usually by an optical resonator. Some of these photons are absorbed by the atoms in the ground state, and the photons are lost to the laser process. However, some photons cause stimulated emission in excited-state atoms, releasing another coherent photon. In effect, this results in optical amplification.|$|E
