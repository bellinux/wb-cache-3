Este trabajo evalúa la frecuencia de muda entre juveniles y adultos de Rhinella marina (Linnaeus, 1758) y la tasa de ocurrencia entre el día y la noche. Para esto, se realizaron dos observaciones diarias (7 am y 7 pm), entre Octubre de 2011 y Marzo de 2012, a tres grupos de individuos clasificados según su tamaño longitud rostro-cloaca, como adultos (promedio= 80 mm), juveniles medianos (promedio= 19 mm) y juveniles pequeños (promedio= 13 mm). Estos animales fueron colocados en terrarios en el laboratorio y marcados en el dorso a través de un punto hecho con un corrector de tinta. La muda se determinó por la pérdida total de la marca y una coloración brillante en el dorso.

This paper evaluates the molting frequency between juveniles and adults of Rhinella marina (Linnaeus, 1758) and between the night and day time. Two daily observations, at 7 am and 7 pm, were made between October 2011 and March 2012 to three groups of individuals, classified by their size, snout vent length, as adults (mean= 80 mm), medium juveniles (mean= 19 mm) and small juveniles (mean= 13 mm). The animals were placed in terrariums in the laboratory and marked on their back with a spot of correction fluid. The molting was determined by the total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> and a bright color on the dorsal skin. We found a significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis, H= 19. 84, p< 0. 0001) in the molting frequency among the three groups: adults= 7. 5 days, medium juveniles= 5. 4 days, and small juveniles= 5. 3 days. Also, between the number of molting frogs during the night and day hours (Chi-square, &# 967; 2 = 7. 891, p= 0. 019), particularly in the two groups of juveniles, who moulted mostly at night, as adults did not show any clear difference. It is possible that the highest molting frequency in juveniles may be related to their ontogenetic status, with a smaller size and higher metabolic and developmental rate...|$|E

We have studied mitotic recombination between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtelomeric Y' repeated sequence family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Individual copies of Y's were marked with SUP 11 and URA 3 which allowed for <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> duplications and <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> Y's.

We report that neuronal ablation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> H 3 K 4 -specific methyltransferase, Kmt 2 a/Mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll 1), in mouse postnatal forebrain and adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with increased anxiety and robust cognitive deficits without locomotor dysfunction.

40|$|Transcriptional {{repression}} {{mechanisms are}} important during differentiation of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors, {{where they are}} thought to regulate lineage commitment and to extinguish alternative differentiation programs. PU. 1 and GATA- 1 are two critical hematopoietic transcription factors that physically interact and mutually antagonize each other's transcriptional activity and ability to promote myeloid and erythroid differentiation, respectively. We find that PU. 1 inhibits the erythroid program by binding to GATA- 1 on its target genes and organizing a complex of proteins that creates a repressive chromatin structure containing lysine- 9 methylated H 3 histones and heterochromatin protein 1. Although these features {{are thought to be}} stable aspects of repressed chromatin, we find that silencing of PU. 1 expression leads to removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repression complex, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repressive chromatin <b>marks</b> and reactivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> erythroid program. This process involves incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> replacement histone variant H 3. 3 into nucleosomes.

This situation occurs with enhanced intensity in newly-colonized areas, in so-called language islands (Rosenberg 1994) : convergence of a conglomerate of mutually intelligible dialects towards this new koinè. Various pathways with their respective outcomes of this multi-dialect interaction have been described: leveling in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>marked</b> variants (Trudgill's (1974), interdialect formation with compromise forms or fudging (Chambers & Trudgill 1980 : 115, Hinskens, Auer, & Kerswill 2005 : 10), and reallocation of doubles to distinct functions (Taeldeman 1989, Britain & Trudgill 2005).

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that linker histone H 1 can influence distinct cellular processes by acting as a gene-specific regulator. However, the mechanistic basis underlying such H 1 specificity and whether H 1 acts in concert with other chromatin-altering activities remain unclear. Here, we show that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> H 1 subtypes, H 1. 2, stably interacts with Cul 4 A E 3 ubiquitin ligase and PAF 1 elongation complexes and that such interaction potentiates target gene transcription via induction of H 4 K 31 ubiquitylation, H 3 K 4 me 3, and H 3 K 79 me 2. H 1. 2, Cul 4 A, and PAF 1 are functionally cooperative because their individual knockdown results in <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding histone <b>marks</b> and <b>the</b> deficiency <b>of</b> target gene transcription.
