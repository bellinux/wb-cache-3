The lighthouse, surrounded by ball fields next to the new marine terminal for the Port of Paulsboro, is still active for navigation on the Delaware River.

50|$|The Light is a 1987 {{composition}} by Philip Glass, {{his first}} score {{for a full}} symphony orchestra. The work was commissioned for the Michelson-Morley Centennial Celebration held at Case Western Reserve University.

Lighter sticks are faster and safer to use (you can't seriously injure your opponent because the stick breaks first). The length of a canne is 95 cm, weight is ca. 120 g for green and ca. 100 g for the black canne.|$|R

50|$|When {{they were}} constructed, no ship channel had yet been dredged in the Patapsco, though some {{dredging}} had been {{performed in the}} Inner Harbor area. In the 1850s the Brewerton Channel was constructed, but it headed {{straight out of the}} harbor to the mouth of the river. Therefore the range <b>lights</b> never <b>marked</b> <b>a</b> specific channel. Complaints about the visibility and usefulness of the lights were common.|$|R

His compositions are noted as an example of balance, though sacrificing technical perfection for the benefit of a more intense evocative power.|$|R

5000|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1790 {{as one of a}} pair of candle-powered lights ("High Lighthouse" [...] and [...] "Low Lighthouse"). It was electrified in 1947. The tower is 85 ft tall, putting the lantern at 134 ft above sea level. The other lighthouse - the [...] "low light" [...] was 20 ft lower. It was decommissioned and demolished in 1883 before it could be lost due to coastal erosion, its lantern being reused at Southwold lighthouse.

2500|$|There {{is a third}} {{lighthouse}} just upstream of the pier, on the Herd Groyne (constructed in 1861-67 {{to preserve}} Littlehaven Beach, formerly known as Herd Sands, which had begun to be washed away by the change of currents caused by the new piers). The Groyne shows <b>an</b> occulting <b>light</b> which <b>marks</b> <b>a</b> safe entrance course between the piers, showing white to a vessel approaching from seaward on the correct course, green to a vessel off-course to the north, and red to one off-course to the south. Built by Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House in 1882, It consists of an upper hexagonal part, including the lantern, of wood and corrugated iron construction, sitting on twelve cylindrical steel legs. The whole structure is painted red and stands [...] in height. The Herd Groyne lighthouse was refurbished and repainted in 2014.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{generation}} of incoherent synchrotron radiation in the visible spectral range which is produced by laser-accelerated electrons with 55 - 75 -MeV energy as they propagate through an undulator. Simultaneous detection of electron and photon spectra allows for precise comparison between experimental results and undulator theory. First- and second-order undulator radiation was detected. The agreement between experiment and theory and the exclusion of other effects proves that the observed radiation is generated in the undulator. Beyond that, this experiment introduces laser-accelerated electrons into the radio-frequency accelerator domain of synchrotron <b>light</b> sources. This <b>marks</b> <b>a</b> noticeable step toward a new, compact, and brilliant short-wavelength light source. (Abstract from: [URL]...|$|R
50|$|The piercer {{will check}} the {{underside}} of the tongue for large blood vessels, sometimes with <b>a</b> bright <b>light,</b> and <b>mark</b> <b>a</b> safe placement for the piercing. The tongue is then clamped with forceps and pierced with a needle, usually from top to bottom with a piercing needle or from bottom to top with a cannula needle. Initial jewelry should always be considerably longer than will ultimately be required to allow for swelling, which is common following the piercing. Within two days of getting the piercing the tongue can swell up to double its original size. This can lead to pain when speaking and eating, but this is not permanent. Piercers often recommend drinking cold beverages and sucking on crushed ice to help reduce the swelling. Some people find that taking Ibuprofen or similar anti-inflammatory drugs can greatly reduce the swelling associated with a tongue piercing. It is advisable not to drink alcohol, smoke, or eat spicy food until the piercing is at least partially healed (around two weeks), and alcohol-free mouthwash should be used after eating or smoking.|$|R
50|$|The Lake Borgne Light was a {{lighthouse}} in Mississippi {{at the entrance}} to Lake Borgne on what is now Lighthouse Point, east of Heron Bay. It was built in 1889 to replace an earlier light on St. Joseph's Island further east, which was shrinking and is now completely gone. The new light sat on a screwpile foundation in the marsh and was reached by a boardwalk; it was equipped with a fifth order Fresnel lens. The house was destroyed by the 1906 Mississippi hurricane but was rebuilt; it was deactivated in 1937 and abandoned. The foundation of the <b>light</b> is <b>marked</b> as <b>a</b> hazard on present day charts, as the point of land has eroded further.|$|R
50|$|Electoral stain {{typically}} {{contains a}} pigment for instant recognition, a silver nitrate which stains {{the skin on}} exposure to ultraviolet <b>light,</b> leaving <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that is impossible to wash off and is only removed as external skin cells are replaced. Industry standard electoral inks contain 10%, 14% or 18% silver nitrate solution, depending {{on the length of}} time the mark is required to be visible. Although normally water-based, electoral stains occasionally contain a solvent such as alcohol to allow for faster drying, especially when used with dipping bottles, which may also contain a biocide to ensure bacteria aren't transferred from voter to voter.|$|R

6000|$|Gipsy Marks.--When gipsies travel, {{the party}} that goes in advance leaves marks at cross-roads, in order to guide those who follow. These marks are called [...] "patterans;" [...] there are three patterans in common use. One is to pluck three large handfuls of grass and to throw them on the ground, at a short {{distance}} from one another, in the direction taken; another is, to draw a cross on the ground, with one arm much longer than the rest, as a pointer--a cross is better than any other simple mark, for it catches many different <b>lights.</b> (In <b>marking</b> <b>a</b> road, do not be content with marking the dust--an hour's breeze or a shower will efface it; but take a tent-peg, or sharpened stick, and fairly break into the surface, and your mark will be surprisingly durable.) The third of the gipsy patterans is of especial use in the dark: a cleft stick is planted by the road-side, close to the hedge, and in the cleft, is an arm like a signpost. The gipsies feel for this at cross-roads, searching for it on the left-hand side. (Borrow's 'Zincali.') A twig, stripped bare, with the exception of two or three leaves at its end, is sometimes laid on the road, with its bared end pointing forwards.|$|R
40|$|The present paper aims {{at making}} clear how George Eliot owes a debt in style to Jane Austen in her {{character}} portrayal. Taking up Austen’s Emma and Eliot’s Daniel Deronda, {{we consider the}} qualities of prose style that are characteristic of the respective writers as seen in these novels. A comparative analysis of their discourses has brought to <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>marked</b> tendency on both sides to use negative expressions and the subjunctive. These common traits are surmised to meet an artistic challenge of creating ambiguity in the characters’psychological situations. Eliot, while inheriting Austen’s stylized English, utilizes scientific phraseology to give voice to the human drama in late nineteenth century England. Thus she adds physiological dimensions to what Austen has established. We attempt to prove this point {{on the basis of}} discourse analysis...|$|R
