40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of {{manipulation}} treatment and {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) on patients with cervicogenic headache. Methods: Seventy patients with cervicogenic headache were randomly allocated to receive manipulation treatment and TENS treatment, which were given every other day respectively for total 40 days. The headache degree (numeric rating scale, NRS), frequency, <b>lasting</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> the range of motion (ROM) of the cervical spine 2 weeks before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment, were compared. Results: Before treatment, {{there were no significant differences}} in the headache NRS scores, frequency, <b>lasting</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> the ROM scores between the two groups (P＞ 0. 05). After treatment, the headache NRS score, frequency, <b>lasting</b> <b>time</b> in the manipulation group decreased significantly (P＜ 0. 01), while in the TENS group just the headache NRS score decreased significantly (P＜ 0. 05). The ROM scores in both groups showed no significant changes (P＞ 0. 05). The response rate of manipulation treatment is 94. 5 %, significantly higher than 64. 5 % of TENS treatment (P＜ 0. 05).
