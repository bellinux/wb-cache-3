25|$|An {{important}} note on {{the growth}} of hydropathy is that it started to become prominent as traditional medical practice was becoming more professional {{in terms of how}} doctors operated, alienating many patients, as they felt that the medical encounter was becoming less personalized, and the more scientific the medical language became, the <b>less</b> <b>that</b> they could easily understand. Hydropathy was a return to a treatment that was spiritual and natural, making it more palatable to those who felt uncomfortable with the direction that traditional medicine was taking.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, DNA {{tests have}} {{demonstrated}} substantially less inter-marriage {{in most of}} the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 years than in other populations. The findings lend support to traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and counters theories that many or most of the world's Jewish populations were founded by entirely gentile populations that adopted the Jewish faith, as in the notable case of the historic Khazars. Although groups such as the Khazars could have been absorbed into modern Jewish populations — in the Khazars' case, absorbed into the Ashkenazim — it is unlikely that they formed {{a large percentage of the}} ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews, and much <b>less</b> <b>that</b> they were the genesis of the Ashkenazim.|$|E
25|$|Racing {{became more}} {{competitive}} with the introduction, in 1666, under King Charles II, of the King's Plate Races, designed {{so as to}} favour a fast yet strong horse, capable of winning a 4-mile race with a weight load of 12 stone. The winning horses were much sought after for breeding, leading to rapid improvement of the breed, with horses not in the winnings still capable hunters. The Curragh was awarded its plate in the 1670s, followed by the establishment in 1685 of a studbook under the Down Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders to promote the breeding of racehorses. The introduction of the Penal Laws, restricting Catholics to owning horses of a value <b>less</b> <b>that</b> £5, did little to deter horse owners, resulting in races limited to horses of that value. Race meetings were increasingly advertised in the press, and by 1750 even the English Racing Calendar advertised some 71 Irish events.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the leading}} {{hypotheses}} for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, {{to try to solve}} this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in Nili Fossae in 2008. Soon thereafter, landed missions to Mars started identifying carbonates on the surface; the Phoenix Mars lander found between 3–5 wt% calcite (CaCO3) at its northern lowland landing site, while the MER Spirit rover identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16–34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Later CRISM analyses identified carbonates in the rim of Huygens crater which suggested that there could be extensive deposits of buried carbonates on Mars. However, a study by CRISM scientists estimated that all of the carbonate rock on Mars holds <b>less</b> <b>that</b> the present Martian atmosphere worth of carbon dioxide. They determined that if a dense ancient Martian atmosphere did exist, it is probably not trapped in the crust.|$|E

25|$|During {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries, with its {{activities}} underwritten by episcopal and papal indulgences, the hospital's {{role as a}} centre for alms collection persisted, but its linkage to the Order of Bethlehem increasingly unravelled, putting its purpose and patronage in doubt. In 1346 the master of Bethlem, a position at that time granted to the most senior of London's Bethlemite brethren, applied to the city authorities seeking protection; thereafter metropolitan office-holders claimed power to oversee the appointment of masters and demanded in return an annual payment of 40 shillings. It is doubtful whether the city really provided substantial protection and much <b>less</b> <b>that</b> the mastership fell within their patronage but, dating from the 1346 petition, it {{played a role in}} the management of Bethlem's finances. By this time the Bethlehemite bishops had relocated to Clamecy, France, under the surety of the Avignon papacy. This was significant as, throughout the reign of Edward III (1327–77), the English monarchy had extended its patronage over ecclesiastical positions through the seizure of priories under the control of non-English religious houses. As a dependent house of the Order of Saint Bethlehem in Clamecy, Bethlem was vulnerable to seizure by the crown and this occurred in the 1370s when Edward III took control. The purpose of this appropriation was, in the context of the Hundred Years' War between France and England, to prevent funds raised by the hospital from enriching the French monarchy via the papal court. After this event the masters of the hospital, semi-autonomous figures in charge of its day-to-day management, were normally crown appointees and it became an increasingly secularised institution. The memory of its foundation became muddied and muddled; in 1381 the royal candidate for the post of master claimed that from its beginnings it had been superintended by an order of knights and he confused its founder, Goffredo de Prefetti, with the Frankish crusader, Godfrey de Bouillon. The removal of the last symbolic link to the Bethlehemites was confirmed in 1403 when it was reported that master and inmates no longer wore the star of Bethlehem.|$|E
500|$|Although Turner's {{lyrics are}} found to be [...] "far from wholly discernable", his vocals have [...] "mellowed". Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "Turner's vocals are growing as well, {{sounding}} eerily like Steve Brodsky, from Isis' peers Cave In. These journeys into melody are so successful (vocal harmonies, no <b>less)</b> <b>that</b> you wonder why Turner still bothers with the pseudo-death metal vocals at all. They add little to the music and must serve to turn off more potential fans than they attract." [...] Nate Chinen, however, sees this variety as a vital component of the album's success, attesting that [...] "Aaron Turner expertly alternates between a death-metal roar and a more human wail, using whichever better suits the needs of a song".|$|E
500|$|Commentary on the beheadings varied widely.

There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even <b>less</b> <b>that</b> it could have been motivated by malevolence... he piece has a definite authorising function". On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, David Martin described the decapitation as [...] "an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} success, [...] "We Are the World" [...] received {{mixed reviews}} from journalists, music critics {{and the public}} following its release. American journalist Greil Marcus felt that the song sounded like a Pepsi jingle.

[...] Marcus added, [...] "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi—and the true result will likely be <b>less</b> <b>that</b> certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest." [...] Author Reebee Garofalo agreed, and expressed the opinion that the line [...] "We're saving our own lives" [...] was a [...] "distasteful element of self-indulgence".

500|$|Harrison's design had [...] "little {{that was}} English, still <b>less</b> <b>that</b> was recognisably Oxonian", said the {{architectural}} historian Sir Howard Colvin. There were no pitched roofs, battlements, or pinnacles. Instead, the proposed building had [...] "a strongly Mediterranean character", inspired by medieval buildings in that region. White Portland stone was the chosen building material; {{there were to}} be [...] "stark" [...] external walls and flat roofs, and a large semi-circular doorway at the main entrance, with facetted voussoirs demonstrating the influence of the Muslim architecture of Norman Sicily. The tower, which was to have an internal dome and an external polygonal design, showed (in Colvin's view) influences of Byzantium and parts of southern France. In the hall, {{there were to be}} aisles on the north and south sides of {{the main body of the}} hall, as in a basilica, with the arches and columns of the aisles designed in a Greek Doric style. The hall and its grand staircase, said Colvin, would have rivalled those of Christ Church. Although Harrison had not finished plans for the common rooms, the initial sketches had oriental touches, including fireplaces reminiscent of the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. The Warden's Lodging would have been [...] "one of the most handsome and commodious of its kind". However, Colvin thought that the chapel design was better suited to Mediterranean sunlight than Oxford gloom.|$|E

[...] Orders for parachutes {{were placed in}} Australia, the United States and India. A request for 5,000 cargo parachutes with containers was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September {{it was decided to}} send 1,000 without containers by air, while the rest went by sea. Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be [...] "free-dropped"—dropped without parachutes—so the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would have also increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier. Without a well-organised recovery effort, <b>less</b> <b>that</b> 50 percent of what was dropped was recovered, and perhaps 70 per cent of what was recovered was found to be in a usable condition.|$|E
