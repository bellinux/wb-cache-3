500|$|Kurosaki {{collaborated with}} musical duo Trustrick in {{performing}} the song [...] "Dead Or Lie". In {{an interview with}} Diga Online, Kurosaki mentioned how {{she had been a}} fan of the Danganronpa series and was surprised to learn that she had been chosen to perform a song for the series. She compared her duet with Trustrick's vocalist Sayaka Kanda to an angel and a demon, with her voice being compared to a demon, and Kanda's voice being transparent and feminine <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel.</b> It was her first time writing lyrics for a duet, and she had to consider the roles of Kanda and Trustrick's guitarist Billy in the song.|$|E
500|$|By 1990, ISO was {{performing}} {{not just in}} the US but also abroad. The troupe was regularly reviewed by The New York Times. A 1988 review said that, [...] "Unfortunately, many of [...] effects looked too self-consciously clever." [...] A 1990 review concluded that, [...] "It is easy to be optimistic about ISO; its shows are goofy fun. But the apparently casual silliness derives from great theatrical shrewdness." [...] A 1991 review said that, [...] "The evening got off to a good, punchy start, then dwindled irretrievably into sophomoric hijinks." [...] A 1993 review stated that, [...] "Iso is after laughs and it gets them. But its targets are threadbare just when dance could use some sharp satirists." [...] In one 1990 performance, Steinberg used elastic bands to playfully reshape her arms and legs as noodles, then flew from wires <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy {{when you hit the}} spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel,</b> but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E

60|$|His hand trembled as {{he hung up}} the receiver, and he {{was weak}} from the organ which had stirred him. His eyes were shining <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel's,</b> {{and his face was}} transfigured, purged of all earthly dross, and pure and holy.|$|R
2500|$|Zhora's {{gunshot wounds}} are both on her {{shoulder}} blades. [...] The end result makes her look <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel</b> whose wings have been cut off. Zhora makes use of a serpent that [...] "once corrupted man" [...] in her performance.|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have many}} good boys, but none {{can match the}} good {{heart and soul of}} Dominic Savio. I see him so often at prayer, staying in church after the others; every day he slips out of the {{playground}} to make a visit to the Blessed Sacrament. When he is in church he is <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel</b> living in Paradise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cook's musical flair led to {{him being}} granted a {{scholarship}} to Bedford School, an independent school for boys in the county town of Bedford, when he was 13, also as a boarder. He [...] "sang <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel</b> and played the clarinet to grade eight". While being educated in Bedford, he also learned to play piano and saxophone. However, music was soon eclipsed when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) came to play against the Bedford XI. The visiting side were a man short and drafted the 14-year-old new boy to play against his school; Cook scored a century.|$|E
6000|$|... "Life can't rob me now--nor death," [...] he cried, in exaltation. [...] "I {{have your}} love. Your face {{will always be}} with me--as now--lovely and brave!... Not a tear!... And only that sweet smile <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel's!...</b> Oh, Lenore, what a girl you are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Gordon. O {{think not}} of his errors now; {{remember}} [...] His greatness, his munificence, think on all [...] The lovely features of his character, [...] On all the noble exploits of his life, [...] And let them, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel's</b> arm, unseen [...] 35 [...] Arrest the lifted sword.|$|R
6000|$|Willie felt {{a wonderfully}} strong {{sensation}} within his heart {{as he looked}} into the sufferer's large liquid eyes; and for a few seconds he could not speak.

2500|$|..... this goodly {{frame the}} earth {{seems to me}} a sterile promontory, this most {{excellent}} canopy the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man—how noble in reason; how infinite in faculties, in form and moving; how express and admirable in action; how <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel</b> in apprehension; how like a god; the beauty of the world; the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1783 {{comments}} about Nancy Storace as Dorina in Fra i due litiganti seem astonishingly unguarded: [...] "Storace played [...] <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel.</b> Her beautiful eyes, her white neck, her beautiful throat, her fresh mouth, made a charming effect." [...] His 1787 {{comments on the}} duet, [...] "Pace, caro mio sposo," [...] in Una cosa rara suggest comparable enthusiasm for the music Storace sang: [...] "I find the duo between Mandini and Storace so tender and so expressive that it poses {{a danger to the}} young members of the audience. One needs to have had some experience in order to see it with a cool head".|$|E
2500|$|The Puhdys reunited for a one-off {{concert at}} the Brandenburg Gate in 1991, and, {{received}} enthusiastically, decided to continue; the situation in East Germany had changed, and {{there were signs of}} both Ostalgie — nostalgia for the GDR — and an emergent regional identity as Ossis. The band released the album Wie ein Engel (<b>Like</b> <b>An</b> <b>Angel)</b> the following year. While the title track (about the then-current dangers of [...] "S-Bahn surfing," [...] youths climbing on the roof of moving Berlin commuter trains) was a minor hit, accompanied by a low-budget music video, the album is best known for the anthem [...] "Was bleibt" [...] (What's Left), inspired by a book by East German writer Christa Wolf, which asked obliquely what would remain from the GDR. Sales figures showed that Wie ein Engel had initially sold around 24,000 copies; while this was hardly a blockbuster in Germany, as almost all the sales were in the east it was a regional top seller. Re-releases of the Puhdys catalog on compact disc in 1993 also sold respectably, and numerous compilations were released.|$|E
60|$|The fair little face, {{touched with}} divine compassion, as it peeped shrinkingly through the grate, was <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>angel's</b> in the prison.

2500|$|HAMLET. [...] I {{will tell}} you why; so shall my {{anticipation}} prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to {{the king and queen}} moult no feather. [...] I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this [...] majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.
