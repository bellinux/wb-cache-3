To study {{state of}} immune status in {{children}} and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) at early stages of the disease development and perspectives of their treatment. Materials and methods. 286 children and adolescents with olygo- and polyarticular variants of JIA aged 3 to 18 years were included. Examination of CD 4, CD 8, CD 16, CD 95 <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>markers,</b> IgA, IgG, IgM rheumatoid factor, interleukin 1 (3, 4, 6, 8, 10, tumor necrosis factor a as well as lymphocyte morphometry was performed. Results. High blood levels of CD 4, CD 8, CD 16, CD 95, pro- and anti- inflammatory interleukins were revealed at active stage of JIA particularly in pts with polyarthritis and extended olygoarthritis. Changes of mean lymphocyte morphometric measures linearly inversely correlated with relative <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>markers</b> level what proves relationship of processes of proliferation, cytotoxicity and elevation of circulating apoptotic cell count in blood. However increase of “programmed death cells" may reflect not only proliferation but also capability of cells to induce cell death program in presence of provocative factors.

Method: Type 1 diabetic state was induced to overnight fasted animals by intraperitoneal injection with a single dose of STZ (65 mg/kg body weight). Six equal sized groups of male Sprague- Dawley rats received or not different doses of N. sativa oil and TQ. Blood glucose was tested every morning through 30 days of the experimental period. After completion of the 4 weeks experimental protocols, blood samples were collected from overnight fasted rats by the cardiac puncture under anesthesia. Serum was assayed for autoimmune anti- Islet cell antibodies (ICA), pan T- <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>marker</b> (CD 90), pan B <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>marker</b> (CD 19), and pan innate cells marker (CD 1 lb) in addition to serum insulin using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The animals were dissected after sacrificed and the pancreas was taken for histology. This organ was placed in 10 % formalin for fixation. Results: T 1 DM causes increased the levels of serum glucose, levels of T, B <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>markers,</b> innate cells marker, and ICA and decreased serum insulin level, meanwhile treatment of diabetic rats with N. sativa oil and TQ significantly decrease the levels of all immunological (p< 0. 05) beside it significantly resulted in elevation of serum insulin level (p< 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} the {{cellular}} immune response to stop solid tumor growth {{has been the subject}} of much research. Although the mechanisms for tumor evasion of immune response are poorly understood, one viable explanation is that tumor-killing lymphocytes cannot reach the tumor cells in sufficient quantity to keep the tumor in check. Recently, the use of bifunctional antibodies. (BFAs) has been proposed as a way to direct immune cells to the tumor: one arm of the antibody is specific for a known tumor-associated antigen and the other for a <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>marker</b> such as CD 3. Injecting this BFA should presumably result in cross-linking of lymphocytes. (either endogenous or adoptively transferred) with tumor cells, thereby enhancing therapy. Results from such an approach, however, are often disappointing- frequently there is no benefit gained by using the BFA. We have analyzed the retargeting of endogenous effector cells by BFA using a physiologically based whole-body pharmacokinetic model that accounts for interactions between all relevant species in the various organs and tumor. Our results suggest that the design of the BFA is critical and the binding constants of the antigen and lymphocyte binding epitopes need to be optimized for successful therapy...|$|E

40|$|The adoptive {{transfer}} of immunity {{by means of}} spleen and lymph node cells has been analysed in rabbits of defined major histocompatibility (RLA) types and immunoglobulin (Ig) allotypes. Previous results had shown that chimaeras formed by transplanting adult cells into RLA-matched newborn hosts become stable B-lymphocyte chimaeras, as determined by their continuous production of donor type Ig. However, specific antibodies made by adult chimaeras were demonstrably only of recipient origin, unless the donor had been primed. The present report describes early events after the transfer of cells from donors primed with trinitrophenylated keyhole limpet haemocyanin (TNP-KLH). Double-staining with enzyme-labelled antigen or antibody conjugates was applied to identify lymphocytes of donor or recipient origin in spleen sections of transplanted rabbits and also to identify cells producing anti-TNP. Lymphocytes with membrane-bound Ig (mIg+ cells) of donor allotype were readily identified scattered singly or in small clusters throughout the recipients' B-lymphocyte areas within 5 days after transfer. Groups of donor-derived cells producing anti-TNP were demonstrable only in animals that had been specifically stimulated.

40|$|The pan <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>marker</b> CD 45 {{exists in}} various isoforms arising from {{alternative}} splicing of the exons 4, 5 and 6. While naïve T cells express CD 45 RA translated from an mRNA containing exon 4, exons 4 - 6 are spliced out to encode the shorter CD 45 R 0 in antigen-experienced effector/memory T cells. The SNP C 77 G (rs 17612648) {{is located in}} exon 4 and blocks the exon's differential splicing from the pre-mRNA, enforcing expression of CD 45 RA.

40|$|Abstract. Cluster of {{differentiation}} (CD) 24 {{was originally}} {{described as a}} B <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>marker</b> and has recently received considerable attention in cancer research as its overexpression has been observed in several types of carcinoma. The CD 24 molecule is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein {{that appears to be}} associated with aggressive cancers involving invasion and metastasis. However, the expression of CD 24 in human bladder cancer and its clinical signifi-cance remains largely unknown and no association has been reported between CD 24 overexpression and human bladder tumor recurrence. In the present study, the CD 24 expression in cancer tissues obtained during transurethral surgery and the subsequent intra-bladder tumor recurrence following surgery were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed and the intensity of CD 24 staining was semi-quantitatively evaluated. CD 24 expression was observed more frequently in high-grade bladder tumors (G 2 -G 3) than low-grade tumors (G 1). Positive CD 24 expression was significantly associated with intra-bladder tumor recurrence following surgery and increased staining intensity was also correlated with recur-rence. The positive association between CD 24 expression and tumor recurrence was observed in each tumor category (stages Ta and T 1, low and high grade). The results demonstrated that CD 24 expression is significantly associated with bladder tumor recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the significance of CD 24 as a predictor of bladder cancer recurrence. These insights may lead to future therapeutic strategies targeting CD 24 to prevent the dissemi-nation of bladder cancer cells and tumor recurrence...|$|E

However, data on T <b>lymphocyte</b> activation <b>markers</b> of preterm infants is scarce. We investigated the association between gender, gestational and postnatal age, preeclampsia (PE), premature rupture of membranes (PROM) as well as prenatal steroid treatment (PS) and the frequency of activated T lymphocyte subsets (HLA-DR+, CD 69 +, CD 25 +, CD 62 L+) and major T lymphocyte subpopulations (CD 4, CD 8, Th 1, Th 2, naive, memory) in peripheral blood during the first postnatal week in preterm infants. RESULTS: Cord blood and peripheral blood samples were collected from 43 preterm infants on the 1 st, 3 rd, and 7 th days of life. We assessed the frequency of the above T lymphocyte subsets using flow cytometry. The 'mixed effect model' was used to analyze the effects of clinical parameters on T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>markers.</b> The frequency of CD 25 + T lymphocytes was higher in PROM. The frequency of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells and the CD 4 +/CD 8 + cell ratio was decreased in PE. The frequency of CD 62 L+ T lymphocytes was higher in male compared with female infants. PS did not affect the frequency of the investigated markers. CD 4 + CD 25 + cells had a lower frequency at birth than on day 7. Th 2 lymphocytes had a lower frequency on postnatal days 1 and 3 when compared to day 7.

Very chronic ureaplasma colonization of amniotic fluid causes low-grade lung inflammation and functional lung maturation in fetal sheep. Less is known about shorter exposures of the fetal lung. Therefore, we hypothesized that ureaplasmas would cause an acute inflammatory response that would alter lung development. Singleton ovine fetuses received intra-amniotic Ureaplasma parvum serovar 3 or control media at 110, 117, or 121 days and were delivered at 124 days gestational age (term = 150 days). Inflammation was assessed by 1) cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and 2) cytokine mRNA measurements, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry for inflammatory cells and elastin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining in lung tissue. Neutrophils were increased in BALF 3 days after exposure to ureaplasmas (P = 0. 01).

One important requirement for this assay is the inclusion of a protein transport inhibitor in stimulated cell cultures to trap the cytokine, thus allowing a brighter signal. Two compounds commonly used for this purpose are brefeldin A (BFA) and monensin (MN). Flow cytometry was used to assess the differential effects of BFA and MN on surface CD 3, - 4, - 8, and - 69 expression and the intracellular expression of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) following stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. We found that BFA blocked the majority of CD 3 + cells from expressing surface CD 69, but BFA did not inhibit intracellular CD 69 expression. MN did not significantly inhibit surface CD 69 expression. With regard to <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>marker</b> expression following activation, surface CD 4 expression was significantly downregulated; however, less downregulation was observed with BFA treatment than with MN treatment. Analyzing intracellular cytokine expression, BFA trapped a greater percentage of TNF-α inside activated cells than MN. An analysis of the cytokine concentration in culture supernatants indicated that cells treated with MN released TNF-α and IFN-γ from the cells, while the BFA-treated cells released IFN-γ only. With prolonged (18 -h) stimulation, the cells treated with MN were less viable than those treated with BFA. We conclude that the choice of a protein transport inhibitor is an important variable in this assay. When developing this method as a tool for clinical immunology laboratory analysis, investigators should consider the differential effects of BFA and MN on results...|$|E
40|$|B {{lymphocytes}} are {{an important}} cell population of the immune system. However, until recently {{it was not possible}} to transduce resting B lymphocytes with retro- or lentiviral vectors, making them unsusceptible for genetic manipulations by these vectors. Lately, we demonstrated that lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with modified measles virus (MV) glycoproteins hemagglutinin, responsible for receptor recognition, and fusion protein were able to overcome this transduction block. They use either the natural MV receptors, CD 46 and signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM), for cell entry (MV-LV) or the vector particles were further modified to selectively enter via the CD 20 molecule, which is exclusively expressed on B lymphocytes (CD 20 -LV). It has been shown previously that transduction by MV-LV does not induce B lymphocyte activation. However, if this is also true for CD 20 -LV is still unknown. Here, we generated a vector specific for another B <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>marker,</b> CD 19, and compared its ability to transduce resting B lymphocytes with CD 20 -LV. The vector (CD 19 ds-LV) was able to stably transduce unstimulated B lymphocytes, albeit with a reduced efficiency of about 10 % compared to CD 20 -LV, which transduced about 30 % of the cells. Since CD 20 as well as CD 19 are closely linked to the B lymphocyte activation pathway, we investigated if engagement of CD 20 or CD 19 molecules by the vector particles induces activating stimuli in resting B lymphocytes. Although, activation of B lymphocytes often involves calcium influx, we did not detect elevated calcium levels. However, the activation marker CD 71 was substantially up-regulated upon CD 20 -LV transduction and mos...|$|E
40|$|Biotinylation and radioiodination {{have been}} {{compared}} for labeling lymphocyte-surface proteins and the labeled proteins symmetrically immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing major <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>markers</b> {{such as the}} murine Thy- 1, CD 25 (the alpha subunit of the interleukin- 2 receptor), CD 45, and human CD 2 glycoproteins. The detection of biotinylated proteins by enhanced chemiluminescence after transfer to nitrocellulose {{was found to be}} fast and as efficient as the detection of iodinated proteins by autoradiography. The vectoriality of cell-surface biotinylation was ascertained by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the cellular extract in which the major cytoplasmic proteins were not found biotinylated. This nonradioactive labeling procedure offers a convenient and efficient alternative to radiolabeling of cell surfaces for the biochemical analysis of extracellular domains of membrane proteins...|$|R
40|$|A {{relation}} between lymphoma and autoimmune neutropenia, unlike autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, has not previously been well documented. We report {{a patient with}} a disorder presenting as autoimmune agranulocytosis, splenomegaly, and infiltration of the hepatic sinusoids by lymphocytes. Antineutrophil antibodies were present. Over a 2 V 2 -year period, the illness progressed to an aggressive, poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma with terminal liver failure and fibrosis. Peripheral blood <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>markers</b> identified the tumor as a proliferation of T-cells of the helper class. A review of previous literature disclosed other reports of similar patients who had neutropenia, a lymphoproliferative illness, and hepatic disease. Our case is representative of a previously unrecognized syndrome characterized by autoimmune neutropenia {{in the setting of}} a lymphoproliferative disorder of T cells, with a predilection for liver involvement...|$|R
40|$|T/NK cell proliferative EBV {{associated}} {{disease is}} a rare one which {{is more common in}} eastern Asian countries. EBV is originally associated with B cells, and EBV associated T cell lymphoma is so rare. Hence we decided to describe a patient treated with misleading diagnoses such as TB and sarcoidosis for almost two years. The liver was biopsied after admission in this center, and gastric and colonic biopsy was also performed due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Diffuse infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells was seen, especially lymphocytes some of which were atypical. T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>markers</b> were seen in these cells by immunohistochemical staining. Further studies demonstrated T lymphocytes associated with EBV to be positive which is very rare event. Although going under chemotherapy, there were no response and the patient died...|$|R
