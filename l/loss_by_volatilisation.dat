40|$|Sugarcane {{grown in}} the Southern African region is reliant on large inputs of {{fertiliser}} nitrogen (up to 200 kg N /ha/crop) for producing optimum sucrose yields. Urea is the preferred N fertiliser, mainly due to a high N concentration [46 %] and a lower price per unit of N compared with its main competitors, limestone ammonium nitrate (LAN [28 %]) and ammonium sulphate (AS [21 %]). While LAN, AS and urea suffer similar field losses of NO 3 -N by leaching and denitrification, urea is subject to additional NH 3 -N <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilisation</b> from both acid and alkaline non-irrigated soils. A new laboratory method was developed to test grower soils for potential ammonia volatilisation from surface-applied urea. An empirical ammonia volatilisation model, based on soil buffer capacity, was developed from these new soil test data, requiring N-rate, soil pH, organic matter, and clay as inputs. The model was used to predict potential ammonia volatilisation losses from selected field trials and laboratory studies in South Africa and the USA. Good correlations between model predictions and experimental results, including sugar yield, highlighted {{the significance of the}} ammonia volatilisation process as a component of overall nitrogen fertiliser efficiency on many sugarcane soils. Possible management options which could improve N fertiliser efficiency on dryland South African sugarcane farms are discussed. These include use of the alternative N sources LAN or AS, broadcasting urea instead of banding, urea burying, fertiliser splitting, and liquid fertilisers...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of using of biuret as a plant growth and/or soil microbial activity regulator at low concentrations, and as a slow-release N fertiliser at high concentrations. Biuret stimulated Douglas-fir seedling growth at low concentrations, but inhibited it at high concentrations. The stimulation of biuret on seedling growth in sand and solution culture was associated with increased net photosynthetic rate and nutrient uptake and when grown in the soil it was also related to the improvement of soil N availability and therefore the uptake of N by seedlings. Provenance 93 (relatively fast growing) was more responsive to lower concentrations of biuret, but {{more sensitive to the}} toxicity of biuret at high concentrations than provenance 98 (relatively slow growing). Yellow-tip (chlorosis) in needles was a typical symptom of biuret toxicity. Applied nitrogen had a much greater effect on Douglas fir seedling growth than biuret. Provenance 93 grew faster at lower N supply due to its greater ability to absorb more nutrients and further to distribute more into the shoot. Biuret at lower concentrations had a positive real priming effect on net mineralisation of native soil N in both soils. The causes for the positive priming effects were related to the stimulation of microbial growth and activity at an early stage of the incubation and/or the death of microbes at a later stage, which was biuret-concentration-dependent. Biuret additions increased gross rates of soil N mineralisation and nitrification and affected the turnover rates of mineral N pools. The biuret-¹⁵N tracing technique further confirmed that biuret addition stimulated the mineralization of native soil N by increasing the turnover rate constant (k value). The potential of biuret as a slow-release N source at high concentrations (especially in the Burnham soil) was related to the slow mineralisation, nitrification and more immobilisation of biuret-N, which reduced the potential of N <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilisation</b> and denitrification...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect that the {{randomised}} versus even distribution of excreta (dung and urine) may have on modelling nitrogen (N) <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> leaching, <b>volatilisation</b> and denitrification from a grazing system. A range of stock densities (from 200 to 2000 sheep/ha, equivalent to an annual stocking rate of 3 to 33 dry sheep equivalent (DSE) /ha respectively) were simulated to represent an increasing application of N excreta to a grazed 1 hectare area either distributed randomly or uniformly. This study found that the proportion of annual N inputs lost by denitrification were significantly lower and leaching N losses were higher at high stocking densities compared to if excreta was distributed uniformly. The results of this study indicate that N losses from a sheep grazing system could be adequately modelled assuming uniform distribution of excreta at stocking densities up to 1200 sheep/ha (equivalent to an annual stocking rate of 20 DSE/ha). But at higher stock densities, when N loads are high, the spatial distribution of excreta is important and models need to explicitly deal with the distribution of dung and urine N returns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{sustainable}} progress {{of nuclear power}} relies on a safe and secure management of radioactive waste and on the implementation of processes fulfilling the enhanced safety and security principles of an advanced nuclear fuel cycle. To this end, a pyrochemical electrorefining process for the recovery of actinides from metallic nuclear fuel based on An-Zr alloys in a molten salt medium is investigated at ITU. It consists of anodic dissolution of the fuel in a molten salt bath and selective electrochemical reduction of the actinides that are then collected {{in the form of}} An-Al alloys on solid aluminium cathodes. For the separation of the actinides from the aluminium a chlorination route is proposed at ITU. It consists of three steps: (I) distillation of the adhered salt; (II) chlorination of the An-Al alloys with either HCl(g) or Cl 2 (g) under conditions ensuring a full chlorination, forming AnClx(s) and AlCl 3 (g) avoiding formation of volatile actinide chlorides. A subsequent sublimation step (III) to remove any remaining AlCl 3 is also investigated. Prior to laboratory experiments, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed to evaluate the optimal reaction conditions for U, Pu and Np. Using the equilibrium module of the software HSC-Chemistry 6. 0, the conditions for different temperatures and ratios of chlorination gas to An-Al alloys were calculated. Based on these calculations the temperature range to be tested experimentally was limited to 300 - 400 °C in the case of HCl(g) and 150 - 170 °C in the case of Cl 2 (g) to exclude the formation of volatile actinide chloride species such as UCl 6 (g). As starting materials, samples prepared by electrorefining of U-Pu-Zr alloys, as well as An-Al alloys prepared by arc melting of the pure elements, were used. The experiments were carried out in a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere. The box is equipped with a Ar/HCl/Cl 2 gas line, a vacuum pump and a vertical furnace in which a reactor of 1 l in volume made of quartz glass is placed. A boron nitride crucible was used as the reaction vessel. After inserting the An-Al alloys into it, it was placed in the quartz reactor. The reactor was filled with Ar, heated to the desired temperature, filled with the chlorination gas and isolated for a specific time. The evaluation of the process efficiency is based on XRD and ICP-OES analysis of samples taken from the reaction products and from the cold parts of the reactor, where evaporated material such as AlCl 3 is condensed. The formation of actinide chlorides with high efficiencies was proved without An <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>volatilisation.</b> JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen {{is usually}} the {{limiting}} factor to high yields in rice fields. Therefore, use of BNF as an alternative or supplementary source of N for rice has been the major approach in microbiological management of wetland rice. Among N 2 -fixing micro-organisms present or introduced in rice fields, cyanobacteria play a major role. Free living indigenous forms have spontaneously unabled modest but constant yields (1 - 2 t ha- 1) to be obtained for centuries after continuous cropping without N fertiliser addition. Symbiotic forms were also used for centuries in rice fields in China and Vietnam, allowing significant yields (2 - 5 t ha- 1) to be obtained through labor-intensive and quite sophisticated green manuring technology. Research on free-living and symbiotic cyanobacteria as biofertilisers for rice reached intensive development in the 70 's and the 80 's. Since then, the number of research papers dealing with these topics has markedly declined. Research on free-living cyanobacteria has shown that, as an additional source of N for rice, they have a moderate potential of about 30 kg N ha- 1 crop cycle- 1 which may translate to a yield increase of 300 - 450 kg ha- 1. Inoculation of rice fields with selected or transformed strains is not a proven technology. On the other hand, the knowledge acquired on the general ecology of the rice field floodwater during these studies has unabled practical recommandations to optimise its management {{in a way that}} favors BNF by cyanobacteria, improves chemical N fertiliser utilisation, and helps controlling populations of detrimental invertebrates. Over the long term, biological engineering of cyanobacteria may design "super N 2 - fixing cyanobacteria" but the characteristics that will enable them to survive, develop, and fix N 2 in rice fields are still not known. #Azolla$ has proved useful as a nitrogen biofertiliser in China and Viet-Nam. Currently it's use has drastically diminished in these countries and #Azolla$ has not been adopted in most of the countries where it was tested for adoption as green manure for rice. Progress in strain collection, selection, hybridization, and recombination has opened ways to alleviate many environmental and nutritional limitations of #Azolla$. However, the socio-economic limitations are the most important and are probably increasing in relation to changes in agricultural policies and practices. But recent studies have shown that #Azolla$ has a potential not only as a green manure, but as a multipurpose biofertiliser that can also decrease N <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> ammonia <b>volatilisation.</b> It can also be a weed suppressor, a potassium source through its ability to concentrate this element, an animal feed, and a primary producer in rice- fish-#Azolla$ cultivation.

50|$|Most plant nutrients, {{with the}} {{exception}} of nitrogen, originate from the minerals that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute nitric acid and ammonia, but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of nitrogen fixation by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues (soil organic matter), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living microorganisms and soil organic matter are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility.

In continuous and batch experiments, maximum concentration factors up to 3. 5 and 4. 1 were obtained, respectively. The desalination capacity did not decrease significantly during continuous operation periods of several weeks. Membrane cleaning after 195 days resulted in approximately 35 % increase in desalination rate. The Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES), a bioassay that selectively detects oestrogenic compounds, confirmed that about 90 % of the oestrogenic activity was removed by electrodialysis.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} and fate of fertiliser nitrogen applied to combine-sown rice were investigated in field experiments in which fertiliser timing, water regime and soil type were varied. The information gained {{was used to}} predict strategies for optimising fertiliser efficiency using current techniques, and to predict and test improved fertilisation technologies. The stage of crop growth, water regime and soil properties all had large and interacting effects on agronomic efficiency. On an infertile alkaline grey clay soil, agronomic efficiency of urea applied at sowing was very low (8 kg kg- 1) compared with later applications associated with continuous flooding (up to 56 kg kg- 1). The low efficiency was due to nitrification and subsequent de-nitrification during the flushing period. Nitrogen- 15 balance studies indicated that 80 % of the urea nitrogen was lost from the soil-plant system. The rapid nitrification rate and high loss of nitrogen on the grey soil contrasted with the very low levels of nitrate and low losses of nitrogen (10 - 25 %) from urea applied to rice growing on an infertile acidic red soil under alternating conditions of saturation and aeration (sprinkler-irrigation). Furthermore, on a fertile acidic red soil in the same region, other authors have measured large yield responses to nitrogen applied at sowing. These differences highlight the need to consider soil properties and water management when attempting to predict optimum fertilisation strategies. Yields of sprinkler-irrigated rice (managed to replace water lost by evaporation) were reduced by more than 50 % compared with rice grown under continuous flood. However, this was not due to decreased plant uptake or increased loss of fertiliser nitrogen in the sprinkler-irrigated treatments. The low yields appeared {{to be associated with}} plant water stress, decreased nitrogen mineralization (by approximately half) and location of the fertiliser nitrogen near the soil surface where root activity was probably restricted due to inadequate moisture. On the grey soil, maximum agronomic efficiencies occurred with application shortly before permanent flood or at early panicle elongation. Efficiency was doubled when urea was applied before permanent flood compared with shortly after permanent flood. The greater efficiency appeared {{to be associated with the}} deeper transport of the applied nitrogen into the soil, and consequently lower <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> ammonia <b>volatilisation</b> and/or nitrification/de-nitrification. However, even with the most efficient fertilisation strategies, plant 15 N recoveries were less than 40 %, while losses exceeded 20 %. When the 15 N balance data were considered in conjunction with the agronomic data,. it appeared that it would be possible to further increase agronomic efficiency if plant recovery of applied nitrogen could be increased. In particular, minimisation of losses of nitrogen (via nitrification/de-nitrification) from fertiliser applied before permanent flood was a most attractive option. Potential methods identified for increasing agronomic efficiency <b>by</b> minimising <b>losses</b> of nitrogen applied before permanent flood were deep placement and the use of nitrification inhibitors and slow release nitrogen sources. Several experiments were conducted in an attempt to improve fertiliser efficiency by banding urea and modified urea sources 5 - 7 cm below the soil surface before permanent flood. Plant recovery of 15 N was increased by up to 20 % with banding compared with surface broadcasting. The best recoveries were from urea super-granules (USG). An experimental fertiliser rig and a commercial seeder fitted with a triple disc assembly were used to band the fertilisers in the main plots. There was no significant yield advantage with banded urea over broadcast urea applied before permanent flood. The fertiliser rig caused considerable plant damage. Using the triple disc applicator, it was possible to band fertiliser below the soil surface with minimal soil disturbance, and plant damage, but only under i ideal conditions of soil moisture. Furthermore, where the soil surface was dry and cracked, penetration with the triple discs was no greater than the depth of the cracks into which surface applied urea prills would be washed upon flooding. The yield test of USG was unsatisfactory because of the excessive plant damage with this method. With current technology, there appears to be little scope for improving the efficiency of urea applied before permanent flood by mechanical placement below the soil surface.
