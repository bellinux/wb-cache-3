5|$|During {{this same}} time, Dunderdale {{was named the}} best fiscal {{performer}} of Canada's premiers by the Fraser Institute. The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office, which was the 2011-2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> performance on three core components of fiscal policy: government spending, taxes, and debt and deficits. Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth in spending.|$|E
25|$|Boston On Fire: Also {{known as}} Blind Moon or a Grand Slam. This is a blind bid {{to take all}} tricks in a hand, made before either partner has <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> cards. Again, {{the first team to}} bid either Double Blind Nil or Blind Moon has precedence.|$|E
25|$|Nil: A {{player that}} has already <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> cards can bid Nil. The object of the bidder is to take no tricks during the hand. The player's partner may make a normal bid and then help them by {{attempting}} to take tricks the Nil bidder would otherwise take. In solo/cutthroat spades, successful Nil bids are rare {{since there is no}} partner to help by taking the bidder's higher cards. If the Nil bidder takes no tricks, he receives the Nil bonus; if unsuccessful, the player or team subtracts that bonus. More than one player (opponents or teammates in partners) may bid Nil on a deal.|$|E

25|$|With a 10-day {{break between}} the 4th and 5th Tests, England <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> squad {{following}} their batting performances at Headingley. Many names were thrown up as possible replacements for the failing middle order of Bopara, Bell and Collingwood, including Jonathan Trott and Robert Key, {{as well as}} Mark Ramprakash, whose last test came in 2002, and Marcus Trescothick, who then ruled {{himself out of the}} running. The fitness of Andrew Flintoff was also questioned, as many commentators said {{that he would have to}} play if England were to win the Test. Flintoff remained in the squad, the only change being the introduction of Trott for Bopara, with the confirmation that the South African-born batsman would make his Test debut at The Oval.|$|E

2500|$|A {{recent example}} of {{reflexivity}} in modern financial markets {{is that of}} the debt and equity of housing markets. Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. [...] More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses. [...] Lenders <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans – the value of the houses – had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively). [...] Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.|$|E

The Captain then asked the First Officer {{if one of the}} ground crews had tampered with the panel near the plane's rear door, and subsequently stated that [...] "the guy" [...] had problems and was pissed at them. The flight continued to Lagos and the crew continued to discuss the problem they were facing. They noticed that there were differences on the EPR value on the engines. The crew also noticed that there was no response from the left engine when they advanced the throttle lever, thus concluded that the left engine was inoperative. The crew decided to start their descent towards Lagos. As a failure on the left engine occurred, the crew should have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and followed procedures accordingly, but failed to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{very common}} {{variants}} of bidding {{are for a}} player or partnership to bid [...] "blind", without having <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> cards, or to bid [...] "nil", stating {{that they will not}} take a single trick during play of the hand. These bids give the partnership a bonus if the player exactly meets their bid, but penalizes them if the players takes more or fewer. A combined bid of 2"blind nil" [...] is usually allowed, and is worth both the blind and nil bonuses or penalties. In some variants, the player bidding nil passes 1 or 2 of his cards (depending on the variant rules) to his partner and the partner passes an equal number of her cards back in what is considered [...] "nil passing". [...] Nil passing may be allowed only {{in the case of a}} blind nil.|$|E
2500|$|Blind bidding: Virtually all games {{include a}} variant that may happen during bidding; {{one or more}} players, having not yet <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> cards, may choose to bid {{on the number of}} tricks they will take. When bidding [...] "blind", the player's bid, if made exactly by that player, is rewarded with bonus points, while failing to make the bid results in the bonus being {{subtracted}} from the player's or team's score. Blind bidding is capped at a bid of seven. Thus, bidding a blind 8 or higher is contrary to standard game play, and is not allowed. Quite commonly, blind bids are allowed only if the bidding team is at least 100 points behind, and in many cases, whether a minimum point spread is required, these risky bids are typically made by a team with a large deficit as a last-ditch effort; blind bids made in this situation are typically called [...] "trailing blind bids".|$|E

2500|$|Studies in mice {{have found}} a link between BPA {{exposure}} and asthma; a 2010 study on mice has concluded that perinatal exposure to 10µg/ml of BPA in drinking water enhances allergic sensitization and bronchial inflammation and responsiveness in an animal model of asthma. [...] A study published in JAMA pediatrics has found that prenatal exposure to BPA is also linked to lower lung capacity in some young children. This study had 398 mother-infant pairs and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> urine samples to detect concentrations of BPA. They study found that every 10-fold increase in BPA was tied to a 55% increase in the odds of wheezing. The higher the concentration of BPA during pregnancy were linked to decrease lung capacity in children under four years old but the link disappeared at age 5. Associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine said, [...] "Exposure during pregnancy, not after, {{appears to be the}} critical time for BPA, possibly because it's affecting important pathways that help the lung develop." ...|$|E
