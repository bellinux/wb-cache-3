50|$|Building {{surveyors}} work in most {{real estate}} markets including residential, commercial, retail, industrial, <b>leisure,</b> <b>education</b> and health. Consequently, {{there are a}} wide variety of opportunities for chartered building surveyors to work in both the commercial, private, and public sectors. Many chartered building surveyors work for property consultancies, public sector organisations, real estate owning clients and contractors as well as in a number of specialist niche areas such as insurance, rights to light, party wall matters etc. As well as strong technical skills, building surveyors need to have strong people skills and the highest levels of integrity. Clients, whether a large corporation or an individual member of the public, need to have the utmost confidence in the impartial advice given by chartered building surveyors. Chartered building surveyors are clearly differentiated from the rest of their market by their enhanced technical knowledge and professional standards.|$|E
