Halliday divides the ideational into the logical and the experiential metafunctions. The <b>logical</b> <b>metafunction</b> refers to the grammatical resources for building up grammatical units into complexes, for instance, for combining two or more clauses into a clause complex. The experiential function refers to the grammatical resources involved in construing the flux of experience through the unit of the clause.|$|E

30|$|Coherence in SFL {{framework}} {{is defined as}} the property of “unity” and “hanging together” (Hasan 1984, p. 181). Given the property, coherence is studied from logical and textual metafunctions in the present research. The <b>logical</b> <b>metafunction</b> is realized by paratactic and hypotactic complexes at different ranks, with one of these, the clause rank, being the focus of this research. The textual metafunction is realized by cohesion around the clause (Halliday and Matthiessen 2004). The realization of coherence can be studied in terms of the lexicogrammatical patterns of logical and textual metafunctions.|$|E
30|$|As stated before, the {{collaborative}} {{effect of the}} textual and <b>logical</b> <b>metafunctions</b> can be probed through the logical relations of clauses with relevant tokens. Based on the analysis in the previous section, the percentage of clauses containing relevant tokens is quite different between the Chinese source text and the English target texts. The Chinese ST has a lower percentage of clauses in the cohesive chains than the two English TTs. This section describes in detail {{the differences in the}} clauses with relevant tokens in both the ST and TTs.|$|R
30|$|The clauses {{entering}} into the cohesive chains {{can be considered}} as contributing to the formation of cohesion, and also to the texture of the text, in terms of their complexity, taxis, and also logico-semantic type. The features that the clauses with relevant tokens display show the lexicogrammatical realization patterns of the <b>logical</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> together in a coherent text.|$|R
30|$|Coherence can {{be studied}} from both logical and textual {{perspectives}} in systemic functional linguistics.

40|$|Since 1970 s, {{a growing}} number of {{systemic}} functional descriptions of languages other English have been undertaken (see Matthiessen 2007). In the case of Chinese, the most significant lexicogrammatical attention is given to clause and verbal groups (such as McDonald 1998; Li 2007). This gives the present author an incentive to investigate nominal groups in Chinese. Drawing upon systemic functional linguistic theory on lexicogrammar (Halliday & Matthiessen 2004; Matthiessen 1995), the present study aims to explore the logical resources provided by nominal groups of Mandarin Chinese. The description will go into two parts: firstly, I will give an overview of the logical resources that the Chinese nominal group can provide, exploring the <b>logical</b> <b>metafunction</b> in terms of Taxis and Logico-semantic relations; secondly, I will investigate the logical complexity of the nominal group by looking at the modification structure as well as the complexity of embedding. The study aims to provide a new perspective in doing text analysis and also make contribution to the typological descriptive work on nominal groups. Finally, a case study will be presented, where the nominal groups used in two authentic texts in the same field are compared in terms of <b>logical</b> <b>metafunction.</b> The case study aims to illustrate how the logical complexity of the nominal groups is presented to help create registerial features of a text. 6 page(s...|$|E

Experiential {{resources of}} Chinese nominal groups [...] Chapter 5. Interpersonal resources of Chinese nominal groups [...] Chapter 6. Textual resources of Chinese nominal groups [...] Chapter 7. Summary and conclusion. For {{the past two}} decades, great efforts {{have been made in}} the systemic functional description of English and many other languages including Chinese at the clause level. However, very few descriptive work has been done at the group/phrase level. As an attempt to fill in the gap, this thesis extends the lexicogrammatical study to the level of nominal groups, focusing on Mandarin Chinese in particular. Drawing upon a corpus of 180 quality texts of different text types, the investigation is heavily text-based: the nominal groups are observed in the environment of clauses, sentences, paragraphs and texts in contexts. The description of Chinese nominal groups is unfolded on the basis of Halliday’s metafunctional model, exploring the metafunctional resources that Chinese nominal groups provide in realising the three strands of meaning: ideational (including logical and experiential), interpersonal and textual meanings. Through the investigation of each metafunction, some important systems within the nominal group are presented, which provide selections in realising the metafunctional meanings. In terms of <b>logical</b> <b>metafunction,</b> the system of MODIFICATION is presented. In terms of experiential metafunction, the systems presented include THING TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, EPITHESIS, QUALIFICATION, and MEASURE. In terms of interpersonal metafunction, the system of PERSON is introduced. And finally, in terms of textual metafunction, the exploration includes the system of NAMING, the system of IDENTIFICATION, and the system of NUMERATION. Major selections on each of these systems are discussed in detail, with examples demonstrating the potential lexicogrammatical choices. Apart from the exploration of the systems, another focus of the study is on the potential application of the findings to other areas. For this purpose, at the end of each metafunctional exploration, a case study involving different types of texts is presented, demonstrating the significance of nominal groups in their contributions to the metafunctional meanings. The case studies are designed to explore different issues in relation to the use of nominal groups, including the modification structure of the nominal groups and its relation with text types (in the logical exploration), the experiential environment of Thing type choices in different types of texts (in the experiential exploration), the choice of nominal groups in enacting different attitudes (in the interpersonal exploration), and challenges of cohesion and coherence in machine translation presented by nominal groups (in the textual exploration). Through in-depth metafunctional exploration of the nominal gorups, as well as illustrative case studies, this research is expected to contribute to the development of language typology in Systemic Functional Linguistics, as well as other areas including delicate discourse analysis, the study of Chinese language, and machine translation research.

To better understand the patterns of the <b>logical</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> in the construction of a coherent text, the interweaving of clause and cohesive chains at lexicogrammatical level in the above analysis can be summarised, to give a general view. In general terms, the clauses in the cohesive chains in the Chinese source text and the two English target texts display some similarities as well as differences, which can be stated as follows: [...]...|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} clause {{complexity}} of the clauses with relevant tokens, {{the study of the}} calibration of cohesive chains with other metafunctions is fore grounded in this analysis. The cohesive chains realize the semantic continuity and the texture of the text. Through the cohesive chains, both identity and similarity, the plot is continuous, with the strings of events and characters under a certain context, in narrative texts. Since the study of cohesive chains reveals the continuity of the text, such a study {{can be seen as the}} basis for further investigation into the textual coherence of a text. As stated in the framework, the realization of coherence at the lexicogrammatical level is reflected in the analysis from the perspectives of the <b>logical</b> and textual <b>metafunctions.</b> In addition, the combination of the logical relations and cohesive chains demonstrates how the semantic continuity of the text is realized grammatically via the progression of the clauses. The different logical relations may have different functions in the creation of the text. The coherence of the text can be expressed by the lexicogrammatical patterns of the combination of the logical and textual.|$|R
40|$|Coherence can {{be studied}} from both logical and textual {{perspectives}} in systemic functional linguistics. The <b>logical</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> together contribute to the coherence of a text. Coherence is realized through clause complexes and cohesive chains at the lexicogrammatical level from the logical and textual meanings. Clause complex reflects the logical development of the text, while cohesive chains are the threads of a coherent text. The clauses {{that are involved in}} cohesive chains take a more important role in forming a coherent text than others, and thus have the potential to reveal the features of coherence realization. This research aims to explore the realization of coherence in a Chinese novel Hong Lou Meng and its two English translations, The Dream of the Red Mansions (by Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang) and The Story of the Stone (by David Hawkes), or more specifically, the distribution of logico-semantic types in both the Chinese (ST) and the English texts (TT). The research shows that there are both similarities and differences between the ST and the TTs on the one hand, and between the TTs on the other, and that the differences are related to the styles of translators. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} analyze the errors arising in {{translation}} of legal documents from English to Persian. Most of the researchers conducted on explaining the complexity of legal language, has shown that vocabulary and terminology has justifiably received the most attention, as lexis fulfills the symbolic or representational function of language {{better than any other}} linguistic component. Consequently it has been supposed that in legal translation, just finding appropriate equivalent for vocabulary and terminology is sufficient. But in this paper, which examines the errors occurred in English –Persian translation of legal documents, the translated text will be analyzed at sentence level based on a meaning-based functional approach; i. e. Systemic Functional Grammar Approach (SFG) to see whether we can apply it as an objective criteria for error analysis of translated legal documents & how. For this purpose, nine error categories were considered; including interpersonal, textual, <b>logical</b> and experiential <b>metafunctions</b> and in order to understand experiential meaning, it was broken into three functional constituents; that is participant, process and circumstance. Further to the above categories, three other issues, including mistranslation, omission and word choice were considered, as well. Then while dividing the legal text into separate sentences, each sentence was analyzed according to these categories. The results of this research show that SFG approach would be an appropriate criteria and scale for evaluating the accuracy of the legal documents translation, not only for legal translators in producing an accurate and perfect translation, but also for teachers in evaluating the students’ translation abilities, objectively...|$|R
