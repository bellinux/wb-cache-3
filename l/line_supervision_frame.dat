40|$|Clinical Supervision {{has been}} {{identified}} as a means to support and enhance professional development and is recommended for all mental health nurses. However, it continues to have limited uptake in some mental health services, particularly within inpatient units. There is also confusion about what actually constitutes clinical supervision which is often misguidedly seen as <b>line</b> management <b>supervision.</b> One factor that {{has been identified}} as increasing the uptake or implementation of clinical supervision in inpatient units has been strong management support for clinical supervision practice (Lynch, Hancox, Happell, & Parker, 2008). The aims and objectives of the research project were to explore the knowledge, understanding of and attitudes towards clinical supervision of the senior clinical leaders of the inpatient mental health units of a large metropolitan public mental health service, located in Melbourne. Data collected included participants details, the clinical leaders' participation in having their own clinical supervision and their support of staff in taking up clinical supervision. The researcher was interested in the individual's experience of clinical supervision and hence used hermeneutic phenomenology methodology and employed individual interviews as the primary method of capturing the data. The preliminary results from this research will be presented with particular focus on the enablers and barriers to the uptake of clinical supervision practice in mental health inpatient units from a leadership perspective. The results will inform collaboration between senior clinical leaders and the practice development team to increase the uptake of clinical supervision in inpatient units...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the vast}} amounts of video {{available}} online, and recent breakthroughs in object detection with static images, object detection in video offers a promising new frontier. However, motion blur and compression artifacts cause substantial frame-level variability, even in videos that appear smooth to the eye. Additionally, video datasets tend to have sparsely annotated frames. We present a new framework for improving object detection in videos that captures temporal context and encourages consistency of predictions. First, we train a pseudo-labeler, that is, a domain-adapted convolutional neural network for object detection. The pseudo-labeler is first trained individually on the subset of labeled frames, and then subsequently applied to all frames. Then we train a recurrent neural network that takes as input sequences of pseudo-labeled frames and optimizes an objective that encourages both accuracy on the target frame and consistency across consecutive frames. The approach incorporates strong <b>supervision</b> of target <b>frames,</b> weak-supervision on context frames, and regularization via a smoothness penalty. Our approach achieves mean Average Precision (mAP) of 68. 73, an improvement of 7. 1 over the strongest image-based baselines for the Youtube-Video Objects dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that neighboring frames can provide valuable information, even absent labels. Comment: To appear in BMVC 201...|$|R
40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is first, to {{identify}} the critical managerial competencies of primary care managers; and second, to determine the relationship between personality and motivation, and managerial competency. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted involving distribution of questionnaires to 358 rural primary care managers in Southern Thailand. Findings – The survey found six critical managerial competencies: visionary leadership;assessment, planning, and evaluation; promotion of health and prevention of disease; information management; partnership and collaboration; and communication. Both personality and motivation are found to significantly influence primary care managers’ managerial competency. In particular, conscientiousness (i. e. perseveres until the task is finished, does a thorough job, full of energy, does things efficiently, and a lot of enthusiasm) is related to all managerial competencies. It is clear that extrinsic and intrinsic factors (i. e. quality of supervision and leadership, organizational policy and administration, interpersonal relationship, working conditions, work itself, amount of responsibility, and job recognition) are influential in primary care manager motivation that can significantly improve morale. Research limitations/implications – The short version of the personality instrument may limit the generalization of some of the findings. Future research is needed to assess the relationship between managerial competency and performance. Further research could be done in other countries to see if this conclusion is in fact correct. It would also be useful to research if the findings apply to other health and social areas. Practical implications – Personality and motivation are able to co-predict managerial competency whereby motivation tends to have a stronger influence than personality. These findings will be useful to policy makers and to those responsible for the human development in the preparation of management training and development programs. Moreover, top management should not overlook the motivational system as a way to encourage managers to be competent in their job. Originality/value – The paper contributes to our understanding of managerial competency within the context of rural primary care sectors. The success of any organized health program depends upon effective management, but health systems worldwide face a lack of competent management at all levels. Management development for health systems, particularly at the first <b>line</b> of <b>supervision,</b> must be given much higher priority for investment...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, {{a number}} of serious case reviews within social work and social care {{highlighted}} systemic failures within care organisations, resulting in wholesale structural reforms aimed at improving services. These have combined with increased inspection and surveillance of professional practice alongside calls for more staff training and supervision. Less {{attention has been given}} to examining the cultural aspects of social care organisations that may have contributed to such failures and the potential roles that front line managers play in promoting or mediating organisational culture within their individual relationships with front <b>line</b> staff. Professional <b>supervision</b> is cited within the social work literature {{as one of the most}} effective tools for facilitating and supporting individuals to contain and work with the anxiety that naturally arises within social work. Through its different functions, supervision provides an opportunity for managers to engage staff with the vision of the organisation and its standards. This paper explores how some of these opportunities are actually utilised and reports on the findings of a small scale qualitative study which captured data of digital visual recordings of management supervision and the managers’ own reflective accounts about the effectiveness of their supervision skills. Closer analysis of this data gave a glimpse into the different roles that managers perform within the supervision context and this paper discusses some of the strategies the managers used to communicate or mediate aspects of organisational culture to individual staff and support them in their stressful jobs. Some tentative recommendations are made regarding the importance of prioritising particular functions of supervision and for managers in providing space for staff to reflect critically on the context in which they work. These strategies may allow the tacit or taken-for-granted assumptions and beliefs in every-day practice to surface and also to increase the participation and engagement of staff in delivering quality services...|$|R
25|$|Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard) Chalet Maid/Yellowcoat – Peggy was {{the maid}} who looked after the staff chalet <b>lines</b> under the <b>supervision</b> of the fearsome Miss Cathcart. She always {{aspired to be}} a Yellowcoat, and tried her hardest to get {{involved}} with the entertainment in any way she could. Born in Lancashire in 1931, her father worked for the coal and gaslight company and had a passion for motorbike racing, and Peggy was an experienced rider who had a licence {{by the time she was}} 16. Her father had died by the time she joined Maplins, and Peggy was supporting her widowed mother from her wages. In addition to her regular duties, she often helped out the entertainment staff, and could always be seen in the evenings in the Hawaiian ballroom, enjoying (and often joining in with) the evening entertainments. She frequently tried to get involved in the entertainment events, but was always stopped by Gladys, who forbade Peggy's involvement as she was not on the entertainment staff. However, on several occasions, Gladys was overruled by Jeffrey Fairbrother, who allowed Peggy to take part in certain events, which usually involved dressing up in silly costumes to take the place of certain members of the entertainment staff (usually Yvonne) who found it humiliating. Peggy used to play the organ in chapel, and stepped in when Ramona didn't turn up to play at the Marines event. Peggy had a rather vivid imagination and was often easily taken in by others' lies, particularly Ted's ridiculous tales when he needed a cover story. Peggy finally became a Yellowcoat in the final episode, when Dawn was hospitalised and they needed a replacement. After spending just one day as a Yellowcoat, she collapsed from nervous exhaustion and was admitted to hospital. Her job as a Yellowcoat was tragically short-lived, due to Maplins abolishing Yellowcoats after the 1960 season. She stayed on at the camp temporarily after the season ended, but in her old position as a chalet maid, claiming it was still a job and better than being out of work. It was left unknown whether Peggy continued working at Maplins after the 1960 season or whether she moved on.|$|R
40|$|This project {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the co-management arrangements built into the first <b>line</b> of <b>supervision</b> (module advisors) at the Saturn Corporation on first time quality (FTQ) performance and improvements in first time quality. This is a very unique organizational arrangement wherein represented (i. e., unionized) and non-represented (i. e., managers) partners share responsibilities for co-managing production work teams. The purpose of this portion of our work is to test whether this co-management arrangement contributes to the performance of these work units and thereby adds value to Saturn as a whole. We focus on first time quality as the performance measure. In order to analyze the value-added to quality performance by Saturn's system of comanagement, represented and non-represented operations department-level middle managers were studied. A detailed analysis of the supervisory system at the department or module level across Saturn's three plants (called business units) allowed us to test whether the variations in the comanagement system and quality performance are systematically related. We analyzed the relationship between the behavior patterns and supervisory methods of both union and non-union middle managers, attributes of their individual union-management partnerships, differences in the patterns of communication and coordination of each group, and performance outcomes, in particular first-time-quality improvement. We also studied time use and the dynamics of partnerships, including the balancing of social and economic tasks, as well as the division of labor between represented and non-represented management. Specifically, we examined: 1) Whether represented managers were indeed managing people and technical aspects of the production process (called resources); 2) If represented managers were managing, did they manage their time, priorities, and communications differently than did their non-represented partners. 3) Whether the behaviors of represented managers added value to quality performance. 4) Whether the nature of the individual represented and non-represented manager partnerships at the department level had an impact on quality performance. These questions are important because some industry observers believe that while over half of the middle management positions at Saturn were indeed being filled by union members, Saturn had simply bought labor peace at a high price. They contended that only the non-represented managers were truly functioning in that role while the union members were either free riders or acting as grievance committeemen focusing exclusively on people issues. Another explanation for Saturn's remarkable quality performance is that a new 'effort bargain' was struck between GM and the UAW (i. e. workers simply work harder). We test our alternative hypothesis that this system of partnership and co-management systematically adds value by increasing the rate of first-time-quality improvement. These data allow us to test which, if any, of the specific attributes of the partnership (i. e. task balancing, represented and non-represented relationships, communication density, problem solving, etc.) predict quality performance. Data were collected via surveys from 150 managers across the three business units. Multiple regression techniques were used to analyze these data, and to test for the relationship of these specific aspects of the co-management system to first-time-quality improvement. Managers provided data on how they used their time during the day, how they thought they should allocate their time, and on their communications with others in the Saturn operations. The communications data were collected over a two week time period. The differences in the level and nature of communications were then analyzed to see if they affected quality performance outcomes. Two measures of quality serve as the performance outcomes {{to assess the impact of}} the Saturn partnership arrangements: 1) first time quality; and 2) quality improvement...|$|R
