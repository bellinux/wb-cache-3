500|$|France has {{explicitly}} {{called for}} a permanent seat in the UN for its close EU partner: [...] "Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influence—France would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council", French president Jacques Chirac {{said in a speech}} in Berlin in 2000. The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid. Former President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines also expressed his country's support for Germany's bid, together with Japan's. Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the UK. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat, but {{as long as there is}} little sign that France and the UK will give up their own seats, Germany should also have a seat.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, Usher competed in a dance battle against fellow R artist Chris Brown at the Reggae Sumfest. The battle sparked an Internet rumor of the two {{possibly}} going on tour. This was further pushed by producer Jermaine Dupri alluding that the two artist may be unaware of this upcoming tour. The singers later took to Twitter to ask who the fans would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> perform with. On September 8, 2010, the singer announced his touring trek (and revealed it was solo) for North America. Due to demand, many additional stops in Europe and Australasia were added. It is Usher's first arena tour since his 2004 effort, The Truth Tour. The then announced OMG Tour commenced on November 10, 2010 and concluded on June 1, 2011 with Usher performing {{in a total of}} 92 shows.

500|$|... "Proposition Infinity" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "This is the series I've {{been missing for}} years. It was goofy, spastic, over-stuffed, occasionally cruel, and bizarrely sincere." [...] He graded the episode A-, praising the [...] "No on Infinity" [...] ad parody and reappearances of George Takei and Hedonismbot in particular. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote: [...] "I’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> lay off the contemporary commentary episodes for a bit, {{but other than that}} it was exactly what any fan of the show would hope for." [...] Danny Gallagher of TVSquad stated that the episode's [...] "robotic take on the needless hysteria and blatant hypocricy [...] of gay marriage was not only steeped in satiric goodness, but it was downright hilarious." [...] He felt that the episode's writing was an improvement over the previous episodes in the season and that it [...] "really used the storied and rich history of the characters to its advantage." [...] In particular, Gallagher praised Takei's cameo as one of the episode's funniest, even stating it {{to be one of the}} series' best. [...] Alasdair Wilkins of io9 also praised the episode, calling it [...] "a triumph for the new Futurama, and just the sort of episode that leaves me convinced that the show's revival was completely worthwhile." [...] Michelle Castillo of Television on Today enjoyed the attack on California Proposition 8, stating that the episode [...] "poked fun at the issues in the unique way that only 'Futurama' can pull off." ...|$|E

[...] Enchanted with the picture which he appeared to have conjured up for himself, he laughed with the utmost relish, and then patting the green bag in his lap, which plainly contained a violin, [...] "You see," [...] he went on, [...] "I go out playing for dancing-parties. Work all day at my trade,--I'm a carpenter,--and play in the evening. Take my little old ten dollars a night. And I notice the women a good deal; and I tell you they're all excitable, and I sh'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> vote. Vote right and vote often,--that's the ticket, eh?" [...] This friend of womanhood suffrage--whose attitude of curiosity and expectation seemed to me representative of that of a great many thinkers on the subject--no doubt was otherwise a reformer, and held that the coming man would not drink wine--if he could find whiskey. At least I should have said so, guessing from the odors he breathed along with his liberal sentiments.|$|R
