5000|$|The {{original}} plant comprised two Ferranti 800 kW reciprocating steam alternators and a 1500 kW Ferranti/Yates and Thom machine. Because of {{the rapid}} advance {{in the design of}} steam turbines, no more reciprocating machines were installed, and by 1906 a Willans/Dick Kerr steam turbine had been installed to meet the growing load, the first of fifteen turbines to be installed during the life of the station.In 1927, ownership passed to the new West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority (WMJEA), and with the building of the National Grid in the early 1930s it became a [...] "selected station". In 1948 it became part of the newly created British Electricity Authority (later to become, by reorganisation the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and then the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). It closed in 1977, {{as a result of the}} mid-1970s recession, which also claimed many other serviceable stations. In 1951 the station achieved brief fame in the technical world by being the first to run a large alternator, whose turbine was disabled, as a so-called [...] "synchronous condenser", which enabled the generation of <b>lagging</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> to control voltage at a weak point in the system.|$|E
40|$|A {{synchronous}} condenser is a synchronous machine that generates reactive power that leads real power by 90 {degrees} in phase. The leading reactive power {{generated by the}} condenser offsets or cancels the normal <b>lagging</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> consumed by inductive and nonlinear loads at the accelerator complex. The quality of SLAC`s utility power is improved {{with the addition of}} the condenser. The inertia of the condenser`s 35, 000 pound rotor damps and smoothes voltage excursions on two 12 kilovolt master substation buses, improving voltage regulation site wide. The condenser absorbs high frequency transients and noise in effect ``scrubbing`` the electric system power at its primary distribution source. In addition, the condenser produces a substantial savings in power costs. Federal and investor owned utilities that supply electric power to SLAC levy a monthly penalty for <b>lagging</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> delivered to the site. For the 1993 fiscal year this totaled over $ 285, 000 in added costs for the year. By generating leading reactive power on site, thereby reducing total <b>lagging</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> requirements, a substantial savings in electric utility bills is achieved. Actual savings of $ 150, 000 or more a year are possible depending on experimental operations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{simulate}} the model of a self-excited asynchronous generator (SEASG) feeding R L load in conjunction with an AC/DC/AC converter fed RLC series circuit connected at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). Simulation model of the proposed system has been developed by using Matlab/Simulink. The result shows that the effect of RLC series circuit when operated at variable frequency affects the generation voltage profile. This reflects that an additional capacitance or inductance effect is possible to inject when the RLC is operated at a frequency lower or higher than the resonance frequency.

40|$|Abstract: Derived by the {{increasing}} distributed {{electric power generation}} in correlation to large energy grids, {{there is a need}} for active compensation and power-flow control. Equally important is a linking of midsized off-shore windfarms, on which a thyristor-based HVDC conversion and transmission would be inadequate, con-cerning money and space consumption. For the latter, IGBT-based valve technology is looking more promis-ing. In relation to FACTS, the same could be used for STATCOM functionality, emitting both leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power.</b> The use of that technology however, is posing non neg-ligible problems with transformer insulation at the HVDC converter. The pulses used by the IGBT switches include much higher frequencies than the wanted 50 / 60 Hz, due to their large slew-rate. Therefore, material properties, e. g. electric strength, of common transformer insulation will be analyzed at frequencies of several 10 kHz to some 100 kHz. Accord-ing to break down voltages of transformerboard around 100 kV, at 50 Hz and 1 mm gap, HF-test-voltages of those amplitudes need to be generated. For that reason a source has to be designed and built, including a capaci-tor for the samples. With increasing voltage and fre-quency, corona effects are generating unwanted partial-discharge phenomena and need to be taken into account at the design...|$|E
40|$|An {{improvement}} of unbalanced distribution system operation {{is carried out}} by reactive power compensation. The <b>lagging</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> demand is compensated by allocating a number of three-phase shunt capacitors. At the stage, the compensation devices are determined tentatively in term of number, size and location. The effects of the installed shunt capacitors are then analyzed. The unbalanced condition of distribution system is taken into account {{due to the fact}} that distribution system is inherently imbalance. For three-phase unbalanced power flow analyses, forward-backward propagation algorithm is proposed. The algorithm works directly on the system without any modification. Starting with determination of forward and backward propagation paths, the algorithm calculates branch currents using backward path. With the branch currents in hand, the bus voltages are calculated using the obtained branch currents and line impedances. Equivalent injection currents representing loads and shunt admittances method are required. The algorithm offers robust and good convergence characteristics for radial distribution system. In this paper, reactive power compensation is simulated using tentative approach and the achieved system improvements are observed. The improvements are presented as losses minimization and voltage profile enhancement.

30|$|There {{are three}} aspects of {{differentiating}} <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> from active power in power system operation, {{and they should}} be considered in reliability evaluation. First, it is not efficient to transfer <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> over a long distance because <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> losses in transmission lines are significant and the bus voltage is very sensitive to <b>reactive</b> <b>power.</b> Therefore, the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> shortage is usually compensated locally in weakly connected grids. Second, the major role of <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> is to maintain voltage stability/security of power systems. Therefore, the impact of <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> on system reliability in terms of energy not supplied is indirect and is calculated based on the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> shortage and voltage violations. Finally, the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> losses change with system configuration and operation conditions [23, 24]. <b>Reactive</b> <b>power</b> requirements for voltage restoration after a contingency are heavily dependent on <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> reserve distributions in a power system. In order to reasonably determine the real and <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> dispatch and post contingency load shedding, the characteristics of real and <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> corresponding to bus voltage and their correlation have to be considered.|$|R
