50|$|The pellet waggler {{is mainly}} used in fishing for carp during warmer months. It is a float fishing {{technique}} {{that relies on}} the use of heavy <b>loose</b> <b>feeding</b> of particles to bring the fish in to the area of the suspended bait. It was originally designed to be used with hard particle baits such as trout pellets rather than the softer boilie type baits which are fished using a hair rig. The best bait for this style of fishing is sinking pellets of between 4 mm and 10 mm, depending upon the distance that they need feeding using a hook attachment such as bait-fix.|$|R

30|$|In a water/{{sediment}} study, lugworms (A. marina) {{were exposed}} for 28  days to sediment containing unplasticised PVC (uPVC) granules (mean size: 130  µm; 5, 10 and 50  g uPVC/kg sediment ww). During the first 2  weeks of exposure, feeding rate of lugworms was significantly reduced at 50  g/kg sediment ww. However, {{during the third}} and fourth week of exposure, feeding rate in the controls decreased to levels close to those observed at 50  g/kg ww. No clear effect on <b>feeding</b> was <b>seen</b> at <b>5</b> and 10  g/kg ww. Phagocytic activity of coelomic fluid was significantly increased at 5 and 50, but not at 10  g/kg ww. At 10 and 50  g/kg ww, total available energy reserves were significantly lower than in the controls. Yet, weight of the uPVC exposed worms {{at the end of the}} experiment did not significantly differ from the control value. In a second experiment, A. marina was exposed for 51  h to 50  g uPVC/kg ww. The frequency of egestion events (evaluated during the last 3  h of exposure) was significantly reduced at 50  g/kg ww. In a further experiment, lugworms were exposed for 7  days to sediment with 10, 50 and 100  g silica/kg ww. Since exposure to silica did not significantly affect the number of faecal casts, the reduced organic content did not appear to be the cause for the reduced feeding activity. It was assumed that the reduced egestion frequency of the worms at 50  g uPVC/kg ww might be due to a lower feeding activity or a reduced uptake efficiency, possibly caused by reduced adhesion of uPVC particles (as compared to sediment) to the feeding apparatus of A. marina [177].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to compare the accuracy of a rule induction classifier system –Quinlan’s <b>SEE</b> <b>5</b> – with linear discriminant analysis and logit. The classification task chosen is the differentiation of the most efficient companies from the least efficient ones {{on the basis of a}} set of financial variables. The sample consists of a database containing the annual accounts of the companies located in the Principality of Asturias (Spain), which are mainly small businesses. The main results indicate that <b>SEE</b> <b>5</b> outperforms logit, but it is not clearly better than discriminant analysis. However, <b>SEE</b> <b>5</b> models suffer from bigger increases in error rates when tested with validation samples. Another interesting finding is that in <b>SEE</b> <b>5</b> systems both the number of variables selected and the number of rules inferred grow when sample size increases...|$|R

Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird <b>feeding</b> (<b>see</b> bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.|$|R

5000|$|Critics of the AAFCO {{standards}} {{argue that}} such requirements are too lax. Generational studies conducted by researchers at University of California, Davis have shown some foods that pass AAFCO's feeding trials are still not suitable for long-term use and estimated that of 100 foods that pass the nutritional analysis, 10 to 20 would not pass the feeding trials. Although maximum levels of intake of some nutrients have been established because of concerns with overnutrition, many still lack a maximum allowed level and some contains large disparity between maximum and minimum values. The NRC accepts that despite ongoing research, large gaps still exist in the knowledge of quantitative nutritional information for specific nutrients. Some professionals acknowledge the possibilities of phytochemicals and other vital nutrients {{that have yet to}} be recognized as essential by nutritional science.
