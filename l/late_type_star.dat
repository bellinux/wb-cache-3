40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} correlations between the properties of galaxies in the local Universe is the so-called morphology-density relation (Dressler 1980). A plethora of studies utilizing multi-wavelength tracers of activity have shown that <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>star</b> forming galaxies favour low density regions in the local Universe (e. g. G´omez et al. 2003). In particular, the cores of massive galaxy clusters are galaxy graveyards full of massive spheroids that are dominated by old stellar populations. A variety of physical processes might be effective in suppressing star formation and affecting the morphology of cluster and group galaxies. Broadly speaking, these can be grouped in two big families: (i) interactions with other cluster members and/or with the cluster gravitational potential and (ii) interactions with the hot gas that permeates massive galaxy systems. Galaxy groups are the most common galaxy environment in our Universe, bridging the gap between the low density field and the crowded galaxy clusters. Indeed, as many as 50...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} {{study of the}} X-Ray emission toward 22 Herbig AeBe stars using the Chandra archive. We probe {{the origin of the}} X-Rays toward Herbig stars: are they intrinsic? This question is addressed by correlations between the physical stellar properties and the X-Ray emission. There is a weak correlation between the continuum radio emission at lambda = 3. 6 cm and Lx, which suggests that the X-Ray emission depends upon the source. On the other hand, no correlation was found with the stellar rotational period, but that only excludes solar-like magnetic activity as the origin of the X-Rays. Most importantly, the X-Ray luminosity of Herbig AeBe stars have a different distribution than T Tauri stars, suggesting X-Ray emission from an unseen <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>star</b> companion can be ruled out with an 80 % confidence level.

40|$|The oxygen {{absorption}} line imprinted in the scattered {{light from the}} Earth-like planets has been considered the most promising metabolic biomarker of the exo-life. We examine the feasibility of the detection of the 1. 27 micron oxygen band from habitable exoplanets, in particular, around late- type stars observed with a future instrument on a 30 m class ground-based telescope. We analyzed the night airglow around 1. 27 micron with IRCS/echelle spectrometer on Subaru {{and found that the}} strong telluric emission from atmospheric oxygen molecules declines by an order of magnitude by midnight. By compiling nearby star catalogs combined with the sky background model, we estimate the detectability of the oxygen absorption band from an Earth twin, if it exists, around nearby stars. We find that the most dominant source of photon noise for the oxygen 1. 27 micron band detection comes from the night airglow if the contribution of the stellar PSF halo is suppressed enough to detect the planet.

He 2 - 428 and M 1 - 91 have high density (from 10 ^ 3. 3 to 10 ^ 6. 5 cm^- 3) unresolved nebular cores that indicate that strong mass loss/exchange phenomena are occurring close to their central stars. An F 0 star is found at the centre of symmetry of A 79; its reddening and distance {{are consistent with the}} association of the star with the nebula. The spectrum of the core of He 2 - 428 shows indications of the presence of a hot star with red excess emission, probably arising in a late-type companion. A 79 is one of the richest PNe in N and He, the abundances of M 1 - 91 are {{at the lower end of}} the range spanned by bipolar PNe, and He 2 - 428 shows very low abundances, similar to those measured for halo PNe.

40|$|During {{a search}} for the optical {{counterparts}} of IRAS sources whose flux peaks at 25 microns, a small faint bipolar nebula was discovered in Monoceros at the position of IRAS 07131 - 0147. The CCD images display the object's considerable structure. The central star seems relatively free of closeby nebulosity: the two lobes have a bow-tie structure with those parts nearest to the star consisting of series of small knots. The outer parts of the lobes seem to be made up of filaments streaming away from knots. On the basis of its optical spectrum, the central star was classified as a M 5 - 6 giant. In the IRAS color classification scheme of Van der Veen and Habing (1988), the central star is VIb which indicates that there are distinct hot and cold components of circumstellar dust and that the mass loss process may have temporarily abated. Therefore, it is proposed that the object is in the post main sequence stage of evolution and is a protoplanetary nebulae. Young protoplanetary nebulae have totally obscured central stars illuminating reflective lobes whereas older ones such as M 2 - 9 have lobes seen in emission from gas ionized by the central hot star which is clearly visible. Since the central object of IRAS 07131 - 0147 is a relatively unobscured <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>star</b> and the lobes are seen only by reflection, it is suggested that this nebula is a protoplanetary nebula in an evolutionary stage intermediate between that of CRL 2688 and M 2 - 9...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first L-band spectroscopic {{observations}} {{for a dozen}} stellar sources in the central 0. 5 pc of the GC stellar cluster that are bright in the 2 - 4 micron wavelength domain. With the aid of additional K-band spectroscopic data, we derive optical depth spectra of the sources after fitting their continuum emission with a single reddened blackbody continuum. We also derive intrinsic source spectra by correcting the line of sight extinction via the optical depth spectrum of a <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>star</b> that is most likely not affected by local dust emission or extinction at the Galactic Center. The good agreement between the two approaches shows that the overall variation of the line-of-sight extinction across the central 0. 5 pc is Δ A_K≤ 0. 5 mag. The extinction corrected spectra of the hot He-stars are in good agreement with pure Rayleigh Jeans continuum spectra. The intrinsic spectra of all other sources are in agreement with continuum emission and absorption features due to the dust {{in which they are}} embedded. We interprete both facts as evidence that a significant amount of the absorption takes place within the central parsec of the Galactic Center and is most likely associated with the individual sources there. We find absorption features at 3. 0 micron, 3. 4 micron, and 3. 48 micron wavelength. Correlations between all three features show that they are very likely to arise in the ISM of the central 0. 5 pc. Spectroscopy of high MIR-excess sources 0. 5 " north of the IRS 13 complex is largely consistent with them being YSOs. However, a bow-shock nature of these sources cannot be excluded.

For example, the mass loss of planets orbiting early and <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>stars</b> is different because of the differences of the EUV and X-ray radiation of the host stars. As an initial step, we carried out a program to identify suitable A-stars in the CoRoT fields using spectra taken with the AAOmega spectrograph. In total we identified 562 A-stars in IRa 01, LRa 01, and LRa 02. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, conference proceedings, in pres...|$|R
40|$|NASA's Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) {{will carry}} out an all-sky survey from 80 to 800 A in four bandpasses. It is {{expected}} that many types of sources will be detected, including white dwarfs and <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>stars.</b> A deep survey will also be carried out along the ecliptic which will have a limiting sensitivity a factor of 10 better than the all-sky survey in the bandpass from 80 to 300 A. The payload includes a spectrometer to observe the brigher sources found in the surveys with a spectral resolution of 1 to 2 A...|$|R
