In this paper, we describe and analyze a set of incremental compilation steps that can be directly applied to a range of parallel logic verification hardware, including logic emulators. Important aspects of this work include the formulation and analysis of two incremental design mapping steps: the partitioning of newly added design logic onto multiple <b>logic</b> <b>processors</b> and the communication scheduling of newly added design signals between <b>logic</b> <b>processors.</b> To validate our incremental compilation techniques, the developed mapping heuristics have been integrated into the compilation flow for a field-programmable gate-array-based Ikos VirtuaLogic emulator [1].

40|$|In {{conventional}} computers, wiring between transistors {{is required}} to enable the execution of Boolean logic functions. This has resulted in processors in which billions of transistors are physically interconnected, which limits integration densities, gives rise to huge power consumption and restricts processing speeds. A method to eliminate wiring amongst transistors by condensing Boolean logic into a single active element is thus highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate a novel logic architecture using only a single electromechanical parametric resonator into which multiple channels of binary information are encoded as mechanical oscillations at different frequencies. The parametric resonator can mix these channels, resulting in new mechanical oscillation states that enable the construction of AND, OR and XOR logic gates as well as multibit logic circuits.

Unfortunately, the large dissipative losses that take place when nanomagnets are switched with a magnetic field [3], or spin-transfer-torque [4] inhibit the promised energy-efficiency. Recently, there have been experimental reports of utilizing the Spin Hall effect for switching magnets [5 - 7], and theoretical proposals for strain induced switching of single-domain magnetostrictive nanomagnets [8 - 12], that might reduce the dissipative losses significantly. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that strain-induced switching of single-domain magnetostrictive nanomagnets of lateral dimensions ~ 200 nm fabricated on a piezoelectric substrate can implement a nanomagnetic Boolean NOT gate and unidirectional bit information propagation in dipole-coupled nanomagnets chains.
