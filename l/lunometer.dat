50|$|Luhn {{was born}} in Barmen, Germany (now part of Wuppertal) on July 1, 1896. After he {{completed}} secondary school, Luhn moved to Switzerland to learn the printing trade so he could join the family business. His career in printing was halted by his service as a communications officer in the German Army during World War I. After the war, Luhn entered the textile field, which eventually {{led him to the}} United States, where he invented a thread-counting gauge (the <b>Lunometer)</b> still on the market. From the late twenties to the early forties, during which time he obtained patents for a broad range of inventions, Luhn worked in textiles and as an independent engineering consultant. He joined IBM as a senior research engineer in 1941, and soon became manager of the information retrieval research division.|$|E
