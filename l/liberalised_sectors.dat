This paper attempts an econometric modelling of staff numbers in electricity regulatory institutions. We specify a model of the determinants of staff numbers that reflects electricity system complexity as well as national economic and regulatory environments. We empirically estimate a translog cost function specification of the model using data on 60 electricity regulators collected from an international questionnaire survey in 2000 - 01. We conclude that there are significant differences between the regulatory cost functions of developed and developing countries and that, in establishing independent regulatory agencies, developing countries face high fixed costs relative to market size.

40|$|Amongst the {{approaches}} {{that have developed}} to improve environmental protection within the energy sector, strategic environmental assessment (SEA) has received relatively little attention. This is despite its potential to overcome some of the shortcomings associated with project-level assessment by intervening at higher levels of energy system planning. In this article, a review is presented {{of the extent to}} which SEA has been adopted and otherwise promoted in strategic energy planning processes in a wide range of countries throughout the world (with an emphasis on European Union nations). In this regard, the growing importance of regulatory compliance is underlined, especially within the EU, with a particular focus upon the application of SEA to grid systems. The case of the Belgian transmission system is described, illustrating a proactive approach to SEA. But the difficulties inherent in introducing SEA to an increasingly fragmented and <b>liberalised</b> <b>sector</b> are also drawn out, leading to suggestions by which these difficulties may be addressed.

40|$|How {{important}} is trade openness {{as a vehicle}} for driving productivity in developing countries? We offer a sector-specific analysis with focus on the manufacturing sector for meaningful policy insights. Using a modern econometric techniqueâ€”the autoregressive distributed lag approach to cointegrationâ€”this article attempts to establish the relationship between openness to trade and manufacturing performance in Nigeria for the period 1970 â€“ 2008. The results suggest that trade openness has a significant positive impact on manufacturing productivity in Nigeria both in the short and long run. These coefficient estimates are robust and stable over the time. Therefore, the policy direction for the manufacturing sector in Nigeria should focus more on open policies through trade liberalisation as a long-term plan. Reduction in trade restrictions and implementation of appropriate incentives are vital for resuscitating the performance of the sector. In this aspect, policy-makers should leverage the benefits of openness to the comparative advantages in the <b>liberalised</b> <b>sector.</b> JEL Classification: F 41, C 22, O 55 Trade Openness; Manufacturing Growth; Cointegration; Autoregressive Distributed Lag; Nigeri...|$|R
50|$|Since 2001 the Iranian Government {{has moved}} toward <b>liberalising</b> the banking <b>sector,</b> {{although}} {{progress has been}} slow. In 1994 Bank Markazi (the central bank) authorised the creation of private credit institutions, and in 1998 authorised foreign banks (many of whom had already established representative offices in Tehran) to offer full banking services in Iran's free-trade zones. The central bank sought to follow this with the recapitalisation and partial privatisation of the existing commercial banks, seeking to <b>liberalise</b> the <b>sector</b> and encourage {{the development of a}} more competitive and efficient industry. State-owned banks are {{considered by many to be}} poorly functioning as financial intermediaries. Extensive regulations are in place, including controls on rates of return and subsidized credit for specific regions. The banking sector in Iran is viewed as a potential hedge against the removal of subsidies, as the plan is not expected to have any direct impact on banks.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a popular}} {{perception}} that recent trade liberalisation in South Africa has been bad for jobs. This paper examines this by investigating the relationship between tariffs, both levels and changes, and wages in the manufacturing sector. This is done through matching individual labour force data with industry level tariff data and estimating Mincerian earnings equations. The results suggest that an identical individual in a low tariff sector earns {{more than one in}} a high tariff sector. Furthermore, wages are higher in those sectors that have undergone greater liberalisation. These results are robust to controlling for sector characteristics as well as selectivity into manufacturing jobs. Contrary to popular perception, these results suggest that trade liberalisation is good for wages. Two possible explanations of this positive relationship are investigated. The first is that trade liberalisation has resulted in low wage job shedding in those <b>sectors</b> that have <b>liberalised.</b> There is some evidence that this is occurring. The second is that wages in <b>liberalising</b> <b>sectors</b> have risen relative to sectors where tariffs have remained the same – the evidence provided suggests that this may also be an explanation. ...|$|R
