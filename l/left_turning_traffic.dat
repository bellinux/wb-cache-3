40|$|This study {{developed}} decision assistance curves (DAC) for unconventional intersections, including median U-turns (MUT), {{continuous flow}} intersections (CFI), and jughandle intersections, {{based on their}} operational performance relative to a conventional intersection. An economic analysis was performed to compute the net present value (NPV) of benefits and the benefit to cost ratio (B/C) {{with the development of}} a spreadsheet tool. The DAC classified the region of optimal performance of isolated unconventional intersections. For 5 % <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions, MUT was warranted for all volume criteria. For 10 % and 15 % <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions, jughandle was warranted for the major street approach traffic volumes {{greater than or equal to}} 2200 vph, and greater than 1800 vph, respectively. However, the warranty decreased with the increase of minor streets for all of the conditions except at balanced and nearly balanced conditions under 10 % <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> <b>traffic.</b> For 10 % and 15 % <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions with an unbalanced flow, CFI was warranted for major street approach traffic volumes greater than or equal to 2200 vph, and greater than 1800 vph, respectively. The warranty expanded with the increase of minor street approach traffic volumes. The standard signalized intersection with <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> permitted was warranted for minor street approach traffic volumes less than 200 vph and the major street approach traffic volumes of 700 vph to 1350 vph. The high presence of trucks favored the use of CFI. Additionally, a case study performed on a 24 -hour rural pattern volume indicated the highest NPV of benefits and the highest B/C related to new MUT construction. Though the MUT-retrofit had the highest NPV, since the construction cost of MUT-retrofit was high, a jughandle-retrofit was found to have the highest B/C. In this manner, the developed method provided an integrated decision support system utilizing both operational performance and economic aspects as an improved method over the current practice.

The study carried out to develop a model for pedestrian level of service of signalized intersections in Vijayawada city and Bhubaneswar city based on pedestrian’s perception on safety and comfort.

The various factors required to develop the model extracted from video graphic data. Pearson correlation analysis was done to identify the various significant factors influencing pedestrian level of service.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The designing of bicycle lanes can be a complicated issue. Some bicycle lane treatments are meant to encourage cyclists to merge with traffic before the intersection, while some treatments channelize cyclists to merge with traffic in a predetermined location. Two intersections (Bizzell/George Bush Drive and Throckmorton/George Bush Drive) at the Texas A&M University were chosen to observe cyclist behavior. Both intersection approaches contained an island separating right turning traffic from straight and <b>left</b> <b>turning</b> <b>traffic.</b> However, the right turn lane at Bizzell begins at the island, while at Throckmorton the right turn lane is present throughout the approach to the intersection. Video cameras were used to record cyclists as they approached and traveled into the intersections. The distance from the intersection where a cyclist merged with motor vehicle traffic, the cyclist maneuvers as they entered the intersection, and the cyclist traffic control compliance was recorded. The motor vehicle volumes were also recorded to determine if they influenced cyclists' decisions to merge with traffic. Using the Chi Square test of independence, the collected behaviors were evaluated to determine if the behaviors were dependent upon the intersection location. Linear regression was used to determine the influence of motor vehicle volumes on cyclists and the test of proportions was used to decide if the proportions of behaviors were equal at both intersections. It was found that the intersection approach geometry, striping and lane configuration does influence cyclists to merge with traffic at different locations and motor vehicle volumes did not influence cyclists' decisions to merge with traffic. The proportions of inappropriate behaviors were different between the locations, while the traffic compliance rates were the same...|$|E
40|$|Left-turning {{traffic is}} {{a major source of}} {{conflicts}} at intersections. Though an average of only 10 % to 15 % of all approach traffic turns left, these vehicles are involved in approximately 45 % of all accidents. This report presents the results of research conducted to develop models which estimate approach accident rates at high speed signalized intersections. The objective of the research was to quantify the relationship between traffic and intersection characteristics, and accident potential of different left turn treatments. Geometric, turning movement counts, and traffic signal phasing data were collected at 100 intersections in Iowa using a questionnaire sent to municipalities. Not all questionnaires resulted in complete data and ultimately complete data were derived for 63 intersections providing a database of 248 approaches. Accident data for the same approaches were obtained from the Iowa Department of Transportation Accident Location and Analysis System (ALAS). Regression models were developed for two different dependent variables: 1) the ratio of the number of left turn accidents per approach to million left turning vehicles per approach, and 2) the ratio of accidents per approach to million traffic movements per approach. A number of regression models were developed for both dependent variables. One model using each dependent variable was developed for intersections with low, medium, and high <b>left</b> <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> volumes. As expected, the research indicates that protected left turn phasing has a lower accident potential than protected/permitted or permitted phasing. Left turn lanes and multiple lane approaches are beneficial for reducing accident rates, while raised medians increase the likelihood of accidents. Signals that are part of a signal system tend to have lower accident rates than isolated signals. The resulting regression models may be used to determine the likely impact of various left turn treatments on intersection accident rates. When designing an intersection approach, a traffic engineer may use the models to estimate the accident rate reduction as a result of improved lane configurations and left turn treatments. The safety benefits may then be compared to any costs associated with operational effects to the intersection (i. e., increased delay) to determine the benefits and costs of making intersection safety improvements...|$|E

More specifically, the research objectives include the following parts: To identify the factors affecting the operational performance of U-turning vehicles. In this case, we are particularly interested in the U-turn speeds of U-turning vehicles; To evaluate the impacts of U-turns on capacity of signalized intersections, and; To simulate U-turn movement at signalized intersections using Synchro and validate the simulation results. To achieve the research objectives, extensive field data collection work was conducted at sixteen selected sites at Tampa Bay area of Florida. The data collected in the field include: U-turning speed; <b>Left</b> <b>turning</b> speed; Turning radius Queue discharge time; Control delay; Hourly traffic volume, and; Percentage of U- <b>turning</b> vehicles in <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> lane. Based on the collected field data, a linear regression model was developed to identify the factors affecting the turning speeds of U-turning vehicles at signalized intersections. The model shows the turning speed is significantly impacted by the turning radius and the speed of U-turning vehicles increases with the increase of turning radius. On the basis of field data field data collection, a regression model was developed to estimate the relationship between the average queue discharge time for each turning vehicle and the various percentages of U-turning vehicles in the <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> stream. Adjustment factors for various percentages of U-turning vehicles were also developed by using the regression model. The adjustment factors developed in this study can be directly used to estimate the capacity reduction due to the presence of various percentages of U-turning vehicles at a signalized intersection.
