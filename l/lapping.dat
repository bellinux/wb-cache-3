Going into the first corner, Häkkinen accelerated faster than Michael Schumacher and Coulthard off the line and overtook both drivers for the lead. He managed to maintain his lead until his first pit stop on lap 31. As his teammate Coulthard made his pit stop one lap later, Häkkinen regained the lead which he held to win his third win of the season.

5|$|Audi's No. 8 car made a {{pit stop}} for tyres, fuel and a {{replacement}} rear spoiler. The safety car {{went into the}} pit lane after 24 minutes and racing resumed with Jarvis leading the field back up to speed. Lamy passed François Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari at Rivage corner {{to take over the}} LMGTE Am lead. Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR Sport car after moving in front of the vehicle upon <b>lapping</b> it at La Source resulting in heavy damage to the No. 7 Audi car's front-end, littering debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler braked early for the corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, littering the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while <b>lapping</b> Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for <b>lapping</b> and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is one of}} twelve cranial nerves found in amniotes including reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the nerve or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or <b>lapping</b> water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, {{and then to the}} affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the nerve have been explored through studies of the nerve in rodents and reptiles. The nerve is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution.|$|E

5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and <b>lapping</b> {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during <b>lapping,</b> nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for <b>lapping</b> and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E

5|$|In third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, Hamilton narrowly beat Rosberg to the fastest time, <b>lapping</b> just 0.068 seconds faster than his teammate. All drivers used the super-soft tyre compound {{to set their}} fastest lap times, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen third and fourth ahead of the Williams pair of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Vettel {{had spent most of}} the session testing his car with a heavier fuel load in preparation for the race that would see him start with a five-place grid penalty for a change of the gearbox. He completed the highest number of laps with 28, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo, who was 11th fastest. At the back end, the Sauber drivers of Ericsson and Nasr were slowest, behind both Manor cars.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton was fastest {{in the first}} free practice session, run in clear and sunny conditions, <b>lapping</b> {{in a time of}} 1m43.754s, over one-tenth of a second faster than teammate Rosberg in second. Rosberg had set new fastest sector times on his last fast run, but a mistake in {{the last part of the}} track lost him a chance at the best time. Kimi Räikkönen was third fastest for Ferrari, ahead of Daniil Kvyat. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Ricciardo changed back to his older specification Renault power unit, after being unsatisfied with the performance of his updated unit at the previous race in Brazil. He finished the session seventh fastest. At Lotus, Jolyon Palmer replaced Romain Grosjean, but had to sit out most of the session due to a water leak, managing just nine laps.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} dipterans known {{are from the}} Middle Triassic (around 240 million years ago), and they became {{widespread}} during the Middle and Late Triassic. Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 million years ago), so the original dipterans {{must have had a}} different source of nutrition other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, {{it has been suggested that}} they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and <b>lapping</b> up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the Triassic, about 220 million years ago. Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 million years ago. A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|While under caution - on <b>lap</b> 119 - Gordon {{achieved}} his 24,000th career <b>lap</b> led, and led {{the field}} to the restart on <b>lap</b> 127. Gordon made his final stop and handed the lead to Harvick on <b>lap</b> 133, before Greg Biffle took the lead two <b>laps</b> later. On <b>lap</b> 138, the seventh caution came out when Allmendinger, <b>laps</b> down with damage from the <b>lap</b> 117 crash, hit the wall in turn 1. The race restarted with 17 <b>laps</b> to go.|$|R
5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car, {{and when the}} car {{returned}} to the pit lane Häkkinen built a comfortable lead over Jarno Trulli. As the track dried and his rivals made pit stops, Häkkinen maintained his lead until a lap-13 spin gave Michael Schumacher the lead {{for most of the}} remainder of the race. By the 34th lap Schumacher's tyres began to degrade; he drove off the racing line to cool them, which allowed Häkkinen to close the gap. On lap 41 Häkkinen overtook Michael Schumacher for the lead, <b>lapping</b> BAR driver Ricardo Zonta and maintaining the lead to win. Although Rubens Barrichello set the fastest lap time in the other Ferrari, he was hampered by a poor qualifying performance and retired with a fuel-pressure problem thirteen laps from the finish.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their <b>lapping</b> mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was <b>lapping</b> Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E

5000|$|On <b>lap</b> 139, {{the third}} caution {{flag of the}} race was waved for debris. Earnhardt, Jr. got back on the lead <b>lap</b> and Kyle Busch {{returned}} to the lead <b>lap</b> with a free pass. At the restart on <b>lap</b> 143, Casey Mears was leading again. <b>Laps</b> later, Biffle passed him. On <b>lap</b> 151, McMurray received the lead. A <b>lap</b> later, Biffle repassed him. On <b>lap</b> 155, Kevin Harvick gave McMurray a shove to reclaim the lead for two <b>laps.</b> On <b>lap</b> 168, Harvick became the leader. He led for three <b>laps</b> before Mears assumed the lead. On <b>lap</b> 173, the lead returned to McMurray. On <b>lap</b> 182, Kenseth claimed the lead, and the fourth caution came out as McMurray spun out in the tri-oval off of Harvick's bumper. Under the caution, 11 drivers did not pit, so Clint Bowyer led the field at the restart on <b>lap</b> 187.|$|R
5|$|As {{they had}} been {{compromised}} by the first lap pileup and were {{at the back of}} the field, Dillmann and Coletti chose to make their mandatory pit stops when the window opened at the end of the seventh lap for rear soft compound tyres. Haryanto and Abt made their stops on the next lap and Calado and Lancaster did the same on lap nine. Coletti's early pit stop resulted in him <b>lapping</b> faster than any other driver by two seconds. Other drivers became aware of the significance and Nasr went into the pit lane to keep his position from Calado and Ceccon and Richelmi did the same on the eleventh lap. This placed pressure on race leader Evans who was at this point three seconds a lap slower than Ceccon. Evans made his own pit stop on lap 12 for four soft compound tyres but did not retain first place as Ceccon made up enough time to move in front of him. Evans could not keep close to Ceccon and was three seconds behind the driver after one lap and his diminishing pace hurt the delayed Bird who became the leader when Evans made his pit stop. On lap 15, De Jong made a problematic pit stop: his rear jack failed which delayed him and then crossed the yellow line at the pit lane exit twice, earning him a drive-through penalty.|$|E
5|$|Buemi elected not {{to change}} tyres and gained the overall lead. Conway later served a drive-through penalty for his {{collision}} with Shaytar. The repairs to Van der Garde's vehicle meant he was stationary in his pit stall for four minutes which allowed Merhi to inherit fifth position in LMP2. Tréluyer reported to Audi that his car had no front downforce, while Buemi went off the track at Raidillon {{in his effort to}} push hard to extend his lead over Bernhard. Buemi was held up by one of the SMP entrants and an Aston Martin at Fagnes causing his advantage to be reduced to 1.015 seconds. The Toyota driver missed his braking point at the Bus Stop chicane and went wide at La Source shortly afterwards, causing him to lose the first position to Bernhard. Buemi reclaimed the position at Eau Rouge but temporarily fell to second again after Bernhard overtook him on the Kemmel straight and retook the place before the entry to Les Combes. At Blanchimont corner, Bernhard avoided colliding heavily with the rear-end of Buemi's car after the latter slid while <b>lapping</b> Gulf Racing's Porsche entry.|$|E
5|$|Buemi {{moved back}} ahead of Conway {{in the battle}} for fifth, while Lotterer was impeded by an LMP2 and LMGTE car at Becketts corner and Webber was delayed by the two {{vehicles}} at Stowe corner. Jarvis came across the two slower cars at Copse corner and narrowly held off an overtaking manoeuvre from Dumas. The Audi moved across the track at Becketts corner upon coming across more slower traffic. Webber caught Lotterer and after closing up to him through Club corner. While <b>lapping</b> Rossiter, Webber moved {{to the front of the}} race heading into Abbey corner. Webber began to pull away from Lotterer. Jarvis was delayed by Rossiter, allowing Dumas to attack but went into grass on the Wellington straight. After making contact Bruno Senna overtook Rusinov driving into Maggots corner for second place in LMP2. The first round of pit stops began after 37 minutes with Derani making a pit stop, promoting Senna into the LMP2 lead. Jarvis was the first of the overall leaders to make a pit stop for fuel and tyres and was followed by teammate Lotterer one minute later. Dumas and both Toyota cars made stops with Jani taking over from Dumas and Kamui Kobayashi switched positions with Conway. Webber stopped one lap later and Hartley climbed aboard the No. 1 Porsche.|$|E
5|$|Da Matta {{reclaimed}} {{the first}} position on <b>lap</b> 103 before losing it to Papis {{on the next}} <b>lap.</b> After coming from a <b>lap</b> behind {{the rest of the}} field, Carpentier moved into the lead on <b>lap</b> 105, although Papis retook it on the following <b>lap.</b> Da Matta and Mears both held the position over the next two <b>laps</b> before Papis reclaimed it on <b>lap</b> 109. Andretti passed Papis to move into the first position on <b>lap</b> 110, before the Italian reclaimed it on the next <b>lap.</b> Da Matta, Andretti, Papis and Fernández all held the position over the following four <b>laps.</b> Green-flag pit stops began on <b>lap</b> 116.
