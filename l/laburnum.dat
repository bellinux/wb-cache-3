60|$|Business {{was pretty}} slack, and so Merton rather rejoiced over the {{application}} of a Mrs. Nicholson, from The <b>Laburnums,</b> Walton-on-Dove, Derbyshire. Mrs. Nicholson's name was not in Burke's 'Landed Gentry,' and The <b>Laburnums</b> could hardly be estimated as one of the stately homes of England. Still, the lady was granted an interview. She was what the Scots call 'a buddy;' that is, she was large, round, attired in black, between two ages, and not easily to be distinguished, by an unobservant eye, from buddies as a class. After greetings, and when enthroned in the client's chair, Mrs. Nicholson stated her case with simplicity and directness.|$|R

The broadleafs include <b>laburnum,</b> wych elm, three types of oak, four kinds of cherry tree, alder, sycamore, sweet chestnut, walnut and various other fruit trees.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Malaysian Navy {{can trace}} its roots to the {{formation}} of the Straits Settlement Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (SSRNVR) in Singapore on 27 April 1934 by the British colonial government in Singapore. The SSRNVR was formed to assist the Royal Navy in the defence of Singapore, upon which the defence of the Malay Peninsula was based. Also behind its formation were political developments in Asia, particularly the rise of a Japan that was increasingly assertive in Asia. In 1938, the SSRNVR was expanded with a branch in Penang. On 18 January 1935, the British Admiralty presented Singapore with an , , to serve as the Reserve's Headquarters and drill ship. It was berthed at the Telok Ayer Basin. HMS <b>Laburnum</b> was sunk in February 1942, prior to the capitulation of Singapore at the beginning of Second World War activities in the Pacific.|$|E

[...] A pergola covered with <b>laburnum</b> and wisteria was introduced in 1986 leading to the entrance into the walled garden. Between 1986 and 1988, two iron gates and a sundial were added.

500|$|The cotton mills {{grew out}} of a cottage {{spinning}} and weaving industry that was widespread across the district. As industrialisation gathered pace, local weavers felt threatened by the advent of powered looms, and in April 1812 a mob smashed the machines and burnt down a new factory, Westhoughton Mill, in neighbouring Westhoughton. For this, the Luddites, three men and a boy of 14, were tried at Lancaster Assizes and hanged. Fustian was woven and after 1827 silk also was brought from Manchester. In 1938 James Burton had built cotton mills {{on both sides of the}} Hindsford Brook including Lodge Mill. Dan Lane Spinning and Doubling Mills were built in the 1840s and lasted until the 1950s. Howe Bridge Spinning Mills, the largest complex in Atherton was started in 1868 and the last mill built in 1919. It closed as a textile factory in early 1999. [...] Mills built in the 20th century were <b>Laburnum</b> Mills in 1905 (closed 1980), and Ena Mill in 1908 which closed in 1999.

The young <b>Laburnums</b> (as they seem), with purple flowers, are Pigeon-peas, {313b} right good to eat.
