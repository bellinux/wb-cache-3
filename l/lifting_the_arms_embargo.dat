This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War.

It seeks to offer a more nuanced explanation of the developments in the EU’s arms embargo policy towards China than has been put forward in the existing literature to date, which makes assumptions about the motivations of certain actors. To do so, it examines how the perceptions of key policymakers in the EU and two of its Member States – France and the United Kingdom (UK) – influenced their positions in the debate. The article argues that an account focusing on the variation in perceptions between actors and consequently divergent policy preferences through close process-tracing of the development of the policy facilitates a more nuanced explanation of the proceedings of the debate...|$|E

50|$|McCloskey {{brokered}} a broad {{coalition of}} Democrats and Republicans who {{had listened to}} his daily calls {{from the floor of}} the U.S. House of representatives to stop the genocide.

Despite tough opposition, the McCloskey-Gilman amendment passed the House of Representatives 244-178 on June 9, 1994. In the U.S. Senate, a similar bill was sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman. It was defeated by a 50-50 vote on July 1, 1994 (Senate Amendment 1851 to S. 2182, 104th Congress). In 1995, after McCloskey was out of Congress, both houses of the 105th Congress passed a bill to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> on Bosnia by veto-proof, two-thirds majorities.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, a number of nations have argued that <b>the</b> {{mandatory}} <b>arms</b> <b>embargoes</b> imposed against them violated their right to self-defense.

50|$|Much of {{the focus}} of Clinton's foreign policy during his first term was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a nation in southeastern Europe that had {{declared}} its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. This declaration was the catalyst of a war between Bosnian Serbs, who wanted Bosnia {{to remain in the}} Yugoslav federation, and Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The Bosnian Serbs, who were supported by Serbia, were better equipped than the Muslims and the Croats; as a result, they populated and controlled much of the countryside in ways including besieging cities, such as the capital of Sarajevo. This caused widespread suffering, and in response Clinton proposed bombing Serb supply lines and lifting an embargo preventing the shipment of military <b>arms</b> to <b>the</b> former Yugoslavia (a policy known as lift and strike). European nations, however, were opposed to these moves. In 1994, Clinton opposed an effort by the Republicans in Congress to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>embargo,</b> as it were, because American allies in Western Europe were still resistant to that policy.|$|R
25|$|In addition, the European Parliament has {{consistently}} opposed <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> to <b>the</b> PRC.

Among the sources that were sought included the former Soviet bloc that it had a strained relationship with {{as a result of the}} Sino-Soviet split. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the Security Council has not met its {{responsibility}} to restore {{international peace and security}} in Bosnia, and that it therefore must rescind Resolution 713 as it pertains to Bosnia.

40|$|Arms {{transfers}} {{are both}} an economic necessity for <b>the</b> European <b>arms</b> industry {{and a potential}} obstacle for the emerging normative power role of the European Union (EU) in world affairs.

Despite these glaring contradictions, however, research on how well <b>the</b> EU’s <b>arms</b> transfer behavior mirrors its normative power rhetoric has been largely absent.

5000|$|In a major {{statement}} on Bosnia in June 1994 Perry attempted to clarify U.S. policy there, {{declaring that the}} conflict did involve U.S. national interests, humanitarian and otherwise, but not [...] "supreme" [...] interests. To limit the spread of violence in Bosnia, the United States had committed air power under NATO to stop bombardment of Bosnian cities, provide air support for UN troops, and carry out humanitarian missions. Perry and the White House resisted congressional pressures to lift an <b>arms</b> <b>embargo</b> imposed earlier by the United Nations on all sides in the Bosnian conflict. During 1994-95 some senators, including Republican leader Robert Dole, wanted the embargo against <b>the</b> Bosnian Muslims <b>lifted</b> {{to enable them to}} resist the Serbs more effectively. Perry thought this might provoke Serb attacks and perhaps force the commitment of U.S. ground troops. In August 1995 Clinton vetoed legislation to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>embargo.</b> (In fact, <b>the</b> Bosnian Muslims had been receiving arms from outside sources.) Meanwhile, although it had stated consistently that it would not send U.S. ground forces to Bosnia, in December 1994 the Clinton administration expressed willingness to commit troops to help rescue UN peacekeepers in Bosnia if they were withdrawn. In May 1995, after the Bosnian Serbs had taken about 3,000 peacekeepers hostage, the United States, France, Germany, and Russia resolved to provide a larger and better-equipped UN force.|$|R
