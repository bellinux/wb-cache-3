40|$|The big {{advantage}} of LED is the flexible spectral design to make white light using different color mixing schemes. Recently, the color mixing of RGB LEDs is mostly done by sealing all three chips at single package and regulated the mix ratio {{of these three}} colors to produce the color of light. And, by changing the LEDs array alignment, RGB chips can achieve overlapping colors of light and create the fun of changing colors in <b>light</b> <b>mixing.</b> Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study is to propose an innovative technique of <b>light</b> <b>mixing.</b> By applying the mechanism design, a RGB <b>light</b> <b>mixing</b> mechanism is produced. Each of the RGB LEDs lamp-type is installed on the couple link of the three mechanisms, respectively. By driving a crank makes the couple link and an output link to produce the relative motion, this will result in the fact that the RGB lamps can project lights on the same plane in order to obtain the color mixing. Unlike mixing technique by control system, this design generates <b>light</b> <b>mixing</b> and changes of color with the synchronized driving of three mechanisms, thus achieving the dazzling perception of single-color lights or mixing of multiple colors for creating ambience of a space...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A novel {{method to}} {{fabricate}} a composite material made by compressing Zinc Oxide (ZnO) crystals and cellulose fibers is reported. The fabricated material shows electrical photoconductivity changes {{when exposed to}} ultraviolet (UV) <b>light.</b> <b>Mixing</b> cellulose fibers with ZnO yields a higher photosensitivity than the one obtained from devices mainly made of ZnO. The structural, electrical, and photosensitivity tests are performed for these mixtures with the goal to determine the mecha-nisms enhancing their sensitivity as well as finding an optimal ZnO–cellulose composition for the fabrication of sensors. A device made from a mixed 50 – 50 wt % composition of ZnO and cellulose yields the best sensitivity to UV, suggesting that the enhancement could be because of the higher oxygen permeability of the cellulose matrix facilitating the O 2 adsorption–desorption processes on the ZnO surface.

40|$|The tidal-fresh James River {{experiences}} recurring blooms of toxin-producing cyanobacteria, including Microcystis aeruginosa.

A mesocosm experiment was designed to test the effects of <b>light,</b> <b>mixing</b> and grazing on cyanobacteria abundance, with nutrients held constant. We predicted that toxic cyanobacteria would be most abundant under stagnant conditions, with enhanced light, with no bivalve grazers present. Abundances of indicator gene copies and phytoplankton counts supported this hypothesis. However, chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, and the toxin microcystin were all found to be most abundant under mixed conditions with ambient light. Statistically, light and mixing were important in controlling toxic cyanobacteria abundance, with little to no effect observed for bivalve grazers. Our findings suggest that toxin production may be regulated by factors independent from those driving algal growth and cyanobacteria abundance...|$|E

40|$|In display technology, pixels are {{composed}} of three primary colors: red, green, and blue (RGB). Using the primary colors provides the ability to generate variety of hues including achromatic point (AP) (white light). This concept is applied in Light emitting diode (LED) displays where each pixel consists of RGB LEDs. Although using compact RGB light in LED displays provides a wide color gamut, many issues arise due to dissimilarities in optical and physical characteristics of LEDs such as: uniform spatial <b>light</b> <b>mixing</b> and distribution of AP, and AP maintenance and thermal management. Power consumption is also a major concern in LED displays. In this paper, the issues with current RGB pixel architecture such as non-uniform mixing and distribution of AP, energy efficiency and a solution to these issues by introducing a new pixel configuration consisting of red, green, blue and white (RGBW) are discussed.

40|$|Photosynthetic {{microorganisms}} {{are important}} bioresources for producing desirable and environmentally benign products, and photobioreactors (PBRs) play {{important roles in}} these processes. Designing PBRs for photocatalysis is still challenging at present, and most reactors are designed and scaled up using semiempirical approaches. No appropriate types of PBRs are available for mass cultivation due to the reactors 2 ̆ 7 high capital and operating costs and short lifespan, which are mainly due to a current lack of deep understanding of the coupling of light, hydrodynamics, mass transfer, and cell growth in efficient reactor design. This review provides a critical overview of the key parameters that influence {{the performance of the}} PBRs, including <b>light,</b> <b>mixing,</b> mass transfer, temperature, pH, and capital and operating costs. The lifespan and the costs of cleaning and temperature control are also emphasized for commercial exploitation. Four types of PBRs-tubular, plastic bag, column airlift, and flat-panel airlift reactors are recommended for large-scale operations. In addition, this paper elaborates the modeling of PBRs using the tools of computational fluid dynamics for rational design. It also analyzes the difficulties in the numerical simulation, and presents the prospect for mechanism-based models. (C) 2017 THE AUTHORS.

40|$|General {{education}} courses are {{a critical part}} of improving a non-science major’s understanding of science in general and of physics in particular. To keep pace with changing modes of instruction, on-line classes are also becoming a standard method of instruction. We offer several on-line courses: such as Physics for Computer Graphics and Animation and Light and Color. The courses are designed to teach students about basic concepts of light, color and optics. For Physics for Computer Graphics and Animation, software is used to demonstrate additive and subtractive <b>light</b> <b>mixing</b> as well as the function of lenses and mirrors. The software can provide students with the ability to control surface coloration, reflectivity and shape features that cannot be readily changed in laboratory. Both Physics for Computer Graphics and Animation and Light and Color include a significant amount of investigation into light, color and optics when taught “face to face. ” However, {{in the context of an}} on-line class, the question is how we might provide a meaningful and equivalent (or better) experience for on-line students? Our solution has been to develop kits the students rent or purchase that allow them to become “at home” investigators. The activities are designed so that the students must be engaged with the material and build upon their observations and conclusions. In the course, the students must participate in collaborative group discussions about their results. We present details of these courses, show student projects and discuss assessment of student understanding of light, color and optics after performing at home investigations...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} and decay of supersymmetric particles {{is presented in}} this thesis. The search for <b>light</b> <b>mixing</b> top squarks and neutralinos/charginos {{will be a major}} task at the upgraded Tevatron and the LHC as well as at a future e + e − linear collider. The dependence of the hadro-production cross section for weakly and strongly interacting particles on the renormalization and factorization scales is found to be weak in next-to-leading order supersymmetric QCD. This yields an improvement of derived mass bounds or the measurement of the masses, respectively, of neutralinos/charginos and stops at the Tevatron and at the LHC. Moreover, the next-to-leading order corrections increase the predicted neutralino/chargino cross section by + 20 % to + 40 %, nearly independent of the mass of the particles. The consistent treatment as well as the phenomenological implications of scalar top mixing are presented. The corrections to strong and weak coupling induced decays of stops, gluinos, and heavy neutralinos [including mixing stop particles] are strongly dependent on the parameters chosen. The decay widths are defined in a renormalization scheme for the mixing angle, which maintains the symmetry between the two stop states to all orders. The correction to the stop production cross sections, depending on the fraction of incoming quarks and gluons, varies between – 10 % to + 40 % for an increasing fraction of incoming gluons. The dependence of the cross section on all parameters, except for the masses of the produced particles, is in contrast to the light-flavor squark case negligible. The calculation of the stop production cross section was applicable to the Tevatron search for particles which could be responsible for the HERA anomaly...|$|E
40|$|This study {{enhances the}} {{capability}} to reproduce multi-coloured images in woven Jacquard forms where weave structure and pattern design were considerably involved in fabrication. In modern weaving, great convenience and efficiencies were established in both production and design process through digitalisation, while the colour adoption has been constrained as the applicable number of figuring yarns were limited. The enhancement toward colour realisation is traditionally related to weaving capability. Surface colour display is dominated by additive, subtractive or optical mixing (Mathur, 2007). An additive colour system offers the largest gamut among output models yet, the <b>light</b> <b>mixing</b> principle is not suitable to apply to weave colour creation. Pre-dyed opaque yarns are used and juxtaposed; small particles of yarn colours reflect lights and they were observed as a certain form of colour. The common and crucial criterial pertinent to an optical mixing of weave colours were aligned more with the subtractive mixing principle. A weave pattern was designed by subtractive primary colour classification and a multi-weft figuring method. Secondary colours are theoretically produced when coupled CMY layers are mixed(i. e., cyan + magenta = blue, cyan + yellow = green, magenta + yellow = red) and black is generated when all CMY primaries are mixed (Berns, 2000);however, non-bendable colours of threads are employed for colour reproduction in weaving {{and there is a}} limit to adopt a pigment mixing principle in the woven form. Therefore, each weave pattern required a modification to redefine primary colour regions and densities once an original artwork was separated and presented in greyscales levels. The weave patterns in an original subtractive scheme were altered by applying region-based segmentation to maximise the accessible colour gamut. In this study, the weaving application developed for the multi-coloured image was introduced and the design process was explained based on a practical experiment proceeded with a newly developed weaving application...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of high brightness and high efficiency light emitting diodes (LEDs), solid state lighting is ready {{to take over the}} lighting and display market. While the original concept of white LEDs (wLEDs) is based on a blue-emitting chip on which a light-converting phosphor is coated, a new approach has gained interest in the last decade [1]. In this so-called remote approach, a phosphor plate is placed at a certain distance from the LED chip. This lowers the phosphor temperature since the conductive heating by the LED chip is eliminated. Moreover the lowered excitation flux on the phosphor results in less self-heating during the downshifting of the blue light by the phosphor. Due the reduced reabsorption of light by the LED chip, the inherent scattering properties of the phosphor particles and the freedom to optimize the <b>light</b> <b>mixing</b> chamber, the remote approach yields improved light out-coupling and a more uniform light distribution. Despite the benefits described above, research on the stability and durability of remote phosphors is still scarce and inconsistent, while of most importance from a commercial point of view. Standard accelerated aging methods are available for lumen depreciation in on-chip LED lifetime prediction [2], but no established standard methods exist for the remote- approach. This work investigates the influence of three acceleration factors for aging: (1) heat, (2) humidity and (3) irradiance, ultimately providing a way to investigate the aging of phosphors in a remote configuration. Phosphor plates are mounted on teflon mixing chambers with a blue pumping LED at the bottom and placed in a climate chamber. Integrating sphere measurements, XRD and SEM(-EDX) studies are performed at predefined aging-times to retrieve the influence of each acceleration factor on the phosphor stability with respect to photoluminescence (PL), particle crystallinity and morphology respectively. As a proof of concept, commercial phosphors are tested first, providing optimized accelerated aging conditions. The approach is then transferred to investigate in-house prepared phosphors. Summarizing we present a technique which allows us to study the degradation of phosphors in the remote wLED configuration...|$|E
