25|$|Heat production: The {{ever-increasing}} {{density of}} MOSFETs on an integrated circuit creates problems of substantial <b>localized</b> <b>heat</b> generation that can impair circuit operation. Circuits operate more slowly at high temperatures, and have reduced reliability and shorter lifetimes. Heat sinks and other cooling devices and methods are now required for many integrated circuits including microprocessors. Power MOSFETs {{are at risk}} of thermal runaway. As their on-state resistance rises with temperature, if the load is approximately a constant-current load then the power loss rises correspondingly, generating further heat. When the heatsink is not able to keep the temperature low enough, the junction temperature may rise quickly and uncontrollably, resulting in destruction of the device.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Canadian {{geophysicist}} J.

The theory claimed that small, long-lasting, exceptionally [...] "hot" [...] areas of magma are located under certain points on Earth. These places, dubbed [...] "hotspots", provide <b>localized</b> <b>heat</b> and energy systems (thermal plumes) that sustain long-lasting volcanic activity on the surface.

System parameters examined include the ampoule, melt and crystal thermal conductivities, the magnitude and width of <b>localized</b> <b>heating,</b> and the latent heat of crystallization. Concave interface shapes, typical of semiconductor systems, could be flattened or made convex with <b>localized</b> <b>heating.</b> Although <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> caused shallower thermal gradients ahead of the interface, {{the magnitude of the}} <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> required for convexity was less than that which resulted in a thermal inversion ahead of the interface. A convex interface shape was most readily achieved with ampoules of lower thermal conductivity. Increasing melt convection tended to flatten the interface, but the amount of radial heating required to achieve a convex interface was essentially independent of the convection intensity...|$|R
40|$|Several {{techniques}} used for delaying transition both in {{air and water}} are overviewed, among them uniform surface <b>heating,</b> <b>localized</b> surface <b>heating,</b> {{and the application of}} broad-band disturbance-wave cancellation using the wave superposition principle. It is pointed out that <b>localized</b> <b>heating,</b> in air, can effectively delay transition along a flat plate and reduce viscous drag. Attention is focused on an experiment where the feasibility of relaminarizing turbulent flow over a flat plate with an upstream concave-convex curvature, in air, has been demonstrated using <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> on the concave part of the curved surface.

5000|$|In systems using {{alternating}} current but without separate anode structures, the electrodes alternate as anodes and cathodes, and the impinging electrons can cause substantial <b>localized</b> <b>heating,</b> often to red heat. The electrode may {{take advantage of}} this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode. (Instant start fluorescent lamps employ this aspect; they start as cold-cathode devices, but soon <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> of the fine tungsten wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as hot cathode lamps.) ...|$|R
50|$|Chain {{scission}} {{occurs in}} a polymer {{as a result of}} intense <b>localized</b> <b>heat.</b> the chemical bond in a polymer backbone may be broken with the generation of free radicles by heat, ionizing irradiation, mechanical stress and chemical reactions. These scissions multiple in number cause a fracture tip initialization to occur followed by its growth.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{induction}} heating cycle is very short {{in comparison to}} flame brazing, more parts can be processed in {{the same amount of}} time, and less heat is released to the surrounding environment.“An induction brazing system quickly delivers highly <b>localized</b> <b>heat</b> to minimize part warpage and distortion. Brazing in a controlled vacuum or in an inert protective atmosphere can significantly improve overall part quality and eliminate costly part cleaning procedures” (Induction Atmospheres, 1).|$|E
50|$|Any surface contamination, {{notably the}} oil from human fingertips, {{can damage the}} quartz {{envelope}} when it is heated. Contaminants will create a hot spot on the bulb surface when the lamp is turned on. This extreme, <b>localized</b> <b>heat</b> causes the quartz to change from its vitreous form into a weaker, crystalline form that leaks gas. This weakening may also cause the bulb to form a bubble, weakening it and leading to its explosion.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> (cooling), suction (injection), buoyancy forces and magnetic field for the mixed convection flow on a heated vertical plate. The <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> or cooling introduces a finite discontinuity in the mathematical formulation of the problem and increases its complexity. In order to overcome this difficulty, a non-uniform distribution of wall temperature is taken at finite sections of the plate. The nonlinear coupled parabolic partial differential equations governing the flow have been solved by using an implicit finite-difference scheme. The effect of the <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> or cooling is found to be very significant on the heat transfer, but its effect on the skin friction is comparatively small. The buoyancy, magnetic and suction parameters increase the skin friction and heat transfer. The positive buoyancy force (beyond a certain value) causes an overshoot in the velocity profiles...|$|R

5000|$|This sudden, <b>localized</b> <b>heat</b> release {{generates a}} shock wave which travels through the {{combustion}} chamber, with its sudden pressure rise causing an audible knocking sound. Worse, the shock wave disrupts the thermal boundary layer on the piston surface, causing overheating and eventual melting. The output power decreases and, unless the throttle (or load) {{is cut off}} quickly, the engine can be damaged as described in a few minutes. The sensitivity of a fuel to a cool-flame ignition strongly depends on the temperature, pressure and composition.|$|E
50|$|Thermal stress {{weathering}} comprises {{two main}} types, thermal shock and thermal fatigue. Thermal stress weathering {{is an important}} mechanism in deserts, {{where there is a}} large diurnal temperature range, hot in the day and cold at night. The repeated heating and cooling exerts stress on the outer layers of rocks, which can cause their outer layers to peel off in thin sheets. The process of peeling off is also called exfoliation. Although temperature changes are the principal driver, moisture can enhance thermal expansion in rock. Forest fires and range fires are also known to cause significant weathering of rocks and boulders exposed along the ground surface.

30|$|In October and November, {{the decline}} of xylem {{formation}} and the dormancy of cambium were observed, respectively (Fig.  2). The application of tZ could not inhibit {{the decline of}} xylem formation and the dormancy of the cambium. It was reported that <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> induced reactivation of cambium in coniferous species from late winter to early spring [40]. However, in December, <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> could not induce accelerated reactivation of cambium in sugi, because of the low sensitivity of cambium [41]. Therefore, the observed effects of applied tZ in this study may be recognized only when the environmental factor (temperature) is optimal for xylem formation and the sensitivity of cambium is relatively high.|$|R

50|$|Galling occurs {{initially}} {{with material}} transfer from individual grains, on a microscopic scale, which become stuck or even diffusion welded to the adjacent surface. This transfer {{can be enhanced}} if one or both metals form {{a thin layer of}} hard oxides with high coefficients of friction, such as those found on aluminum or stainless-steel. As the lump grows it pushes against the adjacent material and begins forcing them apart, concentrating a majority of the friction heat-energy into a very small area. This in turn causes more adhesion and material build-up. The <b>localized</b> <b>heat</b> increases the plasticity of the galled surface, deforming the metal, until the lump breaks through the surface and begins plowing up large amounts of material from the galled surface. Methods of preventing galling include the use of lubricants like grease and oil, low-friction coatings and thin-film deposits like molybdenum disulfide or titanium nitride, and increasing the surface hardness of the metals using processes such as case hardening and induction hardening.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to their}} {{promising}} material properties, significant interest lies in economical large-scale production methods. Sonochemical synthesis, which allows nucleation reactions to proceed rapidly through acoustic generation of <b>localized</b> <b>heat</b> and pressure, has been explored {{as a way}} to shorten synthesis times. [...] As with the case of zeolites, microwave-assisted synthesis has also been of interest for the rapid synthesis of ZIFs. [...] Both methods have been shown to reduce reaction times from days to hours, or from hours to minutes. Solvent-free methods, such as ball-milling or chemical vapor deposition, have also been described to produce high-quality ZIF-8. [...] Chemical vapor deposition is of particular promise due to the high degree of uniformity and aspect ratio control it can offer, and its ability to be integrated into traditional lithographic workflows for functional thin films (e.g. microelectronics). Environmentally-friendly synthesis based on supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) have been also reported as a feasible procedure for the preparation of ZIF-8 at an industrial scale. Working under stoichiometric conditions, ZIF-8 could be obtained in 10 hours and does not require the use of ligand excess, additives, organic solvents or cleaning steps.|$|E

The LADA technique is somewhat similar in execution to the Soft Defect Localization (SDL) technique, except that SDL uses a longer wavelength laser (1340 nm) in order to induce <b>localized</b> <b>heating</b> rather than generate photo carriers.
