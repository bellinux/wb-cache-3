The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill over what is now Green Street and Pookles Lane.|$|E

In {{order to}} study <b>the</b> effect <b>on</b> indoor thermal comfort when {{capillary}} network radiation heating is in diffrent locations, and make capillary network apply to civil {{construction in the}} best location. According to the Airpak software,we perform a bedroom thermal environment CFD simulation when capillary network is in three different locations, from which,we get the temperature field, the velocity field and the PMV images.

5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge to the west.|$|E

5|$|Goodrich Castle {{appears to}} have been in {{existence}} by 1101, when it was known as Godric’s Castle, named probably after Godric of Mappestone, a local Anglo-Saxon thane and landowner mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Victorian historians, however, believed the castle to date back further to the pre-Norman conquest days of King Canute, and the site may have been among a small number of Saxon fortifications along the Welsh border. By Norman times, Goodrich formed part of the Welsh Marches, a sequence of territories granted to Norman nobles in, and alongside, Wales. Although Goodrich <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> safer, English side of the border, the threat of raids and attacks continued throughout most of the period.|$|E
5|$|Governor Johnson, {{despite his}} {{presumptive}} official position, his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General John C. Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P.

Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head bounced off the ice. He <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice {{for a few minutes}} before being able to leave the ice on his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E

5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament {{building}} to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E
5|$|North of Dundas Street, {{the route}} swerves westward onto the {{alignment}} of Halls Road and crosses Rossland Road; a future interchange is planned at this location. It continues north to an interchange with Taunton Road before diverging east from the Halls Road alignment to travel parallel {{between it and}} Coronation Road. The route crosses Highway7 (Winchester Road), where a partial interchange provides southbound access and a northbound exit; a commuter carpool parking lot <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northwest corner. Immediately north of Highway7, the route ends at a three-level stack interchange with Highway407E, {{which is also a}} toll route thus no ETC cameras are present there.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February the Allied army {{encountered}} the main Argentine force commanded by Rosas himself. On paper, {{the two sides}} were well-matched. The Allies included 20,000 Argentines, 2,000 Uruguayans, 4,000 Brazilian elite troops totalling 26,000 men and 45 cannon (16,000 cavalrymen, 9,000 infantrymen and 1,000 artillerymen). On the Argentine side, Rosas had 15,000 cavalrymen, 10,000 infantrymen and 1,000 artillerymen, totalling 26,000 men and 60 cannon. Rosas {{had been able to}} select the best positions for his army, choosing the high ground on the slopes of a hill at Caseros, which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the Morón creek. His headquarters were in a mansion at the top of Caseros.|$|E

5|$|The Hastings family {{suffered}} financially as {{a result}} of the war, and Ferdinando was imprisoned for debt in 1659. The family moved to Donington Hall, although some of the remains of the castle were repaired to form a house called Ashby Place, which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side of the site in the old outer court. Selina Hastings, the Countess of Huntingdon, lived there after 1746. With the deterioration of the castle and the departure of the Hastings, the neighbouring town also fell into decline. With the death of Francis Hastings in 1789, the castle was inherited by Francis Rawdon, who later became the Earl of Moira.|$|E
5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when they ran out of ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{the collapse of}} papal authority in the Papal Schism allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This de facto authority over appointments was formally recognised by the Papacy in 1487. This led to the placement of clients and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son Alexander, who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews {{at the age of}} 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of venality and nepotism. James IV used his pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn to help bring the respective regions of Ross and Galloway, which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edges of the kingdom, under royal authority. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour. In 1472 St Andrews became the first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be followed by Glasgow in 1492.|$|E
