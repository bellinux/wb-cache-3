5|$|The {{demobilisation}} {{plan was}} put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. At this time the military had a strength of 598,300 men and women. Of these, 310,600 were in Australia, 224,000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 were in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general demobilisation did not begin until 1October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. These centres were to provide information on employment, <b>land</b> <b>settlement,</b> <b>housing,</b> training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed. Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September.|$|E

The Federation reflected his conviction, {{to which he}} adhered to all his life, that farmers' land proprietorship must {{go hand in hand}} with land nationalisation.|$|R
50|$|Agricultural {{policy was}} an early issue raised in the election. This was because the Cardiganshire Farmers’ Union, a {{generally}} pro-Conservative organisation, held a meeting to question Captain Evans and decided to ask all candidates the same series of questions. They {{wanted to know if}} the candidates approved of farmers having to give up land to ex-soldiers, if they would support a {{reduction in the number of}} government inspectors supervising farmers and their work, particularly those operating under the Wages Boards. Although Loveden Pryse decided not to put himself up as a candidate, the issue of waste and government expenditure was raised in the election. The farmers wanted to know if the candidates would oppose increased spending on education, public health, <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> and <b>housing.</b> Despite the conservatism of the country people it was reported that Llewelyn Williams was receiving a good reception in the rural areas.|$|R

5000|$|The {{need for}} trained {{professionals}} highlighted the shift towards formal, organized <b>settlement</b> <b>houses,</b> often {{with their own}} set of ethics, ideology, or religion; funding also became an issue {{with the need to}} pay the professional social workers. Typically, financing for the <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> and their workers came from wealthy philanthropists who frequently served {{on the board of directors}} of the house or association, and government agencies at this point contributed very little to the community agencies. Although the work of <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> aimed at welcoming the immigrants to the new country while encouraging the maintenance of certain aspects of their lifestyles from their native <b>lands,</b> many <b>settlement</b> and community <b>houses,</b> the Downtown Community House included, simultaneously sought to acculturate and Americanize the immigrants they helped by teaching English and instilling them with asserted American values. At the Hull-House, for example, immigrants were educated with classes in history, art, and literature; many community houses had specific Americanization classes and programs. In the Bowling Green Neighborhood Association's annual report in 1926, they stated that they that “never prodded them immigrants into citizenship, but when they have reached the point where they want to become citizens, we give them all the help we can with their papers.” ...|$|R
40|$|Origins and {{organization}} of New Bedford financial <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> are examined. <b>Settlement</b> <b>houses</b> {{are an important part}} of the extensive fishing community and have made significant historic contributions. Economic, political and social factors leading to the development of formal <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> in New Bedford are traced and the contemporary organization and responsibilities of <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> are investigated. <b>Settlement</b> <b>houses</b> and fishing routines were observed from 1986 to 1998. Interviews of the settler/owners of the five largest <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> in New Bedford and early settlers and fishermen from the 1930 s and 1940 s were conducted. Financial settlers helped bring order and increased trust to financial settlements that, prior to the 1930 s, had largely been conducted in cash and based on unwritten agreements. Most contemporary and many of the earliest settlers are female and women's contributions to the fishing industry are discussed. Emphasis is also placed on the fisher-based solution that <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> represent; implications for use in co-management strategies and the need to reduce the adversarial atmosphere in fisheries governance are discussed. financial settlers New Bedford co-management fishing community New England fishermen <b>settlement</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Progressive Era, {{roughly the}} time period between 1890 and 1914, {{was a time of}} transformations, challenges, and uncertainty. In {{response}} to immigration, industrialization and urbanization, and an unsatisfied working class, <b>settlement</b> <b>houses</b> developed to address the issues of the time. One <b>settlement</b> <b>house</b> founder, who has been largely overlooked by the history books, devised a unique method to reach the Russian-Jewish population of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Lizzie Black Kander attempted to change the lives of immigrants, for better or worse, via assimilation through cultural eating habits. She created a <b>settlement</b> <b>house</b> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, called "The Settlement," and taught young girls how to keep house and prepare a proper meal. Using the lessons from her cooking classes at The Settlement, Kander also produced a cookbook, which is still reproduced and sold today. Kander's methods and motivations for <b>settlement</b> <b>house</b> work are complex and help to explore the broader American <b>settlement</b> <b>house</b> movement. While Kander is typical of many <b>settlement</b> <b>house</b> workers who believed in assimilating immigrants, she also represents a thrust of the <b>settlement</b> <b>house</b> movement that allowed some choice over cultural identity and granted immigrants the right to assimilate on their own terms...|$|R

50|$|The {{most famous}} <b>settlement</b> <b>house</b> in the United States is Chicago's Hull House, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889 after Addams visited Toynbee Hall within the {{previous}} two years. Hull House, though, was not a religious based organization. It focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children. Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, founded in 1894, Friendly Inn <b>Settlement</b> <b>House,</b> founded in 1874, Henry Street Settlement, founded in 1893, Hiram House, founded in 1896, and University <b>Settlement</b> <b>House,</b> founded in 1886 and the oldest in the United States, were, like Hull House, important sites for social reform.
