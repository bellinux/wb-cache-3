25|$|In 1988, Bachchan {{returned}} to films, playing {{the title role}} in Shahenshah, which was a box office success. After {{the success of his}} comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like Jaadugar, Toofan and Main Azaad Hoon (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film, Hum, for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 film Agneepath. These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of Khuda Gawah in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of Insaniyat (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.|$|E

The German offensive lasted with varying intensity for the next five months and during this time, all five divisions of the AIF in France were involved in the fighting as they attempted to stem the tide of the German advance, which achieved large territorial gains and at one stage looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> ultimately secure a remarkable victory for the Germans as they pushed to within [...] from Paris late in May. During this time, the Australians were involved in a number of actions at Dernancourt, Morlancourt, Villers-Bretonneux, Hangard Wood, Hazebrouck, and Hamel.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Music.j-total.net, {{the song is}} written in the key of F minor. During {{the first and second}} verse and pre-chorus, the song follows a key sequence of F minor. Through the first, second and third chorus, the song has a sequence of A#m7–D#m7–E–D#m7. During the bridge section, the key sequence changes to A#m7–C7–F minor. It opens with a percussion section that includes a drum machine and cymbals; it then carries on with Palm Products GmbH synthesizers and keyboards, as described by a member at Selective Hearing. In an interview with MSN Hotmail in 2008, Utada said about the song; [...] "I wanted to write quite a lively song and after writing it, I still feel that this has the most energetic feeling to it and that it’s probably the most polished song too." [...] She personally enjoyed the end result of the song, as she described the arrangement and lyrical content, and cited it one of her favorite songs form the album. A reviewer from Selective Hearing said that the song [...] "sound like throw backs to her R days." [...] The editor analyzed the song's music structure, and said that the [...] "sample at the beginning sounds <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be from a Godzilla movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wrong Goodbye {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics and garnered {{an audience of}} 1.36 million viewers. New York Magazine drew out the references from past seasons and commented on how the season finale was written. [...] "The Last Episode of the Fourth Season of the Greatest Show of Our Time felt in many ways <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been written to end the series, what with the many This Is Your Life moments (such as the return of Georgina Sparks and Blair's old minions Izzy and Kati), the wry references to episodes past, the wrapping up of story lines (including the revelation that Dan has been secretly novelizing his observations of the Upper East Side for the entire time we've thought we've [...] "known" [...] him), and the meaningful departure of its most marketable star to none other than Hollywood." [...] Critical praise went to the storyline twist behind Charlie's identity, citing her as [...] "the big “shocker” of the Gossip Girl finale" [...] and the cameo appearance of Gossip Girl author, Cecily von Ziegesar. Television Without Pity included the episode in its gallery of [...] "Season Finales 2011: The Best and Worst", declaring the finale {{as one of the}} best and stating that it [...] "had a lot of storylines pay off" [...] and [...] "was our own little version of a fairy tale." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in his {{evaluation}} of The Secret Service as a whole, La Rivière {{argues that the}} premise of a secret agent masquerading as a priest while driving an antiquated car could not have appealed much to children, and that older viewers would have been disappointed with the series' unoriginal [...] "traditional espionage format". Ian Fryer concurs, writing in FAB magazine that [...] "very little about The Secret Service has obvious appeal to the traditionally young Supermarionation audience." [...] Discussing the opening theme music, he remarks that [...] "the younger me would have run a mile from any series which sounded like that." [...] He also notes that the opening credits [...] "broke with the tradition of having a thrilling or suspenseful promise {{of what was to}} come, and made the series look suspiciously <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be about the life and work of an elderly vicar." [...] For La Rivière, the blending of puppetry and live action [...] "simply doesn't work. It requires more than the audience can give in terms of acceptance." [...] In the case of [...] "More Haste Less Speed", he points out that the character of Lady Hazlewell is portrayed in live-action distance shots by a stunt actor dressed in drag – an [...] "unintentionally hilarious moment that illustrates beautifully why the live-action inserts didn't work." [...] He further argues that the contrasting light levels of shots that alternate between one format and the other shatter the illusion of [...] "artificiality" [...] that previous series had been able to sustain in the absence of live action.|$|E

500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. In a 2010 {{review of the}} episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "Grade A" [...] rating. He noted {{the difference between the}} style of the episode and previous stories of the series, saying that at first, it [...] "feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be a very special Murder, She Wrote or something," [...] and that later, [...] "we're clearly in some other show entirely, the only links in the continuity chain being Mulder and Scully themselves." [...] Including Morgan's other scripts for the show, VanDerWerff called his writing [...] "deeply, deeply funny", but said that [...] "Humbug" [...] "may be [...] weakest script". He particularly praised the ending of the episode, saying [...] "there are few other TV writers that would come up with something as haunting and as perfectly understanding of the human condition as the final reveal of who the killer is." [...] Also writing for The A.V. Club in 2010, Zack Handlen called it [...] "a terrific episode ... well-written and odd". Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called [...] "Humbug" [...] "the pivotal episode of The X-Files." [...] Robert Goodwin said of the episode [...] "Talk about offbeat. It's very theatrical and grandiose. The trick was being careful that it didn't become like a bad Vincent Price movie, but it worked out well." [...] Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Reviewers for website IGN named [...] "Humbug" [...] the tenth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series. Topless Robot named it the sixth funniest episode of the series.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such {{a huge part of}} me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Indecision {{over his}} {{sexuality}} in the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol" [...] drew some negative reviews of Blaine. Reiter noted that, [...] "So much of Blaine's charm {{has been his}} certainty about who he is." [...] Though she found his subplot with Rachel [...] "fun", she commented: [...] "Blaine's overwrought speech in the coffee shop after Rachel asks him out just felt off-key. Saying 'bye' to the Blaine sexual-confusion storyline wouldn't make us angry at all." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also criticised the storyline, which, he wrote, [...] "seemed <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be an interesting, complicated look at teenage sexuality {{and how it can}} seem formed but might be more fluid than most teens would give it credit for, then lost its nerve and took the easy way out." [...] AfterElton.com Chris O'Guinn felt that the only aspect of the storyline handled acceptably was Blaine questioning whether he was bisexual, rather than outright straight. He criticized the shallow examination of his feelings, and wrote: [...] "Bisexuality is such a contentious issue that it should not be fumbled this way. For a character to say 'maybe I'm bi' in one scene and then the next say, 'nope, definitely gay' is almost cruel in how dismissive it is toward bisexuals by trivializing the intense confusion that many bisexual people feel in coming to terms with their orientation." [...] In a more positive review, Canning opined that Blaine and Kurt's conversation about sexuality was [...] "great". He was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them" [...] and said that it [...] "felt very real for kids in this situation." ...|$|E

500|$|Like Eno's {{previous}} album Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) {{received a}} mostly very positive reception from critics. Writing for the Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album {{a rating of}} A–, writing [...] "Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure. Admittedly, when they're over they're over—you don't flash on them {{the way you do}} on [...] "Cindy Tells Me" [...] and [...] "Baby's on Fire". But that's just his way of being modest." [...] Wayne Robbins of Creem lauded Eno for the way he [...] "grafts seemingly disparate elements in any way that might be useful to his flow". Robbins explained, [...] "It sounds <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be pretentious; it's not, because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions"; he concluded that [...] "a man who can write songs like 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More' has seen the future, and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno, who makes music you can live with". Circus magazine described the album as [...] "Sick! Sick! Sick! But, oh-h-h, it feels so good! [...] guaranteed to be put on the 'Most Wanted' list by psychopaths everywhere [...] takes you on a dada-ists tour-de-force, lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable". Critic Ed Naha, writing in Crawdaddy!, gave the album a negative review, writing [...] "Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno's first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell." [...] In 1975 Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) was voted one of the best albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1975.|$|E

2500|$|Nagel moved incrementally. He did {{not think}} he could {{initially}} sell the idea of paramedics working alone, {{even if they had}} authorization to perform medical procedures signed by physicians. So instead his first step was to establish a radio link and telemetry between the paramedic fire fighters and the hospital. Nagel's had a hidden agenda in promoting telemetry. For Nagel it gained him access through the legal impediments stopping fire fighters from defibrillating patients and administering medications. Nagel reasoned that if the fire department could send the ECG signal to the hospital via telemetry, then the fire fighters (with special training) could be authorized by the physician to administer needed drugs and procedures before arriving in the emergency department. He believed a paramedic at the scene was a legal extension of a physician. He recalled later, [...] "We saw telemetry as the key to extending our treatment to outside the hospital where hitherto trying to legislate it was {{the dark side of the}} moon in those days. The telemetry looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be the 'open sesame' to doing some treatment pre-hospital." ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{are many}} reasons for hoping that it will do so. The Times has styled the crown the [...] "golden link" [...] of the empire. Australians and Canadians, it was argued, had little love for the motherland but the {{greatest}} devotion to the sovereign, and still truer was this of Indians, Egyptians, and the <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> <b>might</b> be easy to press this theory of devotion too far, but {{there can be little}} doubt that the British Crown does at present stand as a symbol of unity over diversity such as no other crown, unless it be that of Austria-Hungary, can be said to do. The British crown is not like other crowns; it may conceivably take a line of its own and emerge--possibly a little more like a hat and a little less like a crown--from trials that may destroy every other monarchial system in the world.|$|E
6000|$|Somewhere at the back, in some {{pleasure}} {{ground or}} casino or place of entertainment, an undaunted brass band was playing against the cosmic uproar. I {{do not know}} what band it was. Judging from the boisterous British Imperialism of most of the airs it played, I should think it was a German band. But there was no doubt about its energy, and when I came quite close under it it really drowned the storm. It was playing such things as [...] "Tommy Atkins" [...] and [...] "You Can Depend on Young Australia," [...] and many others of which I do not know the words, but I should think they would be [...] "John, Pat, and Mac, With the Union Jack," [...] or that fine though unwritten poem, [...] "Wait till the Bull Dog gets a bite of you." [...] Now, I for one detest Imperialism, but I {{have a great deal of}} sympathy with Jingoism. And there seemed something so touching about this unbroken and innocent bragging under the brutal menace of Nature that it made, if I may so put it, two tunes in my mind. It is so obvious and so jolly to be optimistic about England, especially when you are an optimist--and an Englishman. But through all that glorious brass came the voice of the invasion, the undertone of that awful sea. I did a foolish thing. As I could not express my meaning in an article, I tried to express it in a poem--a bad one.
