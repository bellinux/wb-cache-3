40|$|In this thesis, we {{make two}} major {{contributions}} {{that help the}} tasks of querying, updating, and managing XML data become quick and safe. First, we propose a new labelling scheme for dynamic XML data that supports {{the representation of the}} ancestor – descendant relationship and sibling relationship between nodes. Our unique way of <b>labelling</b> <b>codes</b> can also help users easily determine the depth (level) of the XML tree. Moreover, it also supports the process of updating XML data without the need of re-labelling existing labels, hence facilitating fast update. Some experimental works have been conducted to show its effectiveness. Secondly, for XML security purposes, we propose a fine-grained access control model, named SecureX, which supports read and write privileges. With our novel access control concept, various access types are introduced, including those for determining if a user has the right to change XML structure. SecureX ensures that, crucial information will be accessible only to authorized entities. Furthermore, SecureX can be integrated well with a dynamic labelling scheme to eliminate repetitive labelling and pruning processes when determining a user view. This brings about advantages of speeding up searching and querying processes...|$|E
40|$|Quantum error-correction codes (QECCs) are a vital {{ingredient}} of quantum computation and communication systems. In that context {{it is highly}} desirable to design QECCs that can be represented by graphical models which possess a structure that enables efficient and close-to-optimal iterative decoding. In this paper we focus on stabilizer QECCs, a class of QECCs whose construction is rendered non-trivial {{by the fact that}} the stabilizer <b>label</b> <b>code,</b> a code that is associated with a stabilizer QECC, has to satisfy a certain self-orthogonality condition. In order to design graphical models of stabilizer <b>label</b> <b>codes</b> that satisfy this condition, we extend a duality result for Forney-style factor graphs (FFGs) to the stabilizer <b>label</b> <b>code</b> framework. This allows us to formulate a simple FFG design rule for constructing stabilizer <b>label</b> <b>codes,</b> a design rule that unifies several earlier stabilizer <b>label</b> <b>code</b> constructions.

40|$|Abstract—We {{develop a}} Tanner graph (TG) {{construction}} for an Abelian group block code with arbitrary alphabets at different coordinates, an important application {{of which is}} the representa-tion of the <b>label</b> <b>code</b> of a lattice. The construction is based on the modular linear constraints imposed on the code symbols by a set of generators for the dual code. As a necessary step toward the construction of a TG for, we devise an efficient algorithm for finding a generating set for. In the process, we develop a construction for lattices based on an ar-bitrary Abelian group block code, called generalized Construction A (GCA), and explore relationships among a group code, its GCA lattice, and their duals. We also study the problem of finding low-complexity TGs for Abelian group block codes and lattices, and derive tight lower bounds on the label-code complexity of lattices. It is shown that for many important lattices, the minimal <b>label</b> <b>codes</b> which achieve the lower bounds cannot be supported by cycle-free Tanner graphs.

This scale continues to the 210s at 13.25 micrometre or finer. Thus each step of ten (as from 80s to 90s or 90s to 100s) corresponds to 0.5 micrometre less in allowed maximum fiber diameter.
