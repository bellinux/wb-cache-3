5|$|The term <b>limbic</b> {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the <b>limbic</b> structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} <b>limbic</b> system.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} major {{pathways}} {{in the brain}} connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia. These are known as the motor, oculo-motor, associative, <b>limbic</b> and orbitofrontal circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit. All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease, since these circuits {{are involved in a}} wide variety of functions, including movement, attention and learning. Scientifically, the motor circuit has been examined the most intensively.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, <b>limbic</b> encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|Paul Broca {{associated}} {{regions of}} the brain with specific functions, in particular language in Broca's area, following work on brain-damaged patients. John Hughlings Jackson described {{the function of the}} motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production. Korbinian Brodmann divided {{regions of the}} brain based on the appearance of cells. By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and <b>limbic</b> system functions. The capacity of the brain to re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the <b>limbic</b> structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
25|$|Higher Activation of Subcortical <b>Limbic</b> Regions. A 1998 {{study showed}} higher {{activation}} of subcortical <b>limbic</b> regions of {{two groups of}} reactive and proactive murderers, especially in the more “emotional” right hemisphere of the brain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limbic</b> leucotomy was {{developed}} in the early 1970s by surgeon Alan Richardson at Atkinson Morley’s Hospital. The operation combines stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy and cingulotomy, with up to 14 cryogenic lesions made in the brain. <b>Limbic</b> leucotomies continued to be performed at Atkinson Morley’s Hospital until 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is highly}} interconnected with {{other parts of}} the central nervous system, in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the <b>limbic</b> system, it has connections to other <b>limbic</b> structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The insular cortex is {{considered}} a separate lobe of the telencephalon by some authorities. Other sources see the insula {{as a part of}} the temporal lobe. It is also sometimes grouped with <b>limbic</b> structures deep in the brain into a <b>limbic</b> lobe. As a paralimbic cortex, the insular cortex {{is considered}} to be a relatively old structure.|$|E
25|$|Human {{brain wave}} {{patterns}} show distinct changes during orgasm, which indicate {{the importance of}} the <b>limbic</b> system in the orgasmic response. Male and female brains demonstrate similar changes during orgasm, with brain activity scans showing a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex with normal or increased metabolic activity in the <b>limbic</b> areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Tracer {{studies in}} monkeys {{have shown that}} the orbitofrontal cortex shares {{extensive}} connections with other association cortices, primary sensory and association cortices, <b>limbic</b> systems, and other subcortical areas. Corticocortical connections include extensive local projections to and from other prefrontal regions, as well as with motor, <b>limbic,</b> and sensory cortices. Areas projecting to motor areas are densely interconnected with other prefrontal cortical regions, reflecting integration for executive motor control.|$|E
25|$|Crying and {{vegetative}} {{sounds are}} controlled by the brain stem, which matures earlier than the cortex. Neurological development of higher brain structures coincides with certain developments in infants’ vocalizations. For example, the onset of cooing at 6 to 8 weeks happens as {{some areas of the}} <b>limbic</b> system begin to function. The <b>limbic</b> system is known {{to be involved in the}} expression of emotion, and cooing in infants is associated with a feeling of contentedness. Further development of the <b>limbic</b> system might be responsible for the onset of laughter around 16 weeks of age. The motor cortex, finally, which develops later than the abovementioned structures may be necessary for canonical babbling, which start around 6 to 9 months of age.|$|E
25|$|Much of the <b>limbic</b> system, which {{contains}} primitive brain structures relating to emotion and motivation, {{are involved in}} memory.|$|E
25|$|Edelman's theory {{focuses on}} two nervous system organizations: the {{brainstem}} and <b>limbic</b> systems {{on one side}} and the thalamus and cerebral cortex on the other side. The brain stem and <b>limbic</b> system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn adaptive behaviors.|$|E
25|$|It is popularly {{assumed that}} emotion {{disrupts}} cognition. However, neurophysiology and Ommaya's TBI research emphasize its fundamental inseparability. Ommaya defined four {{steps in the}} evolution of consciousness. 1) reflex and avoidance reactions; 2) sensory inputs merged with multisensory neurons in the mesencephalon; 3) interactions formed between sensory and <b>limbic</b> systems and memory; and 4) reinforcement of thalamic neural centers which relays information between sensory and motor centers. Ommaya discussed how the <b>limbic</b> system and emotion motivates action and focuses attention.|$|E
25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} structures in the <b>limbic</b> system. It is also known to play a role in the processing of and memory for emotional events.|$|E
25|$|According to Cloninger, the {{norepinephrine}} neurotransmitter has {{its major}} ascending pathways arising in the locus coeruleus in the pons, projecting onward to the hypothalamic and <b>limbic</b> structures, and then branching upwards to the neocortex.|$|E
25|$|Connectivity of the {{orbitofrontal cortex}} with <b>limbic</b> areas {{includes}} reciprocal projections to granular, dysgranular, and agranular insular cortex, parahippocampal regions, and the hippocampus, particularly CA1 regions in a rostral-to caudal gradient. The orbitofrontal cortex additionally shares extensive reciprocal {{connections with the}} amygdala, and direct and indirect connections to the hypothalamus.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine is {{associated}} with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the <b>limbic</b> system increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases. The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom (see Cognitive development below).|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{research}} {{has looked at}} the tinnitus distress reaction (TDR) to account for differences in tinnitus severity. These findings suggest that at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the <b>limbic</b> system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.|$|E
25|$|Between 1974 and 1985 Persinger {{pursued the}} {{properties}} of brain mast cells and their responsiveness to environmental stimuli. He considered brain function {{to be the result}} of a matrix of anatomical structures. During the 1980s and 1990s he studied the relationships between changes in behavior and multi-focal brain anomalies associated with complex partial and <b>limbic</b> epilepsy and the emergence of sensitivities to stimuli typically not detected. Linda St-Pierre and he showed that the interaction between specific psychotropic drugs and <b>limbic</b> epilepsy in rodents contributed significantly to obesity. Nicolas Rouleau and he demonstrated that fundamental electrophysiological properties of the human brain were still evident in chemically fixed, post-mortem samples when appropriate neurochemicals were added or if the tissues were electrically stimulated. After 2000 he, Blake T. Dotta, Nirosha J. Murugan, and Lukasz M. Karbowski pursued the mechanisms by which temporally complex magnetic fields with specific point durations tuned to proton properties slowed the growth of cancer cells but not normal cells, a continuation of the original research by Carly A. Buckner and Robert M. Lafrenie.|$|E
25|$|Hypertrophy of the extraocular muscles, adipogenesis, and {{deposition}} of nonsulfated glycoaminoglycans and hyaluronate, causes {{expansion of the}} orbital fat and muscle compartments, which {{within the confines of}} the bony orbit may lead to dysthyroid optic neuropathy, increased intraocular pressures, proptosis, venous congestion leading to chemosis and periorbital edema, and progressive remodeling of the orbital walls. Other distinctive features of TAO include lid retraction, restrictive myopathy, superior <b>limbic</b> keratoconjunctivitis, and exposure keratopathy.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscience {{describes}} reward, pleasure, {{and motivation}} {{in terms of}} neurotransmitter activity, especially in the <b>limbic</b> system and the ventral tegmental area in particular. If one believes that {{the meaning of life}} is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a science of morality– the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.|$|E
25|$|Psychosurgery {{continued}} to decline during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1976 about 120 operations {{were carried out}} in the United Kingdom. There were still a few standard leucotomies, but by the mid-1970s stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy, cingulotomy and stereotactic <b>limbic</b> leucotomy accounted for more than 50 per cent of operations. Depression was the most common diagnosis; people were also operated on for anxiety, violence, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, anorexia and other diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in amygdalar CB1 receptor binding following imipramine treatment {{is consistent with}} prior studies which collectively demonstrate that several treatments which are beneficial to depression, such as electroconvulsive shock and tricyclic antidepressant treatment, increase CB1 receptor activity in subcortical <b>limbic</b> structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. And preclinical studies have demonstrated the CB1 receptor {{is required for the}} behavioral effects of noradrenergic based antidepressants but is dispensable for the behavioral effect of serotonergic based antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} function, the insula is {{believed}} to process convergent information to produce an emotionally relevant context for sensory experience. To be specific, the anterior insula is related more to olfactory, gustatory, vicero-autonomic, and <b>limbic</b> function, whereas the posterior insula is related more to auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor function. Functional imaging experiments have revealed that the insula has {{an important role in}} pain experience and the experience of a number of basic emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, neuropsychiatry, physiological, and imaging {{studies have}} shown PTSD and {{depression}} to be physical syndromes, in many respects, as they are psychiatric ones in demonstrating <b>limbic</b> system physiological and anatomy disturbances. Attendant PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, which additionally increase physiological stress, may {{play a part in}} leading to frequent MH-like hyperpyrexia and speculate on its influence on underlying myopathology of FSS in other ways. PTSD may also bring about developmental delays or developmental stagnation, especially in paediatric patients.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the three-factor {{approach}} theorizes that neuroticism is mediated by levels of arousal in the <b>limbic</b> system and that individual differences arise because of variable activation thresholds between people. Therefore, highly neurotic people {{when presented with}} minor stressors, will exceed this threshold, whereas people low in neuroticism will not exceed normal activation levels, even when presented with large stressors. By contrast, proponents of the five-factor approach assume a role of genetics and environment but offer no explicit causal explanation.|$|E
25|$|The ventral stream pathway {{is mainly}} {{involved}} in object recognition, {{and is known}} colloquially as the 'what' pathway. It has connections to the medial temporal lobe (which {{is involved in the}} storage of long-term memories), the <b>limbic</b> system (which regulates emotions), and the dorsal stream pathway (which is involved in the visual-spatial locations and motions of objects). Therefore, the ventral stream pathway not only deals with the recognition of objects in the external world, but also the emotional judgement and analysis of these objects.|$|E
25|$|Tropico 2 was {{the final}} entry in the series to be {{published}} by Take-Two Interactive. No further Tropico games were greenlighted until November 2008, when Kalypso Media bought the Tropico intellectual property from Take-Two and announced Tropico 3, developed by Bulgaria's Haemimont Games. The game was released in 2009. Afterward, Haemimont Games developed Tropico 4 (2011) and Tropico 5 (2014), both published by Kalypso. Tropico 6, developed by <b>Limbic</b> Entertainment and published again by Kalypso Media, was announced in June 2017. It is set for release in 2018.|$|E
25|$|The <b>limbic</b> {{system can}} also {{significantly}} impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, {{it is not}} unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.|$|E
25|$|Cocaine causes {{impaired}} {{growth of}} the fetus's brain, an effect that is most pronounced {{with high levels of}} cocaine and prolonged duration of exposure throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy. Studies that use neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FMRI have shown differences in brain structure of PCE children, for example in the cerebral cortex and <b>limbic</b> system. Those PCE children who had slowed brain growth as fetuses are at higher risk for impaired brain growth and motor, language and attention problems after they are born.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{the brain}} have proven that {{pleasure}} and displeasure are an important component {{in the lives of}} animals. It has been established that the <b>limbic</b> neural mechanism that generates reactions are very similar across all mammals. Many studies have concentrated on the brain reward system and how similar it is across mammals. Through extensive research, scientists have been able to conclude that the brain reward system in animals is extremely similar to that of humans. The mechanism of core pleasure reaction is significantly important for animals and humans.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuitry}} {{involving the}} amygdala (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in emotional memory {{along with the}} amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the <b>limbic</b> system (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, {{but this does not}} appear to have been proven.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{triazine}} derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, {{leading to}} stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and has weak 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor inhibition. These actions {{are thought to}} inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral striatum <b>limbic</b> areas, and its neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects have been pointed out as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity. Observations that lamotrigine reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala, suggest that a GABAergic mechanism may also be involved, although this concept is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Many {{research}} studies {{of individuals with}} amusia show {{that a number of}} cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the primary auditory cortex, secondary auditory cortex, and <b>limbic</b> system are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to amusia. While various causes of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.|$|E
