When a message is sent, the selector is sent into the Objective-C runtime, matched against a list of available methods, and the method's implementation is called.

The implementation of the method is <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> runtime, not compile time. There is a small performance penalty for this, but late binding allows the same selector to reference different implementations.|$|E

This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by {{the impact of the}} falling bodies.|$|E

The crowd did not allow Orr to say his thank you speech until he put on a Bruins jersey. The day was proclaimed [...] "Bobby Orr Day" [...] in Boston and the event raised thousands of dollars for charity. He attended the Massachusetts Senate and House of Representatives and was given a five-minute standing ovation.

500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early because I knew there would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. Here she was able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album. The landscape around Broome inspired the lyrics for [...] "Going North". She said, [...] "It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country". The lyrics for [...] "Steer" [...] were inspired when Higgins <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the night sky on a Broome beach: [...] "It dawned on me how small we are, how short life is ...

500|$|According to Chen, Cloud was {{designed}} to [...] "expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke." [...] Chen had the first idea for the game; while walking to school one day he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky, noticing {{the difference between the}} fluffy clouds there and the [...] "polluted and gray" [...] clouds of Shanghai where he was born, and thought about making a game about clouds. It was given a story to [...] "create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested"; however, the team avoided making the story too strong, as it would [...] "distract the player from the core experience" [...] of flying freely and shaping clouds. In the early stages of development, the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment, but this was cut down to [...] "a simple 'poetic' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed." [...] The team intended Cloud to [...] "communicate a feeling of youthfulness, freedom, and the wonder of imagination." [...] It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game, Dyadin. At the 2006 Game Developers Conference student showcase, Chen and Santiago pitched Cloud to Sony representative John Hight as the first game in the [...] "Zen" [...] genre. Hight was interested, but Sony declined to publish the game.|$|E
500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the sky and the}} sun started to shine {{and all of a sudden}} the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E

500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{continued}} to accompany David {{to the ring}} until September when David was on the telephone with Torrie and later found out that Torrie was in the Filthy Animals' locker room flirting with Billy Kidman, {{this resulted in a}} feud between Flair and Kidman on the October 18, 1999 episode of Nitro when Torrie turned on him, resulting in Flair losing the match and the Animals beating on him, after the Animals stopped assaulting David, Torrie left with the Animals, It was around this time that Wilson began managing Billy Kidman and his Filthy Animals teammates. As a result, she found herself involved in the Animals continuing feud with The Revolution. On the November 22, 1999 episode of Nitro, during a tag team match between Billy Kidman and Konnan facing Creative Control for the WCW World Tag Team Championship, Billy Kidman <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Turnertron and saw that Torrie Wilson and Eddie Guerrero were shown flirting inside his locker room on the [...] "Kidcam", a hidden camera segment, which led to a storyline feud between Kidman and Guerrero. Following this, Wilson once again disappeared from television. Wilson however returned on the January 19, 2000 episode of Thunder managing Billy Kidman, and in April 2000, Kidman and Wilson joined a stable known as the New Blood, making them both villainous characters. As part of their newest storyline, Kidman became jealous of the attention Wilson began to give to fellow New Blood member Horace Hogan. In June, Wilson gave Kidman a hit at the Great American Bash, causing him to lose to Horace's uncle, Hulk Hogan.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} in the 1896 season, Hogan {{apparently}} secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. [...] On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. [...] "Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, and then <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball", the paper reported. [...] "It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness {{before the end of the}} game". [...] In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The article called Hogan [...] "one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League" [...] and predicted he would [...] "greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield". [...] The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a [...] "mistake", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. [...] The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan [...] "the largest salary he has ever drawn". [...] Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. [...] "He goes about the streets dressed much like an English costermonger", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. [...] "Marty can be seen with a little red wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis". [...] Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was [...] "playing a sensational center field". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. [...] "Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players", the article stated. [...] "Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year". [...] Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. [...] (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) [...] During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. [...] In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were [...] "anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires". [...] The article added, [...] "Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game".|$|E
