40|$|ABSTRACT: Geometrically linear and {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} analyses {{are used to}} determine the energy release rate and mode ratio in simulated tests of unidirectional, symmetric, single leg bending (SLB) specimens. It is shown that the finite diameter <b>loading</b> <b>rollers</b> that are typically used in practical test set-ups cause this test to be inherently nonlinear. The differences between the linear and nonlinear results are presented parametrically as a function of material properties, specimen thickness, roller diameter, span length and crack length. These results are used, along with empirically derived equations, to develop an approach for designing SLB experiments where one will have a high degree of confidence in toughness values as obtained from conventional data reduction techniques, and for which relatively little specimen-to-specimen variation in mode ratio will be observed...|$|R

Firstly, the influence model under actual working conditions is developed by referring to the basic relationship between transverse thickness difference and shape under ideal conditions. After that, the combined influence of transverse thickness difference and width-to-thickness ratio on the critical unstable shape is analyzed based on the elastic sheet stability model. Experimental validations demonstrate that during the production of ultrathin strip steel with different width-to-thickness ratios, the <b>loading</b> <b>roller</b> shapes should be fine adjusted according to the transverse thickness difference of input strips. Therefore, the variation of transverse thickness difference of output strips can meet the requirement of shape stability, so as to obtain fine shape...|$|R

40|$|Crack {{propagation}} in {{a rotating}} inner raceway {{of a high}} speed roller bearing is analyzed using the boundary integral equation method. The method consists of an edge crack in a plate under tension, upon which varying Hertzian stress fields are superimposed. A computer program for the boundary integral equation method was written using quadratic elements to determine the stress and displacement fields for discrete roller positions. Mode I and Mode II stress intensity factors and crack extension forces G sub 00 (energy release rate due to tensile opening mode) and G sub r 0 (energy release rate due to shear displacement mode) were computed. These calculations permit determination of that crack growth angle for which {{the change in the}} crack extension forces is maximum.

40|$|Idele Wheel whining is a {{phenomenon}} which is predominantly familiar to motor vehicle gear boxes. Usually all the gear wheels are in constant tooth engagement. For this reason one gear wheel from each gear must be supplied with a bearing in order to permit the differences in rotational speeds across the shafts. These wheels, most of which rotate on roller bearings, are described as idle wheels. At very low temperatures in the start up phase a whine like noise is produced by the loose wheel. The noise emission {{does not come from}} the tooth engagements but from the idle wheel bearing. Extensive measurements of idle wheels were carried out at a test stand. A simulation program for lightly respectively not <b>loaded</b> <b>roller</b> bearings has been developped in order to clarify the mechanism of origin of the noise. The foundation for the calculation of the forces in the lubricant film is the instationary hydrodynamic lubricant theory. In order to estimate the critical oil viscosity for noise, simple equations are available to the designer. (orig.)

Two methods have been used: low frequency mechanical vibration (up to 1000 Hz) and high frequency mechanical vibration (up to 16000 Hz) monitoring method and a shock pulse method (SPM, frequency 32000 Hz). Machines have been tested in at free run and fully loaded. Results have been applied to in-crease reliability of diagnostic methods in a case when radial clearances inside a bearing are too small {{and there is no}} enough lubricant oil supply to bearings. Radial clearances and relative vibra-tion displacements of rotor shafts have been measured using proximity probes. The low frequency vibration excitation method is not efficient enough in failure diagnostics of bearings in comparison to high frequency and shock pulse methods.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{smearing}} damage was studied under controlled conditions in a custom test rig that simulates {{the passage of}} a rolling element through loaded and unloaded zones of a rolling bearing. The set-up comprises a spherical roller which is intermittently loaded between two bearing raceways driven at a prescribed speed. The roller is free to accelerate during the loading phase. Contact <b>load,</b> <b>roller</b> speed and acceleration and electrical contact resistance are recorded during the test. Contact shear stress, friction coefficient, frictional power intensity and elasto-hydrodynamic film thickness are calculated from the recorded kinematics data. Results suggest that the first onset of smearing occurs early in the loading phase where the roller is near-stationary and the frictional power intensity is high. The raceway speed at the onset of damage decreases with increasing load and increasing lubricant supply temperature. The maximum frictional power intensity is found to be relatively constant at all contact conditions that led to 2 smearing.

50|$|The {{tire tread}} and {{sidewall}} elements undergo deformation and recovery {{as they enter}} and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity. Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV) and tangential force variation. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process as a quality check. In the late 1990s, Hunter Engineering introduced the GSP9700 Road Force balancer, which is equipped with a <b>load</b> <b>roller</b> similar to the force variation machine used at the factory to grade tire uniformity.

50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} use conical rollers {{that run on}} conical races. Most {{roller bearings}} only take radial or axial <b>loads,</b> but tapered <b>roller</b> bearings support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered roller bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered roller bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy <b>loads</b> the tapered <b>roller</b> is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

40|$|The wear of railway axle {{bearings}} is {{an important}} phenomenon. Rail companies must keep their rolling stock in a serviceable condition as excessively worn bearings can contribute to safety issues such as vibrations, excessive clearances and possibly even derailments.

40|$|AbstractAnalytical {{predictions}} {{are presented}} for the plastic collapse strength of lightweight sandwich beams having pin-reinforced foam cores that are loaded in 3 -point bending. Both polymer and aluminum foam cores are considered, whilst the facesheet and the pins {{are made of}} either composite or metal. Four different failure modes are account for: metal facesheet yield or composite facesheet microbuckling, facesheet wrinkling, plastic shear of the core, and facesheet indentation beneath the <b>loading</b> <b>rollers.</b> A micromechanics-based model is developed and combined with the homogenization approach to calculate the effective properties of pin-reinforced foam cores. To calculate the elastic buckling strength of pin reinforcements, the pin-reinforced foam core is treated as assemblies of simply supported columns resting upon an elastic foundation. Minimum mass design of the sandwich is then obtained {{as a function of}} the prescribed structural load index, subjected to the constraint that none of the above failure modes occurs. Collapse mechanism maps are constructed and compared with the failure maps of foam-cored sandwich beams without pin reinforcements. Finite element simulations are carried out to verify the analytical model and to study the performance and failure mechanisms of the sandwich subject to loading types other than 3 -point bending. The results demonstrate that the weaker the foam is, the more optimal the pin-reinforced foam core becomes, and that sandwich beams with pin-reinforced polymer foam cores are structurally more efficient than foam- or truss-cored sandwich beams...|$|R

Maximum load is encountered during the edge pre-bending stage of roller bending. Capacity of 3 -roller plate bending machine is specified by maximum thickness and minimum shell diameter combinations that can be pre-bend for given plate material of maximum width. Commercially available plate width or width of the plate that can be accommodated on machine decides the maximum rolling width. Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) provide the machine capacity chart based on reference material considering perfectly plastic material model. Reported work shows the bendability analysis of heavy duty 3 -roller plate bending machine. The input variables for the industry are plate thickness, shell diameter and material property parameters, as it is fixed by the design. Analytical models of equivalent thickness, equivalent width and maximum width based on power law material model were derived to study the bendability. Equation of maximum width provides bendability for designed configuration i. e. material property, shell diameter and thickness combinations within the machine limitations.
