5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle. Accounts {{that he had been}} killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to circulate, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the <b>logic</b> <b>in</b> Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the <b>logic</b> <b>in</b> Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and <b>Logic,</b> <b>in</b> {{which he}} claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E

5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal <b>logic,</b> <b>in</b> formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

40|$|Institutionalists in {{organizational}} sociology {{have developed a}} good deal of evidence about the role of field <b>logics</b> <b>in</b> shaping the practices of organizations. In this paper, we extend this imagery to multiple fields, highlighting how shifting <b>logics</b> <b>in</b> a superordinate field enable the infrastructural development of a subordinate field. In particular, we track how initially marginal, anti-institutional service-learning practices became a legitimate component of mainstream curricula in the field of U. S. higher education. While service-learning proponents have always made claims about the importance of generating knowledge and insight through helping others in the community, service-learning entrepreneurs had to build a field infrastructure to support their claims and culturally repackage the aims of service-learning in a way that articulated with broader <b>logics</b> <b>in</b> the field of higher education. We argue that the shift from an unarticulated closed-system logic to a situation of contending closed-system and open-system <b>logics</b> <b>in</b> the field of higher education facilitated the cultural repackaging of service-learning practices, enabling civic engagement to become a more accepted part of university curricula. Despite this apparently “successful ” institutionalization, however, competing <b>logics</b> <b>in</b> the field of higher education have instantiated contradictions in the service-learning field, raising important issues about th...|$|R

Inclusion logic and exclusion logic are obtained by adding only inclusion atoms or exclusion atoms to first-order logic, respectively.

Based on this description it is shown that all <b>logics</b> <b>in</b> ELin:t are independently axiomatizable. Then the description is used in order to investigate tense logics with respect to decidability, finite axiomatizability, axiomatization problems and completeness with respect to Kripke semantics. The main tool for the investigation is a translation of bimodal formulas into a language talking about partitions of general frames into intervals so that relative to both Kripke frames and descriptive frames the expressive power of both languages coincides.
