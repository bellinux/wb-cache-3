At <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|From c. 57 to 59, Titus was a {{military}} tribune in Germania, and later served in Britannia. His first wife, Arrecina Tertulla, died two years after their marriage, in 65. Titus then took a new wife of a more distinguished family, Marcia Furnilla. However, Marcia's family was {{closely linked to the}} opposition to Emperor Nero. Her uncle Barea Soranus and his daughter Servilia were among those who were killed after the failed Pisonian conspiracy of 65. Some modern historians theorize that Titus divorced his wife because of her family's connection to the conspiracy. He never remarried. Titus appears to have had multiple daughters, at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> by Marcia Furnilla. The only one known to have survived to adulthood was Julia Flavia, perhaps Titus's child by Arrecina, whose mother was also named Julia. During this period Titus also practiced law and attained the rank of quaestor.|$|E

Soldiers and militiamen quickly entered the city, as militants were reportedly retreating, and seized the city's hospital. Following this, the Iraqi government was preparing to declare victory {{in the battle for}} the city. However, ISIL militants sprung an ambush, with suicide bombers reportedly leaping from windows into groups of soldiers. Government troops retreated from the city before sunset four kilometers to the south under constant mortar and sniper fire. Several security force vehicles were seen abandoned, with at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> burnt out. 52 soldiers and 40 militants were killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was then closed for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping. Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in the arrests of John and Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had a prior incident with law enforcement.

5|$|The Olympic Movement uses symbols to {{represent}} the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, {{better known as the}} Olympic rings, consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Australia and Europe). The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.|$|E

The officers returned fire and the car the gunmen were escaping in crashed; later examination revealed at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been wounded. On 19July two police officers on patrol in Haifa were {{shot in the back}} and killed. The following day the 3rd Parachute Brigade cordoned the area and imposed a night time curfew, which was not lifted until 30July.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{contributed to}} {{numerous}} weather-related traffic accidents, at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> classified as major. Around 20 collisions {{occurred on the}} night of August 19 across the San Francisco Peninsula. Two crashes on Interstate 80 forced the closure of four lanes for 30 minutes, while California State Route 9 was blocked in Saratoga by a large tree which fell due to saturated soil. It is unclear how many injuries resulted from the various incidents. Thunderstorms associated with the storm system left about 78,000 electric customers in Sonoma County without power after lightning struck a power substation. The outages lasted up to a few hours. Lightning also knocked three workers unconscious in a vineyard near Lodi; they were in good condition after hospitalization.|$|E

Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport. Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons. Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene, and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured, at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> seriously.|$|E
