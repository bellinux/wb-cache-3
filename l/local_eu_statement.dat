40|$|Abstract. The layered {{compound}} EuFe 2 As 2 is {{an interesting}} model system to investigate the effects of well defined <b>local</b> <b>Eu</b> 2 + 4 f states on the itinerant electronic and magnetic properties of the FeAs layers. To address this subject, we investigated the series EuFe 2 −xCoxAs 2 (0. 1 ≤ x ≤ 0. 75) by electron spin resonance (ESR) of Eu 2 + to probe the spin dynamics of the itinerant subsystem. We relate the results to dc-susceptibility measurements and band structure calculations. As {{a consequence of the}} weak coupling between the local and itinerant subsystems we found that the spin relaxation is well understood in terms of the exchange coupling among the <b>local</b> <b>Eu</b> 2 + spins. A pronounced field dependence of the Eu 2 + spin relaxation demonstrates the direct influence of magnetic fluctuations at the Fe 2 −xCoxAs 2 layers. a...|$|R

In particular, the way skill standards for adult learners is designed in the <b>EU</b> official <b>statements</b> is investigated, analyzing the developments in the European Unionâs adult education policies since the Lisbon process was launched in order to verify to what extent they are evidence-based and legitimated through scientific research and specific ex-ante studies. In fact, because of the ageing work force in Europe, but also {{in the light of the}} recent economic downturns and the increased labor marketâs flexibility and dynamics, many governments have tried to foster the involvement and participation of adults in lifelong learning paths for them to suit the transformations of the knowledge-based societies and be active and competitive even in older ages. This empirical paper is based on literature review and content analysis of the relevant policy documents and official <b>EU</b> <b>statements.</b> The main findings show how, beyond declared purposes and political slogans, the way the EU is shaping the adult learnersâ upskilling significantly appears to aim at the substantial bolstering of basic and digital skills in order to cope with the knowledge economy rather than giving emphasis to more comprehensive sets of competences for lifelong learning and active ageing, which are going to be needed more than ever in the years to come...|$|R

40|$|Collective Action Clauses (CACs) {{are back}} at the {{forefront}} of financial crisis response, this time in Europe. In the absence of a sovereign bankruptcy regime, CACs help solve coordination problems in sovereign bonds by binding all bondholders to the terms of a debt restructuring approved by the majority. But unlike the last two campaigns to include CACs in foreign sovereign bonds in the 1990 s and early 2000 s, today’s initiative does not point to coordination problems. Most of the sovereign bonds at issue either already have CACs or include other features that make restructuring relatively straightforward. Much of the European debt problem stems from private sector debts, which can be restructured in bankruptcy. Moreover, standardized CACs on the model referenced in <b>EU</b> <b>statements</b> fit awkwardly in domestic law bonds, which account for the bulk of the EU sovereign debt problem. Why revive such an ill-fitting remedy?

40|$|The thesis {{concentrates}} on two phenomena: EU {{foreign policy and}} the EU-Israel relationship. As a result, the methodological approach is two-fold. The first {{focal point of the}} thesis is the evolution of EU foreign policy itself, especially concentrating on the situation before and after the Treaty of Lisbon came into effect on 1 December 2009. The second focal point of the thesis are two qualitative analyses of Operation Cast Lead (2008 / 2009) and Operation Protective Edge (2014) which compare the reactions of EU institutions with the reactions of two 'pro-Israel' EU member states (Germany and the Czech Republic) and two 'anti-Israel' EU member states (France and Sweden) to each conflict. The theoretical approach of the thesis is derived from the theory of normative institutionalism developed by Daniel C. Thomas. Based on this theory, the thesis argues that: [1] the increasing power of EU institutions has a mitigating effect on the sharp rhetoric of the member states; and [2] accentuated by the Lisbon Treaty reforms, institutionalism transforms the whole concept of EU foreign policy as individual member states perceive joint action as an intrinsic value and favour consistency and coherence in EU policy-making across time and issue-areas.
