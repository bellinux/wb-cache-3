50|$|The Positec Tool Corporation {{was founded}} in Suzhou, China by Don Gao in 1994. For most of its early years, Positec sold OEM power tools to {{companies}} and brands like Black & Decker. Gao wanted to branch out by creating a line of lawn and garden equipment using his own branding. Positec launched early versions of WORX tools in China in 2004. One of the first WORX products sold was an electronic <b>lawn</b> <b>trimmer</b> called the WORX GT.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, {{retailer}} Lowe's honored Positec {{with the}} Supplier of the Year Award. Lowe's also named Positec the [...] "Innovator of the Year" [...] among their 2,500 other suppliers. The company's WORX GT <b>lawn</b> <b>trimmer</b> also received an {{award from the}} U.S. Electronic Retailing Association in 2010. In 2011, Positec received awards from DIY Week for Product of the Year in the power tool and garden tools categories. In 2013, the World Wildlife Fund presented Positec with the Platinum Low Carbon Award for its sustainable manufacturing facilities in China.|$|E
60|$|The sleeves were short, {{and close}} to the limb, until they fell off at the elbows in large ruffles, that hung in rich profusion from the arm when extended; and duplicates and triplicates of <b>lawn,</b> <b>trimmed</b> with Dresden lace, lent their aid in giving {{delicacy}} to a hand and arm that yet retained their whiteness and symmetry. A treble row of large pearls closely encircled her throat; and a handkerchief of lace partially concealed that part of the person that the silk had left exposed, but which the experience of forty years had warned Miss Peyton should now be veiled.|$|R
50|$|The {{common grackle}} forages on the ground, {{in shallow water}} or in shrubs; it will steal food from other birds. It is omnivorous, eating insects, minnows, frogs, eggs, berries, seeds, grain and even small birds and mice. Grackles at outdoor eating areas often wait eagerly until someone drops some food. They will rush forward and try to grab it, often {{snatching}} food out of the beak of another bird. Grackles prefer to eat from the ground at bird feeders, making scattered seed an excellent choice of food for them. In shopping centers, grackles can be regularly seen foraging for bugs, especially after a <b>lawn</b> <b>trimming.</b>|$|R
60|$|I sought odd jobs. I worked days, and half-days, at {{anything}} I could get. I mowed <b>lawns,</b> <b>trimmed</b> hedges, took up carpets, beat them, and laid them again. Further, I took {{the civil service}} examinations for mail carrier and passed first. But alas! there was no vacancy, and I must wait. And while I waited, and in between the odd jobs I managed to procure, I started to earn ten dollars by writing a newspaper account of a voyage I had made, in an open boat down the Yukon, of nineteen hundred miles in nineteen days. I didn't {{know the first thing}} about the newspaper game, but I was confident I'd get ten dollars for my article.|$|R
5000|$|Because Duncan {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the private branding of the products, he and his Positec staff opted for direct response marketing {{in the form of}} infomercials. The company launched its first infomercial for the battery-powered WORX GT <b>lawn</b> <b>trimmer</b> in March 2007. By the end of that year, the company had sold over 300,000 WORX GT units. During that year, the company also launched the Rockwell Tools line of power tools and accessories. In October 2009, Duncan helped Positec become a supplier of Lowe's, and, in 2010, Lowe's named Positec its [...] "Innovator of the Year." ...|$|E
5000|$|After this, Gao {{began to}} steer the company toward {{becoming}} an independent manufacturer and seller of branded products. In 2004, the company released the WORX line of lawn and garden equipment. Gao hired Paolo Andriolo, a designer based in Vicenza, Italy, to design [...] "ergonomic" [...] products for Positec. The flagship product was an electronic <b>lawn</b> <b>trimmer</b> called the WORX GT. Around {{the time of the}} WORX release, Don Gao met Tom Duncan, a former executive at the Vermont American Tool Company (a joint venture between the Emerson Electric Company and the Robert Bosch Tool Group). After quitting his job at Vermont American, Duncan acquired the rights to the [...] "Rockwell" [...] brand which hadn't been used for power tools since 1981. Gao and Duncan partnered up, with Duncan becoming the head of Positec's North American division in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Scedosporium prolificans {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{as an agent of}} opportunistic human disease since the 1990s. This species is primarily associated with subcutaneous lesions arising from injury following [...] "traumatic implantation" [...] of the agent via contaminated splinters or plant thorns. The majority of S. prolificans infections in immunologically normal people remain localized, characteristically with bone or joint involvement. Disseminated infections from S. prolificans are largely limited to people with pre-existing immune impairment. Notably, S. prolificans exhibits varying tolerance to all currently available antifungal agents. This is particularly true of strains recovered from disseminated infections, and these infections carry a high mortality. Scedosporium prolificans has also been known to cause disseminated disease secondary to myeloblastic leukemia and following lung transplant. In otherwise healthy people, it was recorded as a cause of corneal infection following a <b>lawn</b> <b>trimmer</b> mishap, and bone infection following trauma.|$|E

60|$|Harry {{soon found}} {{that this was the}} case, and it took them nearly four hours' riding before they reached Killicuddery. Here a dozen barefooted men and boys ran out at their approach, and took the horses. It was a large, straggling house, as good as that {{inhabited}} by the majority of English gentlemen, but Harry missed the well-kept <b>lawn,</b> the <b>trim</b> shrubberies, and the general air of neatness and order to which he was accustomed.|$|R
40|$|The {{basis of}} this project is to design a {{lawnmower}} that can be controlled with one’s android device. The constituents used to create this include: a lawnmower, motors, motor controller, batteries, wheels, staple components for the frame and wheels, Arduino, WiFly shield, and a wireless camera. The techniques used to create and manipulate the machine include: Soldering of the circuit designed, H-bridge, for the motor controller; Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in the Arduino Uno for speed and direction control. The overall approach is to design an H-bridge to control the motors, {{and to use the}} android phone to control the speed and direction of the motors; a wireless camera will be mounted on top of the lawnmower, and its receiver will be connected to a TV, so one could control the lawnmower indoors. Upon completion of the project, Since Edwin Budding invented the world’s first lawnmower in Gloucestershire, England in 1827, keeping one’s <b>lawn</b> <b>trimmed</b> and tidy is a laboring task for most people and often time consuming.

60|$|Borrowdean assented silently. He {{was glad}} of the respite, for {{he wanted to}} think. A few minutes' swift rush through the air, and the car pulled up before a queer, old-fashioned {{dwelling}} house {{in the middle of}} the village. A smart maid-servant came hurrying out to assist her mistress. Borrowdean was ushered into a long, low drawing-room, with open windows leading out on to a <b>trim</b> <b>lawn.</b> Beyond was a walled garden bordering the churchyard.|$|R
60|$|But so, in a word, {{and before}} the period of grief for Mr. Osborne's death had subsided, Emmy found herself in the centre of a very genteel circle indeed, the members of which could not {{conceive}} that anybody belonging to it was not very lucky. There was scarce {{one of the ladies}} that hadn't a relation a Peer, though the husband might be a drysalter in the City. Some of the ladies were very blue and well informed, reading Mrs. Somerville and frequenting the Royal Institution; others were severe and Evangelical, and held by Exeter Hall. Emmy, it must be owned, found herself entirely at a loss in the midst of their clavers, and suffered woefully on the one or two occasions on which she was compelled to accept Mrs. Frederick Bullock's hospitalities. That lady persisted in patronizing her and determined most graciously to form her. She found Amelia's milliners for her and regulated her household and her manners. She drove over constantly from Roehampton and entertained her friend with faint fashionable fiddle-faddle and feeble Court slip-slop. Jos liked to hear it, but the Major used to go off growling at the appearance of this woman, with her twopenny gentility. He went to sleep under Frederick Bullock's bald head, after dinner, at one of the banker's best parties (Fred was still anxious that the balance of the Osborne property should be transferred from Stumpy and Rowdy's to them), and whilst Amelia, who did not know Latin, or who wrote the last crack article in the Edinburgh, and did not in the least deplore, or otherwise, Mr. Peel's late extraordinary tergiversation on the fatal Catholic Relief Bill, sat dumb amongst the ladies in the grand drawing-room, looking out upon velvet <b>lawns,</b> <b>trim</b> gravel walks, and glistening hot-houses.|$|R

60|$|The {{carriage}} {{turned into}} a street arched by old elms, and flanked by the houses of the most prosperous townspeople. Some of these were of the old-fashioned, classic type, and others new examples of a national architecture seeking to find itself,--white and yellow colonial, roughcast modifications of the Shakespearian period, and nondescript mixtures of cobblestones and shingles. Each was surrounded by <b>trim</b> <b>lawns</b> and shrubbery. The church itself was set back from the street. It was of bluish stone, and half covered with Virginia creeper.|$|R
60|$|They {{walked up}} the gravelled walk under the {{chestnut}} trees, whereon the leaf buds, luscious looking, with their young green surface delicately tinged with pink, looked over ready to burst into fan-shaped fulness of glory. The well-kept paths, the orderly flower beds, and smoothly <b>trimmed</b> <b>lawns</b> looked all so simple, so obvious beside the strange problem which fate had propounded to these two young people {{walking up and down}} side by side--and with just a certain distance between them as if that problem was keeping them apart.|$|R
50|$|Early brick {{foundations}} {{are visible}} in the basement along with the timber floor boards, joists, posts and beams. Rock formed retaining walls also remain. Walls to {{the eastern end of}} the basement are rendered and have concrete slab floor. To the east of the Town Hall is an asphalt carpark where a 1938-39 garage is located. The double garage with gabled roof clad in pre- painted corrugated metal sheeting is contemporary and sympathetic to the Town Hall addition. It has a masonry facade to Caledonian Hill with other walls timber framed and clad in fibrous cement sheet, all with a painted finish. Mown <b>lawns</b> and <b>trimmed</b> hedges address the fiveways intersection which is separated from the building by wrought iron picket fencing and a stand of palm trees. The setting to Caledonian Hill is more utilitarian with a wide paved footpath abutting the building at the boundary line.|$|R
60|$|The {{open window}} looked out upon a sloping <b>lawn,</b> well <b>trimmed</b> and pleasant, with fuzzy rosebushes and a star-shaped bed of sweet-william. It was bounded by a low wooden fence, which {{screened}} it {{off from a}} broad, modern, new metaled road. At {{the other side of}} this road were three large detached deep-bodied villas with peaky eaves and small wooden balconies, each standing in its own little square of grass and of flowers. All three were equally new, but numbers one and two were curtained and sedate, with a human, sociable look to them; while number three, with yawning door and unkempt garden, had apparently only just received its furniture and made itself ready for its occupants. A four-wheeler had driven up to the gate, and it was at this that the old ladies, peeping out bird-like from behind their curtains, directed an eager and questioning gaze.|$|R
