5|$|Bruce's chosen {{life as an}} explorer, his {{unreliable}} {{sources of}} income and his frequent extended absences, all placed severe strains on the marriage, and the couple became estranged around 1916. However, they continued to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> house until Bruce's death. Eillium became a Merchant Navy officer, eventually captaining a Fisheries Research Ship which, by chance, bore the name Scotia.|$|E

5|$|In April 1903, she was {{introduced}} to a Blue Cuirassier Guards officer Nikolai Kulikovsky by her brother Michael during a royal military review at Pavlovsk Palace. Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other, and exchanged letters regularly. The same year, {{at the age of}} 22, she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years. Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an aide-de-camp, and allowed him to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya Street. The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public, but gossip about their romance spread through society.|$|E

5|$|On April 2, 1955, deHavilland married Pierre Galante, an {{executive}} {{editor for the}} French journal Paris Match. Her marriage to Galante prompted her relocation to Paris. The couple separated in 1962, but continued to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> house for another six years to raise their daughter together. Galante moved {{across the street and}} the two remained close, even after the finalization of the divorce in 1979. She looked after him during his final bout with lung cancer prior to his death in 1998. They had one child, Gisèle Galante, who was born on July 18, 1956.

5|$|The {{first modern}} {{population}} census {{in the country}} was conducted in 1857, and 15 more have been performed since then. Since 1961 the censuses are conducted in regular ten-year intervals, with the latest one in 2011. The first institution {{set up in the}} country specifically for the purposes of maintaining population statistics was the State Statistical Office, founded in 1875. Since its founding, the office changed its name and structure several times and was alternately subordinated to other institutions and independent, until the most recent changes in 1992, when the institution became the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. The 2011 census was performed on 1–28 April 2011, recording situation as of 31 March 2011. The first census results, containing the number of the population by settlement, were published on 29 June 2011, and the final comprehensive set of data was published in December 2012. The 2011 census and processing of the data gathered by the census was expected to cost 171.9million kuna (23.3million euro). The 2011 census was performed using new methodology: the permanent population was determined as the enumerated population who lived in the census area for at least 12 months prior to the census, or plans to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> area for at least 12 months after the census. This method was also retroactively applied to the 2001 census data.|$|E

25|$|UE’s {{policy on}} {{salaries}} is {{deeply rooted in}} UE’s philosophy of unionism. UE sees unionism as a movement and unions as independent organizations of workers. When union leaders <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> income bracket as rank-and-file workers, it helps them {{to stay in touch}} with the outlook and needs of workers. In UE's view, salaries for union officers and staff that are comparable to those of corporate executives tend to undermine a union’s commitment to its fundamental purpose.|$|E
25|$|Women {{entered the}} VTCC in the Fall of 1973 {{and created a}} single unit called L Squadron. By 1979, women were {{integrated}} into the line companies, though they still lived separately from the males in their units. In 1981, the residence halls became co-ed and women began to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> unit area as their male counterparts. In 1987, the first female Regimental Commanding Officer (CO) was appointed. To date, the Corps has had 4 female Regimental Commanding Officers. Today the Corps is nearly 17% female and women hold leadership positions throughout the Corps.|$|E
25|$|Early {{detection}} {{of the disease}} is important, since physical and neurological damage may be irreversible even if cured. Medications can decrease the risk of those living with people with leprosy from acquiring the disease and likely those with whom people with leprosy come into contact outside the home. However, concerns are known of resistance, cost, and disclosure of a person's infection status when doing follow-up of contacts. Therefore, the WHO recommends that people who <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> household be examined for leprosy and be treated only if symptoms are present.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are available to}} treat those infected, including permethrin, crotamiton, and lindane creams and ivermectin pills. Sexual contacts within the last month and people who <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used {{in the last three}} days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.|$|E
25|$|The nomadic phase begins around 10 {{days after}} the queen lays her eggs. This phase will last {{approximately}} 15 days to let the larvae develop. The ants move during the day, capturing insects, spiders, and small vertebrates to feed their brood. At dusk, they will form their nests or bivouac, which they change almost daily. At {{the end of the}} nomadic phase, the larvae will spin pupal cases and no longer require food. The colony can then <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bivouac site for around 20 days, foraging only on approximately two-thirds of these days. Among the army ants are some species that venture out only at night, but no adequate studies of their activities have been made.|$|E
25|$|In The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy, Christopher Lasch {{analyzes}} the widening {{gap between the}} top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to The revolt of the masses (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.|$|E

25|$|In 1797, Queen Maria Luisa {{arranged}} a marriage for Godoy, which she hoped would draw {{him from his}} mistress {{and at the same}} time obscure her own relationship with Godoy. Doña María Teresa Carolina de Borbón y Vallabriga, Farnesio y Rozas, born at Velada on March 6, 1779 (some say January 26, 1780), Charles IV's cousin and the daughter of his exiled and disgraced uncle Luis de Borbón y Farnesio, 13th Count of Chinchón, was chosen to be Godoy's wife. Although she had not met Godoy, Maria Teresa acquiesced in the marriage, which ensured the restoration of her family's fortunes. They married on 11 September or 2 October in the Escorial, Madrid. Godoy received a financial settlement as part of the marriage agreement, but his mistress continued to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> house as his wife.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, Locke {{graduated}} from Harvard University with degrees in English and philosophy, and was honored {{as a member}} of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and recipient of the prestigious Bowdoin prize. After graduation, he was the first African-American selected as a Rhodes Scholar (and the last to be selected until 1960). At that time, Rhodes selectors did not meet candidates in person, but there is evidence that at least some selectors knew he was African-American. On arriving at Oxford, Locke was denied admission to several colleges, and several Rhodes Scholars from the American South refused to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> college or attend events with Locke. He was finally admitted to Hertford College, where he studied literature, philosophy, Greek, and Latin, from 1907–1910. In 1910, he attended the University of Berlin, where he studied philosophy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, many Nochiya Assyrians {{resided in the}} city of Baghdad in the Assyrian suburb of Dora. A few hundred Nochiyaye still live in Iran in Silvaneh District as well. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s, the {{majority}} of the Nochiyaye immigrated to Europe, North America and Australia (Particularly Sydney). Some 3,500 Nochiyaye remain in Iraq, with approximately half of them living in Baghdad and the other half in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, primarily Arbil Governorate in Diana, Darbandokeh, Hawdiyan, Harir, Bidial and Shaqlawa. However, After the fall of Iraq in 2003 and the chaos which ensued, many Nochiyaye living in Baghdad have moved to the villages in Arbil Governorate. Therefore, Renewed efforts were made to re-establish some of those villages which over time were abandoned, and now villages like Harir, Cairu, and Zariwan have been repopulated. Unlike other Assyrian villages in Iraq, Nochiyaye live in close proximity with Kurds, and in many cases <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> villages.|$|E
