5|$|In 1985, {{much to the}} nation's surprise, the Hanshin Tigers {{faced the}} Seibu Lions and took their first and only victory in the Japan Series, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> efforts of star slugger Randy Bass (presently State Senator from Oklahoma), an American playing for the team.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian Baroque {{is today}} {{recognised}} as an architectural style, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work of Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 {{was the first}} book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.|$|E
5|$|Under Aleksandr I, the {{administration}} of the merchant-controlled company was transferred to the Imperial Navy, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> alarming reports by naval officers of native abuse; in 1818, the indigenous peoples of Alaska were granted civil rights equivalent to a townsman status in the Russian Empire.|$|E
50|$|A maxillopodan {{connection}} is possible. <b>Largely</b> considered <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italian researchers' insistence (see disagreements).|$|R
50|$|Attempts <b>to</b> contain <b>the</b> oil using foam-filled {{containment}} booms were <b>largely</b> unsuccessful, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> booms' fragility in high seas.|$|R
25|$|In August 2007, Secretary Paulson {{explained}} that U.S. subprime mortgage fallout remained <b>largely</b> contained <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strongest global economy in decades.|$|R
5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste is <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues premiered in the U.S. on September 8, 1996. It was a smash hit, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> producers'extensive research, {{and became}} crucial to Nickelodeon's growth. Within 18 months of its premiere, Blue's Clues was as {{well-known}} as more established children's {{shows such as}} the 30-year-old Sesame Street. It became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on commercial television. By 2002, 13.7 million viewers tuned in each week.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of Trintignant and Kinski. It {{has been reported that}} during a screening of the film in Sicily, one audience member fired a gun at the screen in anger over the film's ending.|$|E
50|$|Mealista (Mealasta) was a {{township}} in {{the west}} of the Isle of Lewis. It is currently <b>largely</b> uninhabited <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Highland Clearances, which occurred there in 1838.|$|R
25|$|The inter-governmental Pacific War Council was {{established}} in Washington on 1 April, but remained <b>largely</b> ineffectual <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming predominance of U.S. forces in the Pacific theater throughout the war.|$|R
50|$|In 1769, it {{was part}} of Whitley Forest, which has {{remained}} <b>largely</b> intact <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> varied geology and poor soil types on the downs, which are unsuitable for intensive farming.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, {{the defense}} buildup in Mobile shipyards {{resulted}} in a considerable increase in the city's white middle-class and working-class population, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massive influx of workers coming {{to work in the}} shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.|$|E
5|$|England {{dominated}} the second Test, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bowling of Briggs. Batting first, England scored 292 runs, of which Abel contributed 120. Fothergill claimed the first South African wicket, Albert Rose-Innes {{at the end}} of the first day, but only claimed two more in the match, as Briggs took fifteen wickets on the second day to help England to an innings and 202-run victory.|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, {{and recent}} history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of}} law is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E

50|$|With {{the shifts}} in climate, Washington exports of {{agriculture}} goods may fluctuate. The impacts of these fluctuations are <b>largely</b> unknown <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> complexity and unknown extent of <b>the</b> changes <b>to</b> come.|$|R
30|$|No {{breakdown}} is available, but person transport via rail in Mexico is low. The {{reliance on}} highways for transport <b>largely</b> is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor state of Mexico’s railroads, which {{only recently have}} improved under private concessions.|$|R
5|$|Pinon and Ron Perlman {{were cast}} by Alien: Resurrection {{director}} Jean-Pierre Jeunet <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> director's practice of casting recurring collaborators in unconventional, marginal roles. In Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction, Teresa Rizzo explores Alien: Resurrection hybridization theme; the dynamic between Vriess and his wheelchair share a synergy {{of flesh and}} prosthetic with Number 8 and her Alien composition.|$|E
5|$|Though {{relationships}} within the Abelisauridae are debated, Carnotaurus is consistently {{shown to be}} one of the most derived members of the family by cladistical analyses. Its nearest relative might have been either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus; this ambiguity is <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incompleteness of the Aucasaurus skull material. A recent review suggests that Carnotaurus was not closely related with either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus, and instead proposed Ilokelesia as its sister taxon.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for a {{motorway}} service station, the {{two sites}} are {{about half a}} mile apart due to the proximity of junction 8 (for the M50 motorway). The services opened with the motorway in 1962 and have undergone many developments over time, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> evolution of the motorway, which {{at the time of its}} opening ran from Birmingham to Strensham but now runs to Exeter some 100 miles southwards. It was the first service station on the M5.|$|E
50|$|Neudahn, {{which was}} built further away from the main castle group, was first {{mentioned}} in 1340 as nuwenburg zu Than. The early history of the ministeriales of Dahn is <b>largely</b> unclear <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> complex ownership and family relationships.|$|R
50|$|His efforts <b>to</b> {{strengthen}} <b>the</b> defensive {{capabilities of}} Pomerania were <b>largely</b> unsuccessful, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{resistance of the}} Estates. They rejected his demand <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> Stettin arsenal with weapons and equipment, and also refused the inspection announced at Pützerlin in November 1619.|$|R
50|$|On {{the wall}} facing Warren Avenue is {{a trio of}} 13 ft high figures sculpted by Marshall Fredericks {{representing}} science, education and mankind. The figures are <b>largely</b> hidden <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of a parking garage south of the building in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
5|$|As the Biddulphs were {{interested}} in the Arts and Crafts movement, using the manor house to give classes for villagers in crafts such as woodwork and embroidery. There were also plays and musical events for the villagers, including puppet shows for the children. Construction was paused during World War I and Barnsley died in 1926. The final part of the build was completed between 1926 and 1929 under the supervision of his brother, Sidney and his son-in-law, Norman Jewson. The built took a total of 23 years, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional methods being used, but also as no contractor was hired to manage the build.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as {{they were unable to}} avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{legacy of}} {{colonialism}} {{can be said}} {{to play a role in}} why overdevelopment has been <b>largely</b> unconsidered <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "almost exclusive focus on 'underdevelopment' and the underdeveloped world that has characterized development studies and associated disciplines for so long needs".|$|R
50|$|The mobile-cellular {{telephone}} system's expansion has slowed, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> saturation of <b>the</b> market {{which has}} reached 144 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people.|$|R
50|$|The square {{is located}} in the area which was {{released}} after Copenhagen's Bastioned Fortifications were decommissioned {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. Until then the area had remained <b>largely</b> undeveloped <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enforcement of a no-built zone outside the city walls.|$|R
5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination. Powell {{was chosen to}} replace Boyd on the ticket, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, and the race was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that he would run as an independent Democratic candidate. Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.|$|E
5|$|In 1964–65 {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in Shanina arose in the Soviet press, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publication of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to write what they knew about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of the paramilitary DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross-country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{gastroenteritis}} {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, {{with the majority}} occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by the year 2000, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are {{the second most common}} infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1940s, {{agricultural}} productivity has increased dramatically, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{increased use of}} energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides.|$|R
