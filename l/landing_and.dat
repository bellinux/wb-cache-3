Descent stages, built from either the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module, or from the Apollo Service Module, would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon. One configuration used two Service Modules and one LEM descent stage, with the LEM descent stage performing the final <b>landing,</b> <b>and</b> then being reused for ascent from the Lunar surface and trans-Earth injection. The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for <b>landing</b> <b>and</b> the third for ascent and TEI.

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>and</b> {{water are}} the two main drivers of {{agricultural}} production. Pressure on farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water resources is increasing in China due to rising food demand. Domestic trade affects China's regional farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water use by distributing resources associated with the production of goods and services. This study constructs a multiregional input-output model to simultaneously analyze China's farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water uses embodied in consumption and interregional trade. Results show a great similarity for both China's farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water endowments. Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, and Yunnan {{are the most important}} drivers of farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water consumption in China, even though they have relatively few <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water resource endowments. Significant net transfers of embodied farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water flows are identified from the central and western areas to the eastern area via interregional trade. Heilongjiang is the largest farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water supplier, in contrast to Shanghai as the largest receiver. The results help policy makers to comprehensively understand embodied farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water flows in a complex economy network. Improving resource utilization efficiency and reshaping the embodied resource trade nexus should be addressed by considering the transfer of regional responsibilities.
