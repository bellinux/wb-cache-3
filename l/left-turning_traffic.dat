2500|$|On roads with {{multiple}} lanes, turning traffic is generally expected {{to move to}} the lane closest to the direction they wish to turn. For example, traffic intending to turn right will usually move to the rightmost lane before the intersection. Likewise, <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> will move to the leftmost lane. Exceptions to this rule may exist where for example the traffic authority decides that the two rightmost lanes will be for turning right, in which case drivers may take whichever of them to turn. In certain parts of the world traffic will adapt to informal patterns that rise naturally rather than by force of authority; for example, [...] it is common for drivers to observe (and trust) the turn signals used by other drivers in order to make turns from other lanes. For example, if several vehicles on the right lane are all turning right, a vehicle may come from the next-to-right lane and turn right as well, doing so in parallel with the other right-turning vehicles.|$|E
50|$|At certain intersections, <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> may {{be given}} {{precedence}} over straight-moving traffic in a regulated (and thus legal) manner, via the use of protected turn signaling.|$|E
50|$|A jughandle {{is a type}} of ramp or {{slip road}} that changes the way traffic turns left at an {{at-grade}} intersection (in a country where traffic drives on the right). Instead of a standard left turn being made from the left lane, <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> uses a ramp {{on the right side of}} the road. In a standard forward jughandle or near-side jughandle, the ramp leaves before the intersection, and <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> turns left off it rather than the through road. Right turns are also made using the jughandle.|$|E
50|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, while the left/right traffic {{flows through the}} main intersection, the <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> crosses {{to the opposite side}} of the oncoming traffic a few hundred feet away. Doing this removes the crossing conflict. When the north/south through traffic is allowed through the main intersection, the north/south left-turn lanes are also allowed through the intersections as their paths are no longer crossing. All traffic flow is controlled by traffic signals as at a regular intersection.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, two {{advanced}} techniques have emerged {{in the operation of}} protected left-turn signals at signalized intersections in many jurisdictions. One is the use of protectecf-permitted left-turn operation, which permits <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> to turn on an unprotected basis during opposing through traffic intervals in addition to providing a protected left-turn phase. The other is operating one of an opposing pair of left-turn phases in a lagging scquencc, wherein the left-turn phase is serviced immediately after the opposing through movement rather than immediately before it...|$|R
50|$|Generally, a {{dedicated}} left-turn signal is illuminated {{at the beginning}} of the green phase of the green-yellow-red-green cycle. This is called a leading turn. This allows <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic,</b> which often consists of just a few cars, to vacate the intersection quickly before giving priority to vehicles traveling straight. This increases the throughput of <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> while reducing the number of drivers, perhaps frustrated by long waits in heavy traffic for opposing traffic to clear, attempting to make an illegal left turn on red. A dedicated left-turn signal that appears at the end of the green phase is called a lagging turn. If there is no left-turn signal, the law requires one to yield to oncoming traffic and turn when the intersection is clear and it is safe to do so. In the U.S., many older inner-city and rural areas do not have dedicated left-turn lights, while most newer suburban areas have them. Such lights tend to decrease the overall efficiency of the intersection as it becomes congested, although it makes intersections safer by reducing the risk of head-on collisions and may even speed up through traffic, but if a significant amount of traffic is turning, {{a dedicated}} turn signal helps eliminate congestion.|$|R
50|$|US 24 (Telegraph Road) west of Detroit, Michigan {{served as}} a testing ground for the Michigan left {{automobile}} maneuver. Several other channelization techniques are also used; for instance the M-153 (Ford Road) intersection includes a southbound jughandle and a cutoff for northbound <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being positioned and mounted for desired visibility for their respective traffic, some traffic lights are also aimed, louvered, or shaded to minimize misinterpretation from other lanes. For example, a Fresnel lens on an adjacent through-lane signal may be aimed to prevent <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> from anticipating its own green arrow.|$|E
50|$|The M10 is {{a federal}} highway in Russia {{connecting}} the country's two largest cities, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and continuing to the border with Finland. Other than {{in the vicinity of}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the M10 is basically a two-lane highway (one lane for each direction), with an occasional third centre lane to allow overtaking or for <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> at intersections.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, {{due to the}} {{provision}} of traffic between two directions of opposing traffic, some motorists tend to maintain an ongoing criticism of the intersection. Additionally, {{as in the case}} of the half-CFI in Accokeek, the offset <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> reenters the main traffic stream via a half-signal, requiring motorists to merge from a stop condition onto the higher-speed mainline. Motorists sometimes cite discomfort due to the speed differential, a known cause of accidents, though conflicts could be reduced through {{the provision}} of an adequate acceleration lane and merge area. The Accokeek, MD CFI also has notable inequalities in traffic flow depending upon the direction of travel.|$|R

According to one study, at the intersection with Nassau Avenue alone, drivers violated traffic laws almost four times per minute. As a result, the speed limit was lowered to 25 miles per hour from 30 mph in 2014 as part of Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision Zero plan.

40|$|Intersection {{traffic delay}} {{research}} has traditionally placed {{greater emphasis on}} the study of through and left-turning vehicles than right-turning ones, which often renders existing methods or models inapplicable to intersections with heavy pedestrian and non-motorized traffic. In the meantime, there is also a need for understanding the relations between different types of delay and how they each contribute to the total delay of the entire intersection. In order to address these issues, this paper first examines models that focus on through and <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> delays, taking into account the presence of heavy mixed traffic flows that are prevalent in developing countries, then establishes a model for calculating right-turn traffic delay and, last, proposes an approach to analyzing how much each of the three types of traffic delay contributes to the total delay of the intersection, based on the application of shift-share analysis (SSA), which has been applied extensively in the field of economics...|$|R

Both Bike box and Hook-turn yielded an identical vehicle delay, but Bike box produced less bicycle delay than Hook-turn by 2. 5 ~ 29. 9 sec/veh for undersaturated traffic conditions. For saturated traffic condition, Bike box produced less vehicle delay than Hook-turn and 6 -phase strategies, but bicycle delay was found to increase at the 700 vph of bicycle traffic compared to 6 -phase. Bicycle delay was greatly increased under Hook-turn and Bike box strategies when bicycle traffic was greater than 300 vph and 500 vph, respectively. It was also shown that bicycle delay could be significantly reduced by providing appropriate size of queueing space.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to develop guidelines for time-of-day use of permitted left-turn phasing, which can then be implemented using flashing yellow arrows (FYA). This required determining how the risk for left-turn crashes varied as traffic-flow conditions varied {{during the course of}} a representative day. This was accomplished by developing statistical models, which expressed the risk of occurrence of a left-turn crash during a given hour as a function of the left-turn demand, the opposing traffic volume, and a classification of the approach with respect to the opposing traffic speed limit, the type of left-turn protection, and whether or not opposing <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> could obstruct sight distance.

5000|$|Second, {{traffic on}} a freeway is [...] "free-flowing". All cross-traffic (and <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic)</b> is relegated to {{overpasses}} or underpasses, {{so that there}} are no traffic conflicts on the main line of the highway, which must be regulated by traffic lights, stop signs, or other traffic control devices. Achieving such free flow requires the construction of many overpasses, underpasses, and ramp systems. The advantage of grade-separated interchanges is that freeway drivers can almost always maintain their speed at junctions since they do not need to yield to vehicles crossing perpendicular to mainline traffic.|$|E
50|$|As {{the light}} turns green, the left-turning car will rapidly proceed left {{ahead of the}} {{opposing}} traffic, frequently with the signaled assent of the opposing traffic. By accepting a modest delay in going straight, the opposing traffic has saved the <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> waiting an entire light cycle to turn left, as well as saved an equivalent amount of time for all the cars that {{otherwise would have been}} stuck behind the left-turning car. In situations where there is so much oncoming, straight traffic that a left turn would not be otherwise possible during any part of the light cycle, the Pittsburgh left can allow a line of left turning traffic to proceed incrementally.|$|E
50|$|On roads with {{multiple}} lanes, turning traffic is generally expected {{to move to}} the lane closest to the direction they wish to turn.

40|$|At {{the first}} Urban Street Symposium in June 1999 the {{feasibility}} of converting urban four-lane undivided roadways to three-lane cross sections was introduced.

The focus of this paper is the factors and the operational analysis results in the guidelines. In addition, results from a University of Wisconsin extension of the guideline operational analysis are discussed. A CORridor SIMulation (CORSIM) software package sensitivity analysis approach was used in two theses to approximate the difference in the operation of similar roadways with either a four-lane undivided or three-lane cross-section.

With {{the aid of a}} video camera, data were collected at the intersection and 15 -second time span was used in each observation to overcome the drawbacks of traditional methods of traffic conflict analysis. Time to collision (TTC), a widely accepted indicator, was used to identify whether an interaction between two vehicles was a traffic conflict. By using Poisson regression, a prediction model for traffic conflicts at the intersection was developed. Based upon the model, assuming that other factors remain constant, when time headway or speed of eastbound traffic on major road, which is crossed by <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> from minor road, increases, the number of traffic conflicts at the intersection decreases. When volume of <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> on minor road or speed of left-turning vehicles on minor road increases, the number of traffic conflicts at the intersection increases if other factors remain constant. Explanations for the influence of the factors, which were represented by independent variables of the prediction model, were then analyzed in detail...|$|E

40|$|One task {{of traffic}} safety {{engineers}} is {{the identification of}} high crash loca-tions and selection of appropriate highway treatments {{to reduce the number}} of crashes.

A before-and-after study is currently being conducted using empirical Bayesian methods to estimate crash reduction factors for modern conditions on two-lane rural highways. The results of the second phase of the study are reported, which aimed to evaluate the safety ben-efits of intersection approach realignment. Furthermore, an analysis of variance model is used to identify extra benefits of comprehensive treat-ments.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes two unsolved {{problems to}} fulfill {{the gap in the}} literature: (1). What is the vehicle delay and intersection capacity considering <b>left-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> at a pre-timed signal? (2). What are the mean and variance of delay to vehicles at a vehicle-actuated signal? The first part of this research evaluates the intersection performance in terms of capacity and delay at an isolated pre-timed signal intersection. Despite of a large body of literature on pre-timed signals, few work has examined the interactions be- tween left-turn and through vehicles. Usually a protected left-turn signal phase, before (leading) or after (lagging) through signal, is applied to a signalized inter- section when the traffic demand is relatively high. A common problem for leading left-turn operation is the blockage to left-turn vehicles by through traffic, particularly at an intersection with a short left-turn bay. During the peak hour, some vehicles on the through lane {{might not be able to}} depart at the end of a cycle, resulting in an increased probability of left-turn blockage. In turn, the blocked left-turn vehicles may also delay the through traffic to enter the intersection during the following cycle. Those problems may not exist for a lagging left-turn operation, since left-turn vehicles intend to spill out of the bay under heavy traffic. In this case, the through capacity is reduced, leading to an increase of total delay. All of these factors contribute to the difficulties of estimating the delay and capacity for an isolated intersection. In order to examine this missing part of study on the signalized intersection, two probabilistic models are proposed to deal with the left-turn bay blockage and queue spillback in a heuristic manner. Numerical case studies are also provided to test the proposed models. The second part of this research studies an isolated intersection with vehicle-actuated signal. Typically an advanced detector is located at a distance prior to the intersection such that an arriving vehicle triggers a green time extension in or- der to pass through without any stop. This extended time period actuated by the vehicle is called unit extension in this study. If no vehicle actuation occurs during a unit extension, the green phase would terminate in order to clear queues in other approaches. In this way, the actuated system dynamically allocates the green time among multiple approaches according to vehicle arrivals. And the unit extension is the only control parameter in this case. We develop a model to study the vehicle delay under a general arrival distribution with a given unit extension. Our model allows optimizing the intersection performance over the unit extension. The third part of this research applies graphical methods and diffusion approximations to the traffic signal problems. We reinterpret a graphical method which is originally proposed by Newell in order to directly measure the variance of the time for the queue clearance at a signalized intersection, which remains yet to be carefully examined in practice and would be rather challenging if only using the conventional queuing techniques. Our results demonstrate that graphical method explicitly presents both the deterministic and stochastic delay. We also illustrate that the theoretical background for the graphical methods in this particular application is inherently the diffusion approximation. Furthermore, we investigate the problems of disruptions occurred during a pre-timed traffic signal cycle. By diffusion approximation, we provide quantitative estimation on the duration that the effects of disruptions would dissipate...|$|R

No factors, however, is considered for the potential change of signalized intersections capacity caused by the access point closeing to the signalized intersection. This paper presented a theoretical model to estimate the lane group capacity at signalized intersections with the consideration {{of the effects of}} access points. Two scenarios of access point locations, upstream or downstream of the signalized intersection, and impacts of six types of access traffic flow are taken into account. The proposed capacity model was validated based on VISSIM simulation. Results of extensive numerical analysis reveal the substantial impact of access point on the capacity, which has an inverse correlation with both the number of major street lanes and the distance between the intersection and access point. Moreover, among the six types of access traffic flows, the access traffic flow 1 (right-turning traffic from major street), flow 4 (<b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> from access point), and flow 5 (<b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> from major street) cause a more significant effect on lane group capacity than others.

40|$|In traffic systems where {{driving is}} on the left, right-turning {{movements}} tend {{to be difficult to}} efficiently accommodate at signal controlled junctions. A hook turn is one potential solution for this. A hook turn is where a right turn is made from the nearside lane rather than an offside lane at a four-leg signalised junction. After entering the junction, the turning vehicle waits at a nearside position in front of the side road stop line, and then proceeds toward the exit arm when the side road signal turns green The research described in this paper uses microscopic simulation modelling in an innovative way to compare the traffic performance of a hypothetical hook-turn junction with an equivalent conventional junction with opposed right turns. The simulation model evaluated traffic performance under various combinations of demand flow, turning proportions, and signal timings. It was found that hook turns reduced delays to through traffic from the same approach in nearly all cases. Overall junction performance depended on the scale of any increased delays to <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> and side road traffic resulting from the hook-turn movement. It is concluded that hook turns could be used much more widely than at present—including where driving {{is on the}} right—offering significant operational benefits in the right circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Localized {{bottlenecks}} can {{be created}} when large volumes exiting a freeway are destined to turn left at the intersecting cross street. Retiming the signal at the intersection to address the left-turn congestion may worsen congestion for the crossing arterial street. One solution to reduce delay and queuing {{is to keep the}} <b>left-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> on a collector-distributor road past the cross street and then have the traffic use a loop ramp to access the cross street. The loop ramp configuration is a viable alternative when sufficient right-of-way is available to accommodate the loop roadway. The loop design converts a stop or signal-controlled left-turn movement at the ramp terminal into a merge or yield-controlled movement on a loop ramp. Collector-distributor roads can be used in conjunction with loop ramps to provide a speed change area for vehicles traveling between the intersecting streets. Target Market The provision of loop ramps for left-turning movements should be considered at locations where high left-turn volumes exist and sufficient right-of-way exists (or can be acquired) for the construction of the ramp. Two locations where loop ramps are considered include signalized freeway service interchanges and arterial intersections with heavy left-turn volumes. Signalized Freeway Service Interchanges The accommodation of high-volume left-turn movements can significantly affect the operations of a signalized intersection. These movements can be removed from the signalized ramp terminal if a loop ramp is provided. At freeway facilities without frontage roads, providing a loop ramp allows the left-turn phase at the ramp terminal to be eliminated entirely. For more information, please refer to...|$|E

Drivers made left-turns at an uncontrolled intersection with moderately heavy oncoming traffic. Gaps between oncoming vehicles varied and increased gradually from 2 s to 10 s. Drivers made two left-turns with a vehicle honking aggressively behind (pressure condition), and two left-turns without the honking vehicle (control condition). Results showed that middle-aged drivers made more cautious turning decisions under pressure (by waiting for larger and safer gaps, p 3 ̆c. 001), but older drivers did not. Further, older driver turning paths deviated under pressure compared to the control condition (p 3 ̆c. 05), but the middle-aged group did not. Moreover, across all subjects, better executive function was significantly correlated with larger increases of accepted gap size from control to honking (p 3 ̆c. 01).

40|$|To {{deal with}} the {{conflicts}} between <b>left-turn</b> and through <b>traffic</b> streams and increase the discharge capacity, this paper addresses the pre-signal which is implemented at a signalized intersection. Such an intersection with pre-signal is termed as a tandem intersection. For the tandem intersection, phase swap sorting strategy is deemed as the most effective phasing scheme in view of some exclusive merits, such as easier compliance of drivers, and shorter sorting area. However, a major limitation of the phase swap sorting strategy is not considered in previous studies: if one or more vehicle is left at the sorting area after the signal light turns to red, {{the capacity of the}} approach would be dramatically dropped. Besides, previous signal control studies deal with a fixed timing plan that is not adaptive with the fluctuation of traffic flows. Therefore, to cope with these two gaps, this paper firstly takes an in-depth analysis of the traffic flow operations at the tandem intersection. Secondly, three groups of loop detectors are placed to obtain the real-time vehicle information for adaptive signalization. The lane selection behavior in the sorting area is considered to set the green time for intersection signals. With the objective of minimizing the vehicle delay, the signal control parameters are then optimized based on a dynamic programming method. Finally, numerical experiments show that average vehicle delay and maximum queue length can be reduced under all scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Median U-turn {{intersection}} treatment (MUTIT) {{has been}} considered an alternative measure to reduce congestion and traffic conflict at intersection areas. The MUTIT is sometimes difficult to implement in the field because it requires wide median on arterials for U-turn vehicles. The objective {{of this study is}} to introduce an unconventional U-turn treatment (UUT) for intersections which requires less median space but is also effective. The UUT has a dual-bay design with different turning radiuses for small and large vehicles. The VISSIM simulation model was developed to evaluate the operational features of the UUT. The model was calibrated using data collected from intersections in China. The capacity, delay and number of stops were evaluated and compared with the direct-left-turn (DLT) for the same intersections. The results showed that the UUT significantly improved the operations at intersection areas, especially when volume/capacity ratio is small, and ratio of <b>left-turn</b> to through <b>traffic</b> is small. With the UUT, the capacity is increased by 9. 81 % to 10. 38 %, vehicle delay is decreased by 18. 5 % to 40. 1 %, and number of stops is decreased by 23. 19 % to 36. 62 %, when volume/capacity ratio is less than 0. 50. The study also found that traffic efficiency could be further improved when the UUT is designed in conjunction with signal control. In the case, the UUT plus signalized control increases the capacity by 25 % to 26. 02 %, decreases vehicle delay by 50. 5 % to 55. 8 %, and reduces number of stops by 69. 5 %, compared with the traditional DLT...|$|R
