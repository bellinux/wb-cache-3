25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed on}} 10 January 1964, on its 125th sortie, during a low-altitude hover. During a vertical descent the aircraft experienced uncontrollable divergent wing oscillations, the port wing eventually striking {{the ground at}} an acute angle with the aircraft rolling over because of the continued <b>lift</b> <b>engine</b> thrust. The loss was attributed to loss of control because the stabilising limits of the three-axis autostabilisation system's 'puffer pipes' were exceeded in roll. Although airframe damage was relatively light, the Centre D'Essai en Vol test pilot, Jacques Pinier, did not eject and died in the crash.|$|E
25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into forward flight using vectored thrust from the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the cruise engines. By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> being shut down and covered by hinged doors.|$|R

2500|$|The Trident was a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted wing with a quarter-chord sweepback of 35 degrees. It {{had three}} rear-mounted engines: two in side-fuselage pods, {{and the third}} in the fuselage tailcone, aspirating through an S-shaped duct. One version, the 3B, had a fourth [...] "boost" [...] engine aspirated through a separate intake duct above the main S-duct. All versions were powered by versions of the Rolls-Royce Spey, while the boost engine was also by Rolls-Royce: the RB.162, originally intended as a <b>lift</b> <b>engine</b> for VTOL applications.|$|E

50|$|The Rolls-Royce RB.108 was a British {{jet engine}} {{designed}} in the mid-1950s by Rolls-Royce specifically {{for use as a}} VTOL <b>lift</b> <b>engine,</b> i.e., an engine intended primarily for providing upwards thrust rather than for horizontal propulsion.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 {{the company}} {{introduced}} its first ultralight aircraft design, the Birdman Atlas, {{which was based}} on the Eipper Quicksilver. Operational experience resulted in a greatly improved Atlas model for 1981. The redesigned aircraft provided more <b>lift,</b> <b>engine</b> thrust and a better rate of climb. A total of more than 500 were produced.|$|E
50|$|Basically the F119-PW-614S was a Direct <b>Lift</b> <b>engine,</b> {{whereas the}} Lockheed Martin STOVL team used {{a more complex}} and riskier alternative, known as the F119-PW-611, which {{comprised}} a remote shaft-driven lift fan powered by the main engine. However, this generated more lift thrust than possible with only direct exhaust gases. A successful design would have greater payload, and thus longer range than a simple thrust vectored turbofan.|$|E
50|$|Rybinsk Motors was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Kolesov Engine Design Bureau. Kolesov took over the organization from V.A. Dobrynin who founded it in the late 1930s or early 1940s. Under Kolesov's direction, the bureau designed turbojet engines for the Myasishchev M-50 Bounder experimental supersonic bomber, turbojets for the Tu-22 Blinder medium bomber, RD-36-35FVR <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> for the Yak-38 Forger, RD-36-51A supersonic engines for the Tu-144 SST, RD-36-51V engines for the Myasishchev M-17 Mystic, and <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> for the Yak-141 Freestyle.|$|R
50|$|During {{conventional}} flight, the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> {{would be}} inactive; shortly prior to entering vertical flight, compressed air {{provided by the}} single cruise engine {{would be used to}} accelerate the startup of the <b>lift</b> <b>engines.</b> Considerable attention was paid during development to the design of the air intake for the engines, while involved a set of 7 variable hinged grills which open in a forward-facing position to increase airflow to the lift engines; flow into the engines had to be relatively consistent and stable to avoid issues such as engine surges and vibration. Initially, the series of scuttles were fitted to the exit nozzles of the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> to maintain a low-pressure environment beneath the engines and ensure that that the turbine blades rotated in the correct direction; due to the effectiveness of the intake and engine refinements, the scuttles became unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|Propulsion was {{provided}} by a Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB.193-12 vectored thrust <b>engine</b> for both <b>lift</b> and cruise which was augmented by two Rolls-Royce vertical <b>lift</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rolls-Royce RB162 was a simply {{constructed}} and lightweight British turbojet engine produced by Rolls-Royce Limited. Developed {{in the early}} 1960s, it was specially designed {{for use as a}} <b>lift</b> <b>engine</b> for VTOL aircraft but was also used in a later variant of the Hawker Siddeley Trident airliner as an auxiliary boost engine. A smaller related variant, the RB181 remained a design project only, as did a turbofan version designated RB.175.|$|E
50|$|It was the first, {{and so far}} only, {{vertical}} takeoff jet transport ever built. The {{project was}} cancelled in April 1970, although it made its final public flight on 4 May 1970 during the ILA in Hanover. One {{of the factors that}} led to the cancellation was the large drag and weight of the <b>lift</b> <b>engine</b> pods which reduced the useful payload and range compared to conventional transport aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Like <b>lift</b> <b>engines,</b> {{the added}} LiftSystem {{components}} are dead weight during flight, but {{the advantage of}} employing the LiftSystem is that its greater lift thrust increases takeoff payload by an even larger amount.|$|R
