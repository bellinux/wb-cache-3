This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades.

5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed {{to be at least}} partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} was mounted too late to prevent the attacks on Saigon, the Australians and New Zealanders successfully disrupted the communist lines of communication, <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> freedom of manoeuvre to attack the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex, while they were also able to successfully interdict their withdrawal, causing heavy casualties. The operation was also significant {{as it was the}} first deployment of 1 ATF outside its Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR) in Phuoc Tuy, and in this it set a precedent for later operations outside the province. Meanwhile, the remaining Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy Province also successfully repelled repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien, as part of the Tet Offensive that had engulfed population centres across South Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|By 1931, Fraser had {{successfully}} passed her medical examinations and become licensed. Two years later, Fraser became a part-time lecturer {{and then in}} 1934 was promoted to full-time lecturer in the department. Around the same time, in 1933, Williams moved to the farm full-time, returning to Toronto only on weekends. In 1937, she was finally accepted into the Ontario Veterinary College and that same year, Fraser's mother died. Williams graduated in 1941 and she began practicing as a veterinarian. For the first time, the two women acquired a home together, living in Toronto. They took in a foster child, Jenny Rodd, a war refugee from England, who remained with them until the war ended. Rising homophobia during the war-years, which carried into the 1950s and 1960s led the couple to hide the intimate nature of their relationship from their ward and present an ambiguous relationship to the greater society, <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> social life to those who knew them best.|$|E
5|$|Comic strips {{have also}} dealt in subtext and innuendo, their wide {{distribution}} in newspapers <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> inclusion of controversial material. The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent strips {{in the late}} 1970s; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction, both praise and condemnation, to the present day. Comic strips aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in gay- and lesbian-targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate people about LGBT-related issues and to influence real-world politics, with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle, complex, and positive than typical education material. Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards, including the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards and GLAAD Media Awards for outstanding comic book and comic strip.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E

5|$|Gradually {{there were}} {{increased}} number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior, <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> ability to participate in society, and made life difficult for the Zoroastrians {{in the hope that}} they would convert to Islam. Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the law of the land. Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis.|$|E
5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with a sit-down {{strike at the}} Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E
5|$|Hodalj {{praised the}} Sisak OG command for {{managing}} {{to keep the}} operation a secret until it was launched, making sure it would surprise the JNA. The secrecy {{was reflected in the}} apparent last-minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to the offensive, although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to Sunja, to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossingsrelying on oral commands instead. Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> effectiveness. Hodalj concluded that the offensive exceeded needs and capabilities of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that the offensive was prepared for ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself. Regardless of the poor preparation of the offensive, the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation Whirlwind.|$|E

5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his eighth pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, in a time of 1:35.825. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen, who was nine thousands of a second slower than his championship rival and battled him for grid position throughout the session. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified third, and conceded that he was not quick enough to challenge for pole position. The two Williams drivers qualified on the third row of the grid; Button ahead of Ralf Schumacher although both drivers had mixed feelings over their performance. Both Jaguar drivers took seventh and tenth and were satisifed with their pace. Frentzen reported that his car was difficult to handle but was happy to manage an qualifying position of eighth. Villeneuve took ninth despite suffering from excessive oversteer and was unable to improve his time because he changed his car in the opposite direction. Herbert who rounded out the top ten felt he could have qualified on the fourth row despite changes to his set-up. Wurz qualified eleventh and missed on qualifying in the top ten by nearly two thousands of a second. His teammate Fisichella started from twelfth position and reported his car lost performance after the morning practice sessions. Both Arrows drivers filled the seventh row of the grid–de la Rosa was faster than Verstappen–and were affected with problems on the cars <b>limiting</b> <b>their</b> running. Trulli had car handling issues and qualified 15th. Heidfeld qualified 16th, ahead of teammate Jean Alesi. Zonta had limited qualifying time because of an engine change and managed 18th overall. The tenth row of the grid was filled by both Sauber drivers; Mika Salo in front of Pedro Diniz. Salo used the spare Sauber because his race car had alternator issues. Both of Diniz's two fastest qualifying times were disallowed because of him laying oil on the circuit in the morning practice sessions. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid with Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E
