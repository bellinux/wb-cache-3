40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to interpret the}} range of“legal interests”stipulated in article 36 of Japan's Administrative Case Litigation Act (hereafter“ act”) ．It appears that {{there has not been}} much debate on the substance of <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> under article 36 of the act partly because this article, associated with nullity declaration suit, is said {{to be one of the}} most difficult provisions for legal interpretation. While it has generally been accepted that the <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> are the same as those stipulated article 9 (paragraph 1) in relation to revocation suit, this idea does not reflect the overall provisions of the act. On the basis of rigid interpretation of the act, it would be fair to note that the person who has <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> under article 36 includes those who have got damage to their constitutional fundamental rights by administrative measures having substantial defect and those who have got serious damage to their “consequential”legal interests (normally a direct addressee of an administrative measure) ．This interpretation stands out from the comparison with the coverage of the person having <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> under article 9 of the act, which has broader possibility to include those who have legal rights or benefits to be damaged by administrative measures without a“substantial”defect and those who have got“indifferent” damage to their <b>legal</b> <b>interests.</b> Therefore, it is not appropriate to simply assume the coverage of <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> under article 36 to be the same as that stipulated in article 9 of the act. The substantive difference between revocable administrative measures and null administrative measures lies behind this interpretation. 田口信夫、高倉泰夫、森永春乃先生 定年退職記念...|$|R

25|$|Spain, too, {{wanted the}} wreck removed, and {{proposed}} in March 1903 that their government raise the Maine, but Cuba {{declined to give}} permission. Instead, Cuba—desiring to maintain {{good relations with the}} U.S. as well as Spain—itself said it would remove the wreck. Few American firms bid on the work, as the use of dynamite on the wreck was prohibited. After an initial round of bids were rejected, a contract was signed in June 1904 with both Joseph de Wyckoff (an American industrialist) and the firm R.H.F. Sewell of New Orleans, Louisiana. Because the Cuban government was worried that a mine would be found to be the cause of the wreck, its contract with the salvage firms required the wreck to be towed out to sea and sunk. The Sewell firm asked the U.S. government if it retained any <b>legal</b> <b>interest</b> in the wreck. Not only did de Wyckoff protest the Sewell firm's involvement, but the United States informed all concerned in July 1904 that it retained ownership of the Maine and would vigorously prosecute anyone interfering with the wreck. The Cuban effort was quietly canceled.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Panic of 1873, the {{electorate}} was primarily concerned with economic issues. In his first address to the General Assembly, McCreary focused on economic issues to the near exclusion of providing any leadership or direction in the area of government reforms. (In later years, McCreary's unwillingness to take a definite stand on key issues of reform would earn him the nicknames [...] "Bothsides" [...] McCreary and [...] "Oily Jeems".) In response to McCreary's address, legislators from the rural, agrarian areas of the state proposed lowering the maximum <b>legal</b> <b>interest</b> rate from ten percent to six percent. The proposed legislation drew the ire of bankers and capitalists; it was also widely panned in the press, notably by Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson. Ultimately, the Assembly compromised on a <b>legal</b> <b>interest</b> rate of eight percent. Another bill to lower the property tax rate from 45 to 40 cents per 100 dollars of taxable property encountered far less resistance and passed easily. Few bills passed during the session had statewide impact, despite McCreary's insistence that the legislature prefer general bills over bills of local impact. This fact, too, was widely criticized by the state's newspapers.|$|E

500|$|Private {{nuisance}} {{was defined}} in Bamford v Turnley, where George Wilshere, 1st Baron Bramwell defined it as [...] "any continuous activity or {{state of affairs}} causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with a [...] land or his use or enjoyment of that land". Private nuisance, unlike public nuisance, is only a tort, and damages for personal injuries are not recoverable. Only {{those who have a}} <b>legal</b> <b>interest</b> in the affected land can sue; an exception was made in Khorasandjian v Bush, where the Court of Appeal held that a woman living in her mother's house was entitled to an injunction to prevent telephone harassment despite having no <b>legal</b> <b>interest</b> in the property. In Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, however, the House of Lords rejected this development, arguing that to remove the need for an interest in the affected property would transform the tort of nuisance from a tort to land into a tort to the person. The liable party under private nuisance is the creator, even if he is no longer in occupation of the land or created a nuisance on somebody else's land. In Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan, it was held that the defendant was liable for a nuisance (a set of water pipes) even though he had not created it, because he had used the pipes and thereby [...] "adopted" [...] the nuisance.|$|E

Though a Carey spokesperson maintained the copyright infringement allegations were false, McCord said he had turned down settlement offers from Carey's camp.

40|$|Multistorey {{buildings}} typically include stratified <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> {{which provide}} entitlements {{to a community}} of owners to lawfully possess private properties and use communal and public properties. The spatial arrangements of these <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> are often defined by multiplexing cognitively outlined spaces and physical elements of a building. In order to support 3 D digital management and communication of legal arrangements of properties, a number of spatial data models have been recently developed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) domains. While some data models, such as CityGML, IndoorGML or IFC, provide a merely physical representation of the built environment, others, e. g., LADM, mainly rely on legal data elements to support a purely legal view of multistorey buildings. More recently, spatial data models integrating legal and physical notions of multistorey buildings have been proposed to overcome issues associated with purely legal models and purely physical ones. In previous investigations, {{it has been found}} that the 3 D digital data environment of BIM has the flexibility to utilize either only physical elements or only legal spaces, or an integrated view of both legal spaces and physical elements to represent spatial arrangements of stratified <b>legal</b> <b>interests.</b> In this article, the performance of these three distinct BIM-based representations of <b>legal</b> <b>interests</b> defined inside multistorey buildings is assessed {{in the context of the}} Victorian jurisdiction of Australia.
