Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp and the Bishop of Worcester had {{a dispute}} over the <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> Beauchamp {{inherited}} from d'Abetot.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his colonization policies, Stephen restored Crown <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> had been lost {{during the civil war}} that followed Alexander the Good's rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other hand, he granted much landed property to the Church and to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His itinerant lifestyle enabled him to personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.|$|E

5|$|The migrations and {{invasions of}} the 4th and 5th centuries {{disrupted}} trade networks around the Mediterranean. African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing {{from the interior}} and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By {{the end of the}} 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Islamic Middle East was {{dominated}} by the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. The Roman-Persian Wars between the two had devastated the region, making the empires unpopular amongst local tribes. Furthermore, in the <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> would be conquered by Muslims many Christians (Nestorians, Monophysites, Jacobites and Copts) were disaffected from the Eastern Orthodox Church which deemed them heretics. Within a decade Muslims conquered Mesopotamia, Byzantine Syria, Byzantine Egypt, large parts of Persia, and established the Rashidun Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church {{rather than as a}} {{religious}} community. The church remained important in part because the parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> had once belonged to the church.|$|E

Near Golden Lake and the Golden Lake National Forest Campground, FFH16 and US Highway 2 (US2) intersect. FFH16 continues north and curves to the northwest around the end of Golden Lake.

5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some lands to the Livonian Order – portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava—although his control over these western lands was tenuous. There {{has been much}} discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255–1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order; the case for this scenario is bolstered {{by the fact that}} some of the documents mention <b>lands</b> <b>that</b> were not actually under the control of Mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals.|$|E
50|$|The Domesday Book uses {{a number}} of units of measure for areas of <b>land</b> <b>that</b> are now {{unfamiliar}} terms, such as hides and ploughlands.

By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of <b>land</b> <b>that</b> could be assessed as £1 for tax purposes. The survey records that there was 10 ploughlands at Bythorn in 1086. In addition to the arable land, there was 30 acre of meadows at Bythorn.|$|R

Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks.
