40|$|Is <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> a disappearing issue? Reading {{demographic}} literature one may get {{the impression}} that information on <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> no longer helps to explain demographic phenomena, at least in industrialized countries. The argument is that <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> differs strongly from actual living arrangements for, as an example, an increasing number of people prefer to live in a consensual union instead of getting married. The aim of this research is to answer the question whether it is still useful to analyze the populations past and possible future <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> composition. We cannot refuse to believe in the continued increase of non-traditional living arrangements that are a consequence of changing values and attitudes. This, however, does not mean that <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> analysis has become obsolete. Analysis for different industrialized countries even demonstrates the opposite. In the recent past, that is the period 1960 - 1985, changes in the marital composition became increasingly important for explaining various demographic processes. Fertility changes were more and more due to the increase in the proportion of non-married people. Similarly, household changes could more and more be attributed to changes in the marital structure of the population. Both are demonstrated by decomposition analysis. Furthermore, using <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> information for population projections results in significant differences already in the short run. Consequently, when analyzing demographic changes or projecting populations and households, demographers should even now regard <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> as one of their main input variables...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a unique}} data source on <b>marital</b> <b>status,</b> <b>partnership</b> and sexual {{orientation}} of academics and administrators at British universities, we estimate the impact of personal relationships upon earnings for men and women. While university data cover a relatively homogeneous group of workers, {{the two sides of}} the university are very different, with administrative jobs being more like the general job market in the economy. We find a large and significant married male premium, but only on the administrative side of the university. There is no female marriage premium, and no partnership return to gay men or to either heterosexual or homosexual women. sexual orientation, marriage, partnership, academic labour markets...|$|R

40|$|Does single {{motherhood}} {{adversely affect}} infant health? This {{question is not}} easy to answer because of the endogeneity of coresidence during pregnancy. In this paper, we exploit quasi-natural variation in single motherhood from the moment of conception to that of birth arising from marriageable age restrictions and the reform of the laws in Korea. The Korean birth certificate dataset is unique in that it allows us to distinguish coresidence and <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and further to identify the duration of pregnancy period without a partner. Results show that although coresidence with the partner during pregnancy is seemingly beneficial for infant health, it is mostly driven by selection into coresidence. Further, we do not find any significant advantage of legal marriage among young mothers...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{partnership}} and marriage based upon individual abilities and match-specific returns. A theoretical result is that marriage and same-sex partnership positively select more able individuals, while the effect of unmarried heterosexual partnership is ambiguous. We conduct empirical analysis with a unique new data source on <b>marital</b> <b>status,</b> <b>partnership</b> and sexual orientation of academics and administrators at British universities. We find a statistically significant male marriage premium, an insignificant positive effect of heterosexual unmarried partnership, and no partnership return to male homosexuals. This suggests that selection may play a limited role in the marriage premium. We also provide results on cohabiting versus non-cohabiting partners, and on the academic versus administrative side of universities. JEL Classification: J 12, J 16, J 30, J 45...|$|R
40|$|Demographers {{have been}} slow to {{reassess}} the value of the traditional concept of <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> Until the beginning of the 1960 s, a person's living arrangement could be predicted reasonably well by looking at the individual's <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> During the 1980 s, the situation altered dramatically. We know that unmarried couples have always existed; however, in the past they were so rare that little importance was attached to this living arrangement. It was also difficult to study the phenomenon because cohabitation was not yet a generally accepted lifestyle. That is no longer the case. Today, in many European countries many couples live together before marriage, and {{a significant portion of the}} adult population chooses cohabitation instead of marriage. It is therefore no longer possible not to consider consensual unions when studying marital-status or living arrangement structures. The book provides an authoritative and up-to-date review and interpretation of the development of the cohabitation phenomenon across Europe...|$|R

40|$|Testosterone (T) {{has been}} argued to {{modulate}} mating and parenting behavior in many species, including humans. The role of T for these behaviors has been framed as the challenge hypothesis. Following this hypothesis, T should be positively associated {{with the number of}} opposite sex partners a male has. Indeed research in humans has shown that T is positively related to the number of opposite sex partners a young man has had. Here we test, in both men and women, whether this relationship extends to the lifetime number of sex partners. We also explored whether or not T was associated with current <b>marital</b> <b>status,</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>status</b> and whether or not the participant remarried. Using a large sample of elderly men and women (each sample n > 700), we show that T is positively and sizably associated with the number of opposite sex partners in men. When controlling for potential confounding variables such as educational attainment, age, BMI, ethnicity, specific use of a medication and time of sampling this effect remained. For women, the relationship between T and number of opposite sex partners was positive but did not prove to be robust. In both men and women there was no evidence for an association between T and current <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and <b>partnership</b> <b>status</b> (being in a relationship or not). However, remarriage was positively associated with T, but only in males. Results are discussed with reference to the literature on T and sex partners, remarriage and more broadly the challenge hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether health inequalities exist between lone and cohabiting mothers across Europe, {{and how these}} may differ by welfare regime. Data from the European Social Survey are used to compare self-rated general health, limiting longstanding illness and depressive feelings {{by means of a}} multi-level logistic regression. The 27 countries included in the analyses are classified into six welfare regimes (Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Southern, Nordic, Central-Eastern new-EU and Central-Eastern non-EU). Lone motherhood is defined as mothers not cohabiting with a partner, regardless of the <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> Results indicate that lone mothers are more at risk of poor health than cohabiting mothers. This is most pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon regime for self-rated general health and limiting longstanding illness, while for depressive feelings it is most pronounced in the Bismarckian welfare regime. While the risk difference is smallest in the Central-Eastern regime, both lone and cohabiting mothers also reported the highest levels of poor health compared to the other regimes. Results also show that a vulnerable socioeconomic position is associated with ill-health in lone mothers, and that welfare regimes differ in the degree that they moderate this association...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} stereotypes of and emotional reactions to singles by choice and singles not by choice. Participants (N = 480) read a scenario describing persons, who were either single by choice or single not by choice and rated {{their thoughts and}} feelings about these persons. Singles by choice are perceived as more lonely and miserable, and as less warm and sociable, than singles not by choice. However, they are perceived as more successful and potent. Anger and sympathy mediate the relations between choosing singlehood and stereotyping levels. These findings extend {{the way in which}} the Attribution Theory explains activation of stereotypes. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used the term " socially single ", which suggests that what matters most in everyday life is whether a person is in a significant romantic relationship or not, regardless of his or her <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> (DePaulo & Morris, 2006). The goal of our study was to examine whether " socially single " people are perceived differently than coupled people, and to determine whether a choice to remain single affected the intensity of stereotypes.

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} century, Population and Development Review (PDR) {{published}} an article with the visionary title Demographic dimensions in forecasting: adding education to age and sex (Lutz et al. 1999). In this contribution the authors (W. Lutz, A. Goujon and G. Doblhammer-Reiter) systematically discuss the criteria governing the choice of particular dimensions (i. e. covariates, breakdowns or sources of heterogeneity) that should be explicitly and routinely addressed in demographic analysis. The three criteria were: (1) To the users the dimension is interesting in its own right and therefore desirable as an explicit output parameter; (2) The dimension is a relevant source of demographic heterogeneity with an impact on the dynamics of the whole system and therefore on the resulting population size; and (3) It is feasible (in terms of data and methodology) to consider the dimensions explicitly (Lutz et al. 1999 : 42). Each criterion is then applied to a series of candidates: age, sex, <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status,</b> place of residence, educational attainment, ethnicity, region of origin and others. While many of these dimensions seem to be of great substantive importance for specific research questions, only three are seen to meet all three criteria and are hence considered candidates for standard demographic analysis. Not surprisingly, age and sex are among them, while the third recommended standard dimension is the level of educational attainment [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how the {{psychological}} health of British {{men and women}} living alone in mid-life is related to partnership history and parenthood status. Although living alone in mid-life {{is known to be}} associated with poor health, and despite the substantial rise in living alone in mid-life over time, little {{attention has been paid to}} the relationship between living alone and health in mid-life.

This study stresses that partnership and parenthood trajectories into living alone in mid-life are diverse and that these life course trajectories are in turn related to health. It uses data from Understanding Society to examine how psychological health in mid-life of those living alone in the United Kingdom is related to several partnership characteristics and the presence of non-residential children. Preliminary findings show that several aspects of partnership history matter for psychological health in mid-life and that the relation between parenthood status and psychological health is gender-specific...|$|R
