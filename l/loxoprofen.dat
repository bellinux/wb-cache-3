40|$|Background 　It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that weather changes can trigger headache onset. Most people who develop headaches choose to self-medicate rather than visit {{a hospital or}} clinic. We investigated the association between weather and headache onset using large-sample sales of the headache medicine, <b>loxoprofen.</b> Methods 　We collected daily sales figures of <b>loxoprofen</b> and over-the-counter drugs over a 1 -year period from a drug store chain in western Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. To adjust for changes in daily sales of <b>loxoprofen</b> due to social environmental factors, we calculated a proportion of <b>loxoprofen</b> daily sales to over-the-counter drug daily sales. At the same time, we obtained weather date for the study region from the website of the Japan Meteorological Agency. We performed linear regression analysis to ascertain the association between weather conditions and the <b>loxoprofen</b> daily sales proportion. We also conducted a separate questionnaire survey at the same drug stores to determine the reason why people purchased <b>loxoprofen.</b> Results 　Over the study period, we surveyed the sale {{of hundreds of thousands}} of <b>loxoprofen</b> tablets. Most people purchased <b>loxoprofen</b> because they had a headache. We found that the sales proportion of <b>loxoprofen</b> increased when average barometric pressure decreased, and that precipitation, average humidity, and minimum humidity increased on <b>loxoprofen</b> purchase days compared to the previous day of purchases. Conclusions 　This study, performed using a large dataset that was easy-to-collect and representative of the general population, revealed that sales of <b>loxoprofen,</b> which can represent the onset and aggravation of headache, significantly increased with worsening weather conditions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT − Repeated oral {{administration}} of <b>loxoprofen</b> can induce many side effects such as gastric disturbances and acidosis. Therefore, we considered alternative routes of administration for <b>loxoprofen</b> {{to avoid such}} adverse effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) matrix system containing a permeation enhancer for enhanced transdermal delivery of <b>loxoprofen.</b> The EVA matrix containing <b>loxoprofen</b> was fabricated and the effects of drug con-centration, temperature, enhancer and plasticizer on drug release were studied from the loxoprofen-EVA matrix. The sol-ubility of <b>loxoprofen</b> was highest at 40 % (v/v) PEG 400. The release rate of drug from drug-EVA matrix increased with increased loading dose and temperature. The release rate was proportional to the square root of loading dose. The activation energy (Ea), which was measured from the slope of log P versus 1000 /T, was 5. 67 kcal/mol for a 2. 0 % loaded drug dose from the EVA matrix. Among the plasticizer used, diethyl phthalate showed the highest release rate of <b>loxoprofen.</b> Among the enhancers used, polyoxyethylene 2 -oleyl ether showed the greatest enhancing effect. In conclusion, for the enhanced controlled transdermal delivery of <b>loxoprofen,</b> the application of the EVA matrix containing plasticizer and penetration enhancer could be useful in the development of a controlled drug delivery system...|$|E

Since sinomenine is {{a principle}} {{component of the}} Boiogito, {{there is a possibility}} of it being effective on osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee with joint effusion. However, there is no report concerning the effectiveness of Boiogito on knee OA. The objective of the present study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of Boiogito on OA of the knee associated with joint effusion in a comparative study among randomly assigned groups. Methods Study was performed using 50 patients who were diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the knee with joint effusion. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: one group (25 patients) using both <b>loxoprofen</b> (2 -{ 4 -[(2 -oxocyclopentyl) methyl]} propanoic acid) and Boiogito and the other group (25 patients) using <b>loxoprofen,</b> and were evaluated during a 12 week observation period. The assessment parameters including knee scores in the Knee Society Rating System including Knee score and Functional scores, amount of joint effusion by joint puncture in clinically detected cases, the 36 -items short form of the Medical Outcome Study Questionnaire (SF- 36) as a measurement of health related quality of life were used. Results The knee scores based on the Knee Society Rating System were improved in both groups. The staircase climbing up and down ability in the Knee society rating system functional score was significantly improved in the group using Boiogito and <b>loxoprofen</b> compared to the <b>loxoprofen</b> group. In the evaluation using SF- 36, significant improvements were found in the scores in both groups in physical functioning after 12 weeks.

40|$|Purpose: The {{effectiveness}} of <b>Loxoprofen</b> sodium, a non-steroidal anti-in-flammatory drug (NSAID), on the nocturia {{in patients with}} benign pros-tatic hyperplasia (BPH), not responding to anticholinergics or hypnotics, as well as alpha-blockers and 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, were inves-tigated. Materials and Methods: Between October 2004 and June 2005, 150 BPH patients with 2 or more episodes of nocturia, despite treatments with anticholinergics or hypnotics, were enrolled in this study. <b>Loxoprofen,</b> 60 mg/day, was orally administered prior to sleeping for 2 weeks. The number of episodes of nocturia was assessed before and after treatment according to baseline number of episodes of nocturia, age distribution, prostate volume and previous nocturia treatment. Results: The number of nocturia episodes decreased by at least 1 in 74. 7 % (112 / 150) of patients, and decreased by 2 or more, 1 and were unchanged or increased were 48. 0, 26. 7 and 25. 3 % of patients, respectively. In baseline nocturia ≥ 6 group, the nocturia decreased by 1 or more in 85. 0 %. Treat-ment-emergent adverse events, including gastric discomfort (12 patients, 8. 0 %), weak urinary stream (5 patients, 3. 3 %) and leg edema (2 patients, 1. 3 %), occurred in 19 of the 150 (12. 7 %) patients.

Moreover, deeply undermined or huge gastric ulcers some-times develop during the long-term administration of NSAIDs, but very rarely after their short-term administration, which prompted us to report this case...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid anion {{exchange}} hollow fiber membranes (HAEHFMs) based on bromomethylated poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) (BPPO) are proposed as potential drug carriers for four anionic model drugs, including the sodium salts of benzoate (NaBS), salicylate (NaSA), meta-amino salicylate (NaMAS), and <b>loxoprofen</b> (NaLS). The {{results of the}} static loading and release experiments suggest that electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interaction are the main interaction patterns between the membrane and the drugs. And they are directly influenced by the external phase conditions and the drug physicochemical characteristics, such as structure, molecular weight, dissociation (pKa), and hydrogen bonding capability. Among the four different drugs, NaSA and NaMAS {{appear to be the}} most suitable for controlled release by the HAEHFM due to their excellent adsorption/release behaviors...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} alfuzosin {{for the treatment of}} ureteral calculi less than 10 mm in diameter after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Materials and Methods: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial was performed pro-spectively by one physician between June 2010 and August 2011. A total of 84 patients with ureteral calculi 5 to 10 mm in diameter were divided into two groups. Alfuzosin 10 mg (once daily) and <b>loxoprofen</b> sodium 68. 1 mg (as needed) were prescribed to group 1 (n= 41), and <b>loxoprofen</b> sodium 68. 1 mg (as needed) only was prescribed to group 2 (n= 44). The drug administration began immediately after ESWL and continued until stone expulsion was confirmed up to a maximum of 42 days after the procedure. Results: Thirty-nine of 41 (95. 1 %) patients in group 1 and 40 of 43 (93. 0 %) patients in group 2 ultimately passed stones (p= 0. 96). The number of ESWL sessions was 1. 34 ± 0. 65 and 1. 41 ± 0. 85 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p= 0. 33). The patients who required an-algesics after ESWL were 8 (19. 5 %) in group 1 and 13 (30. 2 %) in group 2 (p= 0. 31). Visual analogue scale pain severity scores were 5. 33 ± 1. 22 and 6. 43 ± 1. 36 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p= 0. 056). The time to stone expulsion in groups 1 and 2 was 9. 5 ± 4. 8 days and 14. 7 ± 9. 8 days, respectively (p= 0. 005). No significant adverse effects occurred. Conclusions: The use of alfuzosin in combination with ESWL seems to facilitate stone passage and to reduce the time of stone expulsion but does not affect the stone-free rate...|$|E
30|$|The {{emergency}} surgery {{is known to}} be a risk factor for poor outcomes in elderly patients [14]. The mortality at postoperative 30  days among centenarian patients undergoing {{emergency surgery}} was reportedly 25  % [4]. Since intraoperative hypotension is associated with a 30 -day mortality, phenylephrine 5 – 12  μg/min was used in the patient to avoid hypotension [15]. The authors used a total of 150  mg ropivacaine (3.3  mg/kg). The dosage is above the maximum recommended dose (3  mg/kg) [16]. The patient did not show any signs of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. <b>Loxoprofen</b> was used in the patient despite her having decreased renal function. The use of NSAIDS in fragile elderly, often hypovolemic patients with limited renal functional reserve, is not recommended [17]. We should have chosen acetaminophen instead of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the very elderly patients. The patient was successfully managed without any complications during the perioperative period.|$|E
40|$|A 85 -year-old {{woman with}} {{diabetes}} mellitus and prior myocardial infarction {{was transferred to}} the emergency room with loss of consciousness due to marked bradycardia caused by hyperkalemia. The T wave during right ventricular pacing was tall and tent-shaped while the concentration of serum potassium was high, and its amplitude during pacing was decreased after correction of the serum potassium level. Simultaneously with the correction, normal sinus rhythm was restored. The cause of hyperkalemia was considered to be several doses of <b>loxoprofen,</b> a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), prescribed for her lumbago by an orthopedic specialist, in addition to the long-term intake of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), prescribed for her hypertension by a cardiologist. This case warns physicians that the combination of NSAID and ACEI can produce serious side effects in aged patients who frequently suffer from hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and degenerative joint disease. rights:社団法人日本循環器学会rights:本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであるrelation：isVersionOf:[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} women in their thirties with past {{histories}} of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis developed a low grade fever, followed by a butterfly-shaped erythema, swelling of their fingers, and polyarthralgia. Despite such symptoms that overlap with those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the diagnostic criteria for SLE were not fulfilled. Due to positive results for human parvovirus B 19 (HPV-B 19) IgM antibodies in the serum, diagnoses of HPV-B 19 infection were made in both cases. Although acetaminophen failed to improve their deteriorating symptoms, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), <b>loxoprofen,</b> completely removed the symptoms immediately after the administration. In those cases, since the patients were predisposed to atopic disorders, an increased immunological response based on the lymphocyte hypersensitivity {{was likely to be}} involved in the pathogenesis. The immunomodulatory property of NSAID was thought to repress such lymphocyte activity and thus provided a rapid and sustained remission of the disease...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} {{a case of}} rheumatoid arthritis complicated by bucillamine-induced nephropathy satisfactorily treated with Kampo (Chinese/Japanese traditional) medicines. The patient was a 56 -year-old male, who suffered from polyarthralgia from December 1996. In February 1997, {{he was diagnosed with}} RA in another hospital and treated with <b>loxoprofen</b> sodium, bucillamine and prednisolone. He visited our hospital in May 1997, and we began to treat him with a combination of modern Western and Kampo medicines. During his clinical course, proteinuria induced by bucillamine developed. After bucillamine was discontinued, his polyarthralgia and inflammatory parameters became worse. However, Kampo formulations, Keishi-bukuryo-gan mixed with Toki-shakuyaku-san and Dai-bofu-to, were effective for reducing the activity of RA. The clinical course of this case suggests that Kampo medicines might be useful for the treatment of RA patients, especially for those who have adverse reaction to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 　ブシラミン腎症を併発した慢性関節リウマチ(RA) に対して,漢方治療が奏功した 1 例を報告した。症例は 56 歳,男性。 1996 年 12 月,多関節痛出現。 1997 年 2 月,他院にてRAの診断のもと,ロキソプロフェン,プレドニゾロン,ブシラミンにて加療を受けた。 1997 年 5 月,当科初診以来,現代西洋医学的治療に漢方治療を併用して加療にあたった。経過中,ブシラミンによる蛋白尿が出現。ブシラミンを中止したところ,多関節痛と炎症反応が悪化した。しかし,桂枝茯苓丸合当帰芍薬散および大防風湯が奏功し,RAの活動性が低下し蛋白尿も消失した。このことから,副作用によりDMARDsが使用困難なRAの治療に対して,漢方治療が有効である可能性が示唆された...|$|E
