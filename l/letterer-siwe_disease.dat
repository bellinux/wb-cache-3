The main clinical features are an age incidence from two months to two years; an indefinite onset with no specific symptomatology; a febrile course lasting {{for a few weeks}} or a few months to death; generalized enlargement of the lymph nodes, enlargement of the spleen, and often of the liver as well; a haemorrhagic tendency, commonly producing a purpuric or ecchymotic skin rash most marked shortly before death; hypochromic anaemia, sometimes severe; destructive lesions in bone, commonly in the skull, rarely, if ever, in the bones of the hands and feet, but often occurring elsewhere in the skeleton, e. g. in the ribs, pelvis, humerus, femur, and may be clinically silent or associated with pain and tender-ness, with or without overlying soft tissue swelling; sometimes mottling of the lung fields on x-ray examination; less commonly, secondary bacterial infection, such as otitis media or angina of the throat, and leucocytosis; no apparent hereditary or familial incidence.

30|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH), {{formerly known}} as “histiocytosis X” is due to an idiopathic proliferation of Langerhans cells in various tissues (bone marrow, central nervous system, lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes) causing focal or systemic disease [1, 2, 10, 11]. This disease is most common in children between 6 and 10  years of age and can occasionally be seen in young adults [1, 2, 4, 6, 10]. Langerhans cell histiocytosis comprises three clinical syndromes: (1) eosinophilic granuloma, which is limited to bone or lung; (2) Hand-Schuller-Christian disease, which presents with calvarial lesions, exophthalmos and diabetes insipidus; (3) <b>Letterer-Siwe</b> <b>disease,</b> the most aggressive form of LCH with multi-visceral organ involvement [1, 2, 10, 11]. The most frequent form of LCH is eosinophilic granuloma in which the calvarium is frequently involved [1, 2, 6]. Lesions more frequently occur in the parietal or frontal regions [2, 6]. Clinically, the lesions can be asymptomatic or present as palpable and/or tender masses [1, 2, 4, 6, 10].|$|E
40|$|Background.

40|$|Introduction: Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) {{is a rare}} uni or multisystem disorder {{associated with}} extreme production of immunoreactive Langerhans cells. Although this disorder {{has been reported in}} all age groups, spinal involvement especially thoracolumbar spine is seldom reported in toddlers. Case presentation: We present a one (1) year, four (4) months female child with a history of recurrent fever, irritability and severe anemia of one (1) month duration. CT-scan and MRI revealed a collapsed twelfth thoracic vertebra (T 12) body height greater than 95 % with a huge intradural soft tissue mass. T 12 cortectomy via posterior thoracolumbar approach was used to decompress the soft tissue part followed by interbody fusion with titanium cage filled with autologous iliac crest bone graft, fixation using plates and screws. Conclusion: We are of the view that surgical decompression of spinal LHC lesions with interbody fusion with titanium cage filled with autologous iliac crest bone graft and fixation using plates and screws is very crucial in relieving neurological deficits. However, the patient will need repeated surgeries as she advances with age in a timely manner to avert any neurological deficit that may occur.

40|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH), {{formerly known}} as histiocytosis X, refers to a spectrum of diseases characterized by idiopathic proliferation of histiocytes that produce either focal (localized LCH) or systemic manifestations (Hand–Schüller–Christian disease and <b>Letterer–Siwe</b> <b>disease).</b> Localized LCH accounts for approximately 60 – 70 % of all LCH cases.

The diagnostic imaging findings of localized LCH are also diverse and challenging. The penumbra sign is a common and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature of Brodie’s abscess, but is rarely seen in localized LCH. In this report, we describe a case of localized LCH misdiagnosed as Brodie’s abscess in a 2 -year-old child based on clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and pre-diagnostic MRI findings (penumbra sign).

In this context, we report {{a case of a}} 23 -year-old male suffering for a recurrent and progressive right parietal headache. On computed tomography (CT) it was observed an ostelytic lesion which on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appeared as an hyperintense soft mass on both T 1 and T 2 weighted images. The lesion showed a marked and heterogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration. The surgical excision was complete and the severe headache disappeared.

In the pertinent literature we have found two aggressive cases of EG showing the Ki- 67 expression with a respectively 6. 2 % (occipital bone granuloma) and 10 % (parietal bone granuloma) labeling index.

Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is very rare in LCH. We present the case of a 53 -year-old woman referred by her primary care physician for a screening colonoscopy. A single sessile polyp, measuring 4 mm in size, was found in the rectum. Histopathological examination revealed that the lesion was relatively well circumscribed and comprised mainly a mixture of polygonal cells with moderate-to-abundant pink slightly granular cytoplasm. The nuclei within these cells had frequent grooves and were occasionally folded. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD- 1 a which confirmed the diagnosis of LCH. On further workup, {{there was no evidence of}} involvement of any other organ. On follow up colonoscopy one year later, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. Review of the published literature revealed that LCH presenting as solitary colonic polyp is rare.

40|$|SUMMARY Over a 29 -year period, 43 {{cases of}} {{histiocytosis}} X presented in {{children under the}} age of 12 years. 29 patients (67 %) have survived, and of these, 15 (52 %) have a detectable disability. It was confirmed that young age at presentation and evidence of soft tissue involvement were associated with a worse prognosis. The majority of deaths were associated with pulmonary involvement. 14 patients developed diabetes insipidus. 5 of the surviving adults have heights below the 3 rd centile. Puberty usually occurred at a normal age. Follow-up studies on 12 survivors showed no evidence of residual abnormality of haematology, deficient lymphocyte function, or yeast opsonization. HLA typing showed no unusual pattern. Mild carbon monoxide diffusion defects were present in 4 patients and other abnormalities were detected on lung function tests. Histiocytosis X (<b>Letterer-Siwe</b> <b>disease,</b> Hand-Schiiller-Christian disease, and eosinophilic granuloma of bone) is an uncommon condition in childhood and any one paediatrician is likely to see few cases. A survey in the north-east of England was undertaken to follow-up cases which have presented before the age of 12 years in this area during the years 1947 - 1975 inclusive. The study was done with two objects. Firstly to determine the clinical spectrum of illness and its progression in a group with all degrees of severity, most of them occurring in the years when steroid and cytotoxic therapy was not in use, and secondly to gain some information about the children's development as they grew up, the spectrum of their residual disabil-ities, and what became of them in ybung adult life.

30|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is a rare, clonal proliferative disease {{characterized by}} infiltration of single or multiple organs by specific dendritic cells that resemble the normal epidermal Langerhans cell. LCH comprises {{a spectrum of}} disorders. Localized disease is described as eosinophilic granuloma, while multisystem forms of LCH have eponymous descriptions such as Hand-Schüller-Christian disease, <b>Letterer-Siwe</b> <b>disease,</b> and systemic histiocytosis X. The present case was a solitary osseous lesion without systemic involvement. Although LCH most commonly occurs {{in the first two}} decades of life, it may affect patients of any age, from infants to elderly individuals. Among children, it has an annual incidence of 3 - 5 cases per million. In adults, the disease is rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1 – 2 cases per million/year (Azouz et al. 2005). Bone is the most common organ affected by LCH. The most frequent sites of the osseous lesions of LCH are the skull, femur, mandible, pelvis, and spine. LCH in the spine is reported to mainly involve the vertebral bodies, occurring in 6.5 – 25  % of cases, with the most frequent site being the thoracic vertebrae (54  %) in children, and the cervical vertebrae in adults. In the present case, LCH occurred in the lumbar vertebral body in an adult spine. Well-defined osteolytic lesions can be seen on radiological studies, although osteoblastic lesions can rarely develop (Beltran et al. 1993; Kilborn et al. 2003). In children, most of the vertebral body volume is infiltrated by LCH, causing complete collapse, with a characteristic “vertebra plana” appearance. In adults, a relatively small volume of the vertebral body is affected, and LCH of the body is present without collapse. CT can show some characteristic signs such as osteolytic lesions with a sclerotic margin. MRI can show a hypointense or heterogeneous signal intensity lesion on T 1 -weighted images and a hyperintense lesion on T 2 -weighted images. In the case of our patient, plain X-ray, CT, and MRI were performed, and an osteolytic lesion of the L 1 vertebral body was identified. Although characteristic clinical and radiological features suggest the diagnosis, these features cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. Histological confirmation is always required in adults (Huang et al. 2010). Malignant tumor, osteomyelitis, aneurysmal bone cyst, Ewing’s sarcoma, osteoblastoma, Gaucher’s disease, and acute leukemia must be differentiated (Reddy et al. 2000). The diagnosis of LCH is confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for CD- 1 a and S- 100 protein (Azouz et al. 2005). Spinal LCH is self-limiting and the prognosis is usually good. A variety of treatment modalities for spinal LCH have been reported, including conservative management, intralesional steroid injection, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and curettage with or without reconstructive surgery (Puigdevall et al. 2008; Garg et al. 2003; Bertram et al. 2002). Mild, isolated involvement of the spine without neurological deficits or spinal instability can be managed with conservative methods such as simple observation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immobilization, or casting with or without initial bed rest. Although radiation therapy has the potential for secondary malignancy and vertebral growth-plate damage in the skeletally immature patient, low-dose radiation therapy appears safe and effective for adult patients with progressive spinal lesions or neurological impairment. Chemotherapy, especially modest dose of ARA-C (100  mg/m 2  daily for 5  days, repeated monthly for 6) is suggested for disseminated LCH with multiple bone lesions or multisystem disease (Cantu et al. 2012). Recent studies have been reported that administration of pegylated interferon-alpha can be helpful for treatment of LCH by inducing anti-tumoral response (Furudate et al. 2014). A large fraction of LCH cases appear to be associated with BRAF mutations and those could potentially benefit from treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (Badalian-Very et al. 2010). Surgery should be reserved for selected cases with severe mechanical instability, deformity, or neurological deficit due to compressionBecause spinal LCH is self-limiting, most authors have recommended conservative treatment for disease without neurological or mechanical complications, as in our case.|$|E
40|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH), previously {{known as}} histiocytosis X, eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schüller-Christian or <b>Letterer-Siwe</b> <b>disease,</b> {{is a rare}} disease with a reported incidence in childhood of 5. 4 cases per million children per year. The disease can present at any age but young children are most often affected. It is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal and clonal Langerhans cells in various organs such as the skin, bone, lymph nodes, lungs, liver, spleen and bone marrow. The course of the disease is unpredictable, varying from a spontaneously healing isolated bone or skin lesion, to a chronic relapsing course resulting in permanent consequences, or to a multiorgan disease that can be fatal. The overall aim with this thesis has been to clarify the long-term course and outcome of patients with LCH, to investigate methods to detect and monitor disease activity and, finally, to elucidate if the HLA system {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of LCH. Initially a follow-up study of 49 patients, with reviewed and verified pathology findings, seen at Department of Pediatrics at the Karolinska Hospital 1962 - 1989 was performed, 40 of whom underwent physical examination and laboratory tests, as well as imagining (n= 38). The 5 -yr survival of 77 % (17 / 22) in multi-system disease was significantly lower as compared to the 100 % (27 / 27) survival of children who had singlesystem disease at diagnosis (p= 0. 014). Late sequelae of the disease or its treatment had developed in 42 % of the follow-up patients, leaving only 51 % (23 / 45) of all patients alive and healthy, at a median follow- up of 16 years, with the corresponding figure being 67 % (16 / 24) for single-system and 33 % (7 / 21) for multi-system disease (p= 0. 026). The late sequlae included diabetes insipidus (15 %), severe CNS- complications (10 %, affecting 25 % of multi-system LCH patients), and late-stage pulmonary disease (11 %). The serious permanent consequences in the lungs and the CNS were further studied. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed late-stage radiographic abnormalities of the lungs (cysts and/or emphysema) in 24 % of the patients at follow-up. These patients more often had multi-system rather than single-system LCH (p= 0. 01), were significantly older at diagnosis (p< 0. 001), and had been more heavily treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. They were also more frequently smokers (p< 0. 0001) and most (70 %) had had lung involvement at diagnosis. In two adults, diagnosed with LCH in childhood, smoking preceded pulmonary involvement by three years. We conclude that LCH patients should avoid smoking tobacco and that patients with LCH should be informed about smoking-related pulmonary morbidity. In pulmonary LCH the physical examination is often unremarkable. Chest-X-ray is a valuable screening method for detection and monitoring. HRCT is more informative in monitoring the extent of the disease. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) give a better picture of the current lung function, and it is particularly valuable for monitoring alterations in pulmonary function. Prolonged monitoring of the lungs is suggested for smokers and patients with known pulmonary involvement. One of the most feared permanent consequences of LCH is severe neurological impairment. Patients with LCH-CNS were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The ability to detect metabolic changes in the CNS with PET provides additional information about the activity of the disease, and PET may also be a valuable method to assess the efficacy of therapeutic measures in LCH-CNS. Although recent studies have revealed clonality in LCH lesions and that Langerhans cells are immature with regard to phenotype as well as function, the underlying cause of this enigmatic disease remains unknown. The histopathological features of single-system and multi-system LCH are highly similar, but it is not yet known whether these manifestations have a common cause or whether each has a separate and distinct cause. In an attempt to elucidate if the HLA system {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of LCH, the largest reported pediatric cohort of ethnically homogeneous LCH patients (n= 84) was analyzed for HLA associations. We found that patients with single-system LCH more often had the phenotype HLA -DRB 1 * 03 as compared to patients with multi-system disease, suggesting an immunogenetic heterogeneity in the two clinical entities of LCH and indicating that the HLA-DRB 1 * 03 phenotype may play a protective role against developing multi-system LCH...|$|E
