25|$|<b>LC-MS</b> is {{frequently}} used in drug development {{because it allows}} quick molecular weight confirmation and structure identification. These features {{speed up the process}} of generating, testing, and validating a discovery starting from a vast array of products with potential application. <b>LC-MS</b> applications for drug development are highly automated methods used for peptide mapping, glycoprotein mapping, natural products dereplication, bioaffinity screening, in vivo drug screening, metabolic stability screening, metabolite identification, impurity identification, quantitative bioanalysis, and quality control.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of MS with LC {{systems is}} attractive because liquid chromatography can separate delicate and complex natural mixtures, which chemical composition {{needs to be}} well established (e.g., biological fluids, environmental samples, and drugs). Nowadays, <b>LC-MS</b> {{has become one of}} the most widely used chemical analysis techniques because more than 85% of natural chemical compounds are polar and thermally labile and GC-MS cannot process these samples. As an example, HPLC-MS is regarded as the leading analytical technique for proteomics and pharmaceutical laboratories. Other important applications of <b>LC-MS</b> include the analysis of food, pesticides, and plant phenols.|$|E

25|$|Liquid chromatographyâ€“mass {{spectrometry}} (<b>LC-MS)</b> is {{an analytical}} chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry (MS). Coupled chromatography - MS systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of each technique are enhanced synergistically. While liquid chromatography separates mixtures with multiple components, mass spectrometry provides structural {{identity of the}} individual components with high molecular specificity and detection sensitivity. This tandem technique {{can be used to}} analyze biochemical, organic, and inorganic compounds commonly found in complex samples of environmental and biological origin. Therefore, <b>LC-MS</b> may be applied {{in a wide range of}} sectors including biotechnology, environment monitoring, food processing, and pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and cosmetic industries.|$|E
25|$|Since it is {{accepted}} that ion suppression {{has the potential}} to affect the other analytical parameters of any assay, a prudent approach to any <b>LC-MS</b> method development should include an evaluation of ion-suppression.

25|$|The {{interface}} between a liquid phase technique (HPLC) with a continuously flowing eluate, and a gas phase technique {{carried out in}} a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of electrospray ionization changed this. Currently, the most common <b>LC-MS</b> interfaces are electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These are newer MS ion sources that facilitate {{the transition from a}} high pressure environment (HPLC) to high vacuum conditions needed at the MS analyzer. Although these interfaces are described individually, they can also be commercially available as dual ESI/APCI, ESI/APPI, or APCI/APPI ion sources. Various deposition and drying techniques were used in the past (e.g., moving belts) but the most common of these was the off-line MALDI deposition. A new approach still under development called direct-EI <b>LC-MS</b> interface, couples a nano HPLC system and an electron ionization equipped mass spectrometer.|$|E

25|$|Similar to gas {{chromatography}} MS (GC/MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS or <b>LC-MS)</b> separates compounds chromatographically {{before they are}} introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer. It differs from GC/MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of water and organic solvents, instead of gas. Most commonly, an electrospray ionization source is used in LC/MS. Other popular and commercially available LC/MS ion sources are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and atmospheric pressure photoionization. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like laser spray.|$|E
25|$|<b>LC-MS</b> {{is widely}} used {{in the field of}} {{bioanalysis}} and is specially involved in pharmacokinetic studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.|$|E
25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. <b>LC-MS,</b> since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E

25|$|The mass {{spectrum}} {{can be used}} to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample. MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10âˆ’2 to 1.33 * 10âˆ’6 pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples at higher pressure and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a vacuum system has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds and peptides. MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds. Among the many different kinds of mass analyzers, the ones that find application in <b>LC-MS</b> systems are the quadropole, time-of-flight (TOF), ion traps, and hybrid quadropole-TOF (QTOF) analyzers.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacokinetics {{is often}} studied using mass {{spectrometry}} {{because of the}} complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) {{and the need for}} high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is <b>LC-MS</b> with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however {{it is not uncommon to}} use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.|$|E

2500|$|The {{coupling}} of chromatography with MS is a {{well developed}} chemical analysis strategy dating back from the 1950s. Gas chromatography (GC) - MS was originally introduced in 1952, when A.T. James and A.J.P Martin were trying to develop tandem separation - mass analysis techniques. In GC, the analytes are eluted from the separation column as a gas and the connection with electron ionization (EI) or chemical ionization (CI) ion sources in the MS system was a technically simpler challenge. Because of this, the development of GC-MS systems was faster than <b>LC-MS</b> and such systems were first commercialized in the 1970s. The development of <b>LC-MS</b> systems took longer than GC-MS and was {{directly related to the}} development of proper interfaces. V.L. Tal'roze and collaborators started the development of <b>LC-MS</b> in the early 1970s, when they first used capillaries to connect LC columns and MS ion sources. A similar strategy was investigated by McLafferty and collaborators in 1973. This was the first and most obvious way of coupling LC with MS, and was known as the capillary inlet interface. This pioneer interface for <b>LC-MS</b> had the same analysis capabilities of GC-MS and was limited to rather volatile analytes and non-polar compounds with low molecular mass (below 400 Da). In the capillary inlet interface, the evaporation of the mobile phase inside the capillary {{was one of the main}} issues. Within the first years of development of <b>LC-MS,</b> on-line and off-line [...] alternatives were proposed as coupling alternatives. In general, off-line coupling involved fraction collection, evaporation of solvent, and transfer of analytes to the MS using probes. Off-line analyte treatment process was [...] time consuming and there was an inherent risk of sample contamination. Rapidly, it was realized that the analysis of complex mixtures would require the development of a fully automated on-line coupling solution in <b>LC-MS.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>LC-MS</b> is [...] used in {{proteomics}} as {{a method}} to detect and identify the components of a complex mixture. The bottom-up proteomics <b>LC-MS</b> approach generally involves protease digestion and denaturation using trypsin as a protease, urea to denature the tertiary structure, and iodoacetamide to modify the cysteine residues. After digestion, <b>LC-MS</b> is used for.peptide mass fingerprinting, or LC-MS/MS (tandem MS) is used to derive sequence of individual peptides. LC-MS/MS is most commonly used for proteomic analysis of complex samples where peptide masses may overlap even with a high-resolution mass spectrometry. Samples of complex biological (e.g., human serum) may be analyzed in modern LC-MS/MS systems, which can identify over 1000 proteins. However, this high level of protein identification is possible only after separating the sample by means of SDS-PAGE gel or HPLC-SCX.|$|E
2500|$|The thermospray (TSP) {{interface}} {{was developed}} in 1983 by Vestal laboratories at the University of Houston. The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a <b>LC-MS</b> interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces.The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a desolvation chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer. The LC effluent passed through the heated probe and emerged as a jet of vapor and small droplets flowing into the desolvation chamber at low pressure. The ionization of solutes occurred by direct evaporation or ion-molecule reactions induced by the solvent. This interface was able to handle up to 2 ml/min of eluate from the LC column and would efficiently introduce it into the MS vacuum system. TSP was also more suitable for <b>LC-MS</b> applications involving reversed phase liquid chromatography (RT-LC). The TSP system had a dual function acting as an interface and a solvent-mediated chemical ionization source. With time, the mechanical complexity of TSP was simplified, and this interface became popular as the first ideal <b>LC-MS</b> interface for pharmaceutical applications comprising the [...] analysis of drugs, metabolites, conjugates, nucleosides, peptides, natural products, and pesticides. The introduction of TSP marked a significant improvement for <b>LC-MS</b> systems and was the most widely applied interface {{until the beginning of}} the 1990s, when it began to be replaced by interfaces involving atmospheric pressure ionization (API).|$|E
