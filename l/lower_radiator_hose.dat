50|$|All 335 Series V8s {{shared the}} same 4.38 in bore spacing and {{cylinder}} head bolt pattern as the Windsor V8s. Beyond these shared aspects, the 335 Series engines are very different internally from the somewhat similar-looking Windsor series. The 335 series V8s use smaller 14mm spark plugs and the <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> locations differ between the Windsor and 335 engines. The Windsor engines route coolant through the intake manifold, with the hose protruding horizontally, while the 335 engines had a dry manifold with the <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> connecting vertically to the cylinder block above the cam timing chain cover. The Cleveland has a square-shaped rocker cover while the Windsor has a more rounded cover. All 335 covers are secured with eight bolts; the Windsor uses six bolts.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, for EPDM rubber {{conventionally}} {{used as a}} <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> material {{the aging}} behaviors of the skin part under the electro-chemical stresses were nondestructively evaluated. On account of the penetration of coolant liquid into the skin part the weight of rubber specimens degraded by ECD test increased, whereas their failure strain and IRHD hardness decreased largely. The penetration of coolant liquid seemed to induce some changes in inner structure and micro hardness distribution of the rubbers. Consequently, EPDM rubbers degraded by ECD could be characterized nondestructively by micro-hardness and chemical structure analysis methods...|$|R

500|$|Paving of SR84 had {{commenced}} by 1934, {{with the}} portion of the highway in Maricopa County being paved. A group of San Diego citizens raised concerns about the road from Yuma to Gila Bend not being paved in 1934, due to the impact that this would have on tourism in San Diego, and made a request to the federal government to have it paved. The entire future corridor of I-8 had been paved from Yuma to Casa Grande by 1935.

2500|$|A fighter was {{designed}} primarily for high-speed flight. A smaller wing area was optimal for achieving high speed, but low-speed flight would suffer, as the smaller wing would require more airflow to generate enough lift to maintain flight. To compensate for this, the Bf 109 included advanced high-lift devices on the wings, including automatically-opening leading edge slats, and fairly large camber-changing flaps on the trailing edge. The slats increased the lift {{of the wing}} considerably when deployed, greatly improving the horizontal maneuverability of the aircraft, as several Luftwaffe veterans, such as Erwin Leykauf, attest. Messerschmitt also included ailerons that [...] "drooped" [...] when the flaps were lowered (F series and later the <b>lower</b> <b>radiator</b> flap operated {{as part of the}} flap system), thereby increasing the effective flap area [...] When deployed, these devices effectively increased the wings' coefficient of lift.|$|R

40|$|Cooling {{system in}} the engine {{functions}} as the protector of the machine by absorbing the heat. Heat engine is produced by fuel in the cylinder. The heat is deliberately created to generate energy, but it will cause excessive heat if it is left unchecked (over heating effect). In order to prevent overheating and keep the machine temperature, then it uses radiator. How effective radiator is used {{can be seen by}} using a tool called a radiator tester. Therefore, this research was Designed a Trial Radiator (Radiator Tester) Laboratory Scale Which is Completed by Round Handler 2 ̆ 7 s Machine and Regulator Wind Blower on Diesel Engine L 300. This research was done by testing the car L 300 diesel in the field then noted rpm and air speed that blew into the radiator.

50|$|During launch {{preparations}} at Kennedy, technicians {{noticed a}} small {{section of the}} aft <b>radiator</b> retract <b>hose</b> that was bent in a shape similar to the Greek letter Omega. The hose {{is part of the}} shuttle's cooling system that carries Freon, and is designed to flex when the payload bay doors are opened and closed. Making sure they were not overlooking potential problems, NASA engineers designed a tool to guide the hose back into the storage box, and performed the procedure on 3 February 2008. Engineers would monitor the hose during STS-122, and in the unlikely event that it were to begin leaking Freon, the shuttle's computers would turn off the redundant radiator system before any Freon had a chance to leak out.|$|R
50|$|On the Escort's first outing at World Championship level, the 1993 Monte Carlo Rally, Delecour {{took the}} lead with Biasion second. The pair led the event until the final night, when a late charge by Didier Auriol, driving a Toyota Celica, saw him win, with the Fords second and third. Nevertheless, the new car had {{demonstrated}} its potential, which was underlined the following month when Malcolm Wilson, driving a car prepared by his own team, briefly led the Swedish Rally before retiring after an accident. The works team returned for the Portuguese Rally: Delecour led almost from the start and won the event with Biasion second, establishing both car and driver as serious contenders for that year's World Championship. Delecour won again in Corsica, and Biasion in Greece - his first win for three years - putting them first and second in the drivers' championship, and Ford in the joint lead in the manufacturers' title. However, {{during the second half}} of the season Toyota driver Juha Kankkunen won in Argentina, Finland and Australia, whilst with the exception of Delecour's second place (behind Colin McRae) in New Zealand the Fords' results were relatively poor, giving Toyota the manufacturers' title. Both works Escorts then retired on the San Remo Rally, Delecour after an accident and Biasion with engine failure after a <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> split, but the event was won by Italian Franco Cunico, in a privately entered Escort Cosworth. It was the first time in several years that a privateer had won at this level, and in doing so he outpaced the works Lancia Delta Integrale of reigning World Champion Carlos Sainz, demonstrating the superiority of the Escort over the previously dominant Lancia. Nevertheless, the result was a disappointment for Ford since, although Delecour won the penultimate round of the season, in Catalunya, he lost the world title to Kankkunen.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the school bus, Mann stops his car at a {{railroad}} crossing to allow a passing freight train to cross his path when—unbeknownst to him—the truck arrives behind his vehicle, stops, then immediately attempts to push his car {{into the path of}} the passing train. In response, Mann places his own vehicle in reverse as he repeatedly shouts, [...] " [...] Hey, stop!" [...] After the train passes, Mann then frantically crosses the tracks and drives up an embankment out of the path of the truck, which calmly continues to drive ahead. He then slowly drives his vehicle before observing the truck deliberately driving in an extremely slow speed in an evident effort to allow his vehicle to catch his own. In response to this observation, Mann raises his neck, and slows his own vehicle's speed.Mann then stops at a gas station to call the police and agrees to the operative's offer to both replace his <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> and fill his car with gasoline; however, when Mann steps into station's only phone booth to report the truck driver's behavior, the driver of the truck drives into the booth. Although Mann jumps clear of the booth just prior to the truck striking him, several reptile cases at the station are also struck, and he has to remove a tarantula from his trouser leg. Although he asks the sole operative at the station to phone the police, she replies: [...] "With what? That's the only phone that I've got!" [...] Immediately, Mann enters his car and speeds away as the truck resumes chasing his vehicle. Around a nearby corner, he rapidly pulls off the road, reversing to hide behind an embankment as the truck speeds past.|$|R

40|$|A {{shielded}} radiator {{is integrated}} within a solar concentrator for applications that require protection from high ambient temperatures with little convective heat transfer. This innovation uses a reflective surface to deflect ambient thermal radiation, shielding the radiator. The {{interior of the}} shield is also reflective to provide a view factor to deep space. A key feature of the shield is the parabolic shape that focuses incoming solar radiation to a line above the radiator {{along the length of}} the trough. This keeps the solar energy from adding to the radiator load. By placing solar cells along this focal line, the concentration of solar energy reduces the number and mass of required cells. By shielding the radiator, the effective reject temperature is much <b>lower,</b> allowing <b>lower</b> <b>radiator</b> temperatures. This is particularly important for lower-temperature processes, like habitat heat rejection and fuel cell operations where a high radiator temperature is not feasible. Adding the solar cells in the focal line uses the concentrating effect of the shield to advantage to accomplish two processes with a single device. This shield can be a deployable, lightweight Mylar structure for compact transport...|$|R
