Rolling {{technology}} is employed for the automated <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> {{to compensate for}} the clearance between the tailor-welded blanks which have different thicknesses. The thick blank is plastically deformed to the thin one by rolling. Two main parameters, namely, the depth of rolling and the position of rolling, have been discussed. The broadside displacement has been determined by theoretical calculations and ABAQUS simulations. Reasonable rolling technological parameters have been obtained, which provide good theoretical guidance for improving the speed and quality of laser welding...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was commissioned {{and funded by}} The Welding Institute (TWI). The Welding Institute are a global research and development facility specialising in the joining of materials for industrial applications. The purpose of this {{research was}} to develop capability in textiles joining, particularly ultrasonic and laser welding technologies, which is relatively new to TWI. The appointed researcher adopted a ‘multi-strategy’ (Cresswell 2009) approach to the research; encompassing methods that were both familiar and unfamiliar to those usually adopted by TWI employees and researchers, whom mostly come from engineering and scientific backgrounds. The research was primarily undertaken with the adoption of a ‘craft-design’ approach that uses material investigation to explore and uncover interesting leads for investigation, which was the familiar approach of the researcher coming from a background in textile design. Material studies were carried out inquisitively without the formation of a particular hypothesis and insights were discussed with industry to identify potential commercial and functional application opportunities. Following the identification of an interest in welding stretchy fabrics Speedo agreed to become the main industry partner for the research, providing materials, access to testing equipment and validation of commercial opportunities for material samples relative to their application. The main hypothesis for the research Laser melted patterns can be used to control the elastic behaviour of stretchy textiles to have a targeted and variable compressive effect on the body developed through discussion with Speedo in response to material samples produced using transmission <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> <b>equipment.</b> A predominant scientific approach was adopted during {{the second phase of the}} research to quantify and control this effect: to demonstrate repeatability and test it both on fabric and the body. Methods that were unfamiliar to the researcher prior to this research such as mechanical testing and microscopic analysis were employed. Selection of either a ‘craft design’ or ‘scientific’ approach was made pragmatically in response to the research as it developed. Through a retrospective analysis of applied methods throughout the research trajectory it has been possible to define this particular ‘multi-strategy’ project as a ‘sequential exploratory’ design (Cresswell 2009), whereby periods of subjective investigation are followed by empirical testing. The main process that has been developed by this research is a decorative method of controlling the elastic behaviour of stretchy fabrics using transmission <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> for a controlled and variable compressive effect on the body. Compression fabrics are used widely within the medical, lingerie and sportswear fields to apply pressure to the body either for an aesthetic or functional advantage. In swimwear, compression fabrics are applied to streamline the silhouette and minimise drag resistance. The technique developed by this research makes a contribution to knowledge within the field of laser processing of textiles, specifically within the field of transmission laser welding, and within the field of compression apparel. In the field of transmission laser welding a new functional capability for all-over surface patterns has been demonstrated. In the field of compression apparel a new decorative method for achieving an increasingly variable compressive effect for a smoother transition between different zones of stretch has been achieved.

40|$|How can a {{reflective}} craft practice progress {{the development of}} an emerging production technology for textiles? In an increasingly digital age of manufacture the role of the craft practitioner and particularly hand making processes has had to be reconsidered. There are those that would argue the depletion of goods made by hand simply negates the need for making skills in the development of new products; however, there is an emerging argument that places more value in the potential benefit of craft practice, and particularly making, to bridge between scientific knowledge and the needs of industry. This paper calls upon the research of Dr. Kate Goldsworthy and Helen Paine, who have utilised laser-welding equipment, to explore the benefits of a ‘craft approach’ in assisting {{the development of an}} emerging technology, for decorative and functional textile finishing applications. Goldsworthy first worked with the technology in 2008 during her doctoral research, and has used it to develop unique surface finishes for textiles that preserve material purity and can be recycled within a closed-loop system. The inventors of the technology, TWI, fund Paine’s current doctoral research, and wrote the original brief for the project that is essentially technology driven; from which Paine has chosen to investigate new aesthetic and functional opportunities for stretch textiles offered by the equipment. Despite the disparate contexts for the research of Goldsworthy and Paine, their shared background in textile design has led them both to follow a familiar practice-led approach. In this unified approach {{they have been able to}} collectively recognise the benefits of working in a hands-on way with the technology. This paper will explore techniques undertaken by both researchers during their investigations and share their insights from working with the <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> <b>equipment,</b> made available to them by TWI. More widely, the paper will demonstrate the benefit of an intuitive craft approach in the development of an emerging technology...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{continuously}} increasing {{demands on}} the efficiency of road passenger vehicles the National Highway  Safety Traffic Administration (NHTSA)   commissioned a project to determine the achievable mass savings on an average, mass produced passenger car which are obtainable with today’s or within close reach technology. The major part of this project is conducted at EDAG, Inc. One of the approaches made within this program {{is to reduce the}} weight of a vehicle’s body struc- ture by replacing the commonly on a mass production vehicle applied joining technology resistance spot welding with laser beam welding. The main advantage is the possibility to bisect the size of the flanges since laser welding requires less flange width compared to spot welding. A sample structure is remodeled twice to create one almost solely spot welded and one almost solely laser welded body structure of the same vehicle. Those body structures are represented by two FEM models. Proper representation of the joining technology is applied to both FEM models in preparation of NVH com- putation runs, ensuring the comparability of the two body structures regarding their performance. In cooperation with experienced production engineers two assembly layouts for the spot welded and the laser welded structures are developed. For those assembly layouts cost calculations are done to oppose the attained mass savings to the increase in production costs. The weight difference between the two versions is determined to a remarkable 12. 2 kg for the ana- lyzed sample structure. The laser welded structure thereby displays a slightly improved NVH perfor- mance compared to the spot welded structure. Taking the exemplary cost increase for the assembly of certain parts of the lower body structure into account gave a weight saving efficiency of 4. 58 $ per saved kg. For the field of automotive engineering this is a rather high value, mainly caused by the still very extensive costs for <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> <b>equipment.</b> With laser welding technology being more and more  adopted in mass production applications and most probably due technical improvements those costs are likely to decrease within the next few years. Even more mass savings could be achieved by adapting the design of the body structure more to the usage of laser beam welding...|$|E

In particular, the pulsed YAG laser {{is an extremely}} flexible and versatile too] capable of hermetically sealing microelectronics packages containing sensitive components without damaging them. This paper presents an overview of details that must be considered for successful use of <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> when addressing electronic package sealing.
