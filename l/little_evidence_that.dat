5|$|Up to {{at least}} the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice. As with hunting, there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a {{significant}} effect on wild populations.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid {{levels in the}} blood is controversial. There is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and {{increase the risk of}} certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).|$|E

Vanadium pentoxide {{was reported}} to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the speech had any impact on the {{decision}} {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|During this time, the Molonglo River {{flowed through}} the flood basin, {{with only a}} small {{fraction}} of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side. There was <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Fielding lacked funds, or {{that such a}} lack of funds would cause him to leave Leyden to return to writing plays; Fielding {{eventually}} returned to Leyden on 22 February 1729. It is not know when or why Fielding left the school, but he produced The Temple Beau on 26 January 1730, which suggests that he returned to London by November 1729. By {{the time of his}} return, he had three plays, either still in draft form or complete: Don Quixote in England, The Wedding-Day and The Temple Beau. Of these, only The Temple Beau was accepted for the stage.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Roman {{army of the}} Principate (30 BC – 284 AD) {{underwent}} a significant transformation {{as a result of}} the chaotic 3rd century. Unlike the army of the Principate, the army of the 4th century was heavily dependent on conscription and its soldiers were paid much less than in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army's recruits than in the army of the 1st and 2nd centuries, but there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> this adversely affected the army's performance.|$|E

5|$|There are {{records of}} two tutors {{for the young}} duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's {{literary}} education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, and there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried {{to learn to read}} Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her– unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Although Triceratops are {{commonly}} portrayed as herding animals, {{there is currently}} <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they lived in herds. While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals, to date there is only one documented bonebed dominated by Triceratops bones: a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. Another, more recent find may reveal that Triceratops lived in small family groups. In 2012, a group of three Triceratops in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found in Wyoming, near Newcastle. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit, but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from Tyrannosaurus, particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from Tyrannosaurus teeth.|$|E
5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth {{and how it was}} earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{theology}} espoused by their religious leaders, {{the people of}} Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in nearly every calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were very real and present for them. They believed {{in the presence of}} malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, but there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.|$|E
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves of the Smithsonian Institution spent 18 years {{scouring}} {{the island for}} evidence of the taxon without success. He is doubtful of its survival as it is diurnal and Jamaica is a popular destination for birdwatchers. The exact cause of the likely extinction is unknown, but predation by introduced mammals, especially the black rat but possibly also the Indian mongoose, {{is thought to be}} a factor. Graves points out that there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> habitat loss has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.|$|E

5|$|In Toulouse Roa Bastos taught Guaraní and Spanish {{literature}} at the University of Toulouse. Although {{he had been}} allowed to visit Paraguay to work with a new generation of Paraguayan writers, starting in 1970, he was again barred from entry in 1982, for purportedly engaging in subversive activities. There is however, <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he participated in sectarian politics of any kind. In France, Roa Bastos faced the second forced relocation of his life, but he also won a new readership for his work during this time. Helen Lane's English translation of Yo, el Supremo, I, The Supreme, published in 1986, was greeted with widespread acclaim in the English-speaking world. However, in France, Roa Bastos' writing focus was primarily academic, and his literary output did not match that of his time in Argentina. In 1985 Roa Bastos left his post at the University of Toulouse. Following the downfall of the oppressive Alfredo Stroessner regime in 1989, Roa Bastos returned to Paraguay at the request of its new leader Andrés Rodríguez.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 tropical storms, there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity. The first developed on June 1 in the northwest Caribbean and dissipated a few days later. Another depression developed on July 11 over Panama and also quickly dissipated. A tropical depression developed on July 17 in the northeastern Atlantic west of the Azores, and one ship reported hurricane-force winds; however, there was <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the tropical system was organized, {{so it was not}} classified as a tropical storm. Originally, there was a tropical storm in the database in the Caribbean in the middle of August, but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds. Similarly, there was a tropical storm in the database in late September, but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force winds.|$|E
5|$|There was a prehistoric burial site at {{the summit}} of Mount Pelier Hill and stones from it {{were used in the}} {{construction}} of the lodge. A nearby standing stone was also used for the lintel over the fireplace. Shortly after its completion, a great storm blew the original slate roof off. Local superstition held that this was the work of the Devil, an act of revenge for disturbing the ancient cairn. Conolly had the roof replaced with an arched stone roof constructed in a similar fashion to that of a bridge. This roof has remained intact to the present day, even though the building has been abandoned for over two centuries and despite the roof being set alight with tar barrels during the visit of Queen Victoria to Ireland in 1849. There is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the lodge was put to much use. Conolly himself died in 1729.|$|E
