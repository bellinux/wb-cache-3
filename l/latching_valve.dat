40|$|A {{miniature}} <b>latching</b> <b>valve</b> {{has been}} invented {{to satisfy a}} need for an electrically controllable on/off pneumatic valve that is lightweight and compact and remains in the most recently commanded open or closed state when power is not supplied. The valve includes a poppet that is moved into or out of contact with a seat to effect closure or opening, respectively, of the flow path. Motion of the poppet is initiated by electrical heating of one of two opposing pairs of nickel/titanium shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires above their transition temperature: heated wires contract to their remembered length, applying tension to pull the poppet toward or away from the seat. A latch consisting mainly of a bistable Belleville washer (a conical spring) made of a hardened stainless steel operates between two stable positions corresponding to the fully closed or fully open state, holding the poppet {{in one of these}} positions when power is not applied to either pair of SMA wires. To obtain maximum actuation force and displacement, the SMA wires must be kept in tension. The mounting fixtures at the ends of the wires must support large tensile stresses without creating stress concentrations that would limit the fatigue lives of the wires. An earlier design provided for each wire to be crimped in a conical opening with a conical steel ferrule that was swaged into the opening to produce a large, uniformly distributed holding force. In a subsequent design, the conical ferrule was replaced with a larger crimped cylindrical ferrule depicted in the figure. A major problem in designing the valve was to protect the SMA wires from a bake-out temperature of 300 C. The problem was solved by incorporating the SMA wires into an actuator module that is inserted into a barrel of the valve body and is held in place by miniature clip rings...|$|E

40|$|The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) {{mission is}} an {{international}} partnership between NASA and JAXA whose Core spacecraft performs cutting-edge measurements of rainfall and snowfall worldwide and unifies data gathered by a network of precipitation measurement satellites. The Core spacecraft's propulsion system is a blowdown monopropellant system with an initial hydrazine load of 545 kg in a single composite overwrapped propellant tank.

50|$|The {{operation}} of single interlock systems {{are similar to}} dry systems except that these systems require that a “preceding” fire detection event, typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector, takes place prior to the “action” of water introduction into the system’s piping by opening the pre-action valve, which is a mechanically <b>latched</b> <b>valve</b> (i.e. similar to a deluge valve). In this way, the system is essentially converted from a dry system into a wet system. The intent {{is to reduce the}} undesirable time delay of water delivery to sprinklers that is inherent in dry systems. Prior to fire detection, if the sprinkler operates, or the piping system develops a leak, loss of air pressure in the piping will activate a trouble alarm. In this case, the pre-action valve will not open due to loss of supervisory pressure, and water will not enter the piping.|$|R

40|$|CUBESATS are {{relatively}} new spacecraft platforms that are typically deployed from a launch vehicle as a secondary payload, 1 providing low-cost access to {{space for a}} wide range of end-users. These satellites are comprised of building blocks having dimensions of 10 x 10 x 10 cm cu and a mass of 1. 33 kg (a 1 -U size). While providing low-cost access to space, a major operational limitation is the lack of a propulsion system that can fit within a CubeSat and is capable of executing high delta v maneuvers. This makes it difficult to use CubeSats on missions requiring certain types of maneuvers (i. e. formation flying, spacecraft rendezvous). Recently, work has been performed investigating the use of iodine as a propellant for Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) 2 that could subsequently be used to provide a high specific impulse path to CubeSat propulsion. Iodine stores as a dense solid at very low pressures, making it acceptable as a propellant on a secondary payload. It has exceptionally high Isp (density times specific impulse), making it an enabling technology for small satellite near-term applications and providing the potential for systems-level advantages over mid-term high power electric propulsion options. Iodine flow can also be thermally regulated, subliming at relatively low temperature (less than 100 C) to yield I 2 vapor at or below 50 torr. At low power, the measured performance of an iodine-fed HET is very similar to that of a state-of-the-art xenon-fed thruster. Just as importantly, the current-voltage discharge characteristics of low power iodine-fed and xenon-fed thrusters are remarkably similar, potentially reducing development and qualifications costs by making it possible to use an already-qualified xenon-HET PPU in an iodine-fed system. Finally, a cold surface can be installed in a vacuum test chamber on which expended iodine propellant can deposit. In addition, the temperature doesn't have to be extremely cold to maintain a low vapor pressure in the vacuum chamber (it is under 10 (exp - 6) torr at - 75 C), making it possible to 'cryopump' the propellant with lower-cost recirculating refrigerant-based systems as opposed to using liquid nitrogen or low temperature gaseous helium cryopanels. In the present paper, we describe testing performed using an iodine-fed 200 W Hall thruster mounted to a thrust stand and operated in conjunction with MSFCs Small Projects Rapid Integration and Test Environment (SPRITE) Portable Hardware In the Loop (PHIL) hardware. This work is performed in support of the iodine satellite (iSAT) project, which aims to fly a 200 -W iodine-fed thruster on a 12 -U CubeSat. The SPRITE PHIL hardware allows a given vehicle to do a checkout of its avionics algorithm by allowing it to monitor and feed data to simulated sensors and effectors in a digital environment. These data are then used to determine the attitude of the vehicle and a separate computer is used to interpret the data set and visualize it using a 3 D graphical interface. The PHIL hardware allows the testing of the vehicles bus by providing 'real' hardware interfaces (in the case of this test a real RS 422 bus) and specific components can be modeled to show their interactions with the avionics algorithm (e. g. a thruster model). For the iSAT project the PHIL is used to visualize the operating cycle of the thruster and the subsequent effect this thrusting has on the attitude of the satellite over a given period of time. The test is controlled using software running on an Andrews Space Cortex 160 flight computer. This computer is the current baseline for a full iSAT mission. While the test could be conducted with a lab computer and software, the team chose to exercise the propulsion system with a representative CubeSat-class computer. For purposes of this test, the "flight" software monitored the propulsion and PPU systems, controlled operation of the thruster, and provided thruster state data to the PHIL simulation. Commands to operate the thruster were initiated from an operator's workstation outside the vacuum chamber and passed through the Cortex 160 to exercise portions of the flight avionics. Two custom-designed pieces of electronics hardware have been designed to operate the propellant feed system. One piece of hardware is an auxiliary board that controls a <b>latch</b> <b>valve,</b> proportional flow control valves (PFCVs) and valve heaters as well as measuring pressures, temperatures and PFCV feedback voltage. An onboard FPGA provides a serial link for issuing commands and manages all lower level input-output functions. The other piece of hardware is a power distribution board, which accepts a standard bus voltage input and converts this voltage into all the different current-voltage types required to operate the auxiliary board. These electronics boards are located in the vacuum chamber near the thruster, exposing this hardware to both the vacuum and plasma environments they would encounter during a mission, with these components communicating to the flight computer through an RS- 422 interface. The auxiliary board FPGA provides a 28 V MOSFET switch circuit with a 20 ms pulse to open or close the iodine propellant feed system <b>latch</b> <b>valve.</b> The FPGA provides a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal to a DC/DC boost converter to produce the 12 - 120 V needed for control of the proportional flow control valve. There are eight MOSFET-switched heating circuits in the system. Heaters are 28 V and located in the <b>latch</b> <b>valve,</b> PFCV, propellant tank and propellant feed lines. Both the <b>latch</b> <b>valve</b> and PFCV have thermistors built into them for temperature monitoring. There are also seven resistance temperature device (RTD) circuits on the auxiliary board that can be used to measure the propellant tank and feedline temperatures. The signals are conditioned and sent to an analog to digital converter (ADC), which is directly commanded and controlled by the FPGA...|$|R

40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{are emerging}} as the preferred platform {{for a wide variety}} of earth orbit and even interplanetary missions. These spacecraft are, by their very nature, extremely limited in budget, volume, mass and power. Existing fluid propulsion options are too large, costly and complex for many small satellite applications. In an attempt to address this problem VACCO has produced an inexpensive, modular system specifically designed for the special needs of small satellites. This paper documents the results of a development program conducted for NASA and administered by the Applied Physics Laboratory of John Hopkins University. The Cold Gas Propulsion System (CGPS) resulting from this effort is unique in several ways. It utilizes a simple “blow down” architecture which requires the entire system to operate at up to full storage tank pressure. The traditional pressure regulator has been eliminated. This required the development of unique thrusters capable of functioning with inlet pressures to 207 bar. To minimize power consumption, the thrusters feature <b>latching</b> <b>valves</b> that require an electrical pulse to open and another to close. Between pulses the thruster is magnetically latched in either the open or closed position as required. This dramatically reduces the power required by the thruster valves while preserving small impulse bit capability. In order to minimize mass and cost, the system uses only four thrusters. By mounting these thrusters in a double canted orientation to the spacecraft, pitch, yaw and roll control as well as delta V can be accomplished. In conclusion, the subject Cold Gas Propulsion System represents an important advance in propulsion technology suitable for small satellites. As a result of this work, the size, mass, power requirements and cost of these systems has been reduced...|$|R
40|$|Air pulsing is a {{standard}} method used at the Hanford Site for enhancing the efficiency of sieve tray columns. Air is injected into {{the base of the}} column and then vented using a <b>latching</b> solenoid <b>valve.</b> This ``shaking`` action increases the contact between the two liquid phases in the column. The existing analog speed controllers can vary the pulse rate from 0 to 100 pulses per minute. The controllers are nonlinear, and replacement with digital controllers is desired. Simulator tests, however, showed erratic results when a digital controller was used. This was traced to the scan time of the controller. The 0. 1 second scan rate of the controller, although fast enough to control at 100 pulses per minute, could not handle small setpoint changes. This was especially true at {{the high end of the}} range, and was due to the integer relationship created by the scan time. Using a controller specially modified to scan every 0. 01 second will lessen the problem. This experience has shown that resolution, as well as maximum rate, should be considered when specifying scan rates requirements for digital controllers...|$|R
40|$|The Green Propellant Loading Demonstration (GPLD) was {{conducted}} December 2015 at Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), leveraging work performed over {{recent years to}} bring lower toxicity hydrazine replacement green propellants to flight missions. The objective of this collaboration between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), WFF, the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB), and Ecological Advanced Propulsion Systems (ECAPS) was to successfully accept LMP- 103 S propellant at a U. S. Range, store the propellant, and perform a simulated flight vehicle propellant loading. NASA GSFC Propulsion (Code 597) managed {{all aspects of the}} operation, handling logistics, preparing the procedures, and implementing the demonstration. In addition to the partnership described above, Moog Inc. developed an LMP- 103 S propellant-compatible titanium rolling diaphragm flight development tank and loaned it to GSFC to act as the GPLD flight vessel. The flight development tank offered the GPLD an additional level of flight-like propellant handling process and procedures. Moog Inc. also provided a compatible <b>latching</b> isolation <b>valve</b> for remote propellant expulsion. The GPLD operation, in concert with Moog Inc. executed a flight development tank expulsion efficiency performance test using LMP- 103 S propellant. As part of the demonstration work, GSFC and WFF documented Range safety analyses and practices including all elements of shipping, storage, handling, operations, decontamination, and disposal. LMP- 103 S has not been previously handled at a U. S. Launch Range. Requisite for this activity was an LMP- 103 S Risk Analysis Report and Ground Safety Plan. GSFC and WFF safety offices jointly developed safety documentation for application into the GPLD operation. The GPLD along with the GSFC Propulsion historical hydrazine loading experiences offer direct comparison between handling green propellant versus safety intensive, highly toxic hydrazine propellant. These described motives initiated the GPLD operation in order to investigate the handling and process safety variances in project resources between LMP- 103 S and typical in-space propellants. The GPLD risk reduction operation proved successful for many reasons including handling the green propellant at a U. S. Range, loading and pressurizing a flight-like tank, expelling the propellant, measuring the tank expulsion efficiency, and most significantly, GSFC propulsion personnel's new insight into the LMP- 103 S propellant handling details...|$|R
