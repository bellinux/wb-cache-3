It consists of the following four parts : (1) preface (the {{purpose of this}} essay), (2) the concept of business organization and its structure, (3) the opinions, of the evolution's stages of business organization structure -(a) the digest of Ralph Currier Davis' and Ernest Dale's opinions, (b) the review to E. Dale's opinion, (4) an approach to the concept of the evolution's stages of business organization structure, and their characteristics in Japan. According to my opinion, there are four stages of the evolution; the first stage consisted of <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> alone, the second stage consisted of <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> and functional (or specialist staff) relationship, the third stage consisted of <b>line</b> <b>relationship,</b> and planning or controlling staff relationship, and the fourth stage consisted of the above relationships and decentralized relationship. And I think that functional and staff relationships are the symbol of modern organization structure. In Japan, <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> tings with the paternalistic features, and functional and staff relationship, the symbol of modern organization, have not developed sufficiently. As these results, I may say what the business organization structure in Japan has the excessively hierarchical <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> is the principal characteristic...|$|E

Samples are pretreated by dilution and concentration under vacuum to dissolve crystal and remove air.

40|$|High-density {{genotyping}} of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) enables {{detection of}} quantitative trait loci (QTL) by linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping using LD between markers and QTL {{and the subsequent}} use of this information for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The success of LD mapping and MAS depends {{on the extent of}} LD in the populations of interest and the use of associations across populations requires LD between loci to be consistent across populations. To assess the extent and consistency of LD in commercial broiler breeding populations, we used genotype data for 959 and 398 SNPs on chromosomes 1 and 4 on 179 – 244 individuals from each of nine commercial broiler chicken breeding lines. Results show that LD measured by r 2 extends over shorter distances than reported previously in other livestock breeding populations. The LD at short distance (within 1 cM) tended to be consistent across related populations; correlations of LD measured by r for pairs of lines ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 94 and closely matched the <b>line</b> <b>relationships</b> based on marker allele frequencies. In conclusion, LD-based correlations are good estimates of <b>line</b> <b>relationships</b> and the relationship between a pair of lines a good predictor of LD consistency between the lines...|$|R

A very good straight <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> (correlation coefficient 0. 971) was found between both parameters in the range examined (15 % to 21 % moisture), and also the goodness of fit of the regression equation was found to be quite satisfactory.

30|$|Material balance {{analysis}} {{is considered a}} powerful engineering tool when dealing with oil and gas reservoirs. In gas reservoirs which can be represented by simple volumetric tanks, a straight <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> between (P/Z) and cumulative gas production exists. However, many gas reservoirs do not follow these simple assumptions. Therefore, several modifications have been presented to handle commingled gas reservoirs (Fetkovich et al. 1990; El-Banbi and Wattenbarger 1996, 1997; Juell and Whitson 2011) and compartmentalized gas reservoirs (Hower and Collins 1989; Lord and Collins 1989, 1992; Payne 1996; Hagoort and Hoogstra 1997; Sallam 2016). Although the complications related to either commingled gas reservoirs or compartmentalized gas reservoirs have been addressed, either model alone cannot be applied when both conditions coexist.|$|E

It is a straight <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> when only NAD+ and ATP are considered. When regarding the compartmentation of this phenomenon, it appears that the linear relationship between [NAD+] and [ATP] occurs only in the cytosol.

When a magnetic field is present, the band structure changes to a split Landau level structure [28 – 30]. Figure  2 b is an illustration of the bilayer bandgap and Landau level splitting under the influence of a magnetic field. The inset shows an optical image of the bilayer graphene with the metal contact electrodes. In Fig.  2 c, we plot the resistance of the bilayer graphene, as extracted from the I-V curve, as a function of magnetic field for three different temperatures. As the magnetic field was increased in a step of 4  T, the resistance increase for each step was different, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between the resistance and magnetic field.

40|$|The {{critical}} properties {{of a simple}} prey-predator model are revisited. For some values of the control parameters, the model exhibits a line of directed percolation like transitions to a single absorbing state. For other values of the control parameters one finds a second line of continuous transitions toward infinite number of absorbing states, and the corresponding steady-state exponents are mean-field like. The critical behavior of the special point T (bicritical point), where the two transition lines meet, belongs to a different universality class. The use of dynamical Monte-Carlo method shows that a particular strategy for preparing the initial state should be devised to correctly describe the physics of the system near the second transition <b>line.</b> <b>Relationships</b> with a forest fire model with immunization are also discussed.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} for the precise grinding of crankshaft pin is presented. In which, noncircular following strategy is investigated {{based on the}} motion model consists of horizontal feeding axis, additional lifting axis for wheel frame, and the active rotary axis for workpiece. The straight <b>line</b> <b>relationship</b> of wheel center, pin center and grinding point is ensured by the synchronism between standard arc interpolation motion of wheel frame and eccentric circular motion of pin section. Comparing with traditional tangential point tracing scheme, both constant grinding line-speed and simple control algorithm are fulfilled simultaneously. The negative effect of perpendicular deviation introduced by lifting axis is kinematically analyzed {{as well as the}} dynamic response error of servo system, and solving methods are carried out accordingly. By computer simulation and experimental test, the reported noncircular following strategy emerges good characteristics in the manufacturing of crankshaft, such as a strong adaptability for wheel wearing, simple motion control and high roundness precision...|$|E
40|$|The {{article by}} Low and Low (2004) {{suggests}} one method of quantifying socio–economic inequalities in {{health at the}} local level. 1 However, the method they propose – based on the slope index of inequality – has two major flaws that are not identified in their paper and which may limit its utility. The slope index of inequality is calculated using standard regression techniques. In simple terms, simple linear regression fits a ‘line of best fit ’ {{to a group of}} data points for which information on two variables is available. The gradient of this line is then calculated and reported as the regression, or beta, coefficient. One of the key assumptions of this technique is that there is an underlying linear, or straight <b>line,</b> <b>relationship</b> between the two variables under study. Whilst it is often assumed – especially in statistical analysis – that there is a linear relation-ship between markers of health and socio-economic depriva...|$|E
40|$|Prognostic {{models that}} predict the {{clinical}} {{course of a}} breast cancer patient are important in oncology. We propose an approach to constructing such models based on fractional polynomials in which useful transformations of the continuous factors are determined. The idea may be applied with all types of regression model, including Cox regression, the method of choice for survival-time data. We analyse a prospective study of node-positive breast cancer. Seven standard prognostic factors – age, menopausal status, tumour size, tumour grade, number of positive lymph nodes, progesterone and oestrogen receptor concentrations – were investigated in 686 patients, of whom 299 had an event for recurrence-free survival and 171 died. We determine a final model with transformations of prognostic factors and compare it with the more traditional approaches using categorized variables or assuming a straight <b>line</b> <b>relationship.</b> We conclude that analysis using fractional polynomials can extract important prognostic information which the traditional approaches may miss. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
