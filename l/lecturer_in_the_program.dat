40|$|This {{case study}} {{investigated}} the implementation of an EMI program as an educational change in a Vietnamese public university. Using a needs analysis framework, this qualitative-dominant study sequentially collected data from questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and class observations from 148 students and 71 <b>lecturers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> to provide a thick description of their perceived meaning of the change. The findings revealed that EMI, based on the content and language integrated principles, was promoted as an intended means {{to improve the quality}} of <b>the</b> education system <b>in</b> general, and of language teaching and learning in particular, to meet the increasing demand of a previously closed nation toward a more open and market-oriented economy. While the students and lecturers were positive about the benefits of EMI, they were unaware of the big picture of the change and the change process. Therefore, they exhibited uncertainty and confusion about the meaning, actual practices, and outcomes of the innovation. Through the lens of change theory, the study confirmed that these phenomena were common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> change process. It also identified areas that needed to be addressed to effectively enact EMI; for example, clarification of its purposes and implementation model, teacher learning community, teacher and student support, program evaluation, and student recruitment. <b>In</b> other words, <b>the</b> EMI implementation was depicted as a transition from a Confucian-influenced education system towards a Westernised one, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of a transforming nation striving to join the rest of the world...|$|R

40|$|Indigenous Australians {{have been}} the subject of {{long-term}} disadvantage and discrimination. They are “nearly 16 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous people” (Council of Social Service of New South Wales, 2006, p. 1). Just over one third of Indigenous prisoners have completed primary education as compared to just 16 % of non-Indigenous prisoners (Rawnsley, 2003, p. 19). The majority of Indigenous people in custody have little opportunity to intervene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> offending cycle because they lack the education tools. Since 2000 our university has offered a Tertiary Entry Program (TEP) specifically designed for Australian Indigenous people who wish to gain the necessary skills for successful university study. The university has a growing Indigenous student cohort at various correctional institutions across Australia. As <b>lecturers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> we sought to look beneath the shocking statistical reality and better understand our students. This was a qualitative research study to explore the education journeys of our students in one, local correctional centre. The project investigated the lived realities of our students from early education experiences through to their current studies. We asked; “Do we know our students and where they come from and is this relevant to effective teaching?” We sought to understand how their experiences of formal educational settings impacted on their current learning. While we adapt our <b>program</b> to accommodate <b>the</b> rigours of the correctional system and to provide our students with the best possible learning experience, we questioned how we could improve what we do. This paper explores aspects of student education journeys. Our students represent a fragile, double equity group, that of Australian Indigenous men in custody...|$|R
