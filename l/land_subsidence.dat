5|$|Arlene brought strong {{thunderstorms}} and showers to much {{of eastern}} Mexico, with gale-force winds along adjacent coastlines. Upon landfall in Veracruz, Arlene produced wind speeds to 60mph (100km/h) and up to 9.11in (231.5mm) of rainfall. The winds and rain uprooted trees and caused extensive flooding, prompting at least 1,786 people throughout the state to evacuate their homes. A total of 67 landslides {{took place in the}} state; one such landslide collapsed two houses in Tlalnelhuayocan, killing one inhabitant and injuring 10others. Mudslides and rockfall also uprooted trees and damaged eight cars in Banerilla, though no injuries were linked to the incident. In Tihuatlán, a rescue worker was killed during the passage of the storm. Overall, Arlene affected 3,358residences across 50municipalities in Veracruz; about 2,000homes were damaged in El Higo. Continued downpours brought on the overflow of 28rivers, as well as the isolation of 116communities statewide. Other effects in Veracruz included considerable infrastructural failure, localized <b>land</b> <b>subsidence,</b> and three damaged schools in Coacoatzintla. The costs of road reconstructions totaled Mex$126million (US$10.2million). In response to the devastation, the government {{declared a state of emergency}} for 65percent of the state; by July5, 62municipalities remained under alert.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} {{the context of}} water privatisation in Jakarta, {{it is useful to}} know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources and on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, groundwater overexploitation and <b>land</b> <b>subsidence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Four {{important}} {{effects are}} worthy of brief mention. First, flood mitigation schemes, intended to protect infrastructure built on floodplains, have had the unintended consequence of reducing aquifer recharge associated with natural flooding. Second, prolonged depletion of groundwater in extensive aquifers can result in <b>land</b> <b>subsidence,</b> with associated infrastructure damage – as well as, third, saline intrusion. Fourth, draining acid sulphate soils, often found in low-lying coastal plains, can result in acidification and pollution of formerly freshwater and estuarine streams.|$|E
50|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of historical mean sea levels is complex. <b>Land</b> mass <b>subsidence</b> (as occurs naturally in some islands) {{can give the}} appearance of rising sea levels. Conversely, markings on land masses that are uplifted due to geological processes can suggest a lowering of mean sea level.|$|R
50|$|Withdrawal {{of large}} volumes of oil from the poorly {{consolidated}} sediments resulted in compaction of the oil reservoirs, and resultant sinking of the overlying <b>land</b> surface. <b>Subsidence</b> became apparent in 1940, and exceeded 20 feet at the center. Water injection to maintain pressure in the oil reservoirs began in 1953, which eventually stopped further subsidence.|$|R
50|$|The {{experience}} of the Noordoostpolder had shown that groundwater from the higher old mainland would flow to the lower new <b>land,</b> causing <b>subsidence</b> and dehydration in the old land. It was decided to use geohydrology to detach the new polders from the mainland. A string of peripheral lakes have been left between the two, requiring a much longer dike of 90 km to encircle the polder.|$|R
25|$|The {{premise of}} SAP 4.7 was that climate is changing. Sea {{levels in the}} Gulf of Mexico are likely to rise by two to four feet over the next 50 to 100 years from the {{combination}} of climate-induced warming and <b>land</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Tropical storms are anticipated to increase in intensity {{and the number of}} heavy precipitation events is expected to increase, raising prospects of flooding and structural damage. And the number of very hot days (i.e., >90°F) could rise by 50%.|$|E
25|$|Although {{groundwater}} {{sources are}} quite prevalent, one major {{area of concern}} is the renewal rate or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. Abstracting from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed. Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems. Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, <b>land</b> <b>subsidence,</b> degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{it became}} {{uneconomical}} to mine for the salt. Instead hot water was pumped through the mines, which dissolved the salt. The resultant brine was pumped {{out and the}} salt extracted from the brine. This technique weakened the mines and led to <b>land</b> <b>subsidence</b> as they collapsed. Subsidence affected {{the town and the}} surrounding landscape. For example, collapses in 1880 formed Witton Flash as the River Weaver flowed into a huge hole caused by subsidence. Subsidence also allegedly accounts for many old timber-framed houses in the town centre, which were better able to withstand the movement of the ground. Some houses were built on a base of steel girders that could be jacked up to level the house with each change in the underlying ground. The town's historical link with the salt industry is celebrated in its museum, which is today located in the old workhouse.|$|E
30|$|The damage {{manner and}} degrees are various due to {{geographical}} differences. In eastern China, a high groundwater region, <b>subsidence</b> <b>land</b> formed tremendous lakes and wetlands, 85  % {{of which was}} cultivated land before mining.|$|R

50|$|Station {{construction}} can {{adversely affect}} <b>land</b> stability. <b>Subsidence</b> {{has occurred in}} the Wairakei field in New Zealand. Enhanced geothermal systems can trigger earthquakes due to water injection.

The risk of geothermal drilling leading to uplift has been experienced in Staufen im Breisgau.|$|R
25|$|Texas Medical Center became {{operational}} in the 1950s. The Galveston Freeway and the International Terminal at Houston International Airport (nowadays Hobby Airport) {{were signs}} of increasing wealth in the area. Millions of dollars were spent replacing aging infrastructure. In 1951, the Texas Children's Hospital and the Shriner's Hospital were built. Existing hospitals had expansions being completed. July 1, 1952 was the date of Houston's first network television. Later on that same year, the University of Houston celebrated its 25th anniversary. Another problem Houston had back in the 1950s {{was the fact that}} it needed a new water supply. They at first relied on ground water, but that caused <b>land</b> <b>subsidence.</b> They had proposals in the Texas Congress to use the Trinity river. Hattie Mae White was elected to the school board in 1959. She was the first African-American to be elected in a major position in Houston in the 20th Century. Starting in 1950, Japanese-Americans as a whole were leaving horticulture and going into business in larger cities, such as Houston.|$|E
25|$|Subsidence {{occurs when}} {{too much water}} is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above-surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result can look like craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural {{equilibrium}} state, the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the aquitard supports some {{of the weight of}} the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. When the aquifer gets compressed, it may cause <b>land</b> <b>subsidence,</b> a drop in the ground surface. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the San Joaquin Valley experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet) due to groundwater removal. Cities on river deltas, including Venice in Italy, and Bangkok in Thailand, have experienced surface subsidence; Mexico City, built on a former lake bed, has experienced rates of subsidence of up to 40cm (1'3") per year.|$|E

40|$|In this {{fascinating}} and challenging work, the author analyses the way water for drinking is produced, distributed, owned, acquired, and consumed in contrasting ways in different settings. From the taken-for-granted, all-purpose water, flowing out of taps in advanced economies to extreme inequalities {{of access to}} water of variable qualities, drinking water tells its own interesting story, but also reflects some of the centrally important characteristics {{of the state and}} economies of the different countries. From sparkling mineral water in Germany, to drinking water garages in Taiwan, from water tankers in Mexico City to street vendors in Delhi markets, comparisons are made to stretch our understanding of what we mean by ‘an economy’, quality, and property rights, of water. In addition, the study of socio-economics of drinking water provides a route into understanding interactions between polity, economy and nature. One of the major themes of the book is to analyse the ‘sociogenic’ nature of sustainability crises of economies of water in their environmental settings: epidemics, droughts, pollution, <b>land</b> <b>subsidences</b> and floods. Overall it develops an economic sociology, neo-Polanyian approach in a comparative and historical exploration of water for domestic consumption...|$|R
5000|$|The Terrace is one {{of three}} natural {{terraces}} formed within the grounds by <b>land</b> <b>subsidences</b> of past days - the rocks and boulders of the sub-soil having been left bare.

The artificial portion of this lay-out is about a mile long and is bordered on the garden side by trees and shrubs. From this terrace the views over to the mountains beyond are unrivalled. Below, through the foreground of this landscape, wanders the River Lowther - sometimes over shallows and rapids, with deep pools intervening and crossed at intervals by stone hump-backed bridges. Between it and Hawes Water lie rolling hills whilst looking slightly left there is an uninterrupted view of miles over the park to the fells.

2500|$|Groundwater {{over-exploitation}} and <b>land</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by {{far exceeds}} groundwater recharge, {{leading to a}} falling groundwater table and <b>land</b> <b>subsidence.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>subsidence</b> was first identified when cracks were discovered in [...] the Sarinah bridge in 1978. <b>Land</b> <b>subsidence</b> is also caused {{by the weight of}} increasingly high buildings.

Critical supply shortages during the 1974 peak demand period brought into sharp community focus the need to reassess the previously existing philosophy of meeting continually increasing demand for water with extensive capital construction. An analysis of the impacts resultant from unmanaged peak demands, increased water level declines, potential <b>land</b> surface <b>subsidence,</b> projected increased operational costs and changes in water quality led staff and consultants to formulate and recommend the "Beat the Peak" program. A new philosophy on basin -wide groundwater withdrawals was implemented along with additional programs designed to evaluate the effect of our continued dependence on local groundwater sources. The results of this new management approach have been impressive. Per capita water consumption has been voluntarily reduced, total groundwater pumpage has been reduced and the potential for <b>land</b> surface <b>subsidence</b> is being actively evaluated resulting in direct benefits to Tucson Water and the customers it serves...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{challenges}} ill West Crete ill {{the last}} 4000 years {{can be described}} as a series of 11 relatively small (25 cm on the average) <b>land</b> <b>subsidences</b> alternating with short (150 - 250 year long) relatively still stands of the sea level. At 1500 B. P. an up to 9 m episodic relative land uplift and tilting of this part of the island occurred, but since then no significant coastal changes have been identified. There is strong evidence that these Late Holocene coastal changes are not a product of fluctuations of sea level, but reflect palaeoseismic events. The sequence of the latter is at variance with models of seismic deformation deduced {{from a wide range of}} observations in different tectonic environments, including coastal uplifts near major trenches: according to these models, strain buildup and release through earthquakes is described as a cyclic and rather uniform process, the earthquake cycle. In this process, the permanent seismic deformation accumulates after each earthquake to produce geological features, while the long-term deformation rate is approximately equal to the short term one. Obviously this is not the case with West Crete. The unusual pattern of seismic deformation in this island has been observed in other cases as well, but its explanation is not easy. The juxtaposition of different earthquake cycles, variations in the source and rate of stress or internal deformation of the uplifted hanging wall of a thrust in the pre-seismic period are some possible explanations for this unusual pattern of earthquake cycle in Greece...|$|R
