25|$|The Standing Commission for <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Supervision</b> is {{a federal}} {{institution}} responsible for collecting and reporting language complaints. It can give its opinion to the responsible public authorities, but its opinions are not binding. In its recommendations 26.125A, 26.033 and 23.062 (all published in 1994), the agency argued that language facilities should {{not lead to a}} generalised system of bilingualism of public services in which both languages would hold equal status. Only the regional governments can provide a supreme binding political interpretation for the language laws and the application of language facilities, which can only be annulled by the Council of State.|$|E
50|$|On 13 October 2003, the {{municipality}} of Wezembeek-Oppem summoned the Flemish Region for its decision of 13 August 2003 to nullify its decision of 21 January 2001 {{to send out}} invitation letters for the 2003 federal elections in French to those who it assumed were French-speaking. According to the Peeters directive, these had to be issued in Dutch first after which a French translation could be requested. On 19 July 2008, the Council of State referred back to its rulings of 23 December 2004 and ruled that the Peeters directive was the only correct interpretation of the language law concerning the six rim municipalities. It argued only the Flemish government was in place of interpreting the law, that {{the interpretation of the}} Peeters directive was in conformity with the general principles of the law and that no other interpretation held legal authority. The Court refuted the argument of the plaintiff that the advice of the Standing Commission for <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Supervision</b> (to stock the language preference of citizens and directly addressing them in that language, which was explicitly forbidden by the Keulen directive) should be followed, arguing the Commission had no legal authority. The Court repeated that the interpretation put forward by {{the municipality}} of Wezembeek-Oppem would in practice result in a situation of bilingualism that would be in contradiction with the priority of Dutch and the fundamental Dutch unilingualism of these municipalities.|$|E

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is combined. With no Dataset available, the Named Entities (NEs) were manually tagged which {{led us to}} the creation of training and testing dataset, under the <b>linguistic</b> <b>supervision.</b> Using hybrid approach, the proposed system is able to recognize Name of person...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{language}} has for over six hundred years been {{under influence of}} foreign languages. Nowadays, it is the English language that undoubtedly affects it in largest scale - even though both French and especially German have had a serious influence through history. In an inquiry by behalf of the Swedish Government, named Mål i mun – förslag till handlingsprogram för svenska språket (2002), one of the conclusions was that journalism is an important area {{that has to be}} under <b>linguistic</b> <b>supervision</b> to avoid a gradual weakening of the Swedish language. It is also a known fact that the Swedish sports writers has a tendency to use a lot of English words, even though there are equivalent Swedish ones applicable. This essay investigates the amount of direct English loan words in three types of Swedish sports text...|$|E
40|$|When {{people read}} {{temporarily}} ambiguous sentences, {{there is often}} an increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally,such regressions have been interpreted {{at least in part}} as reflecting readers’ efforts to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., & Rayner, K. (1982). Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology, 14, 178 – 210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic operations and that landing-sites are instead {{selected on the basis of}} low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely <b>linguistic</b> <b>supervision,</b> that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment 2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained, partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing computational models of eye-movements in reading...|$|E
