6000|$|... 'For {{the whole}} proceeding,' rejoined Ralph, abruptly. 'Now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> this matter over, and {{consider}} what I {{ought to have}} if I should help you to success.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{asserted}} Tom stoutly; [...] "I'm goin' to quit. What's done can't be undone, but I'm {{through with}} you. It--it's too blamed terrible, that's what it is! Leave me alone an' <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> honest. Why don't {{you do the}} job yourself?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "For God's sake, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{have the}} <b>turn.</b> You {{are going on}} the campaign, you ought not to have everything--and {{there may be an}} explanation, George. We may be all wrong." ...|$|R

60|$|And now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> for {{a moment}} to you,--wives and maidens, who are the souls of soldiers; to you,--mothers, who have devoted your {{children}} to the great hierarchy of war. Let me ask you to consider what part you have to take for the aid of those who love you; for if you fail in your part they cannot fulfil theirs; such absolute helpmates you are that mo man can stand without that help, nor labour in his own strength.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{time has}} been when nothing could have moved me like the loss of this great sum. Nothing. For births, deaths, marriages, and all the events which are of {{interest}} to most men, have (unless they are connected with gain or loss of money) no interest for me. But now, I swear, I mix up with the loss, his triumph in telling it. If he had brought it about,--I almost feel as if he had,--I couldn't hate him more. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> but retaliate upon him, by degrees, however slow--let me but begin to {{get the better of}} him, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> but <b>turn</b> the scale--and I can bear it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will not}} {{interfere}} with your plans, citizen," [...] rejoined Chauvelin with unwonted gentleness, [...] "but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> in my <b>turn</b> impress one thing upon you, {{and that is that}} unless you are as wary as the serpent, as cunning as the fox, all your precious plans will be upset by that interfering Englishman whom you choose to disregard." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{am tired}} of talking of our faults. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> to the more {{pleasing}} task of discussing those of the English. In the first place, and as a minor matter of form, I think that English humour suffers from the tolerance afforded to the pun. For some reason English people find puns funny. We don't. Here and there, no doubt, a pun may be made that for some exceptional reason becomes a matter of genuine wit. But the great mass of the English puns that disfigure the Press every week are mere pointless verbalisms that to the American mind cause nothing but weariness.|$|E
6000|$|And so I am {{to write}} a story--but of what, and where? Shall it be radiant with the sky of Italy? or eloquent with the beau ideal of Greece? Shall it breathe odor and languor from the orient, or chivalry from the occident? or gayety from France? or vigor from England? No, no; these are all too old--too romance-like--too {{obviously}} picturesque for me. No; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> to my own land--my own New England; the land of bright fires and strong hearts; the land of deeds, and not of words; the land of fruits, and not of flowers; the land often spoken against, yet always respected; [...] "the latchet of whose shoes {{the nations of the}} earth are not worthy to unloose." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> this {{paragraph}} into vulgar language {{for the use}} of the poor, and strictly adhere to the sense of the words. I believe it may be faithfully translated in the following manner: [...] "The bulk of the clergy, and one-third of the bishops, are stupid sons of whores, who think of nothing but getting money as soon as they can: If they may but produce enough to supply them in gluttony, drunkenness, and whoring, they are ready to turn traitors to God and their country, and make their fellow-subjects slaves." [...] The rest of the period, about threatening [...] "infamy," [...] and [...] "the curses of posterity upon such dogs and villains," [...] may stand as it does in the Bishop's own phrase, and so make the paragraph all of a piece.|$|E

6000|$|Bartley {{looked after}} her a moment, and {{continued}} to glance in that direction when he stood stamping the snow off his feet, and brushing it from his legs and arms, before he remounted to Marcia's side. He was excited, and talked rapidly and loudly, {{as he took the}} reins from Marcia's passive hold, and let the colt out. [...] "That girl is the pluckiest fool, yet! Wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> out because I had the right of way! And she wasn't going to let anybody else have a hand in getting that old ark of theirs afloat again.

6000|$|As, in {{the oppressive}} stillness of some tropic night, a single drop is the {{refreshing}} harbinger of a slower that clears the heavens, so even this slight expression relieved {{in an instant}} the intensity of his over-burthened feelings, and warm, quick, and gushing flowed the words that breathed his fervid adoration. 'Yes!' he continued, 'in this fair scene, oh! <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> to something fairer still. Beautiful, beloved Henrietta, I can repress no longer the emotions that, since I first beheld you, have vanquished my existence. I love you, I adore you; life in your society is heaven; without you I cannot live. Deem me, oh! deem me not too bold, sweet lady; I am not worthy of you, yet let me love! I am not worthy of you, but who can be? Ah! if I dared but venture to offer you my heart, if that humblest of all possessions might indeed be yours, if my adoration, if my devotion, if the consecration {{of my life to}} you, might in some degree compensate for its little worth, if I might live even but to hope------ ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary {{gave the}} betrothal ring to Humfrey, and {{she laid her}} hands on their clasped ones. [...] "My {{daughter}} and my son," [...] she said, [...] "I leave you my blessing. If filial love and unshaken truth can bring down blessings from above, they will be yours. Think of your mother in times to come as one who hath erred, but suffered and repented. If your Church permits you, pray often for her. Remember, when you hear her blamed, that {{in the glare of}} courts, she had none to breed her up in godly fear and simple truth like your good mother at Bridgefield, but that she learnt to think what you view in the light of deadly sin as the mere lawful instruments of government, above all for the weaker. Condemn her not utterly, but pray, pray with all your hearts that her God and Saviour will accept her penitence, and unite her sufferings with those of her Lord, since He has done her the grace of letting her die in part for His Church. Now," [...] she added, kissing each brow, and then holding her daughter in her embrace, [...] "take her away, Humfrey, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> my soul from all earthly loves and cares!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, then? At {{any rate}} {{you might get}} an answer from her. She would tell you {{something}} of her intention. Mother, I shall never go away till I know more about it than I do now. The governor says that he will <b>turn</b> <b>me</b> out. <b>Let</b> him <b>turn</b> <b>me</b> out. That won't make me go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} but a tame proceeding, citizen, after {{my visit to}} you," [...] said the old man, with unruffled sang-froid. [...] "But <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> in my <b>turn,</b> assure you of this, citizen Heriot," [...] he added, [...] "that Mlle. de Lucines will never be your wife, that Arnould Fabrice will not end his {{valuable}} life under the guillotine--and that {{you will never be}} allowed to use against him the cowardly and stolen weapon which you possess." ...|$|R

And now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see," [...] <b>turning</b> over his accounts--"Hum, hum!--yes, here it is: Wellingborough Redburn, at three dollars a month. Say four months, that's twelve dollars; less three dollars {{advanced}} in Liverpool--that makes it nine dollars; less three hammers and two scrapers lost overboard--that brings it to four dollars and a quarter.
