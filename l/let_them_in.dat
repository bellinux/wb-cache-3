25|$|On {{the same}} evening, 17-year-old {{high school junior}} Ryan Ferguson and another junior Charles Erickson were {{attending}} Halloween parties in the area. Ferguson and Erickson later {{decided to go to}} meet Ferguson's sister at a bar called By George because a bouncer who worked there would <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> despite being underage. When the teens were out of money, Ferguson's sister bought them a few additional drinks, then cut them off and Ferguson and Erickson left the bar.|$|E
25|$|Other {{evidence}} that was withheld from the defense trial team {{was related to the}} time frame of the murder and Ferguson and Erickson's movements during the evening. Erickson testified at Ferguson's trial that: following the murder, he and Ferguson went back to the bar around 2:45am and were let into the bar by the same bouncer who had <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the first time. He claimed on the stand that they left between 4 and 4:30 am.|$|E

Later, the three returned to the Temple's headquarters in Georgetown to find the bodies of Sharon Amos and her three children. Guyanese soldiers kept the Jones brothers under house arrest for five days, interrogating them about the deaths in Georgetown.|$|E

25|$|Ferrara {{was indicted}} on {{racketeering}} and murder charges around {{the beginning of}} 1990 and arrested shortly afterwards. Shortly after 1 a.m. on March 18, thieves disguised as police officers convinced security guards at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in,</b> whereupon they bound the two men up {{and spent the next}} several hours removing 13 works, including Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only known seascape, as well as the finial that Donati had indicated an interest in. The stolen works have collectively been valued at $500 million, making it the highest-value art theft ever.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Courtenay's force {{attacked}} Radford's manor that night; {{they set}} fire to the wall and gates to draw him out. On their word, including Courtenay's solemn promise to do him no harm if he would speak with them, Radford <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> – although apparently he commented upon their large number. Whilst Radford and Devon's son drank wine, the latter's followers [...] "ransacked" [...] Radford's house, stealing goods up to the value of 1,000 marks, including all his horses and the sheets off his invalid wife's bed. On a pretext of meeting his father the earl, Courtenay persuaded Radford to accompany him when his force withdrew; however, he abandoned Radford on the road a short distance from the house, and six of Courtenay's men killed him. Devon subsequently dispatched a force to the chapel where Radford's body was; they performed, says Storey, a [...] "mock inquest, one of them acting as coroner and others, with assumed names, as jurors. They brought in a verdict of suicide." [...] They then forced Radford's servants to convey his corpse {{as if he had been}} a heretic to the graveyard, where it was deposited unceremoniously into an open grave; the stones laid ready to build his memorial were then dropped on the body, crushing it. By making recognition of the body impossible, this prevented an official inquest being held into Radford's death.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in,</b> and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} months of Achewood, the strip takes place entirely at Chris Onstad's house, and the four {{original}} characters—Philippe, Téodor, Lyle and Cornelius Bear—are implied to be essentially trapped there. Philippe's appearance at the front door causes some Trick-or-Treaters to exclaim in fear, [...] "HOLY CHRIST IS THAT AN ALIVE STUFFED ANIMAL", and the friends are forced to hide when the pizza they ordered is delivered. There is no mention of having jobs, money or any real responsibilities. After Ray, Roast Beef and Pat are introduced, however, the characters begin to assume more complex personalities and exercise greater independence. This trend is accelerated during an extended story arc called [...] "The Party", the first of the long-form storylines which would become a staple of Achewood. The transition from what had essentially been a gag-a-day comic was fairly abrupt – there is no run-up to [...] "The Party." [...] Instead, on March 12, 2002, all of the characters are shown lined up outside the Onstad residence waiting for Téodor to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> and the comic concluded with the note “continued tomorrow.” [...] "The Party" [...] introduces several supporting characters, including the robots, Ultra Peanut and Phillipe's mother.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene Aksenoff, a Tokyo-based {{physician}} who had treated Jackson {{and his children}} on a few occasions, expressed concern about Jackson's use of and interest in various drugs. Aksenoff said that Jackson asked for stimulants {{so that he could}} get through some demanding performances. He said he refused to prescribe them. He recalled that the singer suffered chronic fatigue, fever, insomnia and other symptoms and took a large amount of drugs. He suspected one of the major factors causing Jackson these symptoms was excessive use of steroids or other skin-whitening medications. According to the toxicological tests effectuated on Jackson's body, no addiction had been reported, and none of the experts called to testify at Murray's trial have identified the singer as a drug addict. Janet Jackson confirmed that the Jackson family tried to stage an intervention in early 2007, when Jackson was living in Las Vegas. Janet Jackson and some of her brothers allegedly traveled to his home, but were turned away by security guards who were ordered not to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> He was also rumored to have refused calls from his mother.

2500|$|In 60 BC, Pompey {{sponsored}} an agrarian bill {{proposed by}} the plebeian tribune Flavius that provided for distribution of public land. It included land that had been forfeited but not allotted by Lucius Cornelius Sulla when he distributed land to settle his veterans in 80 BC and holdings in Arretium (Arezzo) and Volaterrae (Volterra), both in Etruria. Land was to be purchased with the new revenues from the provinces {{for the next five}} years. The senate opposed the bill because it suspected that 'some novel power for Pompey was aimed at.' [...] With this belief that Pompey was seeking new power, the optimates opposed the bill. They were led by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, one of the two consuls for that year. He contested every point of the Flavius' bill and 'attacked him so persistently that the latter had him put in prison.' Metellus Celer wanted to convene the senate there and Flavius sat at the entrance of the cell to prevent this. Metellus Celer had the wall cut through to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> When Pompey heard this he was afraid about the reaction of the people and told Flavius to desist. Metellus Celer did not consent when the other plebeian tribunes wanted to set him free. The antics of Flavius alienated the people. As time went by they lost interest in the bill and by June the issue was 'completely cold.' Finally, a serious war in Gaul diverted attention for it. Pompey had managed to support the election of Lucius Afrianius, who had been one of his commanders in the war in the east, as the other consul. However, he was unfamiliar with political infighting. In Cassius Dio's words he [...] "understood how to dance better than to transact any business." [...] In the end, lacking the support of this consul, Pompey let the matter drop. Thus, the Pompeian camp proved inadequate to respond the obstructionism of the optimates.|$|E
