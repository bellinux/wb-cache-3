It was evidenced that the NPs doping {{gives rise to}} photovoltaic (PV) efficiency and enhanced stability, thereby <b>lowering</b> <b>device</b> degradation rate during prolonged illumination. Spectroscopic analysis combined with photon-to-electron conversion efficiency measurements indicate that the efficiency improvement {{can be attributed to}} enhanced light harvesting and subsequent higher exciton generation rate into the photoactive layer. Therefore, this enhancement is attributed to localized surface plasmon resonant absorption (Au NPs) and scattering effects (Al NPs). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the device performance was improved only in the case that metal NPs were in close proximity or even better in direct contact with polymer donor (bare or coated with the same ligand as the donor material). On the other hand, the introduction of Au nanorods (NRs) inside the TiOx back contact interfacial layer acts as a mirror in the device structure, increasing exciton generation through back contact scattering and thus charge collection. The most efficient cells produced in this work incorporating Au NRs into TiOx transport layer of a PTB 7 :PC 71 BM based photoactive layer, demonstrated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8. 25 %, with Jsc of 17. 46 mA/cm 2, Voc of 0. 76 V and FF of 0. 62...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of microelectronic circuits, their scale of integration, and clock speed re quirements have been increasing steadily. All {{of these changes}} {{have the effect of}} increasing the power density of the micro-circuits. IC's with a power of several watts and area of over a square centimeter are quite common. Thus, there is more heat generated per device at die, component, and substrate-attach levels of electronic packaging. In order to maintain reliability of finished products, the junction temperature of the con stituent devices must be kept low. It has been demonstrated that thermal management can be one key to lowering the cost and increasing the performance life of microelectronic products. The cost effectiveness of <b>lowering</b> <b>device</b> temperature has been demonstrated to be dramatic in comparison to the cost of thermal management materials(l, 2). Proper thermal management of advanced microelectronic devices has to be addressed at all levels. One should address the problem from the basic level of die-attach, through com ponent attach, and eventually substrate-attach to thermal drains. Thermal management is almost invariably coupled with a thermally induced stress problem. The increase in temperature at the device level also means a larger fluctuation of tempera ture from the ambient. Each cycle of on-off for the device represents one thermal cycle. Stress induced failures due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch is much more acute for higher power devices. In this paper, we will also address the thermally induced stress on the microelectronic product at all levels of packaging with major emphasis on component and substrate levels. We will demonstrate various ways and examples of reducing or eliminating this stress, which is a major cause of device failures. One of the proven methods is through the use of low Tg epoxies with high thermal stability...|$|E
40|$|As the Silicon based MOSFET scaling {{is close}} to an end, high {{mobility}} III-V MOSFET {{is considered one of}} the most promising candidates in continuing Moore's Law. By replacing the channel from Silicon to III-V high mobility materials, it is expected that the on-current can be further increased, or the same on-current level can be achieved with decreased VDS, which lowers power consumption. However, the high interface and bulk-oxide trap densities are still major issues. These two kinds of trap states deteriorate device performance by <b>lowering</b> <b>device</b> on-current, increasing inverse subthreshold slope, and causing hysteresis (history effect). Fabricating high quality dielectric with low defect density on the interface and inside high-k dielectric is still a critical challenge which needs to be overcome. In this dissertation, two trap models are introduced to simulate the MOS capacitor C-V and G-V dispersions : full interface state model and distributed bulk-oxide trap model. One major application of the models is extracting the interface and bulk-oxide trap densities. Therefore, they can be applied to assist the researchers in the field monitoring the results after certain fabrication procedures. Furthermore, the models can be used to interpret the measuring data, such as the linear capacitance dispersion in accumulation region from bulk-oxide traps, the high-low capacitance dispersion in depletion from interface traps, and the C-V humps in n-type InGaAs MOS from depletion to inversion from the combination effect of increasing interface trap densities and majority carrier time constants. Such "know why" is the key of success in all the field of scientific study assisting the "know how" of engineering work. Furthermore, the insulator thickness effect, temperature effect, and light illumination effect on MOS C-V dispersions are also studied. It is shown that the data in all the conditions can be satisfactorily explained by the frame work of the small signal models with the same trap density. Other trap extraction methods and models, such as Terman method and conductance method for interface traps, and lumped circuit model, including Hasegawa model, for bulk-oxide traps, are also reviewed and commented in the dissertatio...|$|E
