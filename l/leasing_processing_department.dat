The Data <b>Processing</b> <b>department</b> {{was equipped with}} a small IBM 370 Mainframe computer, which was mainly used for batch processing of deposit and mortgage accounts. The bank's IT department was later dissolved in 1976 and its staff were moved to the IT division of the Iranian Social Security Organization (ISSO). At the time Electronic Data Systems (EDS) was developing a social security application for ISSO and was also managing ISSO's data center. After the Iranian Revolution in 1978, the agreement with ISSO (and EDS) was terminated. Bank Refah stopped using ISSO data center and reverted to manual processing. All business units and bank branches were instructed to set up paper-based customer and account ledgers.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research that}} was conducted into {{the potential of}} modeling {{the activities of the}} Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> as an aid to the computer auditor. A methodology is composed to aid in the evaluation of the Internal Controls, particularly the General Controls relative to computer processing. Consisting of three major components, the methodology enables the auditor to model the presumed activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> against the actual activities, as recorded on the Operating System Log. The first component of the methodology is the construction and loading of a model of the presumed activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> from its verbal, scheduled, and reported activities. The second component is the generation of a description of the actual activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> from the information recorded on the Operating System Log. This is effected by reducing the Operating System Log to the format described by the Standard Audit File concept. Finally, the third component in the methodology is the modeling process itself. This is in fact a new analysis technique proposed for use by the EDP auditor. The modeling process is composed of software that compares the model developed and loaded in the first component, with the description of actual activity as collated by the second component. Results from this comparison are then reviewed by the auditor, who determines if they adequately depict the situation, or whether the models description as specified in the first component requires to be altered, and the modeling process re-initiated. In conducting the research, information and data from a production installation was used. Use of the ‘real-world’ input proved both the feasibility of developing a model of the reported activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department,</b> and the adequacy of the operating system log as a source of information to report the departments actual activities. Additionally, it enabled the involvement and comment of practicing auditors. The research involved analysis of the effect of EDP on the audit process, structure of the EDP audit process, data reduction, data structures, model formalization, and model processing software. Additionally, the Standard Audit File concept was verified through its use by practising auditors, and expanded by the development of an indexed data structure, which enabled its analysis to be conducted interactively. Results from the trial implementation of the research software and methodology at a production installation confirmed the research hypothesis that the activities of the Data <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> could be modelled, and that there are substantial benefits from the EDP auditor in analysing this process. The research in fact provides a new source of information, and develops a new analysis technique for the EDP auditor. It demonstrates the utilization of computer technology to monitor itself for the audit function, and reasserts auditor independence by providing access to technical detail describing the processing activities of the computer...|$|R

40|$|Applications of DDP are {{examined}} via two case studies {{to determine how}} the technology was used by management to aid decision-making; the level of management involvement in the MIS (Management Information Systems) design process {{and the nature of the}} relationship between managers and data <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> were also considered. The study showed that because the technology was largely under end user control, better tailored information systems resulted and system output was more directly used by middle and top managers. This only occurred, however, if certain moderators, such as computing and modelling skills, were present in functional departments. DDP also offers opportunities for better relationships with data <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> but the consequences include the need for better management training and functional support groups for systems implementation. A conceptual model is presented as a theoretical framework to guide organisations when using DDP. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} how a single technological innovation, {{the introduction of}} image processing of checks, led to distinctly different changes {{in the structure of}} jobs in two departments of a large bank overseen by one group of managers. In the downstairs deposit <b>processing</b> <b>department,</b> image <b>processing</b> led to the substitution of computers for high school educated labor in accomplishing core tasks and in greater specialization in the jobs that remained. In the upstairs exceptions <b>processing</b> <b>department,</b> image <b>processing</b> led to the integration of tasks, with an associated increase in the demand for particular skills. The case illustrates the interdependence of technological change and organizational change. It suggests that seeing the whole picture' and associated conceptual and problem-solving skills are made more valuable by information technologies. Finally, it underscores that the short-term consequences of technological changes may depend importantly on regulatory forces. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{designing}} flexible plant layouts for manufacturing facilities where product demands are subject to variability. A flexible layout is one that maintains low material handling costs despite fluctuations in the product demand levels. We extend existing procedures for design of flexible layouts by (1) explicitly capturing the stochastic nature of product demands and the resulting variability in material flows between different <b>processing</b> <b>departments,</b> (2) allowing for the possibility of multiple <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> of the same type to exist in the same facility, and (3) letting material flows between pairs of individual departments be determined simultaneously with the layout and as a function of demand scenarios. Optimal and heuristic methods are presented for generating flexible layouts and determining flow allocations under various design and operation assumptions. - 2 - 1.

40|$|Abstract [...] Healthcare {{workflow}} {{has recently}} become an enabling {{technology in the}} healthcare industry to automate processes, improve care quality, and enhances patient safety. Although some {{work has been done}} on healthcare workflow for some departments of a hospital, automating processes and improving patient safety in the Sterile <b>Processing</b> <b>Department</b> (SPD) is still an open problem. The main contributions of this paper are: i) we identify the main factors and issues in the current practice of a sterile <b>processing</b> <b>department</b> that compromise patient safety; ii) we propose to address these issues using healthcare workflow and identify the key architectural requirements for a healthcare workflow system for SPDs; iii) based on these requirements, we propose a service-oriented architecture and validate it with our SPD workflow prototyping system, SPDFLOW. To our best knowledge, SPDFLOW is the first effort in exploring healthcare workflow technology in the SPD domain.
