25|$|Within {{the city}} of Moscow the Yauza is spanned by 21 road bridges, five {{railroad}} bridges, one dedicated tram bridge, two Moscow Metro bridges, numerous pedestrian bridges and the historical Rostokino Aqueduct. Spring floods due to <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> under old bridges were common, with four in the 1950s alone (1951, 1952, 1955 and 1957); they were practically eliminated when these bridges were rebuilt to modern standards. The most recent flash flood on the Yauza occurred August 14, 2003, following a record-setting rainfall. The Yauza and its valleys are not particularly prone to the landslides and erosion common in the western and southern districts of Moscow. There were two minor landslides on the Yauza in 2008, compared with 40 on the Chertanovka River and 33 on the Gorodnya River.|$|E

2500|$|The tranquility {{principle}} of the Bell–LaPadula model states that the classification of a subject or object does not change while it is being referenced. There are two forms to the tranquility principle: the [...] "{{principle of}} strong tranquility" [...] states that security levels do not change during the normal operation of the system. The [...] "principle of weak tranquility" [...] states that security levels may never change {{in such a way}} as to violate a defined security policy. Weak tranquility is desirable as it allows systems to observe the principle of least privilege. That is, processes start with a <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> level regardless of their owners clearance, and progressively accumulate higher clearance levels as actions require it.|$|E
2500|$|The Port Authority {{commissioned}} the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) {{to conduct a}} study of the question, which was completed in 2009, and authorized up to $10 million for planning and engineering services to develop options to deal with the bridge's <b>low</b> <b>clearance.</b> The CoE study looked at three options for the bridge, besides the no-build option. The quickest option they identified, and the one ultimately chosen, was a $1.32 billion project to raise the bridge's roadway to increase its height by 40 percent, which could be accomplished by 2019 at the earliest. It would need a clearance of [...] to handle the new ships. Another option presented was to build a new cable-stayed bridge, which would have cost $2.15 billion and taken until 2022. The most expensive option would be {{to get rid of the}} bridge altogether and replace it with either a bored tunnel or a immersed tunnel through which traffic would traverse under the Kill Van Kull. This option would have taken the longest, being complete in 2024 and costing $2.2 to $3 billion. In initial planning documents, a vertical-lift bridge was also considered, but this was not investigated further in the CoE study.|$|E
2500|$|The {{saxophone}} mouthpiece {{is larger}} {{than that of the}} clarinet, has a wider inner chamber, and lacks the cork-covered tenon because the saxophone neck inserts into the mouthpiece whereas the clarinet mouthpiece is inserted into the barrel. Saxophone and clarinet embouchures differ from each other in firmness, position of the lower lip, and range of entry angles. [...] The [...] "long tones" [...] exercise is used to develop embouchure, along with airstream and breath control. Mouthpieces come {{in a wide variety of}} materials, including vulcanized rubber (sometimes called hard rubber or ebonite), plastic, and metals such as bronze or surgical steel. Less common materials that have been used include wood, glass, crystal, porcelain, and even bone. According to Larry Teal, the mouthpiece material has little, if any, effect on the sound, and the physical dimensions give a mouthpiece its tone colour. There are examples of [...] "dark" [...] sounding metal pieces and [...] "bright" [...] sounding hard rubber pieces – Marcel Mule, for example, used a metal mouthpiece to perform classical music. [...] Some contend that instability at the mouthpiece/neck connection moves harmonic frequencies off series with the fundamental frequency and each other, resulting in a [...] "spread" [...] sound, and that the weight of a metal mouthpiece counteracts that instability, increasing tonal [...] "focus." [...] Mouthpiece design has a profound impact on tone. Early mouthpieces were designed to produce a warm and round sound for classical playing. Among classical mouthpieces, those with a concave ("excavated") chamber are more true to Adolphe Sax's original design; these provide a softer or less piercing tone favored by some saxophonists, including students of Sigurd Raschèr, for classical playing. Saxophonists who follow the French school of classical saxophone playing, influenced by Marcel Mule, generally use mouthpieces with smaller chambers than Rascher style mouthpieces. The use of the saxophone in dance orchestras and jazz ensembles put a premium on dynamic range, projection, and tonal richness, leading to rapid innovation in chamber shape and tip design, and metal construction. [...] At the opposite extreme from the classical mouthpieces are those with a small chamber and a <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> above the reed between the tip and the chamber, called high baffle. These produce a bright sound with maximum projection, suitable for having a sound stand out among amplified instruments and typical of modern pop and smooth jazz. Most saxophonists who play different styles have a mouthpiece suited for each style.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{investigation of the}} effects of a nonuniform tip clearance profile on the performance and flow field in a centrifugal compressor with a vaneless diffuser. This study focuses in particular on the magnitude and location of the wake. Six impellers with different tip clearance profiles were tested in the flow simulations. The accuracy of the numerical simulations was assessed by comparing the experimental data with the computational results for a system characterized by the original tip clearance. Although the performance improved for <b>low</b> tip <b>clearances,</b> a <b>low</b> tip <b>clearance</b> at the trailing edge improved the compressor performance more significantly than a <b>low</b> tip <b>clearance</b> at the leading edge. The flow field calculated for a system characterized by a <b>low</b> tip <b>clearance</b> at the trailing edge produced a more uniform velocity distribution both in the circumferential and in the axial directions at the impeller exit because the wake magnitude was reduced. As a consequence, this impeller provided a better potential for diffusion processes inside a vaneless diffuser...|$|R

50|$|Outbound from Hoboken, commuters {{could ride}} on the Morristown Line (the mainline) to Dover, New Jersey, a trip of 38.3 miles (62 km). The Montclair Branch and Gladstone Branch diverged from the Morristown line at Roseville Avenue Station in Newark and Summit, respectively. The MUs ran off 3000 volt DC {{overhead}} electric wire, drawing current through pantographs. Due {{to the presence of}} overhead bridges along the line, the overhead catenary varied considerably in height. Where no height restrictions existed, the catenary was typically at 24 ft, but for some bridges the wire needed to drop in clearance, with Roseville Avenue being the point of <b>lowest</b> <b>clearance</b> at 15 ft. This didn't affect the operation of the MUs, since they had been designed with these clearance differentials in mind, but the <b>low</b> <b>clearances</b> restricted the use of other trains on the line that had insufficient clearance. The Lackawanna MUs had two pantographs: one for normal use (on the Dover end of the motor car) and one with greater wire tension that was used only during ice storms (on the Hoboken end of the car). The trains lacked speedometers. On test runs, the trains attained a speed of 63 mph on level track. On suitable downgrades, however, the trains could reach 75 mph.|$|R
