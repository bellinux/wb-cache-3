5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and <b>locked</b> doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are <b>locked</b> by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E

5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is <b>locked,</b> it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without <b>locked</b> steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lock</b> {{upgrades}} and downgrades {{release the}} old <b>lock</b> before applying the new <b>lock.</b> If an application downgrades an exclusive <b>lock</b> to a shared <b>lock</b> while another application is blocked {{waiting for an}} exclusive <b>lock,</b> the latter application may get the exclusive <b>lock</b> and <b>lock</b> the first application out. This means that <b>lock</b> downgrades can block, which may be counterintuitive.|$|R
50|$|The {{pin tumbler}} <b>lock</b> (or Yale <b>lock,</b> after <b>lock</b> {{manufacturers}} Yale) is a <b>lock</b> mechanism that uses pins of varying lengths {{to prevent the}} <b>lock</b> from opening without the correct key.

40|$|For a {{data sharing}} {{database}} system, substantial coordination cost is incurred {{to cope with}} the global (distributed) <b>locking</b> needed by these systems. <b>Lock</b> covering is a way to permit component systems to perform private (local) <b>locking.</b> Two forms of covering <b>locks</b> are discussed, together with intention <b>locks,</b> needed to prevent covering violations. Intention <b>locks</b> give permission for lower level <b>locking</b> to be used, but require that this <b>locking</b> be global. The protocol between local <b>lock</b> manager and its principals is defined to permit information needed for local <b>locking</b> to be conveyed.

40|$|A {{safe and}} {{deadlock}} free <b>lock</b> policy is introduced, called pre-analysis <b>locking.</b> Pre-analysis <b>locking</b> {{is based on}} an efficient geometric algorithm which inserts <b>lock</b> and unlock operations into the transactions.

In general, none of pre-analysis lock-ing and two-phase <b>locking</b> dominates the other: there exist cases in which pre-analysis <b>locking</b> allows for more concur-rency than any two-phase <b>locking</b> policy, but there are also cases in which a two-phase <b>locking</b> policy allows for more concurrency than pre-analysis <b>locking.</b> Keywords: database concurrency control, <b>locking</b> policy, serializability, safety, deadlock 1...|$|R

After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, <b>locked</b> in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were <b>locked</b> away in their cells overnight.

5000|$|In {{software}} engineering, double-checked <b>locking</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "double-checked <b>locking</b> optimization") is a software design pattern {{used to reduce}} the overhead of acquiring a <b>lock</b> by first testing the <b>locking</b> criterion (the [...] "lock hint") without actually acquiring the <b>lock.</b> Only if the <b>locking</b> criterion check indicates that <b>locking</b> is required does the actual <b>locking</b> logic proceed.|$|R

5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally <b>locked,</b> such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally <b>locked</b> to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally <b>locked,</b> as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E

5|$|<b>Locking</b> {{multiple}} variables using non-atomic <b>locks</b> {{introduces the}} possibility of program deadlock. An atomic <b>lock</b> <b>locks</b> multiple variables all at once.

If two threads each need to <b>lock</b> the same two variables using non-atomic <b>locks,</b> {{it is possible that}} one thread will <b>lock</b> one of them and the second thread will <b>lock</b> the second variable.

For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are <b>locked</b> out by the time limit.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} impact of several <b>lock</b> manager designs on the {{overhead}} imposed to a persistent programming language by automated object <b>locking.</b> Our study reveals that a <b>lock</b> management method based on <b>lock</b> state sharing outperforms more traditional <b>lock</b> management designs. <b>Lock</b> state sharing is a novel <b>lock</b> management method that represents all <b>lock</b> data structures with equal values with a single shared data structure. Sharing the value of <b>locks</b> has numerous benefits: (i) it makes the space consumed by the <b>lock</b> manager small and independent {{of the number of}} <b>locks</b> acquired by transactions, (ii) it eliminates the need for expensive book-keeping of <b>locks</b> by transactions, and (iii) it enables the use of memoization techniques for whole <b>locking</b> operations.
