5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{out of the water and}} saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
2500|$|After Corday's decapitation, a {{man named}} Legros <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> from the basket and slapped it on the cheek. Charles-Henri Sanson, the executioner, indignantly {{rejected}} published reports that Legros {{was one of his}} assistants. Sanson stated in his diary that Legros was in fact a carpenter who had been hired to make repairs to the guillotine. Witnesses report an expression of [...] "unequivocal indignation" [...] on her face when her cheek was slapped. The oft-repeated anecdote has served to suggest that victims of the guillotine may in fact retain consciousness for a short while, including by Albert Camus in his Reflections on the Guillotine. ("Charlotte Corday's severed head blushed, it is said, under the executioner's slap.").|$|E

60|$|Turning away, {{the object}} that met my eyes was Miss Marchmont awake, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> from the pillow, and {{regarding}} me with unusual earnestness.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman did}} not even <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> but {{answered}} at once, readily, {{as though she had}} expected the question for a long time.|$|R
60|$|She <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> with joy, {{then she}} shook it mistrustfully.|$|E

60|$|Then Jim <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{drew her}} up. He was white with fear.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman who}} could not <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> a week ago {{scrambled}} down the ladder, and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft.|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] asked Annie, bending down; she laughed, in <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "I promised Idella you'd let us {{have some}} {{preserves}} to-day, Mrs. Bolton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So spoke Pilate," [...] {{broke in}} Cicely, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and looking {{him in the}} eyes. Then she let it fall again, and was silent.|$|R

6000|$|... "To his {{happiness}} and to mine," [...] she answered, without <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> from <b>her</b> hands. [...] "The dark days are coming for Oscar and for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Philippa <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> a little. This was the {{pronouncement}} towards {{which she}} had been leading.|$|E
60|$|Hearing {{the name}} Noie, Rachel <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and for the}} first time her face grew human.|$|E
60|$|She <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She was pale, but {{her dark}} eyes had an indignant sparkle in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have said}} it," [...] she whispered, without <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Lingard made a brusque {{movement}} at her elbow and bent his <b>head</b> close to <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|That forced <b>her</b> to <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and face}} him, yet still {{she did not}} speak. It was the {{strength}} of despair. She could not endure much more.|$|R

60|$|She <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> There {{was still}} {{something}} of {{the look of a}} scared child in her face.|$|E
60|$|It {{was said}} seriously. She <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> for a moment, so that I could examine her face.|$|E
60|$|Sybilla <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and with}} her outstretched arm pointed to Rosamund, who stood above them all by the high altar.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{leave me}} some cigarettes," [...] she said, without <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "This is frightfully {{monotonous}} work. How {{much more of}} it is there for me to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good gracious! I've spoilt {{all your}} {{beautiful}} roses!' said Mrs. Hauksbee, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> from the lump of crushed gum and calico atrocities on Mrs. Delville's shoulder and hurrying to the Doctor.|$|R
60|$|Numb as Venters {{was when}} at length Jane Withersteen <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked at}} him, he yet {{suffered}} a pang.|$|E
