2500|$|The Series IIA is {{considered}} by many the most hardy Series model constructed. It is quite possibly also the type of classic <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> that features strongly in the general public's perception of the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover,</b> from its many appearances in popular films and television documentaries set in Africa throughout the 1960s, such as Born Free. [...] In February 1968, just a [...] few months after [...] its manufacturer had been subsumed, under government pressure, into the Leyland Motor Corporation, the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> celebrated its twentieth birthday, with total production to date just short of 600,000, of which more than 70% had been exported. [...] Certainly it was whilst the Series IIA was in production that sales of utility <b>Land</b> <b>Rovers</b> reached their peak, in 1969–70, when sales of over 60,000 <b>Land</b> <b>Rovers</b> a year were recorded. (For comparison, the sales of the Defender in recent years have been around the 25,000 level since the 1990s.) As well as record sales, the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> dominated many <b>world</b> markets- in Australia in the 1960s <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> held 90% of the 4×4 market. This figure was repeated in many countries in Africa and the Middle East.|$|R

Heavily based on the contemporary <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> One Ten, the Llama was intended to be sold on both the military and civilian markets.

50|$|In 1948, the British <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> was developed. Originally {{intended}} to be a civilian and agricultural successor to the Willys Jeep (the prototype <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> was built on the chassis of a Willys and used Willys transmission parts but production vehicles used no Jeep components) the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> was brought into military service in 1949, becoming the standard Light Utility Vehicle for the British Army and many armed forces of the Commonwealth. The original <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> design evolved into the modern-day <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Defender which is still in military service throughout the world.|$|R
2500|$|Production of {{the model}} {{now known as the}} Defender began in 1983 as the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> 110, a name which {{reflected}} the [...] length of the wheelbase.

5000|$|In 1962 {{the company}} became {{responsible}} for promoting the Santana and <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> brands in Central and South American Markets {{as well as}} Africa. CKD kits were also supplied to the Moroccan and Costa Rican markets by the company. Because of the harsh working lives vehicles endured in these environments, customer feedback on the range meant that Santana were often far more aware of each model's failings than the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> company itself was. Because of the tight financial position in this period of British Leyland (which owned <b>Land</b> <b>Rover),</b> Santana were often better placed than <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> was {{to deal with these}} failings. This meant that Santana began to engineer its own solutions to common problems into the models it produced and thus arose a degree of originality in Santana's models compared to <b>Land</b> <b>Rover's</b> original products - a trend which led to the company's position today. Up to the late 1980s the Santana models - supposed to be quickly and cheaply built versions of <b>Land</b> <b>Rover's</b> own product - often ended up being quite different to <b>Land</b> <b>Rover's</b> own vehicles. For instance Santana models featured anatomical seats, disc-brakes, turbo diesel engines, taper-leaf springs, coil springs, and civilian-specification Forward Control versions before the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> equivalents and there was even a civilian version of the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Lightweight called the [...] "Ligero" [...] which was never released by <b>Land</b> <b>Rover.</b>|$|R
