5|$|During {{the course}} of his work on 20/20, Stossel {{discovered}} Reason magazine, and found that the libertarian ideas of its writers made sense to him. Stossel was named co-anchor of 20/20 in May 2003, while he was writing his first book, Gimme a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Media,</b> which was published in 2004. In it, he details his start in journalism and consumer reporting, and how he evolved to harbor libertarian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Media</b> is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

25|$|The {{release of}} the report {{garnered}} swift and sometimes contentious reaction from across the political spectrum. In general, critics of the Bush Administration's handling of the war, including <b>liberal</b> <b>media</b> outlets and think tanks, applauded the report's recommendations, particularly those related to troop withdrawal and increased diplomacy with Syria and Iran. Supporters of the war effort, including conservative media outlets and neoconservative think tanks, were {{highly critical of the}} report.|$|E
25|$|Discussing {{the issue}} in Morocco has been taboo for decades. However, human rights {{organizations}} and some <b>liberal</b> <b>media</b> outlets and left-wing political parties led by the Front of Democratic Forces have been attempting to start a capital punishment debate. As for societal and civil movements, blogs and websites have already started debating the issue. The main and the newly created (2003) civil entity Coalition nationale pour l’abolition de la peine de mort au Maroc (CNAPM) (National coalition for the abolition of capital punishment in Morocco) which represents seven associations carrying the slogan Ensemble pour l'abolition de la peine de mort (Together against capital punishment) is also leading the debate.|$|E
50|$|With {{all four}} by-elections {{taking place in}} ridings {{previously}} held by the <b>Liberals,</b> <b>media</b> generally treated them {{as a test of}} Stéphane Dion's leadership. Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, a swing riding which the Liberals had won by a margin of just 68 votes in the 2006 election and in which the by-election campaign was mired in controversy around the process of appointing candidates, was seen as the only riding of the four that the Liberals could afford to lose — the other three were all safe Liberal ridings whose loss would have been seen as precipitating a major crisis for the party.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Wilby {{concluded}} his New Statesman {{review in}} January 2006 with the comment that: [...] "All journalists should read book, because the Davids {{make a case}} that demands to be answered". He felt the book had some flaws, in particular he.objected to their suggestion [...] "that properly radical papers should refuse, say, airline ads. The effect would merely be to bankrupt any paper {{to the left of}} the Mail". Reviewing the book for The Irish Times, Eddie Halt praised [...] "their excellently researched accounts of undeniable media bias", which he says [...] "asks serious questions about the elite media." [...] O'Neill thought that [...] "there is some good material here, especially on the <b>liberal</b> <b>media’s</b> servility during times of war." ...|$|R

500|$|Antara {{received}} {{financial assistance}} {{from the government and}} was placed directly under the president's control, giving him the authority to appoint the agency's managing director and editor-in-chief. Antara's position in the structure of government resulted in confusion over its ownership and control, as well as shifting editorial views in the coming decades. As Sukarno pursued increasingly leftist policies, the conservative media accused Antara for its [...] "explicitly partisan" [...] reporting. Following his removal from office, the subsequent government also used the agency to further its policies, prompting criticism from the <b>liberal</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E

Despite this release, subsequent episodes still saw some of the show's highest viewing figures.|$|R
500|$|On {{the subject}} of reviews, British critic Mark Lawson notes the {{tendency}} for Ellis' reviews to be [...] "unpredictable"; he cited the irony of favour amongst right-wing critics, {{and the extent to}} which the <b>liberal</b> <b>media</b> attack his work. Ellis himself, however, states that he [...] "proudly" [...] accepts the label of moralist. He also attributes some of the negative criticism that Imperial Bedrooms and Ellis' earlier works have received in the past to the earlier schools of feminist criticism; today, he observes young girls [...] "reading the works correctly", opining the books shouldn't be read through the lens of [...] "old school feminism." [...] To that end, the author observes that older women reviewing Imperial Bedrooms in the US had issues with it, not least feelings of betrayal. He feels these are ironic because the book is in fact a critique of a certain kind of male perspective and behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Bo's {{downfall}} elicited strong reactions {{among the}} Chinese public and with commentators {{across the political}} spectrum. Leftist websites such as Utopia, Red China, and Maoflag were full of angry commentary over Bo's dismissal. These websites were shut down {{for a period of}} [...] "maintenance" [...] shortly after. Leftist commentators voiced support for Bo: Kong Qingdong called Bo's dismissal 'a plot by enemies of the state'; Sima Nan said associating Bo with the Cultural Revolution was a 'smear campaign'; Sima's pro-Bo microblogs were censored. Large numbers of sympathetic posts for Bo appeared in microblogs from Chongqing, and Dalian, where Bo was once mayor. The Global Times also wrote a sympathetic editorial. <b>Liberal</b> <b>media</b> reacted positively, criticizing Bo's style of 'personality-based rule' as dangerous and regressive. Right-leaning commentators said Bo's downfall signified a 'correct orientation' to China's future development. Southern Media Group editor Yan Lieshan remarked that Bo correctly identified China's problems but prescribed the wrong solution. Businesspeople whose assets were seized by Bo's administration in Chongqing also reacted positively.|$|E
