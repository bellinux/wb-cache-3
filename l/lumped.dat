5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as <b>lumped</b> element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with <b>lumped</b> elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in <b>lumped</b> element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E
5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using <b>lumped</b> elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the <b>lumped</b> LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding <b>lumped</b> element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of <b>lumped</b> element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of <b>lumped</b> and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E
40|$|Background:. Breast {{augmentation}} with autologous fat {{has been}} performed in Japan for over 30 years. However, complications include breast <b>lumps</b> and oil cysts. Such breast <b>lumps</b> greatly reduce patient satisfaction, and are currently difficult to diagnose and treat for many cosmetic surgery clinics. This study aimed to elucidate {{the effectiveness of}} ultrasound {{diagnosis and treatment of}} patients with breast <b>lumps</b> after breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting. Methods:. We used diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound to examine 256 patients with breast <b>lumps</b> between April 2012 and April 2017. We determined the nature, size, and location of the maximal <b>lump.</b> Breast <b>lumps</b> were classified into five types: cystic, complex, solid, calcification, and unclassifiable. The method of treatment (including fine-needle aspiration, VASER liposuction, lumpectomy, and extended lumpectomy) was selected according to the <b>lump</b> type, and the efficacy of treatment was determined by postoperative palpation and ultrasound. Results:. A total of 198 patients (198 / 256, 77 %) requested treatment. Cystic <b>lumps</b> (79 / 256, 31 %) were treated by fine-needle aspiration. VASER liposuction was used to treat complex (64 / 256, 25 %) and solid <b>lumps</b> (50 / 256, 19 %). Calcification (58 / 256, 23 %) and unclassifiable <b>lumps</b> (5 / 256, 2 %) were removed via periareolar incision. There were no serious complications. In all cases, the <b>lumps</b> were no longer palpable after treatment, and ultrasound showed that they had either contracted or disappeared. Conclusions:. The appropriate treatment for breast <b>lumps</b> after breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting must be selected according {{to the nature of the}} <b>lumps.</b> Ultrasound is essential for diagnosing the breast <b>lump</b> type and determining the best treatment...|$|R

5|$|The {{various types}} of {{resonator}} are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with <b>lumped</b> elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E

Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed.

Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures.
