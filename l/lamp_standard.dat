50|$|A street light, light pole, lamppost, street lamp, light standard, or <b>lamp</b> <b>standard</b> is {{a raised}} source {{of light on}} the edge of a road or path. Modern lamps may also have {{light-sensitive}} photocells that activate automatically when light is or is not needed: dusk, dawn, or the onset of dark weather. This function in older lighting systems could have been performed with the aid of a solar dial. Many street light systems are being connected underground instead of wiring from one utility post to another.|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} the scientific activities during the seventh SeaWiFS Intercalibration Round-Robin Experiment (SIRREX- 7) held at Satlantic, Inc. (Halifax, Canada). The overall objective of SIRREX- 7 {{was to determine}} the uncertainties of radiometric calibrations and measurements at a single calibration facility. Specifically, this involved the estimation of the uncertainties in a) <b>lamp</b> <b>standards,</b> b) plaque standards (including the uncertainties associated with plaque illumination non-uniformity), c) radiance calibrations, and d) irradiance calibrations. The investigation of the uncertainties in <b>lamp</b> <b>standards</b> included a comparison between a calibration of a new FEL by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Optronic Laboratories, Inc. In addition, the rotation and polarization sensitivity of radiometers were determined, and a procedure for transferring an absolute calibration to portable light sources was defined and executed...|$|R

50|$|The Public Works Department in Lagos {{strongly}} opposed these proposals {{on the grounds}} of expense and lack of availability of staff to undertake the work.

50|$|After the NHL game ended, an {{estimated}} 50,000 to 70,000 individuals converged upon Downtown Vancouver.

The police, who were on bicycles, attempted to escort paramedics into the crowd. When members of the crowd attempted to take a bicycle from one constable, police retreated and warned the crowd to disperse.

Many major retailers along Robson had their windows broken, including an Eaton's department store which had more than 50 smashed. The storefronts were eventually guarded by a constable as police regained control of the streets.|$|E
