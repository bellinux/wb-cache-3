Many oleochemical plants were built. Though a nascent and small industry when pitted against big detergent giants in the US and Europe, oleochemical companies in southeast Asia had competitive edge in cheap ingredients. The US fatty chemical industry {{found it difficult to}} consistently maintain acceptable <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits.</b> Competition was intense with market shares divided among many companies there where neither imports nor exports played a significant role. By the late 1990s, giants like Henkel, Unilever, and Petrofina sold their oleochemical factories to focus on higher profit activities like retail of consumer goods. Since the Europe outbreak of 'mad cow disease' or (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in 2000, tallow is replaced for many uses by vegetable oleic fatty acids, such as palm kernel and coconut oils.|$|E
50|$|Physicians {{and other}} health care {{providers}} lack the necessary actuarial, underwriting, accounting and finance skills for insurance risk management, but their most severe problem is the greater variation in their estimates of the average patient cost, which leaves them at a financial disadvantage as compared to insurers whose estimates are far more accurate. Because their risks are a function of portfolio size, providers can reduce their risks only by increasing the numbers of patients they carry on their rosters, but their inefficiency relative to that of the insurers' is far greater than can be mitigated by these increases. To manage risk as efficiently as an insurer, a provider would have to assume 100% of the insurer's portfolio. HMOs and insurers manage their costs better than risk-assuming healthcare providers and cannot make risk-adjusted capitation payments without sacrificing profitability. Risk-transferring entities will enter into such agreements only if they can maintain the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> they achieve by retaining risks.|$|E

Here, we examine variations of the above model where both hospital profit-maximizing and profit-satisficing postures are of interest. We apply the model to three types of Medicare reimbursement policies currently in use or under legislative mandate to implement.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} whether organisations in developing markets legitimise {{their use of}} societal resources. We concur that organisations’ existence in developing markets {{is also part of}} a social contract. Within this implied contract, organisations are to leverage resources in an equitable manner, allowing fair distribution of benefits to society and themselves. In this setting, we propose that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> is the best indicator of the outcome of use of resources, and is subject to numerous societal emotions in developing economies. We also propose that readability of narratives relating to a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> is the best measure of organisations’ immediate legitimacy activities. Five-year data on profitability and readability of sections of corporate annual reports from 30 organisations reveals that organisations with higher profits present more readable narrative disclosures in their annual reports. This relationship is more evident in larger companies and with the public enterprises. These outcomes imply that organisations communicate their profit-related information in ways to manage an appropriate impression and legitimize a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> The study’s outcomes also imply that authorities need to monitor organisations rights to protected existence continuously, as their legitimacy efforts suggest that higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> may be an outcome of potential misuse of resources...|$|R

Some of these changes touch upon the mandate and organisation of the Qianhai Authority itself, and relatively poor-performing innovation agencies and schemes especially in Hong Kong. We find that such a zone would increase innovation-led profits in the logistics, IT, and other Qianhai-targeted sectors by a factor of four in the short-run and a factor of ten in the longer run.

Two sets of questionnaires were administered on the eleven (11) MFI decision units in Kano State, to collect information on their characteristics, financial resources and mode of operations; sources and uses of funds, resource use efficiency as well as outreach.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{development}} of a political economy of large accounting and auditing firms. The importance of this lies in the rapid growth of these firms and the lack of appropriate theories. Economists have applied the theory of the firm to accounting and have approached auditing from agency and litigation costs perspectives, while sociologists have studied the culture of accounting firms and approached auditing using concepts such as ‘legitimation’ and ‘jurisdiction’. These approaches do not recognise that to do justice to the subject matter, we must study accounting firms in the broader context of accounting and its many conceptual and practical problems. These include the conceptual framework, auditor independence, the audit expectations gap, creative accounting, and fraud. To study the accounting firm within the context of accounting the thesis develops a political economy approach that emphasises conflict between investors, managers, workers, and the state. This approach proves helpful because it encompasses all accounting and auditing problems within a framework that recognises agency and links together the profits of accounting firms with their legitimation. The method adopted {{is the development of}} a theory of the profits of accounting firms and a model of factors driving auditor independence. Following Bryer, the thesis develops the theory from Marx’s Capital by combining his analyses of ‘bookkeeping’ and ‘commercial capital’. The theory highlights that as capitalist enterprises accounting firms compete with all other capitalist firms for a share of surplus value, as well as competing with other accounting firms. However, the political economy approach also highlights the essential contradiction in accounting: that measuring and disclosing profits can exacerbate the ‘labour danger’. The provocative character of accounting means that disguise of profits is part of its nature, but that this must co-exist with the contradictory need for accurate, objective measurement of profits. The model therefore suggests that the role accounting firms play in disguise is the key to understanding their behaviour. It predicts that as the level of profits and labour militancy rises, so do investors’ demand for disguise. However, because investors need disguise, auditors cannot have full independence, and the thesis concludes that this explains why auditing is within the private sector. Its general conclusion is that rather than being a principle, auditor independence is a variable driven by investors’ needs and the capitalist tactics of accounting firms. The thesis derives and tests two behavioural predictions. First, that accounting firms will exhibit the same types of behaviour as other capitalist firms. Second, the auditor does not act independently. The thesis tests these predictions with evidence of accounting firms’ mergers and profit margins (1986 to 1995), the changes introduced in the US to increase auditor independence (2001 to 2003), and the change to limited liability partnership status (2004 to 2007) in the UK. The high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> disclosed by the LLP accounting firms and the close relationship between mergers and profit margins support the hypothesis that accounting firms adopt capitalist tactics. The wide-ranging debates (1995 to 2005) and changes to auditor independence rules introduced by SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley support the hypothesis that claims of auditor independence are untrue, and that the level of audit independence is a variable. The thesis proposes further development of the theory through historical research and formalising the model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
