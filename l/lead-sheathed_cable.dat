50|$|Lead burning is {{not used}} as part of {{plumbing}} work for installed pipework. Lead piping has long been considered obsolete, owing to the health aspects. Even where lead piping, or <b>lead-sheathed</b> <b>cable,</b> {{still needs to be}} jointed, this is carried out with a wiped joint, rather than a burned joint. Wiping a lead joint is a soldering process, using plumber's solder (80% lead / 20% tin) and is carried out at low temperature, with a natural-draught propane blowtorch. Today, even wiped joints are rare and where an existing lead pipe must be connected to, a proprietary mechanical joint {{is more likely to be}} used.|$|E
5000|$|In 1844, the United States Congress granted Samuel Morse $30,000 {{to build}} a 40-mile {{telegraph}} line between Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Morse began by having a <b>lead-sheathed</b> <b>cable</b> made. After laying seven miles underground, he tested it. He found so many faults with this system that he dug up his cable, stripped off its sheath, bought poles and strung his wires overhead. On February 7, 1844, Morse inserted the following advertisement in the Washington newspaper: [...] "Sealed proposals will be received by the undersigned for furnishing 700 straight and sound chestnut posts with the bark on and of the following dimensions to wit: 'Each post must not be less than eight inches in diameter at the butt and tapering to five or six inches at the top. Six hundred and eighty of said posts to be 24 feet in length, and 20 of them 30 feet in length.'" ...|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} {{statistical analysis}} of corrosion failures of <b>lead-sheathed</b> <b>cables</b> that serve as primary communication links at Kennedy Space Center. In study, corrosion-failure data analyzed by use of Weibull distribution in effort to assess effectiveness of cathodic protection and to predict future failures...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lead-sheathed</b> <b>cables</b> {{were also}} used for {{telephone}} cables, as the lead outer sheath lasted well buried in wet ground. Jointing such cables could also require wiped lead joints. A typical such joint would involve a joint or tee junction between cables, with the copper pairs inside joined by fine soldering and insulating, then the overall joint wrapped in lead sheet and soldered. Such jointing continued until the 1960s {{and the availability of}} polyethylene sheathed cables.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1883 as an agent for the US Western Electric company that also had a factory in Antwerp, Belgium. The London operation sold US-designed telephones and exchanges to fledgling British telephone companies. Because {{of the costs of}} importing product, the company purchased a failing electrical cable factory at North Woolwich in London in 1898. In addition to making <b>lead-sheathed</b> <b>cables,</b> the factory started assembling equipment from components imported from Belgium and the US, and introduced manufacturing subsequently. Using advanced American thinking and designs, the company incorporated as a British legal entity in 1910.|$|R
