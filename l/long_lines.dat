5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food {{from other parts of the}} region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E

40|$|Bottom <b>long</b> <b>line</b> is an {{important}} gear for catching demersal fish and normally uses fresh fish as bait. Recent development indicates that the fishing grounds for bottom <b>long</b> <b>line</b> are further away from the coast and consequently bait with longer life-time may be needed. Research {{on the use of}} fresh and salted fish baits for bottom <b>long</b> <b>line</b> has been conducted in the eastern Bali waters.

The results showed that the catch of bottom <b>long</b> <b>line</b> using fresh bait was significantly higher than that for salted bait indicating that other suitable preservation techniques are necessary...|$|R
5|$|The {{governments of}} the islands in the {{predicted}} path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats {{in preparation for the}} storm. Also on the island, citizens formed <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50mph (80km/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs.|$|E
5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded {{a tremendous amount}} of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
5|$|By August22, city {{officials}} in Corpus Christi, Texas {{declared a state}} of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region. Tens of thousands of residents were urged to evacuate coastal areas and seek refuge in local shelters or with relatives further inland. An estimated 180,000 people in the state left their residences ahead of the storm. The Corpus Christi International Airport closed midday on August 22. Later that day, Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down. Highways throughout the area were congested due to the large-scale evacuations and <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> for gas and emergency items developed. Three schools, two universities and a college were closed on August23 and remained closed for several days.|$|E

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in <b>long</b> <b>lines,</b> mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E
5|$|Larger {{species of}} procellariid face similar {{problems}} to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait from the <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> {{as they are}} being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning. In {{the case of the}} spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to gillnet fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).|$|E
5|$|The Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited {{recommended}} Bermuda {{residents to}} buy hurricane supplies such as candles, batteries, and non-perishable foods, to fill bathtubs and extra containers with water, and fill gasoline tanks for automobiles. In preparation, residents formed <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> at gas stations, banks, and supermarkets. All government offices and many businesses {{closed on the}} day prior to the hurricane hitting. All schools were closed, while all flights {{in and out of}} the island were canceled. Officials opened emergency shelters, and recommended 2,000 low-lying residents to evacuate; a hotel on the south shore of the island was evacuated as well. Several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane. Local insurance companies on Bermuda experienced a great increase in business, as residents renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses, though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck. The arrival of Fabian forced the cancellation or delay of several sports events, including a cricket match, a football game, and a dinghy race.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{was able}} to {{maintain}} transport to its front lines over <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued {{to arrive at the}} front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition, but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid-August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no resupply of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area.
