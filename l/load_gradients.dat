40|$|AbstractCurrently, {{the main}} field of {{application}} of additive manufacturing processes is shifting from research laboratories to production facilities. Simulation models can foster this transition by providing support in process development and design. This paper introduces approaches to modelling the beam-material interaction in laser beam melting on a level of detail that allows the simulation of the whole build-up process of parts, not only of single laser tracks. Thus both the achievable result accuracy and the needed calculation time are discussed. For this purpose, fundamental correlations to link process characteristics with model parameters are explained. Subsequently, four modelling approaches are analysed. After an introduction of the well-known method of applying a uniform load on a whole layer compound (e.  g. [1]), the developed methods are discussed which allow modelling the beam-material interaction on a more detailed level. Thereby, the focus lies {{on the ability to}} model <b>load</b> <b>gradients</b> perpendicular to the build direction. This article is completed with a discussion of simulated temperature curves for selected monitoring points using two different modelling approaches...|$|E

Traditionally base load plants are now forced to operate as peaking plants. A familiar transition in upcoming years is expected in Croatia and coal power plant operators are preparing accordingly. To evaluate cycling capabilities and control system operation for flexible operation of selected 210 MW coal plant, series of tests with different <b>load</b> <b>gradients</b> were performed and results were thoroughly analyzed. Two possible “bottlenecks” are identified, thermal stress in superheater header, and achievable ramping rate considering operational limitations of coal feeders, firing system and evaporator dynamics. Several unexpected readings were observed, usually caused by malfunctioning sensors and equipment, resulting in unexpected oscillations of superheated steam temperature. Based on superheater geometry and experimental data, maximal steam temperature gradient during ramping was evaluated. Since thermal stress was well inside the safety margins, the simulation model of the whole boiler {{was used to evaluate}} achievable ramping on electric side...|$|E
40|$|Summary- A {{centripetal}} {{temperature gradient}} {{takes place in}} Grana Padano (GP) during moulding because of the slow heat transfer within the cheese and the fast cooling of the outer part. This gradient, {{in combination with the}} low pH value, induces a centripetal inactivation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Throughout the ripening process, the activity of the enzyme keeps> 3 105 mU/kg cheese in the peripheral zones and < 300 mU in the core. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the presence of heat <b>load</b> <b>gradients</b> and ALP inactivation improves the analytical distinction between GP and imitation hard cheeses and affects the ripening behaviour. DifferentIy ripened sam-pies of traditional GP, grana cheese of reduced size, or made from pasteurized milk following GP tech-nology, or collected at the market were submitted to a stratigraphie study. For each cheese sample, subsequent portions collected from the rind to the core were analyzed for moi sture and water activ-ity, aw ' ALP activity, furosine, free ami no acids (FAA), casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) and free fatty acids (FFA). Regarding cheese characterization, thermal treatments of cheese milk can be rec-ognized in GP only by determining the enzyme activity in the most peripheral portions. When the size of the cheese is reduced, cooling in moulding is faster and ALP inactivation in the core is lower. When the moulded cheese is heated, inactivation of the enzyme also takes place in the outer parts. Th...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} {{well-balanced}} finite-volume method for the accurate numerical solution of the equations governing suspended sediment and bed load transport in two-dimensional shallow-water flows. The modelling system consists of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow-water equations for the hydrodynamical model; (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments; and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphodynamics. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite-volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also employ an adaptive procedure in the finite-volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes and incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentrations and bed <b>load</b> <b>gradients</b> that may form in the approximate solutions. Details are given on the implementation of the method, and numerical results are presented for two idealized test cases, which demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and its applicability in predicting dam-break flows over erodible sediment beds.

This model is extended to include the e#ects of free boundary conditions and non-constant <b>load</b> <b>gradients</b> and then used to predict {{the strength of a}} Ti- 6 Al- 4 V matrix reinforced with Sigma SiC fibers under 4 point flexure testing. The predicted tensile and flexure strengths agree very well with the values measured by Gundel and Wawner and Ramamurty et al. The composite strength of disordered spatial fiber distributions is investigated and is shown to have a distribution similar to the corresponding ordered composite, but with a mean strength that decreases (as compared to the ordered composite) with increasing Weibull modulus. A modified Batdorf-type analytic model is developed and similarly extended to the case of non-uniform loading to predict the strength of composites under tension and flexure. The flexure model is found to be inappropriate for application to the experimental materials, but the tensile model yields predictions similar to the Local Load Sharing models for the experimental materials. The ideas and predictions of the Batdorf-type model, which is essentially an approximation to the simulation model, are then compared in more detail to a simulationbased model developed by Ibnabdeljalil and Curtin to more generally assess the accuracy of the Batdorf model in predicting tensile strength and notch strength versus composite size and fiber Weibull modulus. The study shows the Batdorf model to be accurate for tensile strength at high Weibull moduli and to ca [...] ...|$|E

Long term scenarios of electricity generation and demand in Europe until 2040 {{can be found in}} Eurel (2012). To maintain the high standard of security of supply in the German grid, a Task Force of VDE has investigated the needs to balance the German energy system under the aspect of high penetration of RES. For the analysis of the consequences for the non-renewable power generation, a simulation model of the German energy system had been elaborated, which considers the development of RES shown in the reference scenario (VDE AT 40, 2012), for the following development of RES until the year 2020 : wind 60  GW, PV 60  GW, run-of-river hydro 5  GW (constant) and biomass 7  GW.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 42 - 43) Braided channel {{systems in}} rivers commonly {{are associated with}} abundant sediment <b>load,</b> <b>gradients</b> steeper than meandering and straight channels, and mobile banks owing to poor sediment cohesion. The Owens River flows through the Owens Valley in eastern California and over most of its ~ 295 km course it is a low gradient meandering system actively entrenching in its own floodplain. However, the final 8 km of the Owens River are characterized by a rapidly shifting braided system. In {{order to understand the}} nature of the braided section and the geomorphic change it experiences, two field surveys were conducted (June 2009 and June 2010). These surveys allowed for calculation of sinuosity (1. 0934 in 2009 and 1. 1956 in 201 0), gradient (0. 00213 in 2009 and 0. 00211 in 2010), percent slope (0. 2103 in 2009 and 0. 2078 in 2010), and unit stream power (2. 8125 Wm 2 in 2009 and 7. 5942 Wm 2 in 2010). In addition to the surveys 32 sediment samples were collected for grain size analysis. Statistical analysis of the samples showed the river system is dominated by moderately-sorted medium sand. Flow in the lower Owens River is completely controlled by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Over the finalS km, discharge is reduced to - 1. 13 m 3 s- 1 with the rest of the water being diverted from the lower Owens River to the Los Angeles aqueduct for use by the city of Los Angeles. Comparison of the data with data from other braided streams reveals that the Owens River behaves more like a meandering or straight channel, in terms of gradient, percent slope, and unit stream power. Ultimately, it appears the reason for braiding over the last 8 km is a result of an abundant sediment load and a dramatic loss of discharge. An increase of discharge in this section would result in a larger unit stream power and increase the ability to carry suspended sediment, possibly resulting in the channel reverting to a meandering system similar to its upstream reaches...|$|E

The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the presence of heat <b>load</b> <b>gradients</b> and ALP inactivation improves the analytical distinction between GP and imitation hard cheeses and affects the ripening behaviour. Differently ripened samples of traditional GP, grana cheese of reduced size, or made from pasteurized milk following GP technology, or collected at the market were submitted to a stratigraphic study. For each cheese sample, subsequent portions collected from the rind to the core were analyzed for moisture and water activity, a(w), ALP activity, furosine, free amino acids (FAA), casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) and free fatty acids (FFA). Regarding cheese characterization, thermal treatments of cheese milk can be recognized in GP only by determining the enzyme activity in the most peripheral portions. When the size of the cheese is reduced, cooling in moulding is faster and ALP inactivation in the core is lower. When the moulded cheese is heated, inactivation of the enzyme also takes place in the outer parts. The furosine values, which describe the extent of heat load in dairy systems, increase from the outer part to the GP core (from IO mg to 60 mg/ 100 g protein). This gradient is unaffected by prolonged ripening, but changes when modifications in technological parameters such as pasteurization of milk, forced heating in moulding and reduction of cheese size are introduced. The distribution of ALP and furosine values within the cheese constitutes a distinctive parameter between GP and its imitation products. Regarding cheese ripening, all the values of chemical indices adopted for describing the ripening of GP show a progressive increase from the inner to the outer portions of nine- or 15 -month-old cheese samples. These patterns are more pronounced for most of the FAA, and are marked for free serine which increases in the outer zones up to 50 % more than in the core. The amount of 'enzyme resistant' CPP beta-CN(f 16 - 22) 3 P, the accumulation of which requires the presence of active phosphatases and aminopeptidases, has the same stratigraphic behaviour as that of FAA. The close correlation (r = - 0. 97) between furosine and FAA values suggests a possible effect of the heat load occurring in moulding on the centripetal ripening of GP...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is developed}} {{to provide a}} reliable and quantitative structural health monitoring information with emphasis on three properties, namely on locating the anomaly, modeling the anomaly profile, and identifying the damage inside the disturbed structures. Toward this end, a numerical method is developed to reconstruct the anomaly inside the monitored structure from the reflected spectrum of the Bragg gratings that are fabricated into the single mode (SM FBG) or high birefringence fiber (Hi-Bi FBG). 	Firstly, {{the effects of a}} non-uniform distribution of the transversal load and temperature on the FBG are analyzed and the perturbed reflected spectrum is modeled by introducing the change of the refractive indices and grating period along the fiber by using the transfer matrix formulation method. 	Furthermore, an inverse method based on the genetic algorithm (GA) is developed for reconstruction of non-uniform applied anomalies from the perturbed reflected spectrum. The genetic algorithm retrieves the changes in the characteristics of the sensor from the measured spectra information by encoding the refractive index or the grating period distribution along the Bragg grating into the genes. 	Moreover, the effects of the simultaneously applied transversal and longitudinal forces on an FBG sensor are analyzed. The study on the effects of the simultaneous transversal and longitudinal forces on an FBG sensor would eliminate the need for the FBGs to be installed on both the orthogonal directions on top of the monitored surface. Consequently, the applied strain measurements can be achieved by parallel fibers in one direction. This will reduce the number of sensors and the complexity of the monitoring system. The perturbed reflected spectra are modeled by the transfer matrix formulation method. Furthermore, the anomaly gradients along the sensor’s length are determined from the intensity spectrum of the sensor by means of the GA. Additionally, the presented functionality of the GA algorithm is tested on a multiplexed FBG sensor system and the anomaly is modeled along a series of the sensors. Consequently, both the location and the model of the anomaly distribution are obtained. 	Secondly, the effects of the strain and the temperature changes on the Hi-Bi FBG are studied and the reflected intensity spectrums of the polarized modes of the sensor, which are affected by a non-uniform distribution of the temperature or the strain, are modeled theoretically. Each Bragg reflection corresponding to the principal axes of the fiber has different dependencies on temperature and strain. Using this property, the type of the anomaly can be specifically identified and specified. Furthermore, the temperature and the transversal <b>load</b> <b>gradients</b> along the sensor’s length are determined from the intensity spectrum of the sensor by means of the GA. The solution of the genetic algorithm is expressed in terms of the characteristic changes of the sensor, which are correlated with a non-uniform anomaly distribution inside the monitored structure. The presented methods are verified through extensive set of numerical case studies and scenarios. ...|$|E

Nonuniform two-dimensional hygroscopic gradients are obtained from a finite difference solution of the diffusion equation. It is shown that hygroscopic induced stresses can be larger than those resulting from mechanical and thermal loading, and that {{the distribution of the}} interlaminar normal stress may be changed significantly {{in the presence of a}} two-dimensional moisture gradient in the boundary layer of a composite laminate...|$|R

The one is {{strictly}} railways,that is theoretical theses for calculation of locomotive <b>load</b> atrespective <b>gradient.</b> The second is {{an overview of}} computer programMS Access with the basic terms and definitions includedin the program itself It is intended to bring closer the languageof information technology to the railways. The developed programfor calculating the allowed mass of trains that can behauled by certain locomotives enables fast calculation of any ofthe traction variants. A limitation related to mass has been includedin the program...|$|R
