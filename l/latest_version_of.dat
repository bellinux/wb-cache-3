5|$|The Steam {{client was}} first made {{available}} for public beta testing in January 2003 during the beta period for Counter-Strike 1.6, {{for which it was}} mandatory to install and use. At the time, Steam's primary function was streamlining the patch process common in online computer games. Steam was an optional component for all other games. 80,000–300,000 gamers tested the system when it was in its beta period. The system and website choked under the strain of thousands of users simultaneously attempting to play the <b>latest</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Counter-Strike. In 2004, the World Opponent Network was shut down and replaced by Steam. The online features of games which required World Opponent Network ceased to work unless they were converted to Steam.|$|E
5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} the <b>latest</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to {{a shortage of}} resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, {{the final stage of}} the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E

5|$|On 31 October 1941, II. Gruppe flew {{its last}} combat {{missions}} over the northern Crimea. The Gruppe was then ordered {{to return to}} Germany, to be stationed at the Wiesbaden-Erbenheim airfield where it arrived in early November.

Gruppe had claimed 504 aerial victories {{for the loss of}} ten pilots killed or missing in action, and a further nine pilots who had been injured. In addition, 27 aircraft were lost or damaged beyond repair, a further 21 aircraft received heavy damaged and another 27 were lightly damaged. On 20 November 1941, Gollob was again posted to the test facility Erprobungstelle Rechlin. Gollob was replaced by Hauptmann Karl-Heinz Krahl as commander of II. Gruppe of JG3.
