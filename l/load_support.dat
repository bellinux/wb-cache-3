25|$|Geocells (also {{known as}} Cellular Confinement Systems) are {{three-dimensional}} honeycombed cellular structures that form a confinement system when infilled with compacted soil. Extruded from polymeric materials into strips welded together ultrasonically in series, the strips are expanded {{to form the}} stiff (and typically textured and perforated) walls of a flexible 3D cellular mattress. Infilled with soil, a new composite entity is created from the cell-soil interactions. The cellular confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles, thereby maintaining compaction and forms a stiffened mattress that distributes loads over a wider area. Traditionally used in slope protection and earth retention applications, geocells made from advanced polymers are being increasingly adopted for long-term road and rail <b>load</b> <b>support.</b> Much larger geocells are also made from stiff geotextiles sewn into similar, but larger, unit cells that are used for protection bunkers and walls.|$|E

The required level of operational reliability of single post horizontally <b>loaded</b> <b>supports</b> in case of variability of strain-strength features of foundation soils along the route may be provided by using optimal sizes and number of foundation beams creating additional reactive impedance of soil to the <b>loaded</b> <b>support.</b> Foundation beams laid in soil perpendicular to a horizontally <b>loaded</b> <b>support</b> for increasing its bearing capacity are rather widely used.

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanical}} properties of single layer thick-walled cylinder under the working condition and common failure forms were analyzed, {{and the results}} showed that there’s limitation to improve the <b>load</b> <b>supporting</b> capacity only by increasing the wall thickness and the strength of materials. The effective way to improve the stress distribution of single layer thick-walled cylinder is to make the cylinder forced by prestressing. The prestress on the cylinder can counterbalance a portion of the working tensile stress. Firstly, this paper describes the structural of prestressed cylinder of multilayer shrink-on and points out its disadvantage. Secondly, based on the shrink-on cylinder, three kinds of improved cylinder structure of split block shrink-on type, autofrettaged shrink-on type and wire intertwined type are elaborated. The principle, the key technology and the process methods of prestressed processing are parsed. Finally, research directions on the innovative cylinder structure with high <b>load</b> <b>supporting</b> capacity are put forward...|$|R

When the soil contained within a CCS is subjected to pressure, {{as in the case}} of a <b>load</b> <b>support</b> application, it causes lateral stresses on perimeter cell walls.

50|$|CCS is a green {{solution}} that makes civil infrastructure projects more sustainable. In <b>load</b> <b>support</b> applications, {{by reducing the}} amount and type of infill needed to reinforce soil, the usage of haul and earthmoving equipment is reduced.

When used for slope applications, perforated CCS provides excellent soil protection, water drainage and growth stratum for plants. The long-term design life of advanced CCS technology means that maintenance and the associated environmental costs are significantly reduced, as are long-term economic costs.|$|E

50|$|Grass pavers, plastic turf {{reinforcing}} grids (PTRG), and geocells (cellular confinement systems) are honeycombed 3D grid-cellular systems, made of thin-walled HDPE {{plastic or}} other polymer alloys. These provide grass reinforcement, ground stabilization and gravel retention. The 3D structure reinforces infill and transfers vertical loads from the surface, distributing them over a wider area. Selection {{of the type}} of cellular grid depends to an extent on the surface material, traffic and loads. The cellular grids are installed on a prepared base layer of open-graded stone (higher void spacing) or engineered stone (stronger). The surface layer may be compacted gravel or topsoil seeded with grass and fertilizer. In addition to <b>load</b> <b>support,</b> the cellular grid reduces compaction of the soil to maintain permeability, while the roots improve permeability due to their root channels.|$|E
