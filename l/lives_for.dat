5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> over two years. It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each instar becoming {{larger and}} more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> about 51 days as an adult.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Prince Nicholas eloped with Ioana Doletti, a {{divorced}} woman. Marie strongly disapproved of her son's actions and felt hurt by Doletti's repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother. Although she blamed {{the women in}} her sons' <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> a while, she also came to blame herself, for failing to educate them properly. However, she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu, even after Carol's pleas. Until her last years, Marie seldom even mentioned Lupescu's name.|$|E

5|$|Located to {{the right}} of the cathedral's sacristy is the side chapel of Our Lord's Passion. Given by J.J. Braga, a parishioner from Portugal, it was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs after the 1997–2002 renovation. The chapel was chosen out of the four to commemorate the then-newly canonised saints because it was the most thematically similar, in that the martyrs gave up their <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> the faith, emulating Jesus' {{sacrifice}} to save mankind. New stained glass windows were installed depicting the saints.|$|E
5|$|Many, if {{not most}} Mauritians are unaware of the {{existence}} of such a graveyard in Mauritius.

5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> a cause.|$|E

Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope {{to take control}} of the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might pay with their <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on the generals. These men were quick to report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday <b>lives.</b> <b>For</b> example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is active during the night, makes nests of sedge and grass, and {{occasionally}} builds runways. Its diverse diet includes plants, fungi, {{and a variety}} of animals. Population densities are usually below 10 per ha (four per acre) and home ranges vary from 0.23 to 0.37ha (0.57 to 0.91acres), depending on sex and geography. Litters of generally three to five young are born after a pregnancy around 25 days, mainly during the summer. Newborns are helpless at birth, but are weaned after a few weeks. Several animals prey on the marsh rice rat, including the barn owl, and it usually <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> less than a year in the wild. It is infected by many different parasites and harbors a hantavirus that also infects humans. The species is not of conservation concern, but some populations are threatened.|$|E

5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory {{to search for the}} legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} at 10 to 14 months. A {{seasonal}} breeder, {{the time when}} mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters oestrus (which lasts for four to six days), it seeks the company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation lasts for six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi <b>lives</b> <b>for</b> 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity.|$|E

5|$|If {{the hostages}} were still {{held by the}} Scots a decade later, they may well have feared for their <b>lives.</b> <b>For</b> in 1275, the {{continuation}} of the twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost reveal that Guðrøðr led a revolt on the island against the Scottish Crown. According to the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, Guðrøðr took possession of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process. Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: John de Vesci (died 1289), John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1277), Alan, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died 1310), and Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí (died ×1296). The identities of these men suggest that the Scottish force was composed of a small component of heavily armed knights, a contingent of infantry troops levied from the common army of Galloway, and a fleet of galleys gathered from the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers.

Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E
