40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the shear {{behaviour}} of steel plate girders under varying parameters such as aspect ratio, web slenderness ratio, ratio of flange to web thickness and the position of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffener.</b> The effect of these parameters on critical shear strength was compared analytically using finite element analysis. It was numerically demonstrated that the shear resistance of plate girder decreases with increase in aspect ratio and web slenderness ratio. The presence of thick flange improves the shear buckling strength of plate girder. The effective position of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffener</b> is at mid height of the web panel so that maximum shear resistance can be achieved. Index Terms—Girder; Shear resistance; Steel I...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effect}} of floating rings on the stability of longitudinally stiffened, thin-walled cylinders in axial compression. Mylar and Plexiglas were used as the skin and stiffening materials, respectively. The primary objectives of the investigation were: (1) to determine the increase in buckling stress that could be obtained by the addition of floating rings; (2) to determine the ring stiffness required for the maximum cylinder strength; (3) to determine what effect the number of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> had on the ability of the rings to increase the buckling stress; and (4) to examine the mechanism of buckling in the various ring-stringer combinations. A strength-weight analysis was also made. The addition of rings was found to be very effective in increasing the cylinder buckling load when 24 <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> were used. The addition of three rings to a cylinder with 24 <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> increased the buckling load 123 per cent with only a 20 per cent increase in weight. The ring stiffness beyond which there was no more increase in cylinder buckling strength was determined for the 24 stringer, two and three ring configurations. The ability of a ring to increase the buckling stress was markedly decreased when the number of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> was decreased from 24 to 12. The mechanism of buckling was also affected by the number of rings and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> In the light of the experimental results, two analytical methods are suggested for predicting the buckling stress of floating ring stiffened cylinders...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the patch loading of I-girder with two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> The {{configuration}} with two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> is often an excellent solution for beams of higher than 3 meters but {{has not yet been}} discussed in EN 1993 - 1 - 5. It is proposed a model of resistance harmonized with the methods used in Eurocodes for the other problems of buckling. The model contains three significant parts: the yield resistance, the elastic critical load used to determine the slenderness parameter and a reduction factor that relates the resistance to the slenderness. The thesis is structured into eight chapters, in addition to Preface and Table of Contents. Chapter 3 is a list of all symbols used. Chapter 4 presents a review of earlier works. Chapter 5 details the experimental investigations conducted by Gozzi (2007) on three samples without <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> Due to the difficulty of completing a personal physical model testing during the doctorate, it was decided to carefully study the laboratory work by Gozzi {{and use it as a}} basis for the calibration of the numerical study. In Chapter 6 is presented the first part of the numerical study. At this stage, the laboratory tests conducted by Gozzi have been reproduced through a finite element model. It is observed a good agreement of numerical results with test data. In Chapter 7 summarizes the results of numerical analysis of the girder with two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> Chapter 8 presents the procedure proposed for calculating the ultimate patch loading resistance of the girder with two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> Chapter 9 contains a summary of work done in this thesis with suggestions for the most important issues for future development. Chapter 10 lists the references. There are also three appendices with test data by Gozzi and data obtained from literature. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 10 {{full-scale}} {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the strength and behaviour of reinforced coped steel I-beams. The test parameters included the length of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> length of transverse <b>stiffeners,</b> combined <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>stiffeners,</b> double transverse stiffeners, cope depth and cope length. For the coped beam specimens without stiffeners, local web buckling failure occurred in the cope. For the specimens with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> only, the general failure mode was flexural yielding of the full beam section {{at the location of}} maximum bending moment followed by web crippling {{at the end of the}} cope between the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and the top flange of the full beam section. In contrast, the general failure mode for the specimens with combined <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>stiffeners</b> consisted of flexural yielding of the full beam section at the location of maximum bending moment followed by flange local buckling near the loading position. The test results show that the reinforcements were able to increase the capacity of the coped beam specimens significantly and the results also illustrate that in addition to cope depth, cope length also affects the behaviour and strength of the reinforced coped beam specimens. Based on the limited test data, a modification to the current reinforcement details for coped beams was proposed. The proposed reinforcement details accounted for the effects of various cope details. To increase the range of applicability of the proposed reinforcement details, a numerical study is currently underway to consider a wider range of cope details.

40|$|AASHTO LRFD {{requires}} {{the use of}} longitudinal stiffeners in plate girder webs when the web slenderness D/tw is greater than 150. This practice is intended to limit the lateral flexing of the web plate during construction and at service conditions. AASHTO accounts for an increase in the web bend buckling resistance due to the presence of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffener.</b> However, when the theoretical bend buckling capacity of the stiffened web is exceeded under strength load conditions, the Specifications do not consider any contribution from the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffener</b> to the girder resistance. That is, the AASHTO LRFD web bend buckling strength reduction factor Rb applied in these cases is based on an idealization of the web neglecting the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffener.</b> This deficiency can have significant impact on girder resistance in regions of negative flexure. This research is aimed at evaluating the improvements that may be achieved by fully considering the contribution of web longitudinal stiffeners to the girder flexural resistance. Based on refined FE test simulations, this research establishes that minimum size longitudinal stiffeners, per current AASHTO LRFD requirements, contribute significantly to the post buckling flexural resistance of plate girders, and can bring as much as a 60 % increase in the flexural strength of the girder. A simple cross-section Rb model is proposed {{that can be used to}} calculate the girder flexural resistance at the yield limit state. This model is developed based on test simulations of straight homogenous girders subjected to pure bending, and is tested extensively and validated for hybrid girders and other limit states. It is found that there is a substantial deviation between the AISC/AASHTO LTB resistance equations and common FE test simulations. Research is conducted to determine the appropriate parameters to use in FE test simulations. Recommended parameters are identified that provide a best fit to the mean of experimental data. Based on FE simulations on unstiffened girders using these recommended parameters, a modified LTB resistance equation is proposed. This equation, used in conjunction with the proposed Rb model also provides an improved handling of combined web buckling and LTB of longitudinally stiffened plate girders. It is observed that the noncompact web slenderness limit in the Specifications, which is an approximation based on nearly rigid edge conditions for the buckling of the web plate in flexure is optimistic for certain cross-sections with narrow flanges. This research establishes that the degree of restraint at the edges of the web depend largely on the relative areas of the adjoining flanges and the area of the web. An improved equation for the noncompact web slenderness limit is proposed which leads to a better understanding and representation of the behavior of these types of members. Ph. D...|$|E

It presents the rules for determination of plate buckling effects due to direct stresses. Compression and bending resistance was calculated {{for a wide range of}} cross sections, using the computer program EXCEL, and the effects of different parameters were studied. The parameters investigated were: the location of the stiffener, the slenderness of the plate, the plate aspect ratio, the stiffener to plate area ratio, the flange to web area ratio, the steel grade and the web height. Separate calculations were made for three different cases: I-girder stiffened with one or two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> under bending and plate stiffened with n <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> under compression. In EN 1993 - 1 - 5 the effects of plate buckling are taken into account by effective cross sectional areas, determined by reduction factors which depend on elastic critical buckling stresses. Calculation of critical stresses is based on simplified models which may have limited applicability. Elastic critical buckling stresses were calculated more accurately by using computer program EBPlate (energy method). In addition to the comparison of critical stresses we were interested in the effect that the different critical stresses have on the section resistance. Therefore, the critical plate buckling stress in the expressions given by EN 1993 - 1 - 5 was replaced by critical stresses from EBPlate calculation. The comparison of the results of both methods of calculation showed that the differences in critical stresses were differently reflected in the results for section resistance...|$|R

40|$|Ranging from {{agriculture}} to food processing, from mining {{to industrial}} processing, all these sectors {{have a need}} for the temporary storage of (dry) powdered, granular, and bulk materials between different stages {{of all kinds of}} manufacturing processes and between manufacturing process and transportation, or vice versa. Silos are therefore the perfect solution to meet this need, because they can easily store large volumes on a relatively limited floor space. Frequently, silos have a circular platform and are placed in elevated position. The latter can be achieved by a limited number of discrete equidistant supports around the barrel circumference. However, in such cases, large loads have to be transferred to the limited number of supports, causing locally high axial compressive stress concentrations, and consequently premature failure due to plastic yielding and/or elastic buckling (depending on the thickness of the silo wall). A possible answer to avoid these problems is to provide a partial-height U-shaped <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffener</b> above each support. Such stiffeners allow for a more gradual load transfer to the supports, increasing the maximum failure load. This paper aims to map the influence of the dimensions of such longitudinal stiffeners (i. e. the parameters of the cross-section and the height) on the failure behaviour of thick-walled silos. All results and findings are based on geometrically and materially non-linear analyses or GMNA performed with finite element software. The simulations indicate that correctly, for thick-walled silos, failure will always occur by (elasto-) plastic yielding. Depending on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffener</b> cross-section, the location of failure will occur in the stiffened zone of the silo just above the supports for silos with stiffeners with a small cross-section, whereas for stiffeners with larger cross-sections, failure occurs in the unstiffened zone just above the terminations of the stiffeners. In addition, the stiffener width in circumferential and radial direction have respectively an advantageous and a disadvantageous influence on the failure load. Finally, the stiffener height only has a positive impact on the failure load when failure occurs in the unstiffened silo wall. This can be addressed to the distribution of the supporting force over the entire circumference with higher stiffeners...|$|E

Based on previous studies, the presence of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> in the web has not been considered in the calculation procedures. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> in steel plate girders are primarily used to increase bending and shear strength. In the last two decades, a number of projects regarding {{the positive effect of}} longitudinal stiffening on the strength of plate girder webs to concentrated load have been conducted around the world. The results have shown that this type of stiffening enhances ultimate strength for web crippling depending on the position of the stiffener that modifies the slenderness of the directly loaded panel; and flexural and torsional rigidities of the stiffener. This paper presents a methodology for the consideration of longitudinal stiffening on the ultimate strength of plate girders webs subjected to concentrated loads. The methodology is based on the plastic collapse mechanism observed experimentally, in which plastic hinges are formed in the loaded flange and yield lines result in the portion of the web limited by the loaded flange and stiffener. Then, a closed-form solution accounting for the influence of the stiffener is developed following the current expression available in the AISC specifications. Theoretical predictions are compared with available test results, showing that the predicted ultimate loads are in good agreement with experimental results. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new analysis method for orthotropic cylindrical shell structures with arbitrary stiffness distribution. The structural model consists of ring frame elements, orthotropic membrane panels and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffeners</b> (stringer). The element stiffness matrix of the orthotropic panel {{is based on}} the displacements functions of its boundary only. The boundary value problem is solved by developing the stresses in Taylor series and applying the principal of virtual work (virtual forces). By this way it is possible to have large elements able to describe stress peaks. The method is applied for Booster load introduction into launcher structures and reduces the number of degrees of freedom drastically, allowing rapid analyses necessary for parametric optimization in the pre-design phase...|$|R
