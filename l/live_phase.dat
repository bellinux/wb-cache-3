40|$|International audienceIn {{the process}} of hematogenous cancer metastasis, tumor cells (TCs) must shed into the blood stream, survive in the blood circulation, migrate through the {{vascular}} endothelium (extravasation) and proliferate in the target organs. However, the precise mechanisms by which TCs penetrate the endothelial cell (EC) junctions remain {{one of the least}} understood aspects of TC extravasation. This question has generally been addressed under static conditions, despite the important role of flow induced mechanical stress on the circulating cell-endothelium interactions. Moreover, flow studies were generally focused on transient or firm adhesion steps of TC-EC interactions and did not consider TCs spreading or extravasation. In this paper, we used a parallel-plate flow chamber to investigate TC-EC interactions under flow conditions. An EC monolayer was cultured on the lower plate of the flow chamber to model the endothelial barrier. Circulating TCs were introduced into the flow channel under a well-defined flow field and TC cell shape changes on the EC monolayer were followed in vitro with <b>live</b> <b>phase</b> contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Two spreading patterns were observed: radial spreading which corresponds to TC extravasation, and axial spreading where TCs formed a mosaic TC-EC monolayer. By investigating the changes in area and minor/major aspect ratio, we have established a simple quantitative basis for comparing spreading modes under various shear stresses. Contrary to radial spreading, the extent of axial spreading was increased by shear stress...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} for efficient usage of small trace caches. A trace cache can significantly increase the performance of wide out-oforder processors, but to be effective, {{the size of the}} trace cache should be large. Power and timing considerations indicate that a small trace cache is desirable, with special mechanisms to increase its effectiveness despite the limited size. Hence several authors have proposed various filtering methods to select "good traces " for keeping in the trace cache, from among the general population of traces. This paper {{presents a}} new filtering technique, which is based on sampling. Our new technique suggests that instead of building all the traces and trying to select the good ones among them, it is more efficient to make a preliminary selection of traces. This selection is based on a random sampling approach. We show that the Sampling Filter improves trace cache and overall system performance, while reducing power dissipation. The Sampling Filter reduces admission of traces that are not used prior to their eviction from the cache, and prolongs the percentage of time a trace is in its <b>live</b> <b>phase</b> during its stay in the cache. Moreover, the Sampling Filter reduces duplication between the trace cache and the instruction cache and thus reduces the overall misses in the first level of cache hierarchy. 1...|$|E

30|$|Kanode and Haddad (2009) {{stated that}} an important, but incorrect, {{assumption}} {{was made that}} GDSE follows the waterfall method. More recently, researchers have agreed that it must follow the incremental model (Munassar and Govardhan 2010) because it combines the waterfall method with an iterative process. A major concern, reported by Petrillo et al. (2009), was that very poor development methodologies are commonly used by developers for software creation in the game industry. The GDSE appears as a question in many forms attempting to determine what types of practices are used. However, {{there is no single}} answer to this question. Few researchers have explored GDSE practices and then tried to answer questions like the phases of the GDSE process life cycle. Blitz game studios (2014) proposed six phases for the GDSE process life cycle: Pitch (initial design and game concept), Pre-production (game design document), Main production (implementation of game concepts), Alpha (internal testers), Beta (third-party testers), and the Master phase (game launch). Hendrick (2014) proposed a five-phase GDSE process life cycle consisting of Prototype (initial design prototype), Pre-production (design document), Production (asset creation, source code, integration aspects), Beta (user feedback), and, finally, the <b>Live</b> <b>phase</b> (ready to play). McGrath (2014) divided the GDSE process life cycle into six phases: Design (initial design and game design document), Develop/redevelop (game engine development), Evaluate (if not passed, then redevelop), Test (internal testing), Review release (third-party testing), and Release (game launch). Another GDSE process life cycle proposed by Chandler (2010) consisted of four phases: Pre-production (design document and project planning), Production (technical and artistic), Testing (bug fixing), and, finally, the Post-production phase (post-mortem activities). The latest GDSE process life cycle in 2013 proposed by Ramadan and Widyani (2013) was based on the four GDSE process life cycles previously described. They proposed six phases: Initiation (rough concept), Pre-production (creation of game design and prototype), Production (formal details, refinement, implementation), Testing (bug reports, refinement testing, change requests), Beta (third-party testers), and Release (public release).|$|E

40|$|What is Bluebird AR? Bluebird AR was the ABC's {{alternate}} reality drama set {{around the}} leak of Bluebird, a clandestine geoengineering initiative created by eco-billionaire Harrison Wyld. Proposing a fictional scenario {{set against a}} backdrop of real world possibilities, Bluebird AR took some of the conventions of the well-established alternate reality game (ARG) genre and pulled them into the relatively new area of online drama, to create a hybrid entertainment form best described as 'participatory drama'. With Bluebird AR's interactive narrative centred on the experimental science of geoengineering, the deliberate manipulation of the Earth's atmosphere to counteract global warming, the events and characters in the Bluebird story were entirely fictional but fused with reality online. Inhabiting a mixture of third party social media spaces and websites created by the ABC, the story incorporated real online articles, scientific journals, media and debate around geoengineering. In an Australian first, ABC Innovation launched Bluebird AR on 27 April 2010, with a 6 week <b>live</b> <b>phase.</b> Audience members were invited to play collectively to help 'unlock the drama' and push forward the emerging narrative, or passively watch the story unfold in real-time across the internet. Bluebird AR subverted ARG conventions with the high quality of its production and assets, and raised the stakes for online drama with its level of audience participation. " © 2014 ABC "Introduction One of the most exciting creative challenges of producing Bluebird AR was formulating the broad array of visual styles and treatments required for the project's diverse range of content. Many assets also needed to translate well not only online but across other media, including television and print. With the project's producers keen to create a visually rich narrative with high production values from the outset, inspiration for the production design for various aspects of the Bluebird story began in the earliest pitching phase in September 2008. Particular visual treatments and styles for Bluebird's characters, their web spaces and real world possessions were formulated concurrently with the creation of their profiles. Ideas around how various clues and gameplay spaces might look and feel were also explored at this early stage. Bluebird AR's small but tight creative team produced 7 website designs and brands, motion graphics for title sequences and logo animations, rotoscope animation, 3 D compositing and animation, 3 D wireframes and schematics, countless Photoshop composites, and a vast array of character assets for the DC (including Kyle's Bluebird Labs security pass and resignation letter, Kruger's American and Russia passports and birth certificate, Harrison's divorce papers, and more) …" © 2014 AB...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of antioxidant protected (AOX) or unprotected fresh or oxidized corn oil on animal performance, oxidative status of tissues, pork quality, shelf-life, and antioxidant activity of skeletal muscle of finishing pigs. The experimental design was a complete randomized block design (CRBD) in a factorial arrangement (2 × 2), with 2 levels of corn oil (fresh or oxidized corn oil) and 2 levels of antioxidant (AOX; with or without AOX). A total of 160 barrows were fed for 56 days one of the following experimental diets: fresh oil, fresh oil + AOX, oxidized oil or oxidized oil + AOX. Animal performance was evaluated and oxidative status of blood, liver and jejunum was determined, including thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), free carbonyl, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as oxidative indicators, as well as fatty acid composition, vitamin A and vitamin E concentration. After the <b>live</b> <b>phase,</b> a total of 32 barrows were selected for pork quality and shelf life evaluation. Subjective and objective quality traits were assessed. Loin chops were collected for drip loss, proximate analyses as well as sensory attributes at 0, 7 and 14 d of aging, that include juiciness, tenderness, off-flavor and oxidized odor. Also, loin chops and ground Boston Butt were evaluated for discoloration percentage and TBARS after 0, 7, 14 and 21 d in the retail display case. Fatty acid, and vitamin A and vitamin E concentration were determined in backfat and belly fat samples. Finally, diaphragm and loin samples were collected and AOX enzyme activity determinations including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were performed. Barrows fed diets formulated with fresh oil had an increased cumulative ADG (P< 0. 03), ADFI (P< 0. 04) after 56 d and increased final weight (P< 0. 03) when compared to animals fed oxidized oil. An increase (P< 0. 06) in TBARS values, a decrease (P< 0. 03) in GPx enzyme activity and a decrease (P< 0. 01) in Vitamin E concentration were observed in plasma from barrows fed diets formulated with oxidized oil. Also, an increase (P< 0. 04) in free carbonyl was detected in plasma from barrows fed diets formulated with AOX unprotected oil. In regards to pork quality and shelf-life, increased hot carcass weight (P< 0. 01) and carcass yield (P< 0. 01) were observed for pigs fed fresh oil and increased (P< 0. 05) carcass yield was observed for pigs fed AOX protected oil. Increased (P< 0. 03) moisture content was observed in loins from animals fed AOX unprotected oil and increased (P< 0. 04) moisture content and decreased (P< 0. 05) fat content were observed for animals fed oxidized oil. After 14 d of retail display, TBARS values were decreased (P< 0. 001) for loins from animals fed diets containing AOX protected fresh oil, and the decrease (P< 0. 001) continued until after 21 d. In backfat, vitamin A concentration was increased (P< 0. 02) in barrows fed fresh oil, and no oil or AOX effects were found for vitamin E concentration. In belly fat, an increase in vitamin A (P< 0. 05) and vitamin E (P< 0. 03) concentrations were observed for barrows fed AOX protected oil. Finally, SOD activity was increased (P< 0. 04) for diets formulated with AOX. Also, CAT and GPx enzyme activity were increased (P< 0. 01) in diaphragm compared to loin. In conclusion, oxidized oil had a negative impact on animal performance affecting ADG and ADFI resulting in a lighter final weight, also, increasing lipid oxidation and affecting antioxidant systems such as GPx and vitamin E in tissues. Pork quality was not impacted; however, shelf-life was positively affected by AOX protected fresh oil decreasing discoloration and lipid oxidation (TBARS). Finally, CAT and GPx activity were increased in muscles with higher oxidative metabolism, and SOD enzyme activity was increased in animals fed AOX protected oils...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: From September 2005 to February 2007 the Australian Government {{funded the}} Point of Care Testing (PoCT) in General Practice Trial, a multi-centre, cluster {{randomised}} controlled trial to determine the safety, clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and satisfaction of PoCT in General Practice. In total, 53 practices (23 control and 30 intervention) based in urban, rural or remote locations across three states (South Australia [SA], New South Wales [NSW] and Victoria [VIC]) participated in the Trial. Control practices had pathology testing performed by their local laboratory, while intervention practices conducted pathology testing by PoCT. In total, 4968 patients (1958 control and 3010 intervention) participated in the Trial. The point-of-care (PoC) tests performed by intervention practices were: haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) and urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) on patients with diabetes, total cholesterol, triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol on patients with hyperlipidaemia, and international normalised ratio (INR) on patients on anticoagulant therapy. Three PoCT devices measured these tests: the Siemens DCA 2000 (Siemens HealthCare Diagnostics, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) for HbA 1 c and urine ACR; Point of Care Diagnostics Cholestech LDX analyser (Point of Care Diagnostics; Sydney, NSW, Australia) for lipids; and the Roche CoaguChek S (Roche Diagnostics; Sydney, NSW, Australia) for INR. Point-of-care testing in the General Practice Trial was underpinned by a quality management framework which included an on-going training and competency program for PoCT device operators. This article describes the design, implementation and results of the training and competency program. METHODS: An education and training resource package was developed for the Trial consisting of a training manual, a set of A 3 laminated posters and a CD ROM. Five initial training workshops were held for intervention practices from each geographic region between August and October 2005 at three centres - Adelaide (SA), Bendigo (VIC) and Dubbo (NSW). These workshops combined theoretical training in the principles and practice of PoCT with 'hands on' practical training delivered in interactive small group sessions. At the completion of training, practice staff undertook a written and practical competency assessment and received a certificate of competency as a qualified device operator. Following each initial training workshop, practice staff completed a short satisfaction survey. Five refresher training workshops covering all geographic regions were delivered during late August 2006, coinciding with the 12 month point of the <b>live</b> <b>phase</b> of the Trial. At {{the completion of the}} Trial in February 2007, device operators completed a further questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty device operators from 31 practices completed training and competency assessment as part of the Initial Training Workshop series. A further 20 device operators from 12 of the practices were trained in the 12 month period after the initial workshops; 19 of these staff were from rural or remote practices. In total 80 device operators comprising 74 practice staff and six GPs from 31 practices were trained and received competency certificates as part of Trial. In all, 19 device operators left the Trial either through personal resignation from an existing practice or because their practice withdrew from the Trial; the majority (84 %) were from rural and remote practices. A total of 42 device operators from 25 practices attended refresher training {{in the second half of}} 2006. Results from the satisfaction questionnaire completed by device operators following the initial training workshops showed there was unanimous agreement that the posters were useful for the conduct of daily PoCT and practical training in small groups was satisfactory as a training method. The quality and appropriateness of the PoCT training resources and the workshop overall was rated as either good or excellent by all respondents (100 % and 78 %, respectively). The responses by device operators to the post-Trial satisfaction questionnaire found a high level of satisfaction with PoCT across all geographic regions. Device operators from remote practices had the highest satisfaction levels for quality of training, usefulness of the training manual, ease of use of devices, confidence in the accuracy of PoCT results and preference for PoCT over laboratory testing. The usefulness of the posters for conducting PoCT achieved the highest satisfaction rating among operators from all three geographic regions. However the highest staff turnover rates and the highest number of requests for training of additional staff were from rural and remote practices. CONCLUSION: The methods established for the implementation and delivery of training and competency assessment for the PoCT in General Practice Trial were appropriate and effective. Results of the evaluation showed rural and remote practices have a greater need for training and support compared to their urban counterparts and may require more flexible training options to cater for much higher rates of staff turnover.

(2010 a), Aptian sedimentation on the Arabian Platform (marginal part of Arabian Plate) was influenced by two cold phases: One short-lived phase in the earliest Aptian and a second longer <b>lived</b> <b>phase</b> in the Late Aptian. These cold phases caused glacio-eustatic large and rapid sea-level fluctuations in the order of 40  m and exposure of the platform before deposition of the Apt 1 and Apt 5 sequences. Extinction of the rudists in Apt 5 of the Arabian Platform and studied area may have been the result of climatic cooling of Aptian seawater (e.g., Strohmenger et al. 2010). Exposure of Aptian sediments in the latest Aptian–Early Albian (upper boundary of Dariyan Formation) also fits with another cooling event that was recognized in sedimentary facies and in the C- and O-isotope records (e.g., Weissert and Lini 1991) and discussed by Raven et al. (2010) in Aptian sediments of Qatar.|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to clarify the}} phenomenon of empathy, taking our 'lived experience' as its base. Some suggestions concerning its relation to understanding the other person are also given. In Chapter I, some of the significant studies of empathy (or sympathy) in philosophy and psy- chology are reviewed, and our everyday usage of the term 'empathy' is examined. Through these examinations, empathy is provisionally denned as 'to live the identical world with the other person in an affective experience'. In Chapter I, {{the meaning of the}} 'identity' in the above definition is explicated. The 'identity' here means the identity of the kernel' of our lived experience accompanied with some different implicit horizons. In Chapter I, in order to make explicit the <b>lived</b> <b>phase</b> of the identity, the traditional view of self and other-that is, the view in the subject-object scheme-is critically rejected. Only in the state of fusion of self and other, can both live the identical world. In Chapter W, the attitude under which a deep empathy could occur is clarified. And how the experience of empathy transforms the experiencer's world is also discussed. Finally, in Chapter V, the great significance of empathy, as one 'of the ways of understanding the other person, is emphatically pointed out...|$|R
