5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E
5|$|Wakeley saw Blast Corps as {{a puzzle}} game at its core. He was {{influenced}} by the 1994 Donkey Kong, in which the player begins each level with all the tools they need to finish but must <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them. Wakeley said this was Blast Corp core game mechanic. He was also inspired by the Super Mario 64 demo at the 1995 Space World, which introduced him to the 3D analog stick and spurred him achieve something similar. The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance.|$|E

5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E

40|$|For some time, Teacher Education {{policy and}} {{research}} has consistently argued that graduates are ill prepared <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in their practice (TEMAG, 2015). In Australia, an increasing regulatory environment means that Teacher Education providers {{need to meet}} national accreditation demands as well as design programs that address professional standards for graduates where an effective ICT use is a requirement. In an effort to have greater understanding of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> design Teacher Education programs that meet these challenges, this small scale study investigated where 69 pre-service teachers <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a number of ICT resources commonly used in primary and secondary schools. Findings suggest that they <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> many resources (particularly general-type resources) in their everyday life prior to undertaking their teaching qualification and that they <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a lesser number in university coursework or practicum in schools. A number of implications for Teacher Education conclude this paper...|$|R

In his ending, Batman offers him a spot on the Justice League, but Jaime takes a break from heroics and starts living a normal life with his family, whom he had not seen since the Scarab bonded to him.|$|E
25|$|Wang {{wrote the}} {{masterpiece}} Nong Shu for many practical reasons, {{but also as}} a means to aid and support destitute rural farmers in China looking for means to improve their economic livelihoods in the face of poverty and oppression during the Yuan period. Although the previous Song Dynasty was a period of high Chinese culture and relative economic and agricultural stability, the conquering Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty thoroughly damaged the economic and agricultural base of China during the conquest of it. Hence, a book such as the Nong Shu could help rural farmers maximize efficiency of producing yields and they could <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> various agricultural tools to aid their daily lives. However, it was not intended to be read by rural farmers (who were largely illiterate), but local officials who desired to research the best agricultural methods currently available that the peasants otherwise would know little of.|$|E
25|$|As a Saint, Seiya {{has been}} trained to <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the power of the}} Cosmos within his own body and use it for super {{strength}} and speed. The Pegasus Cloth he wears represents the Pegasus constellation, which is associated with Pegasus, the divine winged horse from Greek mythology; and protects his body with durability. Seiya trained for six years and defeated ten other trainees to obtain the Pegasus Cloth and the status of Saint of Athena. The Pegasus Bronze Cloth is damaged various times throughout the series, with Aries Mu typically responsible for repairs. In the manga, the Cloth changes appearance each time it is fixed, while it remains the same in the anime adaptation until the series' second arc. After the Gold Saints use their blood to revive the Bronze Cloths {{at the end of the}} Sanctuary arc, the Pegasus Cloth takes on a golden hue whenever Seiya charges his Cosmo to the maximum. The version of the Cloth that Seiya uses in the Hades arc possesses wings that allow him to fly, both normally and through dimensions. During Seiya's fight against Thanatos, it reaches its God Cloth state, which was last seen in the ages of myth and further increases Seiya's Cosmo and vitality.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Razer Naga had {{a positive}} reception, although many pointed out the obvious targeting towards MMO gamers. Nicholas Deleon on the tech site TechCrunch said the Naga is a good and comfortable mouse.

Ben Kuchera, of Ars Technica called it a [...] "niche product", stating the buttons were unappealing to people who did not play MMO games. The redesigned version of the Naga, called the Naga Epic Molten, received positive reviews for its design.|$|E
500|$|Skilled ninja can <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> other elements; ninja of the Jonin (lit. [...] "high ninja") rank are {{typically}} able to manipulate {{at least two}} elements. Kakashi Hatake has been shown using all 5 different elements in the Naruto series. Although these ninja can use their different elements separately with little effort, combining the two elements is impossible for ninja {{who do not have}} a genetic predisposition for it. Ninja with one of these genetic abilities can mix two specific elements to create an entirely new one. Haku, an antagonist introduced {{at the start of the}} series, can mix water and wind to create ice. Wood Style, a combination of earth and water unique to the First Hokage, Danzo, and Yamato, allows the user to produce wood.

[...] In {{one of the}} first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film's [...] "emotional truth [...] pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science" [...] that made it [...] "faithful to the source material while updating it [...] and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film [...] "an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least – since it certainly has its problems – a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways." [...] Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the [...] "impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG", and said, [...] "Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau [...] help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes".|$|E
