40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether American {{males with}} a high degree of control over their work situation pursue healthy <b>lifestyles</b> and rate their physical health more positively than those who score low on occupational self-direction. That is, are persons who control their work more likely to also try to control their health through living in a particularly healthy manner? We found that there was no support for a spillover effect from high occupational self-direction to enhanced participation in health <b>lifestyles</b> or more positive self-rated health. The findings suggest health <b>lifestyles</b> have spread throughout occupational work groups in the U.

5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic <b>lifestyle.</b> Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial <b>lifestyle,</b> a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial <b>lifestyle.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which young people's <b>lifestyles</b> are related to social class, their {{relationship}} with health behaviours, and variations in these relationships between countries are of central relevance to {{an assessment of the}} {{extent to which}} post-modern (global) influences have replaced those associated with traditional (local) social structures. A comparison between 15 year olds in Glasgow and Helsinki reveals a remarkably similar pattern of relationships. In both locations, involvement in commercial leisure was unrelated to class, as was sports/games in Glasgow, while conventional <b>lifestyles</b> (more middle class) and street-based <b>lifestyles</b> (more working class) were class associated. Furthermore, while <b>lifestyles</b> were strongly related to smoking, drinking and drug use, street-based and commercial leisure orientations elevating rates, sports/games reducing them, social class was of negligible consequence for health behaviours in both places. We conclude that, while there remains a link between social class and some <b>lifestyles,</b> notably in relation to street-based leisure, for the most part young people's <b>lifestyles</b> cut across class and national boundaries and have similar consequences for health behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} <b>lifestyles</b> of nursing {{students}} from a Colombian public university. Methods. A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 2014. 380 students answered by self-reporting the adapted version in Spanish of FANTASTIC <b>Lifestyles</b> Assessment Questionnaire of Wilson and Ciliska. Results. <b>Lifestyles</b> were poor in 9. 2 %, fair in 31. 3 %, good in 53. 7 %, and excellent in only 5. 8 % of the participants. Statistically-significant differences of the total mean score were not found when comparing with gender, age group, and course year, but were detected in two domains by gender: a) physical activity (higher score in men) and b) cigarette smoking (higher score in women). Conclusion. An important proportion of our nursing students has inadequate <b>lifestyles,</b> which means deferred risks for the development of chronic diseases. Universities should promote the training of the future professionals in nursing with knowledge and skills aimed at healthy <b>lifestyles...</b>|$|R
