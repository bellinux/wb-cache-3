40|$|From {{the late}} seventies to the present day, <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sedimentology</b> and lacustrine-related basin {{analysis}} have developed from a near-marginal aca- demic curiosity into a new ground-breaking multidisciplinary body of learning. The starting-point was economic interest in ancient lacustrine sequences as potential suppliers of natural resources such as raw materials (diatomites, clays), evaporite salts and energy (hydrocarbons and coal). The early discoveries of substantial hydrocarbon reserves connected with lacustrine facies in the western USA heralded the huge reserves found later in China, Brazil, western Africa, southeast Asia and the Caspian Sea, among other places...|$|E
40|$|On 21 April 2007, a Mw 6 · 2 {{earthquake}} struck Aysén fjord (Chilean Patagonia) {{and caused}} onshore and offshore mass movements which triggered tsunamis and density flows in the fjord. To {{better understand the}} facies successions in, and the intercalation of, the density-flow deposits, a study {{was made of the}} 2007 deposits in 22 short sediment cores taken in the inner Aysén fjord. By combining grain-size analysis with X-ray computed tomography scanning, it was possible to demonstrate that the encountered facies correspond to classical divisions of debrites and turbidites. The single-event deposits consist of a succession of several sub-deposits deposited under different flow directions and can be interpreted as stacked turbidites. Orientations of: (i) folds; (ii) imbricated mud clasts; (iii) backsets and foresets of climbing ripples; and (iv) asymmetrical convolute lamination were used to determine relative flow directions at the location of the cores. By assigning the basal flow of the stacked debrites and turbidites to the closest principal mass flow, the absolute flow directions of the sub-deposits were determined which, in combination with multibeam basin-floor morphology, allowed reconstruction of the 2007 density-flow successions in Aysén fjord. Furthermore, alternating flow directions provide evidence for a seiche induced by the density flows. It was concluded that X-ray computed tomography scans provide crucial information for reconstructing palaeoflows and can be a useful tool in marine and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sedimentology</b> and palaeoseismology. The multidirectionality of sub-deposits in turbidites is, next to differences in mineralogy, a new criterion to identify stacked turbidites. These multidirectional, stacked turbidites are an indication of simultaneous triggering of density flows and can therefore, in most cases, be attributed to earthquakes, ruling out other triggers, such as floods, storms or other sediment failures...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines moraine and lacustrine {{records of}} glacier fluctuations, {{in combination with}} palynological records of vegetation change, from the previously unstudied northwestern Ahklun Mountains in southwestern Alaska. Morain mapping reveals that ice-cap outlet glaciers {{in the study area}} extended ca. 60 km {{from the center of the}} Ahklun Mountians ice dome during the early Wisconsin (sensu lato), and ca. 40 km during the late Wisconsin. Correlations with well-studied moraines in the southern Ahklun Mountains indicate an asymmetry of glaciation over the range, with ice-cap outlet glaciers more extensive to the south. This asymmetry was more striking during the early Wisconsin (s. l.) than during the late Wisconsin. Alpine glaciers have repeatedly advanced from cirques within the study area. Because these alpine glaciers were confluent or sub-confluent with outlet glaciers during the late Wisconsin maximum, the alpine-glacier moraine record is relatively young. <b>Lacustrine</b> <b>sedimentology</b> from Little Swift Lake records significant retreat of alpine glaciers ca 12. 8 ka (coeval with the onsent of the North Atlantic Younger Dryas). Moraines upvalley of the lake suggests a minor glacier (or rock glacier) advance occurred ca 5. 5 ka. Lacustrine records of vegetation from Little Swift Lake extend back to ca. 13. 4 ka. Most vegetation changes resulted from the post-glacial spread of trees and shrubs, including Betula, alnus, and Picea, to their modern ranges. However, pollen assemblages and other paleoclimate proxies suggest some major changes in late-glacial and Holocene climate. Major vegetation change, most notably the dramatic expansion of Poaceae, occurred ca. 100 yr after the 12. 8 -ka glacier retreat and persisted for more than 2 ka. The inferred reversal to dry (and possibly cool) climate was followed by a period of exceptionally productive mesic conditions during the early Holocene, ca. 11 to 9 ka. The pattern of latest-Quaternary climate changes documented in this study may be evidence that, as previous workers have concluded regarding the Pleistocene glaciations, the late-glacial and early Holocene climate of the Ahklun Mountains region was strongly modulated by changes in the proximity and temperature of the Bering Sea...|$|E
40|$|The Stuart Oil Shale Deposit is a {{major oil}} shale {{resource}} located near Gladstone on the central Queensland coast. It contains an estimated 3. 0 billion barrels of oil in place in 5. 6 billion tonnes of shale. Commissioning of a plant capable of producing 4, 500 barrels per day has recently commenced. The shale is preserved in Tertiary age sediments of The Narrows Beds {{in the southern part}} of The Narrows Graben. The oil shale sequence consists of repetitive cycles composed of oil shale, claystone and lesser carbonaceous oil shale in the 400 metre thick Rundle Formation. The formation is the main oil-shale bearing unit in the preserved half-graben sequence up to 1, 000 metres thick. Previous studies on the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sedimentology</b> of the Rundle Oil Shale Deposit in the northern part of The Narrows Graben have recognised eight facies that exhibit unique and recognisable cycles. The cycles and sequence for the Kerosene Creek Member of the Rundle Formation is correlatable between the Rundle and Stuart deposits. The nature of these facies and the cycles is reviewed in some detail. In conjunction with the principles of sequence stratigraphy, the ideal oil shale cycle is described as the equivalent of a parasequence within a lacustrine system. The lacustrine parasequence is bounded by lacustrine flooding surfaces. The organic material in the oil shale consists of both Type I (algal dominated) and Type III (higher plant matter dominated) kerogen. Where Type I kerogen dominate, oil yields greater than about 100 litres per tonne are common. In contrast where Type III kerogens are dominant, yields above 100 litres per tonne are rare. The variation in oil yield is described for the Stuart lacustrine system. The variation is consequent on the balance between production, preservation and degradation of the kerogen in the parasequences within systems tracts. A system for the recognition of oil shale deposition in terms of lacustrine systems tracts is established based on oil yield assay parameters and the assay oil specific gravity. The oil yield and oil specific gravity variation within the Rundle Formation is modelled by member and the nature and distribution of oil yield quality parameters in terms of the contribution of organic and inorganic source material are described. The presence of significant oil yield (greater than 50 litres per tonne) is dependent on the dominance of lacustrine transitional systems tracts and to a lesser extent, lacustrine highstand systems tracts within the parasequence sets deposited in a balanced lake system in a generally warm wet climate during the middle to late Tertiary...|$|E
