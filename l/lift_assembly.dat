40|$|Reverse-engineering program {{binaries}} often {{relies on}} the recovery of high-level data abstractions. In particular, recovering variables and their type is challenging as most such information is lost during compilation. Although past proposals seem to have addressed this problem, their approaches are either not scalable and suffer from coverage issues (e. g., dynamic analysis), or yield insufficient precision by staying too conservative (e. g., static analysis). Furthermore, most recent works <b>lift</b> <b>assembly</b> to Intermediate Representation (IR), which standardizes low-level operations, and may lose some useful semantics for type inference. In this thesis, we propose BinType, a static analysis-based, scalable, precise and conservative tool that works directly on x 86 assembly to automatically reveal type information of variables and function arguments. BinType is 45 % more precise than TIE (NDSS’ 11) on a dataset 3. 5 times larger, and orders of magnitude faster than its underlying algorithm. We also show that our tool makes {{a significant impact on}} the accuracy of a recent tool on binary to source matching...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this University of Central Florida (UCF) student design was to modify the {{existing}} Integrated Partial Payload <b>Lifting</b> <b>Assembly</b> (IPPLA) to increase its lifting capacity so it could lift the passenger tunnel. The IPPLA {{is used in the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to prepare and load the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle prior to flight. The report evaluated twelve design modifications assigning relative weights to safety, cost, strength, weight, reliability, size, installation and portability. Each potential modification was rated from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) in each of the weighted categories and the results were multiplied, summed, and displayed in a solution matrix. As a result of scoring highest in the solution matrix, the two most probable designs were further analyzed and evaluated to determine the recommended solution to the modification of the IPPLA. The modification of the IPPLA was one of six Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering designs in progress in the Engineering Design class at UCF during Fall Semester. The UCF student design team received counsel and guidance from NASA Kennedy Space Center...|$|R

40|$|The Integrated Partial Payload <b>Lifting</b> <b>Assembly</b> (IPPLA) is {{currently}} used to transport and load experimental payloads into the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. It {{is unable to}} carry the astronaut/passenger tunnel without a structural modification. The purpose of this design {{is to create a}} removalbe modification that will allow the IPPLA to lift and carry the passenger tunnel. Modifications evaluated were full-length insert beams which would extend through the existing strongback arms. These beam proposals were eliminated because of high cost and weight. Other proposals evaluated were attachments of cantilever beams to the existing strongback areas. The cantilever proposals reduced cost and weight compared to the full-length modifications. A third method evaluated was to simply make modifications {{to one side of the}} IPPLA therefore reducing the materials of the cantilever proposals by 40 percent. The design of the modification selected was completed with two channel beams jointly welded to a centered steel plate. The extension arm modification is inserted into the existing strongback channel beams and bolted into place. Two extension arms are added to one side of the IPPLA to provide the extra length needed to accommodate the passenger tunnel. The center counterbalance will then be offset about 20 inches to center gravity and therefore maintain horizontal status. The extension arm modification was selected because of minimum cost, low weight, and minimal installation time...|$|R

50|$|The shield plug was a {{rotating}} {{part of the}} inner reactor vessel and sat over the fuel. It could be rotated {{in order to facilitate}} fuel movements. The shield plug also provided radioactive shielding. During fuel loading, new assemblies were lowered down a tube into an adjacent Transfer Rotor which was integral with the reactor vessel. Then an Offset Handling Mechanism <b>lifted</b> the <b>assembly</b> from the Transfer Rotor and placed it into the vessel. Once all of the assemblies were loaded, a Hold Down Mechanism sat atop them so as to prevent them from moving upwards during operation. The Hold Down Mechanism also contained temperature measuring devices (resistance temperature detectors) to monitor sodium outlet temperatures from the assemblies.|$|R

When the taps were opened and the radar unclamped the mercury levelled itself and the radar floated on it. There was some internal furniture for the operator and the displays, as well as racking for the spare assemblies, and a simple hoist to <b>lift</b> the <b>assemblies</b> up to the radar. For movement the antenna was lowered and the whole radar surrounded by a folding grille attached to decking around the radar to protect it.|$|R

40|$|In {{engineering}} systems a Passive Tuned Mass Damper (a secondary mass – spring - damper combination) {{is often}} used to reduce vibrations of a primary structure (main mass). In an Active Tuned Mass Damper (ATMD) arrangement vibrations of the main mass are attenuated when the secondary mass (referred to as an active mass) is actively controlled. The ATMD system is equipped with a controller, sensors and an actuator. The attenuation is achieved by the application of control force determined by a suitable feedback control algorithm. In this paper the ATMD method is considered to attenuate resonance vertical vibrations of a <b>lift</b> car <b>assembly</b> – suspension rope system during the lift travel, when the frequency of harmonic excitation acting upon the car assembly becomes near its natural frequency. A mathematical model with the optimal feedback gain calculated using Linear–Quadratic Regulator control law is developed. Then, a case study is presented in which computer simulation is carried out. The simulation results are discussed and the effectiveness of an active tuned mass damper system is demonstrated for a given set of lift system parameters...|$|R
50|$|A {{suitably}} sized chamois skin is soaked in clean fuel and {{placed over the}} grid in the funnel and brought up the sides, forming a bowl, to prevent any leakage past the skin. Fuel can then be pumped {{into the top of}} the funnel by the fuel dispenser and watched for signs of water accumulation. The process can be stopped to <b>lift</b> out the <b>assembly</b> from the tank and the trapped water removed so that the job can be continued. Chamois leather is used thus as a fuel filter by boaters, auto detailers—and aircraft refuellers, particularly of a past age when aircraft were flown into very remote areas.|$|R

50|$|The ZMC-2 was {{successful}} both in performance and longevity.

Filling the rigid shell was similarly problematic, requiring an expensive and time-consuming process of filling it first with carbon dioxide, then with helium, and finally purifying the helium by scrubbing residual carbon dioxide from the helium. In addition, the hull had to be strengthened to sustain the weight of the carbon dioxide during the filling process.|$|R
40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through malfunction of gas <b>lift</b> valve <b>assemblies</b> (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well annulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This {{is a growing concern}} as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions, and repair and monitoring become difficult. Currently no safeguard exists in the GLV to prevent product passage in the event of check valve failure. In this paper a design and operational procedures are proposed for a thermally-actuated positive-locking safety valve to seal the GLV in the event of check valve failure. A thermal model of the well and GLV system is developed and compared to well data to verify feasibility of a thermally-actuated safety valve. A 3 × scale prototype safety valve is built and tested under simulated failure scenarios and well start-up scenarios. Realistic well temperatures in the range of 20 C to 70 C are used. Results demonstrate valve closure in response to simulated check valve failure and valve opening during simulated well start-up...|$|R

50|$|The only {{remaining}} {{issue is the}} replacement of the gliding elements of the gliding yaw bearing surface, which is not segmented. This is usually the top axial surface of the gliding bearing, which constantly supports the weight of the whole nacelle-rotor assembly. For the gliding elements of this gliding surface to be replaced, the nacelle-rotor <b>assembly</b> must be <b>lifted</b> by an external crane. An alternative solution to this problem is the use of mechanical or hydraulic jacks able to partially or fully <b>lift</b> the nacelle-rotor <b>assembly</b> while the gliding yaw bearing is still in place. In this way and by providing a small clearance between the gliding elements and the gliding disk, it is possible to exchange the sliding elements without dismantling the gliding yaw bearing.|$|R

50|$|Definitive palatal <b>lift</b> {{prosthesis}} clasp <b>assemblies</b> are {{not unlike}} those {{designed for the}} retention of removable partial dentures. The clasps arise as extensions of a cast metallic alloy prosthetic component termed a major connector that engages the hard palatal mucosa and the lingual surfaces of {{some or all of}} the maxillary teeth. Cast definitive palatal lift prosthesis clasps engage dental abutment surfaces harboring what typically represent 0.01 or 0.02 inch undercuts responsible for prosthetic retention. Alternatively, custom bent wrought wire clasps can be soldered to the cast metallic alloy component of the definitive palatal lift prosthesis from which they extend to engage the undercuts responsible for prosthetic retention. Wrought wire definitive palatal lift prosthesis clasps have an advantage over cast metallic definitive palatal lift prosthesis clasps by virtue of their relative resistance to work hardening that can contribute to the fracturing of cast clasps.|$|R

40|$|As {{everyone}} knows, assembly quality plays a {{very important}} role in final product quality. Since computer numerical control machine tool is a large system with complicated structure and function, and there are complex association relationships among quality characteristics in assembly process, then it is difficult and inaccurate to analyze the whole computer numerical control machine tool quality characteristic association at one time. In this article, meta-action assembly unit is proposed as the basic analysis unit, of which quality characteristic association is studied to guarantee the whole computer numerical control machine tool assembly quality. First, based on “Function-Motion-Action” decomposition structure, the definitions of meta-action and meta-action assembly unit are introduced. Second, manufacturing process association and meta-action assembly unit quality characteristic association are discussed. Third, after understanding the definitions of information entropy and relative entropy, the concrete meta-action assembly unit quality characteristic association analysis steps based on relative entropy are described in detail. And finally, the <b>lifting</b> piston translation <b>assembly</b> unit of automatic pallet changer is taken as an example, the association degree between internal leakage and the influence factors of part quality characteristics and mate-relationships among them are calculated to figure out the most influential factors, showing the correctness and feasibility of this method...|$|R
50|$|A common hammer {{design has}} the hammer able to slide and rotate on a shaft, with a spring {{holding it in}} the {{downwards}} position. Between the hammer and the driving shaft is a steel ball on a ramp, such that if the input shaft rotates ahead of the hammer with enough torque, the spring is compressed and the hammer is slid backwards. On {{the bottom of the}} hammer, and the top of the anvil, are dog teeth, designed for high impacts. When the tool is used, the hammer rotates until its dog teeth contact the teeth on the anvil, stopping the hammer from rotating. The input shaft continues to turn, causing the ramp to lift the steel ball, <b>lifting</b> the hammer <b>assembly</b> until the dog teeth no longer engage the anvil, and the hammer is free to spin again. The hammer then springs forward {{to the bottom of the}} ball ramp, and is accelerated by the input shaft, until the dog teeth contact the anvil again, delivering the impact. The process then repeats, delivering blows every time the teeth meet, almost always twice per revolution. If the output has little load on it, such as when spinning a loose nut on a bolt, the torque will never be high enough to cause the ball to compress the spring, and the input will smoothly drive the output. This design has the advantage of small size and simplicity, but energy is wasted moving the entire hammer back and forth, and delivering multiple blows per revolution gives less time for the hammer to accelerate. This design is often seen after a gear reduction, compensating for the lack of acceleration time by delivering more torque at a lower speed.|$|R
40|$|The nominal overall {{dimensions}} are 71 -inch high x 71 -inch wide x 144 -inch long {{and has a}} 25 -inch square hole throughout. The shield consists of three different materials, steel (inner most section), polycarbonate (central section) and lead (outer most section). The material thicknesses are, steel= 15 -inch, poly= 6 -inch and lead= 2 -inch. The estimated weight is {approx} 69 tons. The shield is centered about the Tev beam line and the 25 -inch square hole provides clearance to the low Beta quad, which is nominally 20 -inch square. During beamline operation, the shield is in contact with Samus magnet core at the detector end and with the Main Ring shield wall on the MR side (with some small clearance {approx} 2 -inch- 3 -inch). The need for the clearance will be discussed later. The shield support structure consists steel structural members appropriately sized for loads encountered in the design. The structure must not only support the shield but, must be designed for rolling the entire assembly into position in the collision hall. It must provide for cylinders to <b>lift</b> the <b>assembly,</b> Hilman rollers and also connections for moving the entire assembly. The movement {{is considered to be}} similar to that with which the calorimeters were moved from the clean room to the sidewalk staging area, i. e. hydraulic cylinder and chain (see dwg. 3740. 000 -ME 294017, 3 sheets). This method will be used for the East to West motion and a hydraulic scheme will be used for any North-South motion. Since the shield is 144 -inch long and the sidewalk structural support is {approx} 96 -inch, there is a section of the shield that is cantilevered (48 -inch). Further, the EF toroid must open {approx} 40 + inch for access to the detector during operations and this requires that the shield or some part of it must also move. This conceptual design suggests that the shield be designed in two pieces axially. These two pieces are identical in cross section but, the lengths are divided into 48 -inch nearest EF and 96 -inch nearest the MR tunnel. The 96 -inch section is designed to clam shell, i. e. split vertically along the beam line, with each half moving {approx} 36 -inch East/West. The opening created with this motion (72 -inch) is 1 -inch greater than the width of the shield, 71 If. Now the forward section can be moved, North/South, within the opened end section, a full 48 -inch. The forward section will be support at one end by the basic shield support structure and at the EF end by a member welded to EF. Rails will be extended from the basic structure to EF and these rails will be collapsible within the basic structure. The shield sections will be mounted on Hilman rollers and all motions will be provided by hydraulic cylinders...|$|R
