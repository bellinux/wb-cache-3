Early LP recordings were monophonic; Alan Blumlein patented Stereophonic sound in 1931 (although stereophony had {{been demonstrated in}} 1881) but unsuccessful {{attempts were made to}} create stereophonic records from the 1920s, including Emory Cook's 1952 idea of using two tracks, and a system using vertical modulation (harking back to Edison's 1877 experiments) for one channel and (then-universal) horizontal for the other, until the modern system ultimately released by Audio Fidelity Records in November 1957. This format uses two modulation angles, equal and opposite 45 degrees from vertical (and so perpendicular to each other), that can also be thought of as using traditional horizontal modulation for the sum of <b>Left</b> <b>plus</b> <b>Right</b> channels (mono), making it essentially compatible with simple mono recordings, and vertical-plane modulation for the difference of the two channels.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} fermionic zero modes of BPS semilocal {{magnetic}} vortices in N= 2 supersymmetric QED with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term and two matter hypermultiplets of opposite charge. There is a one-parameter family of vortices with arbitrarily wide magnetic cores.

St – Non-standard-model neutrinos, {{right-handed}} neutrinos, etc. Abstract. - The {{dark matter}} of the Abell 1689 galaxy cluster is modeled by thermal, nonrelativistic gravitating fermions and its galaxies and X-ray gas by isothermal distributions. A fit yields a mass of h 1 / 2 70 (12 /¯g) 1 / 4 1. 445 (30) eV. A dark matter fraction Ων = h − 3 / 2 70 0. 1893 (39) occurs for ¯g = 12 degrees of freedom, i. e., for 3 families of <b>left</b> <b>plus</b> <b>right</b> handed neutrinos with masses ≈ 2 3 / 4 G 1 / 2 F m 2 e.

The virial α-particle temperature of 9. 9 ± 1. 1 keV/kB coincides with the average one of X-rays. The results are compatible with neutrino genesis, nucleosynthesis and free streaming. The neutrinos condense on the cluster at redshift z ∼ 28, thereby causing reionization of the intracluster gas without assistance of heavy stars.

40|$|All major mental {{functions}} including language, {{spatial and}} emotional processing are lateralized but how strongly {{and to which}} hemisphere is subject to inter- and intraindividual variation. Relatively little, however, is known about how the degree and direction of lateralization affect how well the functions are carried out, i. e., how lateralization and task performance are related. The present study therefore {{examined the relationship between}} lateralization and performance in a dichotic listening (DL) task for which we had data available from 1839 participants. In this task, consonant-vowel syllables are presented simultaneously to the left and right ear, such that each ear receives a different syllable. When asked which of the two they heard best, participants typically report more syllables from the right ear, which is a marker of left-hemispheric speech dominance. We calculated the degree of lateralization (based on the difference between correct left and right ear reports) and correlated it with overall response accuracy (<b>left</b> <b>plus</b> <b>right</b> ear reports). In addition, we used reference models to control for statistical interdependency between left and right ear reports. The results revealed a u-shaped relationship between degree of lateralization and overall accuracy: the stronger the left or right ear advantage, the better the overall accuracy. This u-shaped asymmetry-performance relationship consistently emerged in males, females, right-/non-right-handers, and different age groups. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that performance on lateralized language functions depends on how strongly these functions are lateralized. The present study further stresses the importance of controlling for statistical interdependency when examining asymmetry-performance relationships in general...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the eff ect of repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS) of {{the spinal cord}} on limb angiogenesis in healthy rats and explore its implication {{for the treatment of}} lymphedema. Method Twelve adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups as follows: sham rMS followed by tissue harvest 5 minutes later (group 1, n= 2), 1 Hz rMS and tissue harvest 5 minutes later (group 2, n= 3), 20 Hz rMS and tissue harvest 5 minutes later (group 3, n= 3), 20 Hz rMS and tissue harvest 30 minutes later (group 4, n= 4). Animals were treated with 20 -minute rMS with 120 % of the motor threshold on their left side of upper lumbar spinal cord. Expression of angiogenic factors, that is, Akt, phospho-Akt (pAkt), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phospho-eNOS (p-eNOS) were measured by western blot. Bilateral hindlimb muscles (quadriceps and gastrocnemius) were harvested. Results Expression of Akt in left quadriceps increased in group 4 compared with group 2 and 3 (3. 4 and 5. 3 -fold each, p= 0. 026). Expression of eNOS in <b>left</b> <b>plus</b> <b>right</b> quadriceps markedly increased in group 3 and 4 compared with group 1 and 2 (p= 0. 007). Expressions of eNOS, Akt and p-eNOS, pAkt in gastrocnemius were not comparable between four groups (p> 0. 05). Conclusion Repetitive magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord may exert an angiogenic eff ect closely linked to lymphangiogenesis. It has clinical implication for the possible therapy of lymphedema caused by breast, cervical or endometrial cancer operation.

40|$|Abstract Background The role of {{rib cage}} in the {{development}} of progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis (IIS) has not been studied previously. No report was found for rib growth in children with IIS. These findings caused us to undertake a segmental radiological study of the spine and rib-cage in children with progressive IIS. The aim of the present study is to present a new method for assessing the thoracic shape in scoliotics and in control subjects and to compare the findings between the two groups. Materials and methods In the posteroanterior (PA) spinal radiographs of 24 patients with progressive IIS, {{with a mean age of}} 4. 1 years old, the Thoracic Ratios (TRs) (segmental convex and concave TRs), the Cobb angle, the segmental vertebral rotation and vertebral tilt were measured. In 233 subjects, with a mean age of 5. 1 years old, who were used as a control group, the segmental left and right TRs and the total width of the chest (<b>left</b> <b>plus</b> <b>right</b> TRs) were measured in PA chest radiographs. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney, Spearman correlation coefficient, multiple linear regression analysis and ANOVA. Results The comparison shows that the scoliotic thorax is significantly narrower than that of the controls at all spinal levels. The upper chest in IIS is funnel-shaped and the vertebral rotation at T 4 early in management correlates significantly with the apical vertebral rotation at follow up. Conclusion The IIS thorax is narrower than that of the controls, the upper chest is funnel-shaped and there is a predictive value of vertebral rotation at the upper limit of the thoracic curve of IIS, which reflects, impaired rib control of spinal rotation possibly due to neuromuscular factors, which contribute also to the funnel-shaped chest. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Functional {{dyspepsia}} (FD) is {{a chronic}} condition characterized by upper abdominal symptoms without an identifiable cause. While the serotonergic system {{is thought to}} {{play a key role}} in the regulation of gut physiology, the role of the dopaminergic system, which is important in the regulation of visceral pain and stress, is under-studied. Therefore, this study investigated the dopaminergic system and its relationship with drinking capacity and symptoms in FD patients. METHODS: In FD patients and healthy volunteers (HV) the dopaminergic system was investigated by in-vivo assessment of central dopamine D 2 receptors (D 2 Rs) with [(123) I]IBZM SPECT and by an acute, but reversible, dopamine depletion alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) challenge test. A nutrient drink test was performed to investigate the association between maximal ingested volume, evoked symptoms, and D 2 Rs. RESULTS: The HV subjects comprised 12 women and 8 men (mean age 31 [*]±[*] 3  years), and the FD patients comprised 5 women and 3 men (mean age 39 [*]±[*] 5  years). The FD patients had a lower <b>left</b> <b>plus</b> <b>right</b> average striatal binding potential (BP(NP)) for the caudate nucleus (p[*]=[*] 0. 02), but not for putamen (p[*]=[*] 0. 15), which in the FD patients was correlated with maximal ingested volume (r[*]=[*] 0. 756, p[*]=[*] 0. 03). The D 2 R BP(NP) in the putamen was correlated with nausea (r[*]=[*] 0. 857, p[*]=[*] 0. 01). The acute dopamine depletion test, however, failed to reveal differences in prolactin release between the FD patients and the HV subjects. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that chronic rather than acute alterations in the dopaminergic system may be involved in the pathogenesis of FD. Further studies are required to reproduce our novel findings and to evaluate to what extent the dopaminergic changes may be secondary to abnormalities in serotonergic pathways. status: publishe...|$|R

Additional work done by Corona et al. [15] in which they presented the Luxor system which applied this combination of static and dynamic analysis as well. Their idea involved translating the JavaScript code into an API reference pattern, and accumulating the times of presences for every API reference. By doing this they tried to find a discriminative set of references that characterizes malware code in order to automatically differentiate this code from benign code within PDF files.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND A {{small but}} {{increasing}} number of studies suggest that non-invasive brain stimulation by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can modulate arithmetic processes that are essential for higher-order mathematical skills and that are impaired in dyscalculic individuals. However, {{little is known about}} the neural mechanisms underlying such stimulation effects, and whether they are specific to cognitive processes involved in different arithmetic tasks. METHODS We addressed these questions by applying tDCS during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants were solving two types of complex subtraction problems: repeated problems, relying on arithmetic fact learning and problem-solving by fact retrieval, and novel problems, requiring calculation procedures. Twenty participants receiving <b>left</b> parietal anodal <b>plus</b> <b>right</b> frontal cathodal stimulation were compared with 20 participants in a sham condition. RESULTS We found a strong cognitive and neural dissociation between repeated and novel problems. Repeated problems were solved more accurately and elicited increased activity in the bilateral angular gyri and medial plus lateral prefrontal cortices. Solving novel problems, in contrast, was accompanied by stronger activation in the bilateral intraparietal sulci and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Most importantly, tDCS decreased the activation of the right inferior frontal cortex while solving novel (compared to repeated) problems, suggesting that the cathodal stimulation rendered this region unable to respond to the task-specific cognitive demand. CONCLUSIONS The present study revealed that tDCS during arithmetic problem-solving can modulate the neural activity in proximity to the electrodes specifically when the current demands lead to an engagement of this area...|$|R

The triple-site group tended to show a more pronounced treatment effect at day 90. However, the measurement time point x group interaction effect was not significant. The current results confirm former studies that indicated a significant reduction of tinnitus severity after rTMS treatment. No significant superiority of the multisite protocol was observed.
