5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When crews of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average operating height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the <b>lighting</b> <b>systems,</b> such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. Crews were warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber crews of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E

40|$|Ambient systems provide {{information}} in the periphery of a user’s attention. Their aim is to present information as unobtrusively as possible to avoid interrupting primary tasks (e. g. writing or reading). In recent years, light {{has been used to}} create ambient systems to display information. Examples of ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> range from simple notification systems such as displaying messages or calendar event reminders, to more complex systems such as focusing on conveying information regarding health activity tracking. However, for ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems,</b> there is a broad design space that lacks guidelines on when to make use of light displays and how to design them. In this paper we provide a systematic overview of existing ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> over four identified information classes derived from 72 existing ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems.</b> The most prominent encoding parameters among the surveyed ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> are color, brightness, and their combination.

40|$|We {{consider}} a smart <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> with multiple dual-beam luminaires, with co-located occupancy and light sensors.
