[...] As linear hydrocarbons are the key components of diesel, these biologically produced fuels are excellent diesel replacements. However, fuels containing only long, <b>linear,</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains will freeze under cold conditions. To develop fuels suitable for cold applications, Keasling’s laboratory engineered E. coli and S. cerevisiae to produce branched and cyclic hydrocarbons using the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway: isopentanol, a drop-in replacement for gasoline; pinene, a replacement for jet fuel; and bisabolene, a replacement for diesel fuel. [...] Because isoprenoids add a methyl side chain every four carbons in the backbone, fuels made from isoprenoids have very low freeze and cloud points, making them suitable as cold-weather diesels and jet fuels.|$|E

40|$|Branched {{hydrocarbons}} are {{preferred to}} <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> as ingredients in petrol, as they enhance the fuel octane number. By catalytic isomerisation <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are converted into branched hydrocarbons, {{then it becomes}} necessary to separate the mixture.

Therefore, adsorption and diffusion data are essential to the development of sorption based separation methods, but also they provide key information regarding the catalytic isomerisation over zeolites. However, the experimental assessment of multi-component adsorption data is not straightforward and is highly time-consuming. To approach this problem a new experimental set-up was designed that combines a manometric apparatus with Near-InfraRed (NIR) spectrometer.

Two series of 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) derivatives with branched hydrocarbon chains were synthetized and the surface properties were compared with <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains. We show that hydrocarbon chain branching reduces the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the substituent. As a consequence, the branching can lead to smoother films, due to the increase in solubility of the oligomers formed in the first instances of the polymerization, than that obtained with <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains. Here, highly structured films with non-wetting properties close to superhydrophobic properties are obtained with <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains from a total number of carbon of 8 while relatively smooth hydrophobic films are obtained with branched hydrocarbon chains.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{functionalization}} of carbon nanotubes on the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites {{has been studied}} using a multi-scale modeling approach. These results predict that grafting <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains {{to the surface of}} a single wall carbon nanotube with covalent chemical bonds should result in {{a significant increase in the}} thermal conductivity of these nanocomposites. This is due to the decrease in the interfacial thermal (Kapitza) resistance between the single wall carbon nanotube and the surrounding polymer matrix upon chemical functionalization. The nanocomposites studied here consist of single wall carbon nanotubes in a bulk poly(ethylene vinyl acetate) matrix. The nanotubes are functionalized by end-grafting <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains of varying length to the surface of the nanotube. The effect which this functionalization has on the interfacial thermal resistance is studied by molecular dynamics simulation.

The B-PCPE proposed herein is composed of a plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE, 1 M lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulphonimide (LiTFSI) in succinonitrile (SN)) and a UV (ultraviolet) -cured polymer network bearing long <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains (here, trimethylolpropane propoxylate triacrylate (TPPTA) polymer is exploited). The solid electrolyte characteristics of the B-PCPE are investigated in terms of plastic crystal behavior, mechanical bendability, ionic conductivity, and cell performance. Owing {{to the presence of}} long <b>linear</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains attached to crosslinkable acrylate groups, the TPPTA polymer network in the B-PCPE acts as a compliant mechanical framework, thereby exerting a beneficial influence on bendability and also interfacial resistance with lithium metal electrodes. Meanwhile, the B-PCPE exhibits slightly lower ionic conductivity than a control sample (referred to as "R-PCPE") incorporating a rigid and stiff polymer network of ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA). This unique behavior of the B-PCPE is discussed with an in-depth consideration of the polymer network structure and its specific interaction with the lattice defect phase of SN in the PCE. Although relatively sluggish ionic transport is observed in the B-PCPE, its intimate interfacial contact with electrodes (possibly due to the mechanically compliant TPPTA polymer network) may beneficially contribute to imparting satisfactory cycling performance. close 91...|$|E
