40|$|ORF 326, frxC and ORF 469 of a transfomable cynobacterium, Synechcystis PCC 6803, have {{sequence}} similarity with ORF 465 on the choroplast genome of a <b>livewort,</b> Marchantia polymorpha, respectively. To elucidate their functions,targeted mutagenesis {{was performed}} by transformation with clened DNA in which the ORF was disrupted by insertion of a kanamycin resistancen gene cassette. Streak-purifications of a single colony of each transformant were repeatde to segregate homozygous mutants for disrupted copies, because Synechocystis PCC 6803 {{was reported to have}} approximately 10 chromosomal DNA copies. Southern blot analysis revealed that mutants for ORF 326 had not only disrupted ORF 326 copies but also wild type ORF 326 copies. This suggests that ORF 326 is indispensable for growth under the mixotrophic growth condition used. However, mutants for frxC and mutants for ORF 469 had only mutated copies, indicating that they dispensable for growth. Growth and chlorophyll a content of an ORF 469 -disrupted mutant were compared and chlorophyll a content of an ORF 469 -disrupted mutant were compared to those of wild type under mixotrophic growth condition, but no significant difference was detected. This indicates that ORF 469 is required for neither normal growth nor chlorophyll biosynthesis under thie condition. ゼニゴケ葉緑体ORF 316 、frxCおよびORFと相同性を持つ、形質転換型ラン藻Synechocystis PCC 6803 株のORF 326 、frxCおよびORF 469 の機能についての情報を得るため、これらの欠損株の作製を行った。コード領域にカナマイシン耐性遺伝子カセットを挿入することにより不活性化された変異型のORF（オーブンリーディングフレーム）を持つプラスミドを用いてSynechocystis PCC 6803 株の形質転換を行い、カナマイシンを含む培地で選抜した。Synechocystis PCC 6803 株は約 10 コピーのクロモソームを持つが、サザンブロット解析の結果、ORF 326 については、変異型と野生型のORF 326 の双方を持つ株しか得られず、増殖に必要と推測された。一方frxCおよびORF 469 については、ともに全て変異型に置き換わった株が得られ、増殖には必要ないことが示された。さらにORF 469 欠損株を光照射下で培養し、増殖速度とクロロフィルa濃度を測定したが、いずれも野生株とほぼ同じであり、ORF 469 は、この条件下では、増殖やクロロフィル生合成に必要ないと推察された...|$|E
40|$|Bryophyte and lichen epiphytic {{communities}} were {{studied in the}} Mediterranean-montane area of M. Artu in Sardinia (Italy) by mean of releves carried out in different oak forest types, {{with the aim of}} pointing out differences due to anthropogenic activities. Altogether, 15 bryophyte species and 74 lichen species were found. Releves were classified using cluster analysis. In well-preserved forests, communities dominated by bryophytes and close to the climax associations Antitrichietum californicae and Leptodontetum smithii are present, together with elements of the Lobarion pulmonariae. Lichen communities of the Xanthorion parietinae (Physcietum adscendentis, Parmelietum acetabulae and Ramalinetum fastigiatae) are dominant in the most disturbed conditions, rarely accompanied by elements of the Leucodontetum schiroides. In closed coppice and young woodland a community dominated by Neckera complanata, Metzgeria furcata, Frullania dilatata, Phlyctis argena and Physconia venusta is present, probably close to the Antitrichietum curtipendulae. In mature forests of Q. pubescens and open coppices of Q. ilex, a similar community is also present, though richer in lichen species, and with Frullania dilatata as the only dominant <b>livewort.</b> Widespread temperate species are most frequent in disturbed conditions, while suboceanic species are more common in well-preserved and closed woodland. Mat- and tail-forms of the bryophytes are dominant in well-preserved forest, together with crustose lichens. Broad- and narrow-lobed lichens are dominant in the most disturbed conditions. This is the first study on epiphytic cryptogamic communities of the island...|$|E
