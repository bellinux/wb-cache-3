25|$|Several {{species of}} birds have {{acquired}} methods {{that allow them to}} ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the cardiac glycosides. The oriole is able to eat the monarch through an exaptation of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify cardenolides by taste and reject them. The grosbeak, on the other hand, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, orioles and grosbeaks will periodically have high levels of cardenolides in their bodies, and they will be forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50 percent and indicates that monarch aposematism has a <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
500|$|The UK Human Rights Act 1998 makes Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, {{which protects}} freedom of religion, {{enforceable}} in UK domestic law. Article 9(2) states when {{the freedom of}} religion may be restricted: [...] "Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary {{in a democratic society}} in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or {{for the protection of the}} rights and freedoms of others." [...] R. (Begum) v. Headteacher and Governors of Denbigh High School (2006) was a House of Lords case involving a female Muslim student who wished to wear a jilbab (a long, coat-like garment) to comply with her understanding of the requirements of her faith, but was disallowed from doing so. Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that under Article 9(2), for a restriction to be justified it must be [...] "prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society for a permissible purpose, that is, it must be directed to a <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose</b> and must be proportionate in scope and effect". In the end, a majority of the Law Lords hearing the appeal (including Lord Bingham) held that the appellant's rights had not been interfered with. However, the court held unanimously that even if they had been, there were justifiable grounds for such interference, one of which was the need to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of Muslim dress.|$|E

2500|$|The dissent {{argued that}} the {{provisions}} found by the court to be unconstitutional could be [...] "severed {{from the rest of}} the legislation and that what remains...be interpreted in a way that renders it constitutionally valid." [...] Specifically, Judge Smith {{argued that the}} majority opinion was overly concerned with two aspects of the definition of cyberbullying provided by the law. The law forbids communications that have no <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose</b> and whose intent is [...] "to harass, annoy, threaten, abuse, taunt, intimidate, torment, humiliate, or otherwise inflict significant emotional harm." [...] While the majority opinion argued that the definition was overbroad by criminalizing communications with the intent to annoy, the dissent argued that this language should be interpreted as a [...] "non-exhaustive list of ways" [...] that significant emotional harm could be inflicted, and that it only forbids communications whose intent is to annoy in order to inflict significant emotional harm. The dissent concluded that despite [...] "flaws in the draftmanship of the... law," [...] Albany County had a constitutional right to prohibit communications that have no <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose,</b> are of private concern, and are intended to inflict significant emotional harm on children.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{laid out}} a three-part test for whether a law {{conforms}} with the Contract Clause in Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power & Light.

[...] Third, the law must be reasonable and appropriate for its intended purpose. This test is similar to rational basis review.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas {{let stand}} the District Court's sevenfold test for when a {{clearance}} agreement was a restraint of trade, as he agreed {{they had a}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose.</b> Pooling agreements and joint ownership, he agreed, were [...] "bald efforts to substitute monopoly for competition ... Clearer restraints of trade are difficult to imagine." [...] He allowed, however, that courts could consider how an interest in an exhibitor was acquired and sent some other issues back to the District Court for further inquiry and resolution. He set aside the lower court findings on franchises {{so that they might}} be reconsidered from the perspective of allowing competitive bidding. On the block booking question, he rejected the studios' argument that it was necessary to profit from their copyrights: [...] "The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes reward to the owner a secondary consideration". The prohibitions on discrimination he let stand entirely.|$|E
2500|$|At the Court of Final Appeal, the {{constitutionality}} of the entire statutory notification scheme was challenged. Chief Justice Li, Justice Chan PJ, Justice Ribeiro PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, having considered all the statutory restrictions on the freedom of assembly and the statutory safeguards listed above, held that the notification system was constitutional. However, they held that the norm of [...] "ordre public", which existed as a statutory <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose</b> at that time, was too vague at a statutory level and hence could not be said to be prescribed by law. [...] "Ordre public" [...] was as a result severed, but the term [...] "public order" [...] was sufficiently precise to survive. They also remarked in dicta that the norm of [...] "protection of the rights and freedoms of others" [...] was too wide and did not satisfy the legal certainty requirement. They affirmed the convictions as the severance did not affect the conviction. Justice Bokhary PJ dissented, noting in his judgment that the whole statutory scheme should be struck down except the entitlement to notification.|$|E

6000|$|During {{the space}} which {{occurred}} between writing the [...] "Conquest of Granada" [...] and [...] "Aureng-Zebe", our author's researches {{into the nature}} and causes of harmony of versification been unremitted, and he had probably already collected the materials of his intended English Prosodia. Besides this labour, he had been engaged in a closer and more critical examination of the ancient English poets, than he had before bestowed upon them. These studies seem to have led Dryden to two conclusions: first, that the drama ought to be emancipated from the fetters of rhyme; and secondly, {{that he ought to}} employ the system of versification, which he had now perfected, to the more <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose</b> of epic poetry.

6000|$|And then note, lastly, {{that in this}} case, as in all others, when an {{organisation}} {{has become}} effete and inoperative for its <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose,</b> it is employed for quite other ones--quite opposite ones. What is the usual plea put in for giving and attending these tedious assemblies? [...] "I admit that they are stupid and frivolous enough," [...] replies every man to your criticisms; [...] "but then, you know, one must keep up one's connections." [...] And could you get from his wife a sincere answer, it would be--"Like you, I am sick of these frivolities; but then, we must get our daughters married." [...] The one knows {{that there is a}} profession to push, a practice to gain, a business to extend: or parliamentary influence, or county patronage, or votes, or office, to be got: position, berths, favours, profit. The other's thoughts run upon husbands and settlements, wives and dowries.

60|$|But this {{gravitation}} of women's {{minds to}} the present, to the real, to actual fact, while in its exclusiveness it {{is a source}} of errors, is also a most useful counteractive of the contrary error. The principal and most characteristic aberration of speculative minds as such, consists precisely in the deficiency of this lively perception and ever-present sense of objective fact. For want of this, they often not only overlook the contradiction which outward facts oppose to their theories, but lose sight of the <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose</b> of speculation altogether, and let their speculative faculties go astray into regions not peopled with real beings, animate or inanimate, even idealized, but with personified shadows created by the illusions of metaphysics or by the mere entanglement of words, and think these shadows the proper objects of the highest, the most transcendant, philosophy. Hardly anything can be of greater value to a man of theory and speculation who employs himself not in collecting materials of knowledge by observation, but in working them up by processes of thought into comprehensive truths of science and laws of conduct, than to carry on his speculations in the companionship, and under the criticism, of a really superior woman. There is nothing comparable to it for keeping his thoughts within the limits of real things, and the actual facts of nature. A woman seldom runs wild after an abstraction. The habitual direction of her mind to dealing with things as individuals rather than in groups, and (what is closely connected with it) her more lively interest in the present feelings of persons, which makes her consider first of all, in anything which claims to be applied to practice, in what manner persons will be affected by it--these two things make her extremely unlikely to put faith in any speculation which loses sight of individuals, and deals with things as if they existed for the benefit of some imaginary entity, some mere creation of the mind, not resolvable into the feelings of living beings. Women's thoughts are thus as useful in giving reality to those of thinking men, as men's thoughts in giving width and largeness to those of women. In depth, as distinguished from breadth, I greatly doubt if even now, women, compared with men, are at any disadvantage.|$|E

60|$|What is it, then, {{which really}} tempers the corrupting {{effects of the}} power, and makes it {{compatible}} with such amount of good as we actually see? Mere feminine blandishments, though of great effect in individual instances, have very little effect in modifying the general tendencies of the situation; for their power only lasts while the woman is young and attractive, often only while her charm is new, and not dimmed by familiarity; and on many men they have not much influence at any time. The real mitigating causes are, the personal affection which is the growth of time, {{in so far as}} the man's nature is susceptible of it, and the woman's character sufficiently congenial with his to excite it; their common interests as regards the children, and their general community of interest as concerns third persons (to which however there are very great limitations); the real importance of the wife to his daily comforts and enjoyments, and the value he consequently attaches to her on his personal account, which, in a man capable of feeling for others, lays the foundation of caring for her on her own; and lastly, the influence naturally acquired over almost all human beings by those near to their persons (if not actually disagreeable to them): who, both by their direct entreaties, and by the insensible contagion of their feelings and dispositions, are often able, unless counteracted by some equally strong personal influence, to obtain a degree of command over the conduct of the superior, altogether excessive and unreasonable. Through these various means, the wife frequently exercises even too much power over the man; she is able to affect his conduct in things in which she may not be qualified to influence it for good--in which her influence may be not only unenlightened, but employed on the morally wrong side; and in which he would act better if left to his own prompting. But neither in the affairs of families nor in those of states is power a compensation for the loss of freedom. Her power often gives her what she has no right to, but does not enable her to assert her own rights. A Sultan's favourite slave has slaves under her, over whom she tyrannizes; but the desirable thing would be that she should neither have slaves nor be a slave. By entirely sinking her own existence in her husband; by having no will (or persuading him that she has no will) but his, in anything which regards their joint relation, and by making it the business of her life to work upon his sentiments, a wife may gratify herself by influencing, and very probably perverting, his conduct, in those of his external relations which she has never qualified herself to judge of, or in which she is herself wholly influenced by some personal or other partiality or prejudice. Accordingly, as things now are, those who act most kindly to their wives, are quite as often made worse, as better, by the wife's influence, in respect to all interests extending beyond the family. She is taught that she has no business with things out of that sphere; and accordingly she seldom has any honest and conscientious opinion on them; and therefore hardly ever meddles with them for any <b>legitimate</b> <b>purpose,</b> but generally for an interested one. She neither knows nor cares which is the right side in politics, but she knows what will bring in money or invitations, give her husband a title, her son a place, or her daughter a good marriage.|$|E
