25|$|In <b>linear</b> <b>regression,</b> the {{relationships}} are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of y given {{the value of}} X {{is assumed to be}} an affine function of X; less commonly, the median or some other quantile of the conditional distribution of y given X is expressed as a linear function of X. Like all forms of regression analysis, <b>linear</b> <b>regression</b> focuses on the conditional probability distribution of y given X, rather than on the joint probability distribution of y and X, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between galaxy {{properties in the}} sample of Trinchieri et al. (1989) are reexamined with corrections for Malmquist bias. The linear correlations are tested and <b>linear</b> <b>regressions</b> are fit for log-log plots of L(FIR), L(H-alpha), and L(B) as well as ratios of these quantities. The linear correlations for Malmquist bias are corrected using the method of Verter (1988), in which each galaxy observation is weighted by the inverse of its sampling volume. The <b>linear</b> <b>regressions</b> are corrected for Malmquist bias by a new method invented here in which each galaxy observation is weighted by its sampling volume. The results of correlation and regressions among the sample are significantly changed in the anticipated sense that the corrected correlation confidences are lower and the corrected slopes of the <b>linear</b> <b>regressions</b> are lower. The elimination of Malmquist bias eliminates the nonlinear rise in luminosity that has caused some authors to hypothesize additional components of FIR emission...|$|R
