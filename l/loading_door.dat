25|$|It was {{considered}} to be sturdy and very manoeuvrable for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden semi-monocoque fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot's compartment and main freight <b>loading</b> <b>door,</b> the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the rear section supported the tail unit.|$|E

25|$|From 1980 {{the airline}} {{operated}} a single Boeing 737-2R4C. The aircraft was bought through {{a partnership with}} the Norwegian Armed Forces, in which it was specially equipped to meet military needs. Specifically, it was a combi variant, which encompassed a side <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> and the possibility to quickly rearrange the interior between all-passenger, all-freight, combined passenger and freight, as well as VIP configuration. The aircraft was designed to be able to operate out from gravel runways and was also as the only 737 certified to be used for parachuting.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{compartment}} had two side-by-side {{seats and}} dual controls, {{all of which}} being contained within a large Plexiglas nose section. Initially, the cockpit would be outfitted with internal telephone systems that allowed for communication between the pilots of the glider and tug aircraft while connected; however, this was replaced on later-built models by radio sets instead, which {{had the advantage of}} being able to maintain contact after detaching. Aft of the pilot's compartment was the freight <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> on the port side; the hinged door could also be used as a loading ramp. The main compartment could accommodate 15 troops on benches along the sides with another access door on the starboard side. Supply containers could also be fitted under the centre-section of the wing, three on each side.|$|E
25|$|From 6 April 1934 the Eighteen {{was used}} with other {{aircraft}} on the Glasgow-London-Belfast service by Midland and Scottish Air Ferries. In May 1935 G-ACFV {{was sold to}} Brian Allen Aviation for use {{with a variety of}} associated companies including Commercial Air Hire and Air Dispatch Limited. CAH used the aircraft for excursions and joy riding duties while Air Dispatch operated a daily newspaper flight between London and Paris, and a passenger service on the weekend. Due to the increase in freight business the aircraft was fitted with a larger <b>loading</b> <b>door.</b> Last flown by Commercial Air Hire in June 1936, a sightseeing trip around the RMS Queen Mary, the aircraft was sold as VH-UXD to Mandated Airlines in Australia. She was destroyed in New Guinea on 21 January 1942 by Japanese military forces.|$|E

5000|$|Blackburn B-107A : Projected Stage 3 {{development}} of the B-101 Beverley designed in 1959. The B-107A {{was similar to the}} B-107 but included main <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> in the nose and rear doors for para-dropping only, as well as a relocated flight deck. Like the B-107, this project never progressed beyond the planning stage.|$|R
2500|$|Although Braniff {{had been}} one of the first U.S. {{operators}} of the British-built BAC One-Eleven (and the first U.S. airline to order the British Aircraft Corporation twin jet), in 1965 Lawrence ordered twelve new US-built Boeing 727-100s and cancelled most of the remaining One-Eleven orders. The 727s had been selected before Lawrence's arrival, but no orders had been placed. These planes were the [...] "quick change" [...] (B727-100QC) model, which had a large freight <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> located on one side of the aircraft just aft of the flight deck. This allowed Braniff to begin late-night cargo service, while the aircraft carried passengers during the day. This doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open a new cargo business, AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a mixed cargo/passenger Combi aircraft configuration if needed and Braniff did operate [...] "red eye" [...] overnight services carrying cargo in the forward section with seating for 51 passengers in the rear coach compartment of the jetliner.|$|E
2500|$|L’Express Flight 508 was {{operated}} with a Beech C99 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. Seating on {{the plane}} was five rows of two seats, {{one on each side}} of a central aisle. A single seat was located across from the left passenger <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> and a double seat {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. Passengers boarded through the rear passenger door. The flight left New Orleans, LA with one passenger, at 4:05 pm CDT, landing in Mobile, AL, at 4:50 pm CDT. After changing crews and boarding 12 passengers, the flight departed for Birmingham Municipal Airport at 5:05 pm CDT. As the flight approached Birmingham, strong thunderstorms developed in the vicinity of the airport. Around the same time four other aircraft either diverted to other airports or delayed their approach and entered a holding pattern until the weather improved. The crew of Flight 508 was aware of the thunderstorm activity but elected to continue the approach. Francis Fernandes, the L'Express captain at the controls of Flight 508, later said the plane experienced a [...] "significant roll to the left" [...] on landing approach. Fernandes told investigators that while he and the first officer tried to level the aircraft, it experienced an [...] "extreme updraft" [...] that pushed the plane's nose into the air. After entering a severe thunderstorm cell southwest of the airport, the crew lost directional control and was unable to recover the aircraft prior to impacting two houses in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham at 6:11:27 pm CDT. The airplane struck one home, crossed a tree lined residential street, and slammed into a second home, immediately erupting into flames. The lone surviving passenger was encountered in the home by the residents before all fled the burning home. The captain was taken to UAB Hospital, passenger Mabry Rogers to Carraway Methodist Medical Center, and three residents to Baptist Princeton. Twelve passengers and the first officer perished in the crash; the captain, one passenger, and four residents were injured.|$|E

25|$|Built {{as a car}} ferry, Caledonian Princess was a roll-on/roll-off design, with {{a single}} vehicle door in the stern. The vehicle deck had space for 103 cars. To {{facilitate}} the turning of trucks for disembarking, a turntable {{was included in the}} deck. In 1969, she had side <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> cut into her vehicle deck.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, brake vans (or guard's vans; both {{terms were}} in common use) were often {{also used for}} {{carrying}} parcels and light freight, and usually had large compartments and <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> for such items. Some of the larger vans also included a compartment for passengers travelling on goods services or drovers travelling with their livestock.|$|R
50|$|The Valetta was a {{military}} transport development of the Viking civil airliner. The 58th Viking (c/n 158) became the prototype Valetta, which was first flown from Brooklands by test pilot Mutt Summers on 30 June 1947. The Valetta differed from the Viking fundamentally in being fitted with more powerful engines, a strengthened floor and large <b>loading</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

50|$|Early {{examples}} {{with just}} one or two wagons together were pulled downhill by the horse, the horse also acting as brakes. Later trains developed better mechanical brakes and so several wagons could be coupled together as a single train. The resting horse was carried in a separate wagon or 'dandy car'. These wagons were simple unpowered wagons, with no more adaption for horses than their <b>loading</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lower storey of {{the rear}} facade has a central set of large <b>loading</b> <b>doors.</b> Above this are three symmetrically placed double-hung sash windows with brick sills and low arches to their heads. This facade has two {{rainwater}} heads and associated downpipes, {{the one in the}} southern-most corner appearing to be set into the wall. The facade to the north-west has only three, small windows in it.|$|R
50|$|The East Lane {{elevation}} {{has similar}} parapet detailing, but the rendered facade details finish {{at the edge}} of the splayed corner entrance. This elevation is finished in painted brickwork, and the ground floor has a single opening with timber louvres and fixed glazing, with evidence of brick infill of an earlier <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> below. A brick infilled arched doorway is located adjacent. The first floor has a <b>loading</b> <b>door,</b> consisting of a roller door to the lower section surmounted by timber louvres, and a smaller louvred glass window is located adjacent.|$|E
50|$|KC-97A: Three C-97As were {{converted}} into aerial refueling tankers with rear <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> removed and a flight refueling boom added. After the design was proven, they {{were converted}} {{back into the}} standard C-97A.|$|E
50|$|When {{used as a}} {{paratroop}} transport, ten fully armed troops {{could be}} carried. The paratroopers were provided with a dropping hatch in the rear fuselage and a large <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> in the fuselage side.|$|E
50|$|The Connect, {{when first}} sold, {{was the only}} vehicle of its kind to offer folding and {{separately}} removable 60/40 split rear seats that allowed multiple seating formations and increased load capacity. It also boasted the option of twin sliding side <b>load</b> <b>doors</b> as well as rear doors or a tailgate, whereas neither of its main competitors have this option. The Connect's design emphasizes Ford's ideal that the vehicle be multipurpose.|$|R
50|$|Stanley Potato House is a {{historic}} potato house located near Laurel, Sussex County, Delaware, United States. It {{one of the last}} surviving examples of its building type. It was built about 1920, and is a 1 1/2-story, gable fronted, balloon frame structure on a brick foundation. It measures 17 feet by 23 feet. It retains a number of important elements characteristic of potato house including: minimal fenestration, center aisle floor plan, double siding, and hatched <b>loading</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Situated on 80 acre {{of rural}} farm land 25 mi from Adelaide, the lab's {{facilities}} included a 5×6 metre vibration isolation {{table in a}} studio with air-lock <b>loading</b> <b>doors,</b> large enough {{to drive a car}} onto the main table. The main laser was CW (continuous wave), 6W argon laser built by Coherent Scientific. The company also used a 3 joule ruby pulse laser, built in collaboration with Professor Jesper Munch of the School of Chemistry and Physics at Adelaide University.|$|R
50|$|The DWV built 120,000 Class A2 {{goods wagons}} from 1910 to 1927. These flat-roofed wagons were {{produced}} {{with and without}} hand brakes and in two variants of <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> and ventilation flap. One had a <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> and ventilation flap on each side; the other variant had two loading doors and two ventilation flaps per side. Later, most of the four-door variants were converted to two-door wagons as the extra doors were deemed superfluous. Vans with two ventilators were mainly used for transporting fruit and vegetables. The new raised brakeman's cab was given a gabled roof with a pointed ridge and handrails {{were added to the}} outside of the steps.|$|E
50|$|During the 20th century a turbine, an oil engine, a {{vertical}} steam engine, and finally an electric engine were installed in turn; the waterwheel was abandoned. The first-floor <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> had a hinged chute for sliding sacks into lorries.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has housed {{collections of the}} Maritime Archaeological Association of Far North Queensland since 1988. A <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> {{is present in the}} front end of the building, and was reportedly added after 1988 so that large maritime artefacts could be easily moved into the structure.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{derivatives}} of the Belfast were {{proposed by}} Short. Two principal civil {{versions of the}} aircraft, designated as SC5/10A and SC5/31, were mooted during the early 1960s. The SC5/10A {{was to have been}} a commercial freight derived directly from the Belfast C.1, retaining much of its design such as its large rear <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> for access to the main freight hold. The payload was to be increased to 85,000 lb; reportedly, up to 150 passengers could be seated on a single deck while up to 288 people could be seated across a double-deck configuration.|$|R
50|$|The {{silk mill}} was of six storeys over a {{basement}} and had 18 bays facing Great Bridgewater Street (Nos 72 and 74). The windows had raised sills and wedge lintels. Three bays were blind. The doorways were round-headed with rusticated long-and-short surrounds. The 20-bay west range had segmental-headed windows with raised sills, and <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> on most floors, the octagonal chimney {{was in the}} south-west corner. The rear of the main range had a garderobe turret (privy tower) {{to the right and}} a semi-octagonal turret in the centre.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the F27's {{production}} life, Fokker F27 {{proceeded to}} adapt the design for various purposes and roles. Via a number of modifications, such as the adoption of improved engines, rearranged <b>loading</b> <b>doors,</b> elongated fuselages, and other changes, several different models of the F27 were developed and made available for commercial operators to procure. The adaption of the type to produce several models {{for the purpose of}} performing as a military transport were also produced. Fokker also chose to design a dedicated model of the F27 for conducting maritime reconnaissance missions.|$|R
