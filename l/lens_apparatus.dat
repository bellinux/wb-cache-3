5000|$|CAPE LOOKOUT LIGHT:* The Cape Lookout Lighthouse was {{completed}} in 1812 {{at a cost of}} $20,678.54 and had one wooden and one brick tower.* The station was described in 1850, when William Fulford was keeper, as having 13 lamps, new lighting apparatus having been installed in 1848. The keeper was obliged, in 1850, to keep wheeling away sand from the front side of the keeper’s dwelling to prevent the sand from covering it up. [...] "The sand banks," [...] the report reads, [...] "are now higher than the tops of the windows; and only a few feet from them, at high water mark. On the sea side, it has washed away about 100 feet last year by abrasion and sea flows."* In 1851 Cape Lookout Lighthouse was reported as one of nine coast lights [...] "which require to be improved. The towers of each of them should have an elevation of 150 feet above the level of the sea and should be fitted up in the best manner with first-order <b>lens</b> <b>apparatus,</b> to insure a brilliancy and range adequate to the wants of commerce. These lights are not sufficiently well distinguished, but a general plan for all the seacoast lights will best accomplish this object."* On March 3, 1857, Congress appropriated $45,000 [...] "for rebuilding and fitting out with first-order apparatus the lighthouse at Cape Lookout, North Carolina." [...] The new lighthouse {{was completed}} and first lighted on November 1, 1859. During the Civil War, in 1862, the tower was damaged and the lens, etc., removed, but by 1863 the lighthouse had been refitted and the light reexhibited. A third-order lens was placed in use temporarily until the first-order lens, [...] "injured by the rebels" [...] could be repaired and restored in 1867.* The lighthouse is now a black and white diagonally checkered tower, 169 feet above ground and 156 feet above water and shows a group flashing white electric light every 15 seconds of 80,000 candela, visible 19 miles, from a first-order lens.

The early 1856 transport of the Fresnel Lens and its supporting apparatus from the docks in Edgartown to the clay cliffs was reported in a reflective story published in the Vineyard Gazette on June 26, 1970: [...] "...It took eight yoke of oxen to transport the heavy iron railing for the catwalks...but it took 40 yoke of oxen to move the 60 frames of glass prisms and the multitudinous collection of machinery necessary to operate the new light. The finely balanced lantern weighed over a ton all told. It must have been a slow ponderous procession that traveled the 20 some odd miles of hard packed dirt and sandy island roads from the Edgartown wharf to the clay cliffs..."

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the accommodative state {{of young adults}} wearing + 2 D and + 3 D reading spectacles under normal conditions and with the elimination of accommodative cues. Subjects’ refractions were measured with an infrared PowerRefractor. Power of the vertical meridian was recorded for subjects viewing far and near targets in free space and through a Badal <b>lens</b> <b>apparatus</b> with and without reading spectacles. Additionally, refractive measurements were taken after subjects wore + 2 D reading spectacles for 30 min (post-adaptation). In free viewing and viewing through the Badal lens, subjects uniformly over-accommodated relative to the target while wearing reading spectacles (i. e., with the spectacles, they focused at a plane {{in front of the}} target). Subjects in the first post-adaptation test showed no significant difference in accommodation between viewing a near target with and without + 2 D spectacles after having read with them for 30 min, though they had without post-adaptation. Subjects in the second post-adaptation test were not significantly differently accommodated before and after reading when binocularly viewing a near target with + 2 D reading spectacles. The results imply that no adaptation of the subjects’ accommodative postures while viewing visual targets occurred {{as a result of a}} 1 / 2 h near work task with the spectacles. The over-accommodation of subjects using reading spectacles while they are performing visual tasks shows the necessity of measurement if their true accommodative posture is to be determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this dissertation is aimed at development of photothermal deflection detector {{that is consistent with}} constraints imposed by aerosols sampling and analysis. The main objectives of this project are: 1) the design and evaluation of initial apparatus prototypes and 2) a test of the prototype apparatus with surrogate substances using conventional mid-infrared gas lasers. Experimental evaluation of reduced size photothermal apparatus is first performed with gaseous samples. Analysis of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC- 11) and ethanol vapors is performed with both conventional large apparatus and the prototype small apparatus. Comparison studies in terms of photothermal signal from both apparatuses are carried out to examine how apparatus downscaling affects photothermal signal. The main result indicates that the small apparatus performs about the same as the conventional laboratory-size apparatus. For better understanding of heat transport from aerosols collect on a flat substrate and its surrounding media, a numerical methodology based on finite element analysis is used to investigate the heat transfer between aerosol, substrate, and air. The numerical modeling is extended to prediction of photothermal signals from laser excited optical beam deflection due to temperature gradient inside the air above aerosols. The modeling results help to understand how aerosol properties such as size, shape, thermo-optical properties, and particles arrangement affect photothermal signal. The model is also used to investigate the influence of substrate properties on photothermal signal. A photothermal deflection apparatus is then used to examine the potential of mid-infrared photothermal spectroscopy for aerosol analysis. Laboratory-generated ammonium nitrate aerosols are deposited on germanium substrate by using Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposits Impactor (MOUDI). Photothermal spectroscopy, based on optical beam deflection (mirage effect), is used to analyze the collected aerosols. The measurements are carried out in terms of aerosol number concentration and aerosol mass concentration. Based on standard 30 minutes sampling time and 30 L/min flow rate, the limit of detection obtained for our instrument are 18 particles, equivalence of 0. 2 μg m- 3 mass concentrations for 3 μm particles diameter) for aerosol number concentration measurement and 0. 65 μg m- 3 for aerosol mass concentration measurement.

40|$|Purpose: Mutations {{in human}} fibrillin- 1 and - 2, which are major {{constituents}} of tissue microfibrils, can affect multiple ocular components, including the ciliary zonule, <b>lens,</b> drainage <b>apparatus,</b> cornea, and retina. However, the expression {{pattern of the}} three human fibrillins and an integral microfibrillar component, MAGP 1, during human eye development is not known. Methods: We analyzed sections from human eyes at gestational weeks (GWs) 6, 8, and 11 and at 1 and 3 years of age with antibodies specific for each human fibrillin isoform or MAGP 1, using immunofluorescence microscopy. Results: During embryonic development, each fibrillin isoform was detected in vascular structures bridging the ciliary body and the developing lens, hyaloid vasculature, and retina. In addition, they {{were present in the}} developing corneal basement membranes and lens capsule. MAGP 1 codistributed with the fibrillin isoforms. In contrast, the juvenile zonule was composed of fibrillin- 1 microfibrils containing MAGP 1, but fibrillin- 2 was absent and fibrillin- 3 was only sparsely detected. Conclusions: Fibrillin- 1, - 2, and, unique to humans, fibrillin- 3 are found in various ocular structures during human embryonic eye development, whereas fibrillin- 1 dominates the postnatal zonule. We speculate that vasculature spanning the ciliary body and lens, which elaborates fibrillin- 2 and - 3, may provide an initial scaffold for fibrillin assembly and zonule formation. © 2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods for}} measuring and modeling optical bleaching that occurs, by using continuous laser sources for solution-phase organic dye molecule spectrometry. Photothermal lens experiments {{are used to}} measure the nonlinear optical absorption coefficients of eosin Y, erythrosin B, and pseudo-isocyanine iodide dyes in ethanol as a function of excitation irradiance. Excitation irradiance-dependent photothermal lens data are subsequently interpreted in terms of the photophysics and excited-state relaxation dynamics of the condensed-phase dye molecules under study. The model uses first-order kinetics for excitation and subsequent metastable-state relaxation back to the ground state and accounts for both ground- and metastable-state absorption. The measurement model accounts for thermal <b>lens</b> formation and <b>apparatus</b> configuration. Nonlinear absorption measurements are fit to the model with nonlinear regression. The resulting parameters allow calculation of triplet-state absorption coefficients and triplet to ground singlet state-relaxation rate constants...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{navigation}} aid on Cleveland Point was {{a beacon}} established in 1847, by Francis Edward Bigge, Member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, at his expense, {{as part of}} his lobbying of Cleveland as the port for Moreton Bay. In the middle of the 19th century, small coastal steamboats became a main means of transport for farmers in Moreton Bay, specifically in Cleveland, Victoria Point, Redland Bay and along the Logan River and Albert River. Several lights were established around that period to assist navigation in Moreton Bay, notorious for its rocks and moving mudflats and sandbanks. In some places where no official light was established, locals would install their own lights, {{as was the case in}} Cleveland Point. In the 1860s the Government of Queensland decided to replace these lights with a permanent light. The first temporary government light was displayed in April 1864.

Despite this, little research has been undertaken to define this problem. The extent of scratching of rigid contact lens materials was evaluated and this property was related to material oxygen permeability and refractive index. One hundred and forty lenses made from 28 different rigid materials were evaluated in a masked and randomised manner. Scratches were created on the front surface of the <b>lenses</b> using an <b>apparatus</b> that was specifically designed and constructed for this experiment. The extent of scratching was quantitatively evaluated using a computer-based scanning and image analysis system. The oxygen permeability of all materials was measured using the polarographic method. An Atago N 3000 hand-held refractometer was used to measure the refractive index of these materials. Three significant correlations were revealed: an inverse relationship (r = - 0. 813, P < 0. 0001) between oxygen permeability and refractive index; a positive relationship (r = 0. 511, P < 0. 008) between oxygen permeability and the extent of scratching; and an inverse relationship (r = - 0. 539, P < 0. 0058) between refractive index and the extent of scratching.

But it will probably {{come as a surprise}} to most to learn that Scheimpflug himself disclaimed inventing the rule that now bears his name. The Scheimpflug Principle (or rule or condition) provides guidance on how a camera lens and/or back should be tilted when focusing upon a plane that is not parallel to the film. This short article is intended to provide a little historical background and technical information about Scheimpflug and his patent. If Scheimpflug did not invent this rule, who did? Scheimpflug cites only one reference, and that is to the British Patent of Monsieur Jules Carpentier of Paris. In 1901 Carpentier had patented an enlarger for correcting converging verticals. Carpentier made this claim: "I have investigated the law which governs the correlation between the inclination of the plane of the negative and that of the sensitized surface to that of the optical axis of the lens [...] . and I find that the relationship is this:—If the two planes are sufficiently prolonged they must intersect in the plane perpendicular to the said axis and passing through the optical center of the <b>lens.</b> " Carpentier's <b>apparatus</b> for maintaining this condition is shown in (his) Figures 1 and 2.

40|$|AbstractThe biometric, {{optical and}} {{physical}} properties of 19 pairs of isolated human eye-bank lenses {{ranging in age}} from 5 to 96 years were compared. Lens focal length and spherical aberration were measured using a scanning laser <b>apparatus,</b> <b>lens</b> thickness and the lens surface curvatures were measured by digitizing the lens profiles and equivalent refractive indices were calculated for each lens using this data. The second lens from each donor was used to measure resistance to physical deformation by providing a compressive force to the lens. The lens capsule was then removed from each lens and each measurement was repeated to ascertain what role the capsule plays in determining these optical and physical characteristics. Age dependent changes in lens focal length, lens surface curvatures and lens resistance to physical deformation are described. Isolated lens focal length was found to be significantly linearly correlated with both the anterior and posterior surface curvatures. No age dependent change in equivalent refractive index of the isolated lens was found. Although decapsulating human lenses causes similar changes in focal length to that which we have shown to occur when human lenses are mechanically stretched into an unaccommodated state, the effects are due to nonsystematic changes in lens curvatures. These studies reinforce the conclusion that lens hardening must be considered as an important factor in the development of presbyopia, that age changes in the human lens are not limited to the loss of accommodation that characterizes presbyopia but that the lens optical and physical properties change substantially with age in a complex manner...|$|R
40|$|Thermal lens {{spectrometry}} {{is based}} on the measurement of the temperature rise that is produced in an illuminated sample by nonradiative relaxation of the energy absorbed from a laser.

The main objective of this work is to extend the scope and applicability of the technique so that it can be used in the area of general trace chemical analysis and characterization.

For aqueous solutions which are generally considered to be the worst medium for thermal lens measurements. The sensitivity of the technique was improved by simply increasing the solution temperature and/or by adding strong electrolytes or surfactants into the solution.
