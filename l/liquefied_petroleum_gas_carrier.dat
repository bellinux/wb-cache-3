50|$|Stolt-Nielsen Limited {{entered the}} market for the {{transportation}} of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG) in late 2009. The company purchased the Althea Gas, built in 2003, and the VLGC Yuhsho built in 1999. The company began further integrating the gas business into its business model by the purchase of second-hand <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>carriers,</b> operating in both the spot and short-term period markets. On 19 November 2010 SNG entered into a partnership with Sungas Holdings Ltd to become equal shareholders in Avance Gas Holding Ltd which was previously wholly owned by SNG. Avance Gas now owns six VLGCs.|$|R

500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>carriers.</b> [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|R

40|$|This study {{endeavors to}} {{determine}} whether farmers adjust their consumption of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> in response {{to changes in the}} unit price of energy. A demand model is specified and estimated. The conclusions suggest that the unit price of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> is a factor impacting the quantity of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> demanded by farmers, but {{there is no indication that}} other types of energy are substitutes for natural <b>gas</b> or <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Additionally, the number of acres irrigated is an important factor driving the demand for natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Finally, the estimated models of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> demand were structurally stable over the period 1971 - 1989. ...|$|R

40|$|Household {{surveys in}} Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka were {{analyzed}} using a two-stage Heckman model to examine the factors influencing {{the decision to use}} <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (stage 1) and, among users, the quantity consumed per person (stage 2). In the first stage, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in all six countries increased with household expenditure and the highest level of education attained by female and male household members. Electricity connection increased, and engagement in agriculture and increasing household size decreased, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in five countries; urban residence increased selection in four countries; and rising firewood and kerosene prices increased selection in three countries each. In the second stage, the quantity of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumed increased with rising household expenditure and decreasing price of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> in every country. Urban residence increased and engagement in agriculture decreased <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumption. Surveys in Albania, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru, which did not report quantities, were also examined by calculating quantities using national average prices. Although fuel prices faced by individual households could not be tested, the findings largely supported those from the first six countries. Once the education levels of men and women were separately accounted for, the gender of the head of household was not statistically significant in most cases across the ten countries. Where it was significant (five equations), the sign of the coefficient was positive for men, possibly suggesting that female-headed households are burdened with unmeasured economic disadvantages, making less cash available for purchasing <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Energy Production and Transportation,Markets and Market Access,Energy Conservation&Efficiency,Renewable Energy,Energy and Environment...|$|R
