40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exploratory agent-based {{model of a}} real time gross settlement (RTGS) payment system. Banks are represented as agents who exchange payment requests, which are then settled according {{to a set of}} simple rules. The model features the main elements of a real-life system, including a central bank acting as <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider,</b> and a simplified money market. A simulation exercise using synthetic data of BI-REL (the Italian RTGS) predicts the macroscopic impact of a disruptive event on the flow of interbank payments. In our reduced-scale system, three hypothetical distinct phases emerge after the disruptive event: 1) a liquidity sink effect is generated and the participantsĺiquidity expectations turn out to be excessive; 2) an illusory thickening of the money market follows, along with increased payment delays; and, finally 3) defaulted obligations dramatically rise. The banks cannot staunch the losses accruing on defaults, even after they become fully aware of the critical event, and a scenario emerges in which it might be necessary for the central bank to step in as <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider.</b> Agent-Based Modeling, Payment Systems, RTGS, Liquidity, Crisis Simulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{liquidity provision}} in an electronic limit order market around macroeconomic news releases when fast {{execution of orders}} is especially important. In limit order markets, {{where there is no}} designated <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider,</b> the <b>liquidity</b> situation is primarily determined by specific trading patterns. We find that scheduled information events are followed by a high immediate trading desire. However, the volume offered at limit prices is unusually low. This imbalance between liquidity demand and supply leads to a liquidity shortage reflected in high spreads. Moreover, we find that the shortage is asymmetric {{depending on the type of}} announced information and the absolute amount of its unexpected component.

40|$|This short paper, {{prepared}} as a keynote address, {{explains why the}} credit crunch is fundamentally a story about financial markets, not banks. Its cause was a collapse of securitization and other debt markets, which have become major sources of financing for consumers and companies. Deprived of this financing, consumers have had difficulty purchasing homes and automobiles, and companies have had difficulty purchasing inventory and making capital investments, causing the real economy to shrink. This paper examines how these financial markets should be protected. Although already subject to many prescriptive regulatory protections, these markets evolve faster than regulation can adapt. The paper argues that a market <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> of last resort is the most robust and cost-effective way to protect these financial markets when prescriptive regulation inevitably fails...|$|R
40|$|We report {{evidence}} {{that the presence of}} hidden liquidity is associated with greater liquidity in the order books, greater trading volume, and smaller price impact. Limit and market order submission behavior changes when hidden liquidity is present consistent with at least some traders being able to detect hidden liquidity. We estimate a model of liquidity provision that allows us to measure variations in the marginal and total payoffs from liquidity provision in states with and without hidden liquidity. Our estimates of the expected surplus to providers of visible and hidden liquidity are positive and typically of the order of one-half to one basis points per trade. The positive <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> surpluses combined with the increased trading volume when hidden liquidity is present are both consistent with liquidity externalities...|$|R
40|$|The {{market maker}} plays an {{important}} role in price formation, but his/her behavior and stabilizing impact on the market are relatively unclear, in particular in speculative markets. This paper develops a financial market model that examines the impact on market stability of the market maker, who acts as both a <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> and an active investor in a market consisting of two types of boundedly rational speculative investors—the fundamentalists and trend followers. We show that the market maker does not necessarily stabilize the market when he/she actively manages the inventory to maximize profits, and that rather the market maker’s impact depends on the behavior of the speculators. Numerical simulations show that the model is able to generate outcomes for asset returns and market inventories that are consistent with empirical findings.

Using a sample of European listed firms, we confirm {{that there is a}} positive and significant relationship between CSP rating and a firm's liquidity and investor base. Consistent with the neglected stock effect, this relationship is sensitive to firm size. Our results have important implications for practitioners. Firstly, investment in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) could represent an alternative method of improving a company's stock market quality alongside <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> contracting or market listing transfer. Secondly, when a firm's board investigates the opportunity to invest in CSR, it should consider the benefits of lowering the company's cost of capital through the aforementioned effects. Finally, from an asset manager's perspective, any change in CSP should be taken into account, as it can affect company valuation and therefore portfolio performance...|$|R
40|$|I {{propose a}} {{discrete}} time model of financial markets {{in which an}} arbitrageur has investment opportunities but faces a number of financial constraints. Investment opportunities arise when the price discrepancy between a pair of similar assets becomes large enough. I propose an innovative way to model the effects of market liquidity and the arbitrage industry's reversion force on a stochastic price discrepancy. I use empirical studies and common literature assumptions to build and calibrate the model. I then run a set of Monte-Carlo simulations to test the model's response to the risks and returns {{of a number of}} arbitrage strategies in varying economic conditions. The model's results are in line with a number of theories in the existing literature, and specifically confirm the role of the arbitrageur as a <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> in disturbed market environments. by Roland Beunardeau.

40|$|The New Deal {{regulatory}} policies and institutions redesigned the U. S. financial structure and implicitly required the coordination between monetary {{policy and the}} regulatory framework; in that financial structure the Federal Reserve provided the reserves. The interest policy implicitly required the calibration and coordination of deposit ceiling rates and the prevailing market rate set by the Fed. However, the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of 1951 effectively dismantled the necessary coordination between monetary policy and the banking regulatory framework. The combination of interest rate differentials and reliance on markets as a <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> triggered {{the creation of new}} financial instruments and institutions that changed the structure of the U. S. banking system. This policy encouraged the development of a financial system in which financial institutions seek to escape regulations. For instance, nonbank financial institutions escaped regulations and entered into the banking business model, getting both market share and profits of the regulated banking system. The New Deal constraints combined with innovation and competition between regulated and unregulated banks encouraged the emergence of shadow banks, as the latter were not subject to constraints. monetary policy, regulation, shadow banking, U.
