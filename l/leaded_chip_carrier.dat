As the electronic components plastic <b>leaded</b> <b>chip</b> <b>carriers,</b> the PLCC 84 with daisy chain internal wiring were chosen and subjected to temperature change cycles. After different numbers of load cycles the joints were electrically tested and the faailure rate compared with the visually evaluated dislocation. In addition, damages and cracks were characterized by REM and metallographic investigations. It is demonstrated that failures by breakage of the soldered joints can be excluded at x- and y-dislocations up to 50 %.

50|$|Tape and reel feeder is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used feeder design. Tape-on-reel feeders are loaded with a reel, which is placed onto a reel-reception. The peel-off carriage pulls the reel tape forward until the next component is in the pick-up position. When the sensor indicates that the component is at the pickup position, a holder moves down and locks-down the tape.Tape feeders are most suitable for placing large quantities of identical small components. Tape feeders {{come in a variety of}} sizes and can be used for Small-outline integrated circuits (SOICs) and plastic <b>leaded</b> <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> (PLCCs).The main disadvantage of the tape format is the inability to recycle the empty tapes. Especially in the case of small chip devices, the tape waste material weighs several times more than the packaged components. Moreover, there is additional cost for placing small inexpensive components in tape.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{moisture}} resistance tests of various multilayer top brazed ceramic flat packs and <b>leaded</b> and unleaded <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> has revealed a serious design defect. These packages, which utilize a tungsten interconnect system, {{in the presence}} of high humidity, suffer a galvanic corrosion which anodically consumes the tungsten. This process can continue until the package suffers an open circuit. The test results indicate that the lead plating system does not adequately seal off the interface area where the tungsten stripe egresses from the inside of the package. <b>Leaded</b> and leadless <b>chip</b> <b>carrier</b> packages were also subjected to the {{moisture resistance}} test. The familiar red and green corrosion products were visible after the test was completed. Careful sectioning of the <b>chip</b> <b>carriers</b> has revealed that the tungsten interconnect stripe instead of exiting under the castellations, exits {{at the top of the}} castellation and is thus vulnerable to the attack of moisture. These basic design faults severely impact the reliability of these packages...|$|R

In the present study, three dimensional numerical analysis of heat and fluid flow through PLCC packages oriented in-line and mounted horizontally on a printed circuit board, is carried out using a commercial CFD code, FLUENTTM. The simulation is performed for 12 PLCC under different inlet velocities and chip powers. The contours of average junction temperatures are obtained for each package under different conditions. It is observed that the junction temperature of the packages decreases with increase in inlet velocity and increases with chip power. Moreover, the increase in package density significantly contributed to rise in temperature of chips. Thus the present simulation demonstrates that the chip density (the number of packages mounted on a given area), chip power and the coolant inlet velocity are strongly interconnected; hence their appropriate choice would be crucia...|$|E

Parameters such as junction temperature, thermal resistance and top surface average Nusselt number have been studied for each package by varying the chip power, spacing between the packages and approach air velocities. The decrease in the junction temperature of the packages {{with the increase in}} approach air velocity is clearly observed. Furthermore, the Nusselt number of PLCC 1 is always slightly higher than PLCC 2 for all approach velocities considered.
