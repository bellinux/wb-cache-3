They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.|$|E

40|$|When {{a student}} is faced with {{uncertainty}} in the trustworthiness of a <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> to meet their intended learning goals, it may cause anxiety {{and a lack of}} confidence in the learning. A student’s trust in the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> is needed to reduce this uncertainty. This work develops a conceptual trust model for e-learning activities. The proposed student’s trust model is the Learning Outcome-based Trust (LOT) model. The antecedents of trust are represented based on the intended learning outcome (ILO) structures and are used to estimate the trustworthiness values of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity.</b> Once values based on the antecedents of trust are known, these values are used to assess how much the student can trust the <b>learning</b> <b>activity.</b> The LOT model was evaluate in two real learning situation: (1) where information about the trustworthiness of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> was ambiguous, and (2) where information about the trustworthiness of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> was clear. Students’ trust mainly related to their propensity to trust and their prior knowledge when the trustworthiness of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> was ambiguous. In contrast, students’ trust mainly related to their perceived trustworthiness of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> when the trustworthiness of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> was clear.

40|$|Background. Educational {{process in}} a {{university}} {{is characterized by a}} highly expressed emotional aspect. Students’ repeating emotional experiences form stable structures, the so called emotional installations. The system of emotional installations is a kernel of the emotional attitude to educational activity. Unfortunately, many modern students’ emotional attitude to educational activity is deformed. It can interfere with effective assimilation of knowledge. Therefore researches of the factors deﬁning the emotional attitude of students to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> {{are becoming more and more}} actual. Educational activity contains temporary restrictions and imposes certain obligations on a student. Academic procrastination (unjustiﬁed postponement of the solution of educational tasks for the future) can be shown in the emotional attitude of a student to <b>learning</b> <b>activity.</b> The objective of the research is to study the interrelations of the academic procrastination with parameters of the emotional attitude to the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> of high academic progress students and low ones. The hypothesis states that the emotional attitude to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> of students with high academic procrastination is broken. Method. Russian adaptation of the questionnaire of Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (D. Watson, L. A. Clark, And. Tellegen, 1988), adapted version of Procrastination Scale for Student Population (C. H. Lay, 1986). Sample. 182 students (20 men and 162 women) aged from 18 till 52 years. Results. Negative correlation of procrastination with the integrated positive attitude to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> (rxy = - 0, 26; р < 0, 0005) and positive – with integrated negative attitude (rxy = 0, 29; р < 0, 0001) is revealed. Procrastination of high academic progress students is combined with strong decrease of positive attitude to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> (rxy = - 0, 46; р < 0, 00005) and strengthening of the negative attitude to it (rxy = 0, 42; р < 0, 0005). In the group of low academic progress students, the majority of correlations is statistically doubtful. Conclusions. With high procrastination, the general negative attitude of students to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> signiﬁcantly ampliﬁes, and the general positive one – weakens. A certain structure of fractional emotional installations to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> corresponds to a certain level of procrastination. Manifestation of academic procrastination in the emotional attitude to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> is connected with students’ academic progress. High academic progress students’ emotional attitude to <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> is broken by procrastination more than that of low academic progress students...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{outcomes of}} {{a longitudinal study}} on learning motivation in children of early school age. The aim was to reveal the leading motives in first, second, third and fourth grades and to explore the dynamics of some learning motives in children over the whole period of elementary school. As it was found, the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> in the children was mostly motivated by social motives, among which the leading ones were the motives of selfdetermination and wellbeing. As for learning motives, {{over the course of}} all four years the children were for the most part motivated by the content of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity,</b> and not by its process. The dynamics of certain social motives of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> varied across the sample, with some going through the periods of increase and decrease and others having a oneway dynamics. The study also revealed a decrease in the motivation rooted in the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> itself between the second and third year; at the same time, in the second, third and fourth years the children were more motivated by the content of the <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> than by its proces...|$|R
40|$|Research {{was aimed}} to determine: (1) Students’ {{learning}} outcomes that was taught with {{just in time}} teaching based STAD cooperative learning method and STAD cooperative learning method (2) Students’ outcomes on Physics subject that had high <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> compared with low <b>learning</b> <b>activity.</b> The research sample was random by raffling four classes to get two classes. The first class taught with just in time teaching based STAD cooperative learning method, while the second class was taught with STAD cooperative learning method. The instrument used was conceptual understanding that had been validated with 7 essay questions. The average gain values of students learning results with just in time teaching based STAD cooperative learning method 0, 47 higher than average gain values of students learning results with STAD cooperative learning method. The high <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> and low <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> gave different <b>learning</b> results. In this case the average gain values of students learning results with just in time teaching based STAD cooperative learning method 0, 48 higher than average gain values of students learning results with STAD cooperative learning method. There was interaction between learning model and <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> to the physics learning result test in student...|$|R
