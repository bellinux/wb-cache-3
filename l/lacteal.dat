60|$|I sat on {{his trunk}} while Ferguson Pogue talked. No one could be franker or more candid in his conversation. Beside his {{expression}} the cry of Henry James for <b>lacteal</b> nourishment {{at the age of}} one month would have seemed like a Chaldean cryptogram. He told me stories of his profession with pride, for he considered it an art. And I was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it.|$|E
60|$|Section 30. The {{walls of}} {{the whole of the}} small {{intestine}} are engaged in the absorption of the soluble results of digestion. In the duodenum, especially, small processes, the villi project into the cavity, and being, like the small hairs of velvet pile, and as thickly set, give its inner coat a velvety appearance. In a villus we find (Figure IX., Sheet 3) a series of small blood-vessels and with it another vessel called a <b>lacteal.</b> The lacteals run together into larger and larger branches until they form a main trunk, the thoracic duct, which opens into the blood circulation at a point near the heart; but of this we shall speak further later. They contain, after a meal, a fluid called chyle.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 16th century, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tubes), {{described}} what are {{now known as}} the <b>lacteals</b> as [...] "coursing over the intestines full of yellow matter." [...] In about 1563 Bartolomeo Eustachi, a professor of anatomy, described the thoracic duct in horses as vena alba thoracis. The next breakthrough came when in 1622 a physician, Gaspare Aselli, identified lymphatic vessels of the intestines in dogs and termed them venae alba et lacteae, which is now known as simply the <b>lacteals.</b> The <b>lacteals</b> were termed the fourth kind of vessels (the other three being the artery, vein and nerve, which was then believed to be a type of vessel), and disproved Galen's assertion that chyle was carried by the veins. But, he still believed that the <b>lacteals</b> carried the chyle to the liver (as taught by Galen). He also identified the thoracic duct but failed to notice its connection with the <b>lacteals.</b> This connection was established by Jean Pecquet in 1651, who found a white fluid mixing with blood in a dog's heart. He suspected that fluid to be chyle as its flow increased when abdominal pressure was applied. He traced this fluid to the thoracic duct, which he then followed to a chyle-filled sac he called the chyli receptaculum, which is {{now known as the}} cisternae chyli; further investigations led him to find that lacteals' contents enter the venous system via the thoracic duct. Thus, it was proven convincingly that the <b>lacteals</b> did not terminate in the liver, thus disproving Galen's second idea: that the chyle flowed to the liver. Johann Veslingius drew the earliest sketches of the <b>lacteals</b> in humans in 1647.|$|R
50|$|The chylomicrons {{are small}} enough {{to pass through the}} {{enterocyte}} villi and into their lymph capillaries called <b>lacteals.</b> A milky fluid called chyle, consisting mainly of the emulsified fats of the chylomicrons, results from the absorbed mix with the lymph in the <b>lacteals.</b> Chyle is then transported through the lymphatic system {{to the rest of the}} body.|$|R

6000|$|Spilled milk draws few {{tears from}} an Anchurian administration. Many are its <b>lacteal</b> sources; and the clocks' hands point forever to milking time. Even the rich cream skimmed from the {{treasury}} by the bewitched Miraflores {{did not cause}} the newly-installed patriots to waste time in unprofitable regrets. The government philosophically set about supplying the deficiency by increasing the import duties and by [...] "suggesting" [...] to wealthy private citizens that contributions according to their means would be considered patriotic and in order. Prosperity was expected to attend the reign of Losada, the new president. The ousted office-holders and military favourites organized a new [...] "Liberal" [...] party, and began to lay their plans for a re-succession. Thus the game of Anchurian politics began, like a Chinese comedy, to unwind slowly its serial length. Here and there Mirth peeps for an instant from the wings and illumines the florid lines.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} week we were two busy and happy people. I rose about half-past five and made the fire,--we found so much wood on the shore, that I thought I {{should not have to}} add fuel to my expenses,--and Euphemia cooked the breakfast. I then went to a well {{belonging}} to a cottage near by where we had arranged for water-privileges, and filled two buckets with delicious water and carried them home for Euphemia's use through the day. Then I hurried off to catch the train, for, as there was a station near Ginx's, I ceased to patronize the steamboat, the hours of which were not convenient. After a day of work and pleasurable anticipation at the office, I hastened back to my home, generally laden with a basket of provisions and various household necessities. Milk was brought to us daily from the above-mentioned cottage by a little toddler who seemed just able to carry the small tin bucket which held a <b>lacteal</b> pint. If the urchin had been the child of rich parents, as Euphemia sometimes observed, he would have been in his nurse's arms--but being poor, he was scarcely weaned before he began to carry milk around to other people.|$|E
60|$|Reader! did {{you ever}} taste such {{a cup of tea}} as Miss Gibbs is this moment handing to Mr. Pilgrim? Do you know the dulcet strength, the animating blandness of tea {{sufficiently}} blended with real farmhouse cream? No--most likely you are a miserable town-bred reader, who think of cream as a thinnish white fluid, delivered in infinitesimal pennyworths down area steps; or perhaps, from a presentiment of calves' brains, you refrain from any <b>lacteal</b> addition, and rasp your tongue with unmitigated bohea. You have a vague idea of a milch cow as probably a white-plaster animal standing in a butterman's window, and you know nothing of the sweet history of genuine cream, such as Miss Gibbs's: how it was this morning in the udders of the large sleek beasts, as they stood lowing a patient entreaty under the milking-shed; how it fell with a pleasant rhythm into Betty's pail, sending a delicious incense into the cool air; how it was carried into that temple of moist cleanliness, the dairy, where it quietly separated itself from the meaner elements of milk, and lay in mellowed whiteness, ready for the skimming-dish which transferred it to Miss Gibbs's glass cream-jug. If I am right in my conjecture, you are unacquainted with the highest possibilities of tea; and Mr. Pilgrim, who is holding that cup in his hands, has an idea beyond you.|$|E
50|$|Each villus has {{a network}} of {{capillaries}} and fine lymphatic vessels called <b>lacteals</b> close to its surface. The epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries (amino acids and carbohydrates) and <b>lacteals</b> (lipids). The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where {{they are used to}} build complex substances such as the proteins required by our body. The material that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes into the large intestine.|$|R
50|$|Triglycerides are {{emulsified}} by bile and hydrolyzed by {{the enzyme}} lipase, {{resulting in a}} mixture of fatty acids, di- and monoglycerides. These then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte, where they are re-esterified to form triacylglycerol. The triacylglycerol is then combined with phospholipids, cholesterol ester, and apolipoprotein B48 to form chylomicrons. These chylomicrons then pass into the <b>lacteals,</b> forming a milky substance known as chyle. The <b>lacteals</b> merge to form larger lymphatic vessels that transport the chyle to the thoracic duct where it is emptied into the bloodstream at the subclavian vein.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{over a period of}} 4 years, on a total number of 133 dogs, all of those expressing gastrointestinal disorders. Ultrasound and endoscopic examinations were performed in all dogs in order to assess any significant correlations between ultrasonographic and endoscopic findings. The results confirm a significant correlation between the presence of diarrhoea and increased thickness of the large bowel wall, with P< 0. 5. Another extremely significant correlation we observed is the one between increased thickness of large bowel wall and loss of layering at this level, with P< 0. 5. Upper GI endoscopy revealed that dilated <b>lacteals</b> in the duodenum are significantly associated with the presence of diarrhoea, P< 0. 5 and, more importantly, there is a very significant correlation between dilated <b>lacteals</b> and the presence of striations (P< 0. 5), which confirms previous studies (Sutherland-Smith et al., 2007) that say the striated aspect of the intestinal mucosa is due to dilated <b>lacteals...</b>|$|R
60|$|Very {{central in}} Miss Miniver's {{universe}} were the Goopes. The Goopes were the oddest little couple conceivable, following a fruitarian career upon an upper floor in Theobald's Road. They were childless and servantless, {{and they had}} reduced simple living to the finest of fine arts. Mr. Goopes, Ann Veronica gathered, was a mathematical tutor and visited schools, and his wife wrote a weekly column in New Ideas upon vegetarian cookery, vivisection, degeneration, the <b>lacteal</b> secretion, appendicitis, and the Higher Thought generally, and assisted {{in the management of}} a fruit shop in the Tottenham Court Road. Their very furniture had mysteriously a high-browed quality, and Mr. Goopes when at home dressed simply in a pajama-shaped suit of canvas sacking tied with brown ribbons, while his wife wore a purple djibbah with a richly embroidered yoke. He was a small, dark, reserved man, with a large inflexible-looking convex forehead, and his wife was very pink and high-spirited, with one of those chins that pass insensibly into a full, strong neck. Once a week, every Saturday, they had a little gathering from nine till the small hours, just talk and perhaps reading aloud and fruitarian refreshments--chestnut sandwiches buttered with nut tose, and so forth--and lemonade and unfermented wine; and to one of these symposia Miss Miniver after a good deal of preliminary solicitude, conducted Ann Veronica.|$|E
6000|$|But {{this brings}} me to the most {{extraordinary}} feature of this singular demonstration. I do not think that the publishers were at all troubled by it; I cannot conscientiously say that I was; I have {{every reason to believe that}} the poets themselves, in and out of the volume, were not displeased at the notoriety they had not expected, and I have long since been convinced that my most remorseless critics were not in earnest, but were obeying some sudden impulse started by the first attacking journal. The extravagance of the Red Dog [...] "Jay Hawk" [...] was emulated by others: it was a large, contagious joke, passed from journal to journal in a peculiar cyclonic Western fashion. And there still lingers, not unpleasantly, in my memory the conclusion of a cheerfully scathing review of the book which may make my meaning clearer: [...] "If we have said anything in this article which might cause a single pang to the poetically sensitive nature of the youthful individual calling himself Mr. Francis Bret Harte--but who, we believe, occasionally parts his name and his hair in the middle--we will feel that we have not labored in vain, and are ready to sing Nunc Dimittis, and hand in our checks. We have no doubt of the absolutely pellucid and <b>lacteal</b> purity of Franky's intentions. He means well to the Pacific Coast, and we return the compliment. But he has strayed away from his parents and guardians while he was too fresh. He will not keep without a little salt." ...|$|E

25|$|The {{contents}} of these micelles (but not the bile salts) enter the enterocytes (epithelial cells lining the small intestine) {{where they are}} resynthesized into triglycerides, and packaged into chylomicrons which are released into the <b>lacteals</b> (the capillaries of the lymph system of the intestines). These <b>lacteals</b> drain into the thoracic duct which empties into the venous blood at the junction of the left jugular and left subclavian veins on the lower left hand side of the neck. This means that the fat soluble products of digestion are discharged directly into the general circulation, without first passing through the liver, as all other digestion products do.

60|$|We {{were walking}} along a lonely terrace in Brompton together. The street {{was full of}} that bright blue {{twilight}} which comes about half past eight in summer, and which seems for the moment to be {{not so much a}} coming of darkness as the turning on of a new azure illuminator, as if the earth were lit suddenly by a sapphire sun. In the cool blue the lemon tint of the lamps had already begun to flame, and as Rupert and I passed them, Rupert talking excitedly, one after another the pale sparks sprang out of the dusk. Rupert was talking excitedly because he was trying to prove to me the nine hundred and ninety-ninth of his amateur detective theories. He would go about London, with this mad logic in his brain, seeing a conspiracy in a cab accident, and a special providence in a falling fusee. His suspicions at the moment were fixed upon an unhappy milkman who walked in front of us. So arresting were the incidents which afterwards overtook us that I am really afraid that I have forgotten what were the main outlines of the milkman's crime. I think {{it had something to do}} with the fact that he had only one small can of milk to carry, and that of that he had left the lid loose and walked so quickly that he spilled milk on the pavement. This showed that he was not thinking of his small burden, and this again showed that he anticipated some other than <b>lacteal</b> business at the end of his walk, and this (taken in conjunction with something about muddy boots) showed something else that I have entirely forgotten. I am afraid that I derided this detailed revelation unmercifully; and I am afraid that Rupert Grant, who, though the best of fellows, had a good deal of the sensitiveness of the artistic temperament, slightly resented my derision. He endeavoured to take a whiff of his cigar, with the placidity which he associated with his profession, but the cigar, I think, was nearly bitten through.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The most {{frequent}} form of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) in dogs is represented histologically, by lymphoplasmacytic enteritis (LPE), a histological category, often associated with other morphologic alterations including lymphangiectasia (LE). However, literature data on this latter topic are quite scarce and have mostly been obtained in single reports or in small series. AIM: We evaluated some morphologic parameters of intestinal villi and <b>lacteals</b> in a large cohort of dogs, and correlated them with serum albumin and cholesterol values. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 136 dogs (94 with LPE, and 42 with gastrointestinal problems different from IBD) and analyzed their clinical, laboratory (albumin and cholesterol values), endoscopic, and histologic variables. RESULTS: The LPE group showed significantly impaired clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and histologic variables compared to controls. Affected dogs showed significant correlations between canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index (CIBDAI) scores and endoscopic and histologic variables. Moreover, the grade of hematologic changes were strongly related to the intestinal histologic variables, in particular those concerning villous and <b>lacteals</b> morphology. CONCLUSION: Dogs with LPE had intestinal histologic abnormalities (height, width, height/width ratio, calculated for both villi and <b>lacteals),</b> whose degree correlated with the severity of hypoalbuminemia and hypocholesterolemia. Evaluation of endoscopic and histologic variables in association to the clinical findings may reveal useful insights for the pathogenesis of LPE and, hopefully, might lead to more targeted therapeutic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Amyloid-β (Aβ) is {{secreted}} from lipogenic organs such as intestine {{and liver}} as an apolipoprotein of nascent triacylglycerol rich lipoproteins. Chronically elevated plasma Aβ may compromise cerebrovascular integrity and exacerbate amyloidosis—a hallmark feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Probucol is a hypocholesterolemic agent that reduces amyloid burden in transgenic amyloid mice, but the mechanisms for this effect are presently unclear. In this study, {{the effect of}} Probucol on intestinal lipoprotein-Aβ homeostasis was explored. Wild-type mice were fed a control low-fat diet and enterocytic Aβ was stimulated by high-fat (HF) diet enriched in 10 % (w/w) saturated fat and 1 % (w/w) cholesterol {{for the duration of}} 1 month. Mice treated with Probucol had the drug incorporated into the chow at 1 % (w/w). Quantitative immunofluorescence was utilised to determine intestinal apolipoprotein B (apo B) and Aβ abundance. We found apo B in both the perinuclear region of the enterocytes and the <b>lacteals</b> in all groups. However, HF feeding and Probucol treatment increased secretion of apo B into the <b>lacteals</b> without any change in net villi abundance. On the other hand, HF-induced enterocytic perinuclear Aβ was significantly attenuated by Probucol. No significant changes in Aβ were observed within the <b>lacteals.</b> The findings of this study support the notion that Probucol suppresses dietary fat induced stimulation of Aβ biosynthesis and attenuate availability of apo B lipoprotein-Aβ for secretion...|$|R
