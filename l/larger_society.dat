5|$|In 1960, {{while they}} were still dating, Achebe {{dedicated}} to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in the corruption of Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Aparts main character, Okonkwo. Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.|$|E
5|$|In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased {{operating}} the Sheerness dockyard and the Medway Port Authority {{took over the}} site for commercial use. The dockyard closure led to thousands of job losses, {{and most of the}} nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished. By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691. The dockyard closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society, as many of its members were dockyard workers. At the time, the society was the island's main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings of the <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> such as liberalism and conservatism, or {{focus on the}} environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} reasons for the history and {{continued}} prevalence of racial segregation in U.S. churches, including racism, denominational differences, and isolation. This segregation also has effects on individuals and the <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> including increased racism and segregation even outside of the church. However, segregated Black churches also have been a positive place for community organizing for civil rights and other issues, as well as offering a respite for Black individuals from the racism they face in integrated society.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the rise}} of gay {{cruising}} and gay nightclubs {{led to the formation}} of informal social networks of friends. Within these networks, information and rumours spread within the gay community about the sexuality of local television, sports and entertainment celebrities, university professors, children and relatives of politicians, and even the occasional Cabinet minister himself. This form of informal networking and 'knowledge' constituted the nascent beginnings of a gay community, which was beginning to acquire a sense of itself within the <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

40|$|According to Alexander’s [Alexander, R. D. (1987). The {{biology of}} moral systems. New York: Aldine de Gruyter] theory of morality, human social groups became {{large as a}} result of between-group {{competition}} over preferred habitats and resources, but although larger social groups are more successful in competition, they also experience more pressures to fission. Morality unites a society by limiting infringements upon the rights of other society members, so if <b>larger</b> <b>societies</b> are indeed more likely to split, then those that remain intact may be expected to have more effective inviolable moral rules, such as those imposed by moralizing gods. Cross-cultural analyses support this line of thought: more competition between societies is found in environments rich in resources and <b>larger</b> <b>societies</b> tend to occupy these environments; <b>large</b> <b>societies</b> engage in external conflicts at higher rates and are more often characterized by beliefs in moralizing gods.

25|$|In the West, a man often cannot {{acknowledge}} or display {{sexual attraction}} for another man without the homosexual or bisexual label being attached to him.

Self-verification processes are also adaptive for groups, groups of diverse backgrounds and the <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> in that they make people predictable to one another thus serve to facilitate social interaction.

Another concern was that the composition of the PCRH should be a fair representation of all the major religions in Singapore. It was pointed out that the diversity within religions such as Christianity made it difficult for fair representation and might lead to the exclusion of smaller and independent religious bodies.|$|E

His administration saw a sixfold increase in enrollment from 1911 to 1921, and witnessed Duquesne emerge to become the seventh-largest Catholic school in the country; this meteoric rise can be attributed largely to Hehir's pragmatism and commitment to serving the Catholic community in Pittsburgh {{during a time when}} immigrants struggled to assimilate into <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> Moreover, {{at the beginning of his}} presidency, Hehir took stock of the needs of the immigrant community in Pittsburgh and transformed the Pittsburgh Catholic College from a basically liberal arts school into an institution with a focus on more practical disciplines in legal and commercial fields.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Bedouin {{society was}} nomadic, pastoral, and {{agricultural}} based. Within this system, labor was divided along gender lines. Women were traditionally {{in charge of}} the agricultural activities, which included herding, grazing, fetching water, and raising crops, while men were in charge of guarding their land and receiving visitors. Bedouin culture, especially as it relates to gender norms, developed around this economic structure. In accordance with these traditional economic roles, women in Bedouin society did not interact with strangers, especially unfamiliar men. Bedouin men mediated most of the interactions their families have with the <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> As such, Bedouin culture became highly patriarchal. Within this traditional system, the men have held most of the power, but the vital economic roles of the women granted them significant degree of influence over the household decision-making.|$|E
25|$|Further studies {{reveal that}} the {{identification}} of second-generation immigrants, of Caribbean heritage, as African Americans leads these children to be more aware of racial discrimination in the U.S. In addition, the assimilation into black society and black culture in the U.S. by these children is hindered by their parents' oppositional stance to American black culture, contributing to identity conflict. In the case of Haitians, first generation Haitians hold on strongly to their foreign identity, as they associate the preservation of their culture with stronger solidarity in the community. These first generation Haitians attempt to instill this same Haitian pride in their children as they want the children to succeed {{on the basis of}} ethnic solidarity and the preservation of Haitian culture, and not by giving in to American culture. This creates a clash between the ideas and values these children learn at home, and from their peers and the non-Haitian black community. Thus, these children face conflicting pressures from family, non-second generation immigrant peers, and discrimination by the <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

[...] Indians were to stay on reservations where they would receive government subsidies and training supervised by religious denominations. Indians were no longer allowed to engage in raids or send war parties off the reservations; the Army's job was to force them back. The goal was to assimilate the Indians into American society; any Indian could leave the reservation {{at any time and}} join the <b>larger</b> <b>society,</b> and have full citizenship. The Indians on reservations were made U.S. citizens in 1924.|$|E
500|$|Historian LeeH. Cheek, Jr., {{distinguishes between}} two strands of American republicanism: the puritan {{tradition}}, based in New England, and the agrarian or South Atlantic tradition, which Cheek argues was espoused by Calhoun. While the New England tradition stressed a politically centralized enforcement {{of moral and}} religious norms to secure civic virtue, the South Atlantic tradition relied on a decentralized moral and religious order {{based on the idea}} of subsidiarity (or localism). Cheek maintains that the [...] "Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions" [...] (1798), written by Jefferson and Madison, were the cornerstone of Calhoun's republicanism. Calhoun emphasized the primacy of subsidiarity——holding that popular rule is best expressed in local communities that are nearly autonomous while serving as units of a <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
500|$|Since their movement's {{emergence}} {{early in}} the 20th century, Pentecostals saw themselves as [...] "peculiar people", {{and one of the}} components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior. Prohibitions on drug use, gambling, social dancing, consuming alcohol, smoking, attending theaters, bowling, swimming in public pools and beaches, owning television sets, and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish Pentecostals from the <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> Starting in the 1950s, attitudes in the Assemblies of God on many of these activities underwent dramatic change. The most change probably occurred over views on women's attire, with the former stance against wearing make-up and jewelry giving way to the acceptance of popular fashion. Most of these [...] "holiness standards" [...] are no longer adhered to; however, some are still held to, such as proscriptions on smoking, alcohol and drug use.|$|E

500|$|Durkheim {{also argued}} that our primary {{categories}} for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, {{that gave rise to}} most if not all other social constructs, including the <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, [...] "Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.|$|E
500|$|The {{last two}} {{chapters}} feature Peshkin's {{commentary on the}} school in society, its tradeoffs and comparison with other total institutions and larger social movements, like the New Religious Right. He also compares the academy to public and parochial schools, wherein he finds public school students more politically tolerant and acceptant of religious pluralism. Peshkin's final reflections are written as a [...] "cost-benefit analysis" [...] of these Christian schools in the larger American society. In the last chapter, Peshkin contemplates how his Jewish identity is insulated within a pluralistic and secular society, and how he is fearful of absolutist [...] "imperious, implacable logic" [...] and [...] "zeal for conversion and exclusivism". He recounted that while the school spoke derogatorily of non-fundamentalists and non-Christians, no one spoke of the American religious plurality that permitted this. In response to the encroaching state, fundamentalists feel that their political conviction should mirror that of their religion. Peshkin views the school as schismatic in a <b>larger</b> <b>society</b> for promoting intolerance towards fellow Americans. He also praised traits of the schools including its community, dedicated teachers, and attractive image. At the time of print, Christian schools like Bethany were outpacing the growth of other schools. In 1989, Christian schools comprised about 20% of private school enrollment—around 700,000 students.|$|E
500|$|On 11 June 1932, de Mena married Percy Aiken, a Jamaican {{contractor}} and activist, {{who would become}} {{an officer in the}} island's Bahá'í Faith. Garvey tried to bring the UNIA back to its former status from Jamaica, continuing to write articles for the Negro World and developing two other short-lived papers, The Blackman and The New Jamaican, but all had folded by 1933. In 1934, now adopting her new husband's surname and styled as [...] "Madame Aiken" [...] she began a newspaper using the presses of the Negro World called the World Echo. While the paper ostensibly was to be another organ for UNIA, many of the articles were devoted to Father Divine's Peace Mission. Aiken used the paper to call for anti-lynching legislation and championed African-American civil rights, including liberation in [...] "spiritual, economic, political and industrial emancipation". Father Divine's movement was in direct opposition to Garvey's, in that Garvey pressed for racial consciousness and purity, while Divine argued that race was unimportant and that blacks had to integrate into the <b>larger</b> <b>society.</b> The opposing voices of these two movements were difficult for Aiken {{and other members of the}} diaspora to reconcile. She finally closed both the newspaper and UNIA's offices in New York, moving to Jamaica in 1935. Though she continued some involvement with UNIA through the 1950s, the organization was in decline. Garvey's financial problems resulted in the foreclosure of his home, and by 1935, he permanently relocated to London. Around the same time, Aiken withdrew her support from Father Divine and restyled the World Echo into the Ethiopian World. Though many deserted Garvey, Aiken maintained a good relationship with him until his death.|$|E
