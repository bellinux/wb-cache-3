5|$|The {{northern}} part of the city has a rich tropical evergreen forest with commercially significant trees such as teak, sandalwood, rosewood and bamboo. The soil is predominantly black, which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some red <b>loamy</b> <b>soil</b> is also found. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, Coimbatore falls under the Class III/IV Seismic Zone, having experienced an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale on February 8, 1900.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} {{on a bed}} of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and <b>loamy</b> <b>soil,</b> inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line the bed of the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E

5|$|Nathu La has {{moderately}} shallow, excessively drained, coarse, and <b>loamy</b> <b>soil</b> on a {{steep slope}} (30–50%) with gravelly loamy surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness. It has several sinking zones and parts of it are prone to landslides. To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the government of India regulates the flow of tourists. Road maintenance is entrusted to Border Roads Organisation, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or <b>loamy</b> <b>soil,</b> or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
25|$|The fenlands, {{that stretch}} down {{as far as}} Norfolk, are former {{wetlands}} consisting both of peat bogs and tidal silt marshes which were virtually all drained {{by the end of}} the 19th century when Firsby had its longest period of growth. The former peat fens and silt marshes provided a rich <b>loamy</b> <b>soil</b> that was ideal for the growing of cereal and vegetable crops, and gave Lincolnshire its reputation as being the 'bread basket' of England. The resulting flat lands also made an ideal environment for the later mechanisation of farming in the mid-20th century. Firsby has always been an agriculturally based village with a dark and rich <b>loamy</b> <b>soil</b> over a heavy clay subsoil.|$|E

25|$|The {{species is}} little known in cultivation. It germinates well, but is {{difficult}} to establish and slow to grow. It has been grown successfully in <b>loamy</b> <b>soil</b> in northern Victoria, but attempts to grow it in the sandy soils of Perth have failed. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni suggest that as a compact shrub with attractive foliage {{it would be best}} suited to a small garden. It requires warm, dry weather with near full sun, and heavy well drained soils. It is hardy to drought and frost.|$|E
25|$|Warren has a hilly topography, {{caused by}} two factors: the {{underlying}} geology, {{which consists of}} infolded metamorphic rock of the Leeuwin Complex and Archaean granite of the Albany-Fraser Orogen; and the dissection of rivers such as the Blackwood, Warren, Shannon and Frankland. The western extent of the region takes in the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge, an 80 kilometre (50mi) long strip of coastal limestone {{on top of a}} ridge of granite, with an extensive cave system. There are a number of soil types, including hard setting <b>loamy</b> <b>soil,</b> lateritic soil, leached sandy soil and Holocene marine dunes.|$|E

25|$|See {{the image}} for the {{biological}} {{life cycle of}} the hookworm where it thrives in warm earth where temperatures are over 18°C. They exist primarily in sandy or <b>loamy</b> <b>soil</b> and cannot live in clay or muck. Rainfall averages must be more than 1000mm (40inches) a year for them to survive. Only if these conditions exist can the eggs hatch. Infective larvae of Necator americanus can survive at higher temperatures, whereas those of Ancylostoma duodenale are better adapted to cooler climates. Generally, they live {{for only a few}} weeks at most under natural conditions, and die almost immediately on exposure to direct sunlight or desiccation.|$|E
25|$|In May, June or July, females {{normally}} lay {{a clutch}} of 1 to 11 eggs into a flask-shaped nest excavated {{in a patch of}} sandy or <b>loamy</b> <b>soil.</b> After 70 to 80 days of incubation, the eggs hatch, and the small hatchlings emerge from the nest in late summer. In the northern parts of its range, the common box turtle may enter hibernation in October or November. They burrow into loose soil, sand, vegetable matter, or mud at the bottom of streams and pools, or they may use a mammal burrow, and will remain in their chosen shelter until the cold winter has passed. The Common box turtle has been known to attain the greatest lifespan of any vertebrate outside of the tortoises. One specimen lived to be at least 138 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Cilicia Pedias ("flat Cilicia"—; Assyrian Kue), to the east, {{included}} the rugged spurs of Taurus {{and a large}} coastal plain, with rich <b>loamy</b> <b>soil,</b> known to the Greeks such as Xenophon, who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand, for its abundance (euthemia), filled with sesame and millet and olives and pasturage for the horses imported by Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified. The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus Çay), the Sarus (Seyhan) and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, {{and that the united}} rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of Tarsus (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, Adana (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1000 B.C. the Celts {{arrived in}} this area and settled. [...] The name “Dachau” {{originated}} in the Celtic Dahauua, which roughly translates to “loamy meadow” and also alludes to the <b>loamy</b> <b>soil</b> of the surrounding hills.

2500|$|Most of {{the parish}} has free {{draining}} slightly acid <b>loamy</b> <b>soil.</b> [...] Soil of the area that forms {{the top of the}} Betchworth Hills is [...] "free draining, slightly acid but base-rich soil" [...] rather than [...] "shallow, lime-rich soil over chalk or limestone" [...] which dominates the middle of Box Hill. This is the natural spur to the trees that line the top as it produces extremely fertile pastures and deciduous woodland. Surrey Wildlife Trust manages the rare flower meadows beneath the old quarry.|$|E
2500|$|The moringa tree {{is grown}} mainly in semiarid, tropical, and {{subtropical}} areas, corresponding in the United States to USDA hardiness zones 9 and 10. It tolerates {{a wide range}} of soil conditions, but prefers a neutral to slightly acidic (pH 6.3 to 7.0), well-drained sandy or <b>loamy</b> <b>soil.</b> In waterlogged soil, the roots have a tendency to rot. [...] Moringa is a sun- and heat-loving plant, thus does not tolerate freezing or frost. Moringa is particularly suitable for dry regions, as it can be grown using rainwater without expensive irrigation techniques.|$|E
2500|$|The Carlson Annis Shell Mound sits on {{the eastern}} side of the Green River, {{somewhat}} more than [...] east of the shoreline. [...] Because it lies in the river's floodplain, the mound is the highest point in the area; its top is typically dry even though the surrounding terrain be flooded. [...] It occupies a dark <b>loamy</b> <b>soil,</b> although the edges of the mound are covered by a substantially lighter loam with mixtures of sand and clay. [...] Since the mound was formed, the river has changed its course; it appears to have flowed directly by the base of the mound as it was being created. [...] When the area was first settled in the early nineteenth century, the floodplain was recognized as valuable farmland, and because the mound is an island during floods, settlers saw it as a place of refuge; for most of the time since whites arrived, farmsteads have occupied its summit.|$|E
