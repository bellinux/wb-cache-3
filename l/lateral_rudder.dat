6000|$|Dec. 24th.-Fine, {{and little}} wind. No land in sight {{for the first}} time since we left Macassar. At noon calm, with heavy showers, in which our crew wash their clothes, anti in the {{afternoon}} the prau is covered with shirts, trousers, and sarongs of various gay colours. I made a discovery to-day which at first rather alarmed me. The two ports, or openings, through which the tillers enter from the <b>lateral</b> <b>rudders</b> are not more than three or four feet above the surface of the water, which thus has a free entrance into the vessel. I of course had imagined that this open space from one side to the other was separated from the hold by a water-tight bulkhead, so that a sea entering might wash out at the further side, and do no more harm than give the steersmen a drenching. To my surprise end dismay, however, I find that it is completely open to the hold, so that half-a-dozen seas rolling in on a stormy night would nearly, or quite, swamp us. Think of a vessel going to sea for a month with two holes, each a yard square, into the hold, at three feet above the water-line,-holes, too, which cannot possibly be closed! But our captain says all praus are so; and though he acknowledges the danger, [...] "he does not know how to alter it--the people are used to it; he does not understand praus so well as they do, and if such a great alteration were made, he should be sure to have difficulty in getting a crew!" [...] This proves at all events that praus must be good sea-boats, for the captain has been continually making voyages in them for the last ten years, and says he has never known water enough enter to do any harm.|$|R
5000|$|Certification {{flight testing}} {{continued}} though {{the summer and}} autumn of 2011 with fixes for problems with adverse yaw, <b>lateral</b> stability, ineffective <b>rudder</b> trim at low power settings, pitch damping, roll/yaw damping, high rotation forces on takeoff and the stall prevention system. The aircraft had still not conducted water trials. Of the certification process the Flight Analyst Designated Airworthiness Representative, John Taylor, said [...] "It should be recognized that the Seawind has a very unconventional configuration and as a consequence, has at times been a very challenging configuration to make compliant with FAR Part 23 certification requirements." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{that time}} {{reconnaissance}} or scouting {{was seen as}} the only military purpose of aircraft. The R.E.1, completed in July 1913, was described in contemporary reports as intended for the same purposes as the B.E.2, using the same engine but being an aircraft of more modern refinement. It was a single bay biplane with equal span, constant chord wings, unswept but with stagger. Wing warping was use for <b>lateral</b> control. The <b>rudder</b> was {{similar to that of the}} B.E.2, curved and extending below the fuselage, but a triangular fin was fitted that reached forward to the strongly swept leading edge of the B.E.2 style tailplane.|$|R
5000|$|The Seawind 300C is {{intended}} to be the certified production version and is derived from the kit-built Seawind 3000. It incorporates many changes required to conform to the certification standards. The company indicated that certification flight testing would continue after the crash of the prototype on August 16, 2007, but did not actually resume until early 2010. Certification flight testing continued though the summer and autumn of 2011 with fixes introduced for problems with adverse yaw, <b>lateral</b> stability, ineffective <b>rudder</b> trim at low power settings, pitch damping, roll/yaw damping, high rotation forces on takeoff and the stall prevention system. [...] As of mid-2014 certification was not yet complete.|$|R
50|$|For a sailboat, {{point of}} sail affects lateral force significantly. The higher the boat {{points to the}} wind under sail, the {{stronger}} the lateral force, which requires resistance from a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and <b>rudder.</b> <b>Lateral</b> force also induces heeling in a sailboat, which requires resistance by weight of ballast from the crew or the boat itself and by {{the shape of the}} boat, especially with a catamaran. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become less important. On ice boats, lateral forces are countered by the lateral resistance of the blades on ice and their distance apart, which generally prevents heeling.|$|R
40|$|Response of airship {{owing to}} {{deflection}} angle of elevator, rudder and vectored thrust during trimmed equilibrium flight can be computed by solving the airship {{equations of motion}}. In this study, the linearised decoupled airship equations of motion were used and the solution was computed {{with the aid of}} Matlab software. This paper shows a case study done by applying the physical data of a designed airship called ‘UTHM’s Airship’ in the equations of motion and solved it in order to understand and analyze the response of the designed airship. For ‘UTHM’s Airship’, the longitudinal response of elevator and thrust vectorization has relatively low longitudinal control power and a rather sluggish response characteristic. Meanwhile the <b>lateral</b> response of <b>rudder</b> demonstrates a relatively high rudder control power and quicker lateral response compared to longitudinal response. The results had successfully given an initial insight of the ‘UTHM’s Airship’ response and dynamic stability...|$|R
50|$|The 707-420 was {{identical}} to the −320, but fitted with Rolls-Royce Conway 508 (RCo.12) turbofans (or by-pass turbojets as Rolls-Royce called them) of 18,000 lb (79 kN) thrust each. The first announced customer was Lufthansa. BOAC's controversial order was announced six months later, but the British carrier got the first service-ready aircraft off the production line. The British Air Registration Board refused to give the aircraft a certificate of airworthiness, citing insufficient <b>lateral</b> control, excessive <b>rudder</b> forces, {{and the ability to}} over-rotate on takeoff, stalling the wing on the ground (a fault of the de Havilland Comet 1). Boeing responded by adding 40 inches to the vertical stabilizer, applying full instead of partial rudder boost, and fitting an underfin to prevent over-rotation. These modifications except to the fin under the tail became standard on all 707 variants and were retrofitted to all earlier 707s. The 37 -420s were delivered to BOAC, Lufthansa, Air-India, El Al, and Varig through November 1963; Lufthansa was the first to carry passengers, in March 1960.|$|R
40|$|A general {{overview}} and summary of {{recent advances in}} experiment design for high performance aircraft is presented, along with results from flight tests. General theoretical background is included, with some discussion of various approaches to maneuver design. Flight test examples from the F- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) are used to illustrate applications of the theory. Input forms are compared using Cramér-Rao bounds for the standard errors of estimated model parameters. Directions for future research in experiment design for high performance aircraft are identified.

40|$|Small size {{airships}} {{are traditionally}} {{designed and built}} based on experience rather than scientific approaches. Hence, its design approach has only been discussed in a very limited number of literatures. Thus, with these challenges at hand, a conceptual design study of airship in Malaysia was done to identify and explore the basic technology of airship design. This study focused on the conceptual design, determination of basic specifications and preliminary design of small size non-rigid airship for monitoring missions in Malaysia. The preliminary design focused on static stability, dynamic stability and development of a virtual simulator. The mathematical model of the designed airship for dynamic stability was rederived based on literatures and is then programmed to Graphical User Interface (GUI) {{with the aid of}} Matlab software. The airship was designed to fulfill the design specification suitable for monitoring with maximum speed of 40 km/h, cruising speed of 20 km/h, operating altitude of 120 m and able to carry payload of at least of 6 kg. The dimension of 10 m length with maximum diameter of 2. 3 m was chosen with a pair of 0. 25 hp engines to accomplish the desired specification. The designed airship was statically stable with trimmed angle of attack of approximately 0. 18 degree. Through mathematical model of airship dynamics, following a detailed procedure including stability considerations, the airship had been analyzed and found to be dynamically stable with low control power and the time taken for the longitudinal response of elevator and vectored thrust to become stable was in the order of approximately 80 seconds while the <b>lateral</b> response of <b>rudder</b> becomes stable in approximately 30 seconds. The result of this study concluded that the designed airship fulfilled the design specification for monitoring mission and the designed airship was statically and dynamically stable during cruising speed. The virtual simulator also effectively provides {{a better understanding of the}} response of the designed airship through visualization...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a ship subject to kinematic, dynamic, and moment equations and steered via the rudder under the assumptions that the rudder angle and rudder angle time rate {{are subject to}} upper and lower bounds. We formulate and solve four Mayer problems of optimal control, the optimization criterion being the minimum time. Also, we formulate and solve four Chebyshev problems of optimal control, the optimization criterion being the maximization {{with respect to the}} control history of the minimum value with respect to time of the distance between two identical ships, one maneuvering and one moving in a predetermined way. Problems P 1 and P 2 deal with course change maneuvers. In Problem P 1, a ship initially in quasi-steady state must reach the final point with a given yaw angle and zero yaw angle time rate. Problem P 2 differs from Problem P 1 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. Problems P 3 and P 4 deal with sidestep maneuvers. In Problem P 3, a ship initially in quasi-steady state must reach the final point with a given lateral distance, zero yaw angle, and zero yaw angle time rate. Problem P 4 differs from Problem P 3 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. Problems P 5 and P 6 deal with collision avoidance maneuvers without cooperation, while Problems P 7 and P 8 deal with collision avoidance maneuvers with cooperation. In Problems P 5 and P 7, the maneuvering ship must reach the final point with a given lateral distance, zero yaw angle, and zero yaw angle time rate. Problems P 6 and P 8 differ from Problems P 5 and P 7 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. The above Mayer problems and Chebyshev problems, transformed into Lagrange problems via suitable transformations, are solved via the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm in conjunction with a new singularity avoiding transformation which accounts for the bounds on rudder angle and rudder angle time rate. The optimal control histories involve multiple subarcs along which either the rudder angle is kept at one of the extreme positions or the rudder angle time rate is held at one of the two extreme values. If quasi-steady state is not required at the final point, the total number of subarcs ranges from 4 to 8, depending on the particular problem. If quasi-steady state is required at the final point, the total number of subarcs ranges from 6 to 10, depending on the particular problem: the higher number of subarcs, is due to the additional requirements that the <b>lateral</b> velocity and <b>rudder</b> angle vanish at the final point...|$|R
