5000|$|Genus Paragallinula Sangster, García-R & Trewick 2015 (<b>Lesser</b> <b>Moorhen)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>moorhen</b> (Paragallinula angulata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Rallidae. It is {{sometimes}} placed into the genus Gallinula. It is the only species in the genus Paragallinula.|$|E
5000|$|Moorhens — {{sometimes}} called marsh hens — are medium-sized water birds that {{are members of}} the rail family, (Rallidae). Most species are placed in the genus Gallinula, Latin for [...] "little hen". They are close relatives of coots, and because of their apparently nervous behavior (frequently twitching tail, neck and grinding their backs) are {{sometimes called}} [...] "skitty coots". They are often referred to as (black) gallinules. Recently, one of the species of Gallinula was found to have enough differences to form a new genus Paragallinula with the only species being the <b>Lesser</b> <b>moorhen</b> (Paragallinula angulata).|$|E
50|$|The park is a mainly {{grassland}} {{area with a}} small wood, hedgerows and two play areas. Deans Brook, which crosses the park, has been dammed to create an ornamental lake. The lake has a fringe of vegetation dominated by great and <b>lesser</b> reedmace. Coots, <b>moorhens</b> and mallards breed on the lake, and it also supports amphibians and dragonflies.|$|R
40|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{has demonstrated that}} the genus Gallinula is not monophyletic and comprises four major lineages. A review of the nomenclature of Gallinula shows that generic names are available for three lineages but that a fourth is as yet unnamed. A new monotypic genus, Paragallinula gen. nov., is described for <b>Lesser</b> <b>Moorhen</b> (Gallinula angulata Sundevall, 1850) ...|$|E
