Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the growing}} revenues, the company {{struggled}} to make a profit. Heavy expenditures—primarily marketing along with research and development costs—drove the firm's <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> $500,000 from 1989 to $1.5 million {{by the end of}} the following fiscal year. For fiscal 1991 it posted a net loss of $1.7 million.|$|E
5000|$|Any hot object {{ultimately}} {{returns to}} thermal equilibrium with its environment, due to heat <b>loss</b> <b>from</b> conduction, convection and radiation.

Convection and radiation are the most important sources of heat loss. Thermal insulation is used to slow heat <b>loss</b> <b>from</b> a hot object.

5|$|After {{ten years}} the Super 12 was {{expanded}} to include two extra teams; the Western Force from Australia, and the Cheetahs from South Africa. The expanded competition was renamed the Super 14. The Highlanders continued under Cooper in 2006. After losing their first match of 2006 to the Crusaders, they then won their next three. After only won two of their last six games, they finished the season ranked ninth. The 2007 ended with a similar result to 2006. The Highlanders again finished ninth on the table, and worst of the New Zealand teams. They finished the season with five wins and eight <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> their thirteen matches.|$|E

5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E

Despite suffering heavy <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving Hornet dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.|$|E

UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
