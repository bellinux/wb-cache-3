An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the {{many different types of}} insurance that exist.

For example, vehicle insurance would typically cover both the property risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the <b>liability</b> <b>risk</b> (legal claims arising from an accident). A home insurance policy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.|$|E

The risks have important influences on project quality, safety production and supervision profession development. The research results provide valuable information not only to government departments, professional associations, Chinese supervision engineers and supervision firms, but also to the foreign companies that offer services in China. The quantitative research method can be employed for other questionnaire surveys such as construction project quality and safety accidents. <b>Liability</b> <b>risks,</b> risk management, supervision, supervision engineer,...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{discussions of}} the {{relationship}} between negligence liability and the provision of services by both public and private organisations frequently advert to the emergence of a ‘compensation culture’. Despite empirical evidence that compensation culture claims are somewhat inflated, an anxiety persists that <b>risks</b> of tortious <b>liability</b> may still undermine the implementation of public policy. Concerns about the potential negative effects of liability on public administration frame the problem in various ways: first, there is an anxiety that public authorities may over-react to <b>liability</b> <b>risks</b> by becoming excessively risk averse. Second, there is a fear that compensation claiming will divert financial resources away from service delivery and towards the payment of insurance premiums and compensation awards. Third, there is the fear that insurance companies will, as ‘risk bullies’, curtail public service activities. And, finally, there is the suggestion that risk management, including legal risk management, is becoming the dominant mode of government decision-making to the exclusion of professional judgement. This article addresses these concerns through a set of empirical case studies about the management of <b>liability</b> <b>risks</b> associated with road maintenance services. Although our findings suggest that public authorities respond to <b>liability</b> <b>risks</b> in a variety of ways, we found only limited evidence of the above concerns. In general terms, {{it was a case of}} public authorities being risk aware and responsive as opposed to risk averse...|$|R

Moreover, he pointed out that if these countries should exit the Eurozone and declare insolvency, Germany's <b>liability</b> <b>risk</b> would amount to 33% of that sum, or 114 billion euros, relating these sums to the other rescue facilities of euro countries and the International Monetary Fund. Before he made them public, Target deficits or surpluses were not explicitly itemised, being usually buried in obscure positions of central bank balance sheets.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{development}} of the New Right Agenda, Conservative Governments in Britain introduced incrementally an extensive privatization programme. This paper focuses on the failure of the last privatization of the Conservatives: British Energy, the company established to run the eight most modern nuclear power stations. A key argument used to justify the privatization of British Energy, the transfer of risk from the state to the private sector, is analyzed using the conceptual framework of the risk society thesis. The privatization led to the apparent transfer to the company of interrelated risks, particularly the nuclear <b>liabilities</b> <b>risk.</b> New Labor's rescue of British Engergy confirmed the reality, which was that residual responsibility for risk, especially the nuclear <b>liabilities</b> <b>risk,</b> remained with government. Despite the company's collapse the Labor Government sought a market-based outcome, and in 2008 British Energy was sold to EDF, the French state-owned energy company. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the failure of risk transfer for public policy, drawing on insights provided by the risk society thesis...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{dramatic}} {{increases in}} prices for medical liability insurance, {{directors and officers}} insurance, and other lines of commercial liability insurance, together with the exit of some insurers from those lines of business, has placed liability insurance on the public agenda. At the same time, asbestos and environmental losses continue to mount under general liability insurance policies sold long ago, when {{no one could have}} predicted the extent or cost of such losses. In combination, these and other related events have raised serious concerns about the insurability of <b>liability</b> <b>risks</b> and have prompted calls for dramatic efforts to roll back the advance of liability law in the U. S. and Europe. With this ‘‘crisis’’ as the background, this essay represents a preliminary effort to explore insurance for <b>liability</b> <b>risks,</b> with the goal of articulating a framework that will guide more systematic and empirical study. In the main part of this essay I describe a new conceptual framework for analysing <b>liability</b> insurance <b>risks.</b> The framework helps explain why predicting losses can be so difficult in the liability insurance context and why cycles in insurance pricing are more extreme in liability insurance than in other lines of insurance. Much of this difficulty is already understood to follow from the ‘‘long tail’’ or ‘‘duration of liability’’ problem in liability insurance. The primary contribution of the new framework is breaking apart what I will call ‘‘liability developments risk’’ for separate analysis, facilitating a better understanding of when and why the duration of liability matters. In concluding, I use a brief analysis of medical liability insurance to offer some observations on insurability and to sound the call for systematic empirical research aimed at improving how liability insurance institutions manage <b>liability</b> developments <b>risk...</b>|$|R
