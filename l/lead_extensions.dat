40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{movement}} self-selected by 39 subjects to lift light loads from 9 cm {{above the ground}} is described in kinematic and electromyographic terms. Hamstring length changes were estimated from hip and knee angular kinematics. Subjects adopted a posture {{at the start of}} the lift intermediate between stoop and full-squat postures. A consistent coordination between knee, hip, and lumbar vertebral joints during lifting was described through calculation of the relative phase between adjacent joints and found to be exaggerated with increases in load mass. During the early phase of lifting, knee <b>extension</b> <b>leads</b> hip <b>extension,</b> which in turn <b>leads</b> <b>extension</b> of the lumbar vertebral joints. Early in the lifting movement, when load acceleration is greatest, the erectores spinae are thus relatively long and shortening slowly. Both of these factors produce greater back extensor strength. Rapid hamstring shortening is also delayed, which enhances their strength, and coactivation of the monoarticular knee extensors and biarticular hamstrings observed early in the lifting movement suggested that the knee extensors contribute to hip extension through a tendinous action of the hamstrings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} and develope {{a unifying}} multifractal framework. The framework developed {{in this paper}} {{is based on the}} notion of deformations of empirical measures. This approach <b>leads</b> to significant <b>extensions</b> of already know results. However, our approach not only <b>leads</b> to <b>extensions</b> of already know results, but also, by considering non-linear deformations, provides the basis for the study of several new and non-linear local characteristic. We also initiate a detailed study of the fractal structure of so-called divergence points. We define multifractal spectra that provides extremely precise quantitative information about the distribution of individual divergence points of arbitrary (possibly non-linear) deformations, thereby extending and unifying many diverse qualitative results on the behaviour of divergence points. The techniques used in proving the main results are taken from large deviation theory and are completely different from previous techniques in the literature...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECT: The aim of {{this study}} was to study the effects of MR imaging on the {{electrical}} settings of deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems and their clinical consequences. METHODS: The authors studied the effects of 1. 5 -T MR imaging on the electrical settings of implanted DBS systems, including 1 or more monopolar or quadripolar <b>leads,</b> <b>extension</b> <b>leads,</b> and single- or dual-channel implantable pulse generators (IPGs). The IPG was switched off during the procedure and the voltage was set to 0. The impedances were checked before and after MR imaging. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy patients were treated with DBS for movement disorders and underwent brain MR imaging after lead implantation and before IPG implantation. None of the patients experienced any adverse events. Thirty-one of these patients underwent 61 additional MR imaging sessions after the entire DBS system had been implanted. The authors report neither local cutaneous nor neurological disorders during or after the MR imaging session. No change in the IPG settings occurred when the magnet reed switch function remained disabled during the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that 1. 5 -T MR imaging can be performed safely with continuous monitoring in patients with a DBS system. The ability to disable the magnet reed switch function of the IPG prevents any change in the electrical settings and thus any side effects. The increasing number of DBS indications and the widespread use of MR imaging indicates the need for defining safety guidelines for the use of MR imaging in patients with implanted neurostimulators...|$|R
