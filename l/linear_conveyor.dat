40|$|A high-precision planar digital {{electromagnetic}} actuator with two displacement directions and four discrete positions {{is presented in}} this paper. The four discrete positions are located at each corner of a square cavity where a mobile permanent magnet moves thanks to Lorentz forces generated when a driving current passes through two orthogonal wires placed below the cavity. Four fixed permanent magnets are placed around the cavity {{in order to ensure}} high-precision magnetic holding of the mobile magnet at each discrete position. An analytical model of the actuator is presented and used to characterize its properties (switching time, energy consumption, and displaceable mass). Based on this model, an experimental prototype has been developed and then characterized. Comparisons between experimental and simulated results are carried out and show good agreement. The positioning repeatability errors have also been characterized according to the input signal in order to qualify the digital behavior of this high-precision actuator. Finally, an application of this digital actuator as a <b>linear</b> <b>conveyor</b> is presented and experimentally tested...|$|E
40|$|To {{answer the}} growing needs for super-clean or contact free {{actuators}} for uses in clean rooms, vacuum chambers, and space, innovative actuators which combine {{the functions of}} stepping motors and magnetic bearings in one body were developed. The rotor of the magnetically suspended stepping motor is suspended like a magnetic bearing and rotated and positioned like a stepping motor. The important trait of the motor {{is that it is}} not a simple mixture or combination of a stepping motor and conventional magnetic bearing, but an amalgam of a stepping motor and a magnetic bearing. Owing to optimal design and feed-back control, a toothed stator and rotor are all that are needed structurewise for stable suspension. More than ten types of motors such as linear type, high accuracy rotary type, two-dimensional type, and high vacuum type were built and tested. This paper describes the structure and design of these motors and their performance for such applications as precise positioning rotary table, <b>linear</b> <b>conveyor</b> system, and theta-zeta positioner for clean room and high vacuum use...|$|E
40|$|Vibratory feeders or {{vibratory}} conveyors {{have been}} widely used for the transport and orientation of individual parts and bulk materials in many branches of industrial activity. From the designer’s standpoint, the current endeavor is to conceive efficient vibratory feeders, satisfying constraints of power consumption, vibration transmission and noise emission. Moreover, the interest in the reduction of maintenance cost is always present. In this context, this paper investigates experimentally the concept of vibratory conveying based on the use of piezoelectric materials for motion generation. A small-size prototype of a <b>linear</b> <b>conveyor,</b> in which lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) patches are bonded to the resilient elements, is described. One of the main design goals is that the prototype is intended to be fed directly from the electric network, aiming at avoiding the use of electronic equipment for driving. To comply with this feature and, at the same time, enable to adjust the transport velocity, a mechanical device has been conceived {{in such a way that}} the first natural frequency of the conveyor can be changed. It is shown that the transport velocity is determined by the proximity between the excitation frequency and the first natural frequency of the conveyor. The experimental tests performed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the prototype are described and the range of transport velocities is determined...|$|E
