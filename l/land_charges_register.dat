The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high <b>landing</b> <b>charges.</b> However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand.
