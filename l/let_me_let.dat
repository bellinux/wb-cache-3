[...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan.

6000|$|After {{the scene}} with little Frank, in which that {{refractory}} son and heir {{of the house of}} Clavering had received the compliments in French and English, and the accompanying box on the ear from his sister, Miss Laura who had plenty of humour, could not help calling to mind some very touching and tender verses which the Muse had read to her out of Mes Larmes, and which began, [...] "My pretty baby brother, may angels guard thy rest," [...] in which the Muse, after complimenting the baby upon the station in life which it was about to occupy, and contrasting it with her own lonely condition, vowed nevertheless that the angel boy would never enjoy such affection as hers was, or find in the false world before him anything so constant and tender as a sister's heart. [...] "It may be," [...] the forlorn one said, [...] "it may be, you will slight it, my pretty baby sweet, You will spurn me from your bosom, I'll cling around your feet! O <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> <b>let</b> me, love you! the world will prove to you As false as 'tis to others, but I am ever true." [...] And behold the Muse was boxing the darling brother's ears instead of kneeling at his feet, and giving Miss Laura her first lesson in the Cynical philosophy--not quite her first, however,--something like this selfishness and waywardness, something like this contrast between practice and poetry, between grand versified aspirations and everyday life, she had witnessed at home in the person of our young friend Mr. Pen.|$|E

5000|$|The lyrics concern a {{smuggler}} planning {{his next}} clandestine journey, Bush {{takes on the}} role of his lover, who begs him not to go ("I won't let you do it. If you go, I'll let the law know"). The song ends with the smuggler speaking in defiance ("Would you break even my wings, like a swallow. <b>Let</b> <b>me,</b> <b>let</b> me go"). Bush herself has commented on the lyrics, saying: [...] "In this song she wants to control him and because he wants to do something that she doesn't want him to she feels that he is going away. It's almost on a parallel with the mother and son relationship where there is the same female feeling of not wanting the young child {{to move away from the}} nest. Of course, from the guy's point of view, because she doesn't want him to go, the urge to go is even stronger. For him, it's not so much a job as a challenge; a chance to do something risky and exciting." [...] The song's release in Ireland only is most likely due to the Irish nature of the song, featuring instrumental accompaniment by Irish musicians. These include members of Planxty and The Chieftains: Bill Whelan on Bagpipes and String arrangement, Liam O'Flynn on Uillean pipes and Penny whistle, Seán Keane on Fiddle and Dónal Lunny on Bouzouki. Whelan is credited as writing the string parts for the song, although this was in close association with Bush herself. [...] Bush was to explore Irish themes in later works also, such as [...] "Jig of Life" [...] from Hounds of Love (1985) and the single [...] "Rocket Man" [...] (1991). Bush's mother was Irish and so Kate had listened to traditional Irish music from a young age and was eager to explore this style. Her brother Jay also influenced her due to his appreciation of the group Planxty.|$|E
