5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|Inmates {{are allowed}} to receive their families, partners, or friends privately twice a week for two hours. Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, towels, and condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room with toys and baby-changing facilities is available. Inmates are checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay with them for 24 hours. The house has a small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> a dining table, a sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area with toys. Foreigners are not allowed and inmates have to complete a child-development education program to have 24-hour-long visits.

25|$|In 1446, Archduke Sigismund (1427–1496) became {{ruler of}} Tyrol and reigned {{during a time}} of {{prosperity}} from mining operations in Tyrol. Sigismund expanded the Hofburg area through the acquisition of several houses on Hofgasse and various garden properties near the present-day cathedral. That year, construction of the Hofburg began with the foundations of the main building along the old trench (the southern section of the east wing along Rennweg) and a portion of the south wing (along Hofgasse). Rooms and a chapel in the east wing were completed, and according to tradition, a banquet was held in 1463 in a heated hall. A chancellery was built in the south wing (along Hofgasse). In the Rumer Gate, Sigismund added a room with large windows and a winding staircase where he installed a <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> wall coverings and a large bed.

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Computer Engineering and the Institute of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2009. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2009. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 81 - 85. Colour as {{an effective}} design tool influences people’s emotions in interior spaces. Depending {{on the assumption that}} colour has an impact on human psychology, this study stresses the need for further studies that comprise colour and emotion association in interior space in order to provide healthier spaces for inhabitants. Emotional reactions to colour in a <b>living</b> <b>room</b> were investigated by using self report measure. Pure red, green and blue were chosen to be investigated as chromatic colours, whereas gray was the achromatic colour used as a control variable. The study was conducted at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. Hundred and eighty people from various ages and academic departments participated in the study. Participants first watched a short video showing an overlook of a 3 D model of a <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Next, they were asked to match the distinct coloured <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> facial expressions of six basic emotions that covers anger, disgust, surprise, happiness, fear, sadness and in addition with neutral. The results of the study indicated that the most stated emotions associated for the <b>room</b> <b>with</b> red walls were disgust and happiness, while the least stated emotions were sadness, fear, anger, and surprise. Neutral and happiness were the most stated emotions for the <b>room</b> <b>with</b> green walls and anger, surprise, fear and sadness were the least stated ones. The most stated emotion associated for the <b>room</b> <b>with</b> blue walls was neutral, while the least stated emotions were anger and surprise. Neutral, disgust and sadness were the most stated emotions for the <b>room</b> <b>with</b> gray walls. Gender differences were not found in human emotional reactions to <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> different wall colours. Kayaaslan, EnverM. S...|$|R

Roy's obsession with an idea implanted by an alien intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story [...] "Dulcie and Decorum" [...] (1955) by Damon Knight.|$|E
500|$|Von Neumann {{liked to}} eat and drink; his wife, Klara, {{said that he could}} count {{everything}} except calories. He enjoyed Yiddish and [...] "off-color" [...] humor (especially limericks). He was a non-smoker. At Princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German march music on his gramophone, which distracted those in neighboring offices, including Albert Einstein, from their work. Von Neumann did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in. He never used it, preferring the couple's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> its television playing loudly. Despite being a notoriously bad driver, he nonetheless enjoyed driving—frequently while reading a book—occasioning numerous arrests, as well as accidents. When Cuthbert Hurd hired him as a consultant to IBM, Hurd often quietly paid the fines for his traffic tickets.|$|E

Because of trams, trucks, and horses {{going up and down}} Kensington, Phillips had to hang heavy blankets over the studio door and a rear window to minimise the noise. Phillips' first recording was of himself singing [...] "Bonnie Marie of Argyle", (unaccompanied) and a few days later he recorded [...] "Unchained Melody", with local dance band singer Betty Roy. The first disc he cut in the studio was on 7 August 1955, with his eight-year-old daughter, Carol, singing, [...] "Mr Sandman". All the discs had [...] "Play with a light-weight pick-up" [...] on the label, as this would increase the life of the disc, which would eventually wear out.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, a Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars-inspired space fight is shown between Stewie, Rupert, and a giant {{spaceship}} {{in the shape of}} Peter's head, along with a series of lookalike TIE fighters. In addition, Stewie paraphrases a series of lyrics from the 1972 single [...] "Rocket Man" [...] by singer-songwriter and composer Elton John. When Brian's script is brought up during breakfast, Peter mentions his own idea for a script entitled Bigger Jaws, in which the shark from the 1975 film Jaws has to team up with the guys, including Martin Brody, Quint and Matt Hooper, to go after him to get [...] "bigger Jaws." [...] After it is produced, Peter already has a sequel in mind called Way Bigger Jaws. A historical cutaway gag portrays Adolf Hitler thinking he is being rejected by the publishing house for his submission of the autobiographical Mein Kampf, in which a publisher tells him, [...] "We didn't like it... we loved it!" [...] – to which Hitler replies, [...] "I could have killed you, Mr. Weinberg!" [...] Most of the storyline following Stewie, Chris and Meg is an homage to the 1989 film Weekend at Bernie's.

500|$|The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and {{referenced}} {{throughout the}} episode, {{along with many}} other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how after going back in time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalk board, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E
