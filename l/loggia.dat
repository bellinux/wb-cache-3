5|$|Leicester {{also built}} a <b>loggia,</b> or open gallery, beside the great keep {{to lead to}} the new formal gardens. The <b>loggia</b> was {{designed}} to elegantly frame the view as the observer slowly admired the gardens, and was a new design in the 16th century, only recently imported from Italy.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish <b>loggia</b> {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, finials and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the <b>loggia</b> design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. Wall tiles were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his <b>loggia</b> was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance {{that the rest of the}} house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the <b>loggia</b> was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{there were}} no <b>loggias</b> on the raised ground floor. Ground floor <b>loggias</b> were added later {{in the course of}} {{reconstruction}} work.|$|R
50|$|The <b>loggias</b> in {{the lower}} floor were in the Doric order; the {{associated}} entablature has a frieze which alternates metope (decorated by dishes and bucrania) and triglyphs. The upper-floor <b>loggias,</b> by contrast, are in the Ionic order, with a continuous frieze entablature.|$|R

5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the <b>Loggia,</b> which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the <b>Loggia</b> after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the pool, steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} pool at right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining wall at {{the end of the}} terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of the Broad Walk is a <b>loggia,</b> dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The <b>loggia</b> was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The <b>loggia</b> is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the <b>loggia</b> are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps {{this is the reason}} for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della <b>Loggia,</b> in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the <b>Loggia</b> in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E

50|$|One {{particularly}} imposing {{feature of}} the building is a 150-foot marble bell tower rising from the north center of the original 1899 building. The tower is square in plan with two levels of open <b>loggias</b> near the top. These <b>loggias</b> are arcaded with colored marble disks above the architrave on the first level, and arched openings with a bracketed balcony on the second.|$|R

5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the <b>Loggia</b> in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the <b>Loggia</b> palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the <b>Loggia</b> palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the <b>Loggia,</b> including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, after {{a fire in}} March 1976, Amtrak {{undertook}} a $314,000 rehabilitation of the station. The roof and portico were rebuilt, {{two of the three}} dormers removed, new restrooms added, and the platform and waiting room repaired. The <b>loggia,</b> windows, and other openings were covered with cinderblocks and brick.|$|E

5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There {{is reason to believe}} that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli to that of the <b>Loggia.</b> With the <b>Loggia,</b> however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E
5|$|The work at Salò and {{associated}} documentation, reconstructed through the numerous bills and payments, {{attests to the}} complex relationship between Cairano and Mangiacavalli. They shared staff, which was directed by either of them depending on who was on site. Such collaborative work, which has already been noted at San Pietro in Oliveto are emblematic of Cairano's artistic activity, which became increasingly busy and varied as public and private commissions poured {{in the first decade}} of the sixteenth century following the work at the <b>Loggia</b> palazzo. However, Cairano's attention was not directed to Salò, which he visited rarely, or even to San Pietro in Oliveto, which was mainly run by Sanmicheli, but to two works of greater importance and resonance: the grand staircase of the <b>Loggia</b> and the arch at Sant'Apollonio.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} <b>loggia</b> consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E

5|$|Cairano's art {{and career}} began a rapid ascent {{following}} several other commissions for {{work within the}} sanctum of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. On November 16, 1941, he was paid for two keystones for the vault of the old Duomo which was being built {{under the aegis of}} Bernardino da Martinengo. Cairano was given the sole commission for figurative sculptures in the new building. Two years later, in 1493, Cairano began work at the courtyard of the <b>Loggia</b> palazzo.|$|E
5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (The Old and the Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and {{repression}} of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of friendship with some of its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La <b>Loggia,</b> Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.|$|E
5|$|The great Renaissance {{projects}} of Brescia were {{interrupted by the}} war. Even the <b>Loggia</b> palazzo, where Cairano had already established scaffolds to mount the figures on the second level, including two angular trophies, was not to see a resumption of work till fifty years later, {{under the direction of}} Ludovico Beretta. The town's priorities had changed from artistic pomp and cultural recovery to basic necessities and vital functions.|$|E

5|$|The north facade has a gabled porch bay which {{includes}} an arched doorway with a stone monogram above. On {{each side of}} the entrance bay, there are two gables, with bays where the wings are set at an angle. The north-west wing includes a chapel, with a twin-arched <b>loggia</b> and its own porch. The east wing was previously the service wing. The building's rainwater pipes are embossed with animals and flowers.|$|E
5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a <b>loggia,</b> typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at {{either side of the}} gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E
5|$|The tower had {{two floors}} and a mezzanine. On {{the first floor}} was the famous Sundial Room or Meridian Room, which was {{initially}} an open <b>loggia.</b> Pope Urban VIII had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between 1580 and 1582 by Simon Lagi and the two Flemish artists Paul and Matthijs Bril. Today the tower has paintings by Cristoforo Roncalli and Matteino da Siena.|$|E
