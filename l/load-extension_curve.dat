Mooring systems affect extreme and fatigue loading in moored wave and tidal stream energy converters driving reliability, device survival and energy extraction efficiency. A novel mooring system referred to as the Intelligent Active Mooring System (IAMS) combines a <b>load-extension</b> <b>curve</b> which can be actively varied in response to the prevailing met-ocean conditions with a high minimum breaking load. Prototype test results demonstrate the working principle and validate the performance characteristics. The tests have established the component behaviour for different design settings and load profiles show that the system allows a wide range of response characteristics and reliable operation under single system failure mode. Numerical model studies comparing IAMS performance against existing solutions show potential for significant overall system cost reduction.

40|$|Stress-relaxation {{analysis}} {{was employed to}} determine changes in cell wall properties of Avena coleoptile and green pea stem. The stress-relaxation curve of the cell wall was simulated by a model consisting of four Maxwell viscoelastic components. Auxin changes only the initial part of the curve, indicating that auxin primarily decreases the relaxation time of the model. Significance of the r spectrum, representing a generalized Maxwell model for cell wall properties, is also {{discussed in terms of}} auxin action. The fact that auxin causes a change in mechanical properties of the plant cell wall has been confirmed by many investigators using non-automatic type tech-niques (cf. 1 - 4). However, these techniques involve disadvantages in their operation and in evaluation of the results obtained, as pointed out by GLELAND (5). Adoption of automatic tensile testing apparatus has several advantages (5 - 8). Using a standard tensile technique, where a constant rate of strain is given to methanol-killed, pronase-treated coleoptile segments, compliance (elastic: DE, plastic: DP, see Ref. 7) of the cell wall is obtained from the slope of the <b>load-extension</b> <b>curve.</b> However, since cell wall extensibility as expressed by complianc...|$|E
40|$|Uniaxial tensile {{tests have}} been used to {{investigate}} the mechanical properties of rubber materials. From the results of these studies {{it was found that the}} strength of these materials was related to the energy dissipated by the material during deformation, the hysteresis energy, HB. It has been shown for several rubbers that a simple empirical relationship exists between the energy density to break, UB, and the hysteresis energy at break, HB, where K is a constant of proportionality. This relationship indicates that the more energy a rubber can dissipate on deformation, the more work it can withstand before breaking. This relationship has been investigated as to its applicability to flexible ‘rubbery ’ materials, particularly those used as adhesives. Samples of a commercial flexible polyurethane adhesive, 3 M DP 609, were extended at a constant extension rate to rupture. A fresh sample was then extended under the same conditions to a load just before rupture. The sample was then retracted at the same rate as the extension cycle. The energy at break, UB, was determined by measuring the area under the <b>load-extension</b> <b>curve</b> and the hysteresis energy at break, HB, from the area between the extension and retraction curves. The initial results indicate that this failure criterion describes the failure in this material between two limits...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements is established to investigate the structural performance of bolted connections between cold-formed steel strips and hot rolled steel plates under shear. Non-linear material, geometrical and contact analysis is carried out to predict the <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> of typical bolted connections with cold-formed steel strips of high yield strength and low ductility. The failure mode {{of interest in the}} present investigation is the bearing failure of cold-formed steel strip around bolt holes; a full description of the {{finite element model}} is presented. Based on test data, a stress-strain curve for the cold-formed steel strip is proposed which allows the cold-formed steel strip to yield and degrade in strength at large strain. The <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> of four sets of test specimens were successfully predicted up to an extension of 3 mm. The predicted bearing resistance and the extensional stiffness of the bolted connections compare well with test data. It is found that stress-strain curves, contact stiffness and frictional coefficient between element interfaces, and clamping force developed in bolt shanks are important parameters for accurate prediction of the <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> of bolted connections.

40|$|Virtually all fibers exhibit some {{dimensional}} {{and structural}} irregularities. These include the conventional textile fibers, the high-performance brittle fibers {{and even the}} newly developed nano-fibers. In recent years, we have systematically examined the effect of fiber dimensional irregularities on the mechanical behavior of the irregular fibers. This paper extends our research to include the combined effect of dimensional and structural irregularities, using the finite element method (FEM). The dimensional irregularities are represented by sine waves with a 30 % magnitude of diameter variation while the structural irregularities are represented by longitudinal and horizontal cavities distributed within the fiber structure. The results indicate that fiber geometrical or dimensional variations have a marked influence on the tensile properties of the fiber.

Reliability and storm survival of Marine Energy Converters are critical to their commercial development and deployment. The Intelligent Active Mooring System (IAMS) is a novel device intended to minimise extreme and fatigue loading in mooring lines through a non-linear <b>load–extension</b> <b>curve</b> that is variable in operation to adjust to the prevailing metocean conditions. An analytical model of IAMS, validated by physical model tests at the Dynamic Marine Component test facility at the University of Exeter, is used in a numerical simulation of the performance of IAMS as part of the mooring system of the South West Mooring Test Facility buoy. A 10 m length of IAMS can reduce the rms line tension in normal operating conditions by up to 21 % and the peak line tension in storm conditions by up to 21 % when compared to braided nylon mooring lines. Peak line tension reductions of over 50 % can be achieved if a longer IAMS unit is used. The resulting mooring system can be optimised to give load reductions {{in a wide range of}} metocean conditions; while variable pre-tension could be used for tidal range compensation or to ease access for installation and maintenance.

The ‘In press‘ version is available at [URL] of the main engineering challenges for floating marine renewable energy devices is the design of reliable, yet cost-effective mooring solutions for the harsh and dynamic marine environment. The mooring system must be able to withstand the ultimate limit state during storm conditions as well as the fatigue limit state due to the highly cyclic wave motions. This paper presents the performance and service simulation testing of a novel mooring tether that combines the material properties of elastomeric and thermoplastic elements. This allows to 'tailor' the <b>load-extension</b> <b>curve</b> to exhibit a low stiffness response for the expected normal, operating, load conditions and a high stiffness response for the envisaged extreme, storm, conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the working principle of the mooring element and show good agreement between the theoretical load extension curve and the conducted performance tests with a distinct hysteresis effect caused by the thermoplastic element. The hysteresis is dependant on the applied pre-tension and load cycle amplitude of the element {{and to a lesser extent}} on the cycle frequency. The relaxation of the elastomeric element is quantified, giving insight into the expected longterm performance of the tether. The demonstrated working principle and the possibility to tailor the mooring response allows engineers to load- and cost-optimise the mooring system of floating marine energy converters.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) hinges produced by Common Fibers (Kent, Washington) {{are a new}} technology with uncharacterized {{mechanical properties}}. Currently, Common Fiber’s hinges are utilized in wallets, {{but in order to}} expand the application of the hinges to structural components, complete characterization of the mechanical properties of the hinges is necessary. To address this problem, hinges developed by Common Fibers were tested utilizing the V-Notch rail shear test, ASTM D 7078, to determine the shear strength of the hinges. Two layups, [+ 45 /- 45 / 0]s and [0 /+ 45 /- 45 / 0]s were produced by Common Fibers for the experiment. Hinged and unhinged laminates of both layups were tested using the V-Notch rail shear test for maximum load producing <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves.</b> The results of the hinged and unhinged laminates were compared to characterize the shear behavior of the composite hinges. Comparison of hinged and unhinged composites revealed that the production of the hinge results in a reduction in shear strength from an average of 12. 260 kN to as low as 1. 568 kN. The <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> display a pre-loading phase where the fibers in the hinge region undergo a period of relaxed extension until they are engaged in supporting the applied load.

At low twist, the fibers slip along the filament core and mainly the filament yarn supports the effort. The breakage of this nature was named high elongation breakage.

40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements was established to investigate the bearing failure of cold-formed steel bolted connections under shear. It was demonstrated (Chung and Ip. Engineering Structures 2000; 22 : 1271 - 1284) that the predicted <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> of bolted connections in lap shear tests followed closely to the measured <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> provided that measured steel strengths and geometrical dimensions {{were used in the}} analysis. Furthermore, it was shown (Chung and Ip. Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Steel Structures, Praha, May 1999, p. 503 - 506) that stress-strain curves, contact stiffnesses and frictional coefficients between element interfaces, and clamping forces developed in bolt shanks were important parameters for accurate prediction of the deformation characteristics of bolted connections. This paper presents an extension of the finite element investigation onto the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel bolted connections, and three distinctive failure modes (Ip and Chung. Proceeding of the Second International Conference on Advances in Steel Structures, Hong Kong, December 1999) as observed in lap shear tests are successfully modelled: bearing failure; shear-out failure; and net-section failure. Furthermore, a parametric study on bolted connections with different configurations is performed to provide bearing resistances for practical design, and the results of the {{finite element model}}ling are also compared with four codified design rules. It is found that the design rules are not applicable for bolted connections with high strength steels due to reduced ductility. Consequently, a semiempirical design formula for bearing resistance of bolted connections is proposed after calibrating against finite element results. The proposed design rule relates the bearing resistances with the design yield and tensile strengths of steel strips through a strength coefficient. It is demonstrated that the design rule is applicable for bolted connections of both low strength and high strength steels with different ductility limits.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of fibre {{irregularities}} on the mechanical behaviour of the irregular fibres using the finite element method (FEM). The {{first part of this}} work examines that {{the effect of}} fibre dimensional irregularities on the linear and non-linear tensile behaviour of the fibres, using a two-dimensional (2 D) finite element models. In the linear simulation, a concept of method Young’s modulus is introduced. The method Young’s modulus, breaking load and breaking extension are affected by the magnitude and frequency of diameter variation in the fibre specimen. Fibre dimensional variation and the gauge length effect are also simulated. In the non-linear analysis, some additional information is obtained on changes in the yield and post-yield regions, which are clearly shown in the <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves.</b> Further investigation is focused on the flexural buckling behaviour of fibres with dimensional irregularities. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model is used to simulate the buckling deformation of dimensionally irregular fibres, and the critical buckling load of the simulated fibre is calculated. Two parameters, the effective length and the average diameter within the effective length of an irregular fibre, are considered to be the key factors that influence the buckling behaviour of the fibre. An important aspect of this work is the calculation of the effective length of an irregular fibre specimen during buckling. This method has not been reported before. The third part of this work is on the combined tensile and torsional behaviour of fibres with dimensional irregularities, using a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model. Two types of fibres, polyester and wool, are simulated with sine waves of different level (magnitude) and frequency at different twist levels. For the polyester fibre, experiment verification of the simulation results has been carried out, and the results indicate the FE model is well acceptable for the simulation. The final part of this work examines the combined effect of dimensional and structural irregularities on the fibre tensile behaviour. Three-dimensional (3 D) finite element models are used to simulate the cracks (transverse, longitudinal, combined transverse and longitudinal cracks) and cavities distributed in uniform fibres and fibres with 30 % level of diameter variation, respectively. One of important conclusions is that under the simulated conditions, the dimensional irregularity of fibre influences the tensile behaviour of fibres more than the fibre structural irregularity. The fibre dimensional irregularity affects not only the values of the breaking load and breaking extension, but also the shape of <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves.</b> However, the fibre structural irregularity simulated in the study appears to have little effect on the shape of the <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves.</b> In addition, the effect of crack or cavity size, type and distribution on fibre tensile properties is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|The <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> of Alastiks {{were found}} to be {{sensitive}} to both the degree and rate of extension. When halting at a con-stant extension, the exponential load decay was also dependent on the initial deforma-tion rate. The results suggest that clinically these modules should be stretched slowly to position. Before attempting the more complicated analyses of intra-arch forces and tooth move-ments, it is imperative to first understand the behavior of the force device itself. In the present investigation, we have chosen to study Unitek's K 2 regular Alastik modulesa since they are in popular use in our clinics and since the manufacturer claims them to be capable of producing long-lasting, ac-curate forces in the oral environment. 1 Materials and Methods Special grips shown in Figure 1 were ma-chined to measure Alastik forces in a tensile testing machineb under a variety of loading and stretching conditions. A 0. 046 -inch di-ameter hole drilled perpendicular to the longitudinal axis permits the insertion of a no. 56 drill through the eyelet of the module to hold it in place during testing.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which endogenous cessation of coleoptile elongation after emergence of the primary leaf is brought about was investigated in rye seedlings {Secale cereale L.) that were either grown in darkness or irradiated with continuous white light. In 3 -d-old etiolated (growing) coleoptiles a turgor pressure of 0. 59 MPa was measured. In 6 -d-old coleoptiles, which had ceased to elongate, cell turgor was 0. 51 MPa and thus only 13 % lower than in the rapidly growing organ. Hence, the driving force for growth (turgor) is largely maintained. Cell-wall plasticity (£„,) and elasticity (£al) were determined with a constantload extensiometer both in vivo (turgid coleoptile segments) and in vitro (frozen-thawed samples). Cessation of coleoptile elongation was correlated with a 95 % reduction in £pl, whereas £., was only slightly affected. Extension kinetics were measured with living and frozen-thawed segments cut from growing and non-growing coleoptiles. The corresponding stress-strain (<b>load-extension)</b> <b>curves</b> indicate that the cell wall of the growing coleoptile behaves like an elastic-plastic material whereas that of the nongrowing organ shows the behaviour of an elastic solid. These data demonstate that £pl represents a true plastic (irreversible) deformation of the cell wall. It is concluded that cessation of coleoptile growth after emergence of the primary leaf is attributable {{to a loss of}} cell-wall plasticity. Hence, a mechanical stiffening of the cell wall and not a loss of turgor pressure may be responsible for the deceleration of cell elongation in the rye coleoptile...|$|R

We studied infant rib fractures from a biomechanical and morphological perspective using a porcine model. Methods: We used 24, 6 th ribs of one day old domestic pigs Sus scrofa, divided into three groups, desiccated (representing post-mortem trauma), fresh ribs with intact periosteum (representing peri-mortem trauma) and those stored at - 20. °C. Two experiments were designed to study their biomechanical behaviour fracture morphology: ribs were axially compressed and subjected to four-point bending in an Instron 3339 fitted with custom jigs. Morphoscopic analysis of resultant fractures consisted of standard optical methods, micro-CT (μCT) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results: During axial compression fresh ribs did not fracture because of energy absorption capabilities of their soft and fluidic components. In flexure tests, dry ribs showed typical elastic-brittle behaviour with long linear <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves,</b> followed by short non-linear elastic (hyperelastic) behaviour and brittle fracture. Fresh ribs showed initial linear-elastic behaviour, followed by strain softening and visco-plastic responses. During the course of loading, dry bone showed minimal observable damage prior to the onset of unstable fracture. Frozen then thawed bone showed similar patterns to fresh bone. Morphologically, fresh ribs showed extensive periosteal damage to the tensile surface with areas of collagen fibre pull-out along the tensile surface. While all dry ribs fractured precipitously, with associated fibre pull-out, the latter feature was absent in thawed ribs.

We studied rib fractures from a biomechanical and morphological perspective using 15, 5 th ribs of domestic pigs Sus scrofa, divided into two groups, desiccated (representing post-mortem trauma) and fresh ribs with intact periosteum (representing peri-mortem trauma). Ribs were axially compressed and subjected to four-point bending in an Instron 3339 fitted with custom jigs. Morphoscopic analysis of resultant fractures consisted of standard optical methods, micro-CT (μCT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). During axial compression, fresh ribs had slightly higher strength because of energy absorption capabilities of their soft and fluidic components. In flexure tests, dry ribs showed typical elastic-brittle behaviour with long linear <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves,</b> followed by relatively short non-linear elastic (hyperelastic) behaviour and brittle fracture.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Elastin and {{collagen}} (types I and III) are {{the primary}} load-bearing elements in aortic tissue. Deficiencies and derangements in elastin and type III collagen {{have been associated with}} the development of aneurysmal disease. However, the role of type I collagen is less well defined. The {{purpose of this study was}} to define the role of type I collagen in maintaining biomechanical integrity in the thoracic aorta, with a mouse model that produces homotrimeric type I collagen [α 1 (I) ] 3, rather than the normally present heterotrimeric [α 1 (I) ] 2 α 2 (I) type I collagen isotype. Methods: Ascending and descending thoracic aortas from homozygous (oim/oim), heterozygous (oim /+), and wildtype (+/+) mice were harvested. Circumferential and longitudinal <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> were used as a means of determining maximum breaking strength (Fmax) and incremental elastic modulus (IEM). Histologic analyses and hydroxyproline assays were performed as a means of determining collagen organization and content. Results: Circumferentially, the ascending and descending aortas of oim /oim mice demonstrated significantly reduced Fmax, with an Fmax of only 60 % and 23 %, respectively, of wildtype mice aortas. Oim/oim descending aortas demonstrated significantly greater compliance (decreased IEM), and the ascending aortas also exhibited a trend toward increased compliance. Reduced breaking strength was also demonstrated with longitudinal extension of the descending aorta. Conclusion: The presence of homotrimeric type I collagen isotype (absence of α 2 (I) collagen) significantly weakens the aorta. This study demonstrates the integral role of type I collagen in the biomechanical and functional properties of the aorta and may help to elucidate the role of collagen in the development of aneurysmal aortic disease or dissection.

40|$|Little {{has been}} {{reported}} regarding the susceptibility of grade X 100 pipeline steel to environment-assisted cracking (EAC). The relative susceptibility of as-received bulk, welded and simulated heat-affected zone (HAZ) microstructures were compared using slow strain rate techniques and smooth tensile specimens. The susceptibility was also {{compared with that of}} X 80 steel. Specimens were tested in a 1 M sodium hydrogen carbonate / 0. 5 M sodium carbonate solution with a pH of ~ 9. 5 at a temperature of 75 oC within an applied potential range of – 500 to – 1100 mV (sce). For comparison a 4 M NaNO 3 environment was also used. The as-received bulk grade X 100 was found to be less susceptible than a Widmanstätten microstructure, or a pearlite/ferrite, or a “spheroidised” structure. Welding has a significant effect on the microstructure and hence resistance to EAC. Tests on the as-received steel gave serrated <b>load-extension</b> <b>curves</b> and the serrations occur at particular combinations of strain rate and temperature. The serrations at 75 oC and strain rate of 2 x 10 - 6 /s were removed by annealing at 600 oC but this increases the susceptibility to secondary cracking at potentials more negative than – 800 mV (sce). The grade X 100 is less susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) than to hydrogen embrittlement. The role of carbon and manganese solute atoms in microstructural segregation (banding) was investigated. Banding induced directionality in the growth of stress corrosion cracks and caused fracture surface ovality. EDX microanalysis confirmed that the concentration of manganese is higher in the bands of pearlite. Band removal depends on homogenisation of either carbon or manganese which also depends on temperature, time and diffusion rate. Carbon diffusion may be restricted by cooling austenitised steel at a fast rate. Rapid cooling removes carbon segregation but does not remove manganese segregation. Homogenisation of manganese at 1175 oC takes more than five hours. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServicePTDF, NigeriaGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
