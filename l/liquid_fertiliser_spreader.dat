The analysis is directly applied to the flow of particles on a centrifugal <b>fertiliser</b> <b>spreader.</b> Equations of motion are derived for flat disc/radial vanes type of spreaders and further generalised for the more common conical disc/pitched vanes type. The derived equations of motion form part of {{the basis of a}} simulation model for centrifugal (or spinning disc) <b>fertiliser</b> <b>spreaders</b> with the equations of motion through the air completing the model. In the simulation, the collective flow of particles is treated as a superposition of single-particle trajectories with different initial conditions.

A discrete element method (DEM) model of a centrifugal <b>fertiliser</b> <b>spreader</b> was developed. A sensitivity study was used to determine the DEM parameters by comparing the results to experimental results. The effects of the disc speed, feed position, feed rate and vane angle on the spread pattern were investigated experimentally and compared to the DEM results.

With proper management, these residues are potentially valuable sources of plant nutrients, mainly N. Recycling such subproducts in sustainably-based agricultural systems can minimise {{the use of}} mineral fertilisers, and hence reduce the potential risk of surface and groundwater pollution. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to obtain (small scale) two <b>liquid</b> labelled-organic <b>fertilisers,</b> an animal- and a vegetal-based organic (AO and VO, respectively) fertiliser, to be used as organic N sources in subsequent fertigation studies. Forage maize (Zea mays L.) grown under 15 N-labelled fertiliser supply was used as raw material for VO fertiliser production, and also as 15 N-labelled sheep feed to obtain 15 N-labelled manure. The labelled faeces fraction was used as raw material for the AO fertiliser. The VO fertiliser was obtained after an acidic and an enzyme-driven hydrolysis. The AO fertiliser was obtained after acidic hydrolysis. The VO <b>liquid</b> <b>fertiliser</b> presented an N concentration of 330 mg·L- 1, 85 % of total N was organic, while ammonium and nitrate N accounted for 55 % and 45 % of the mineral nitrogen fraction, respectively. This fertiliser also exhibited high K, Ca and S concentrations and notable values for the remaining macro- and micronutrients. The AO <b>liquid</b> <b>fertiliser</b> had a similar total N concentration (496 mg·L- 1, 82 % of total N in an organic form) to that of VO, but its mineral N fraction significantly differed, which came in a predominantly (95 %) ammonia form.

The objective was to compare crop production between plants grown with <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertilisers</b> and plants grown with conventional de novo fertilisers. Cucumbers were propagated in coir and peat and planted on slabs of respectively coir and peat. The plants on the two rooting media received either liquid organic or chemical fertilisers, resulting in four treatments in total. Plants fed with <b>liquid</b> chemical <b>fertilisers</b> were shown to initially produce 10 - 20 % more fresh weight per unit time than plants fed with <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertilisers.</b> When organic fertiliser was used during cultivation, ammonium accumulated to levels of 10 - 20 mmol L- 1, while nitrate levels dropped to below 1 mmol L- 1. To explain the results, the conversion of nitrogen was studied. Conversion of organic nitrogen into nitrate requires enzymatic hydrolysis to ammonium, followed by bacterial oxidation to nitrate. This microbiological process depends on two physiological groups of naturally occurring aerobic soil bacteria; ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). In conclusion nitrate concentration rather than the concentrations of organic nitrogen or ammonium, were growth rate determining.

In prior experiments the conversion by aerobic substrate born bacteria of ammonium into nitrate was plant growth limiting. To improve the formulation of a commercial <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertiliser</b> by increasing the nitrate concentration, a simple bench scale moving bed bioreactor of 20 L volume was constructed and used in continuous mode. The objective was to convert 80 % {{or more of the}} organic N present in the original <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertiliser</b> into nitrate. In the bioreactor we used naturally occurring aerobic nitrifying soil bacteria. Bacterial material from a soil sample was multiplied in vitro in selective media. The bioreactor was inoculated with ammonia and nitrite oxidising bacteria. Bacteria were maintained on a bio-carrier with a high specific surface area and a low specific mass. The bioreactor was aerated from below which allowed the bio-carrier to float and fertiliser solution could freely reach all bacterial mass. After initial inoculation, bacteria established themselves on the bio-carrier over a three week period after which accumulation of nitrite ended and stable production of nitrate as an only product of nitrification started. The nitrate production was monitored for several months during which it produced continuously. The bioreactor was supplied with fertiliser solution containing 6 mmol L- 1 (total N, no nitrate). Over 90 % of nitrogen supplied was converted to nitrate. Influent hydraulic retention time in the bioreactor was around 12. 5 h. In conclusion, in line continuous conversion of <b>liquid</b> organic-N <b>fertiliser</b> into nitrate can be achieved for over 90 % by a simple and reliable technique.

In this paper we examine postrelease establishment and dispersal of the nymphs of the predatory bug Pristhesancus plagipennis on soybean, cotton and sunflower {{in an effort}} to devise an appropriate strategy for field release. The effects of predator stadia and release rates on field establishment and within-crop-canopy dispersal after hand release were recorded in soybean, cotton and sunflower. Field establishment improved with the release of more-developed nymphs, with third instars providing the most appropriate compromise between field hardiness and rearing cost.

Because of this within-field spatial variability, in the precision agriculture cycle, the targeted fertiliser spreading can be highly profitable for both environment protection and cost saving. For this aim the yield and, then, the soil nutrient content must be measured on a localised basis and, therefore, mapped. Relying on the yield map and on the map of each nutrient available in the field {{it is possible to}} produce the fertiliser application map, which must be stored on a portable computer, in order to perform the spatially variable rate fertiliser spreading.

A glasshouse pot experiment tested if <b>liquid</b> P <b>fertilisers</b> were more effective for growing spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) than granular P (monoammonium phosphate) in 28 soils from all over Australia with soil pH (H 2 O) ranging from 5. 2 to 8. 9. Application of liquid P resulted in greater shoot biomass, as measured after 4 weeks' growth (mid to late tillering, Feeks growth stage 2 - 3), than granular P in 3 of the acidic to neutral soils and in 3 alkaline soils. Shoot dry matter responses of spring wheat to applied liquid or granular P were related to soil properties to determine if any of the properties predicted superior yield responses to liquid P. The calcium carbonate content of soil was the only soil property that significantly contributed to predicting when liquid P was more effective than granular P. Five soil P test procedures (Bray, Colwell, resin, isotopically exchangeable P, and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT)) were assessed to determine their ability to measure soil test P on subsamples of soil collected before the experiment started. These soil test values were then related to the dry matter shoot yields to assess their ability to predict wheat yield responses to P applied as liquid or granular P. All 5 soil test procedures provided a reasonable prediction of dry matter responses to applied P as either liquid or granular P, with the resin P test having a slightly greater predictive capacity on the range of soils tested.

40|$|Sugarcane {{grown in}} the Southern African region is reliant on large inputs of {{fertiliser}} nitrogen (up to 200 kg N /ha/crop) for producing optimum sucrose yields. Urea is the preferred N fertiliser, mainly due to a high N concentration [46 %] and a lower price per unit of N compared with its main competitors, limestone ammonium nitrate (LAN [28 %]) and ammonium sulphate (AS [21 %]). While LAN, AS and urea suffer similar field losses of NO 3 -N by leaching and denitrification, urea is subject to additional NH 3 -N losses by volatilisation from both acid and alkaline non-irrigated soils. A new laboratory method was developed to test grower soils for potential ammonia volatilisation from surface-applied urea.

Technical advantages to use the 3 D spread pattern knowledge the CEMIB provides are illustrated regarding different real problems, gradually complex, for which manufacturer are commonly faced {{as soon as they}} need to improve or develop new spreader technologies or new fertiliser formulations. Then, the greater part of the paper is organise to explain some computed tools which have been developed by the Cemagref to value the most as possible information enclosed in the 3 D spread pattern. The CEMIB global offer is really well positioned in the eco-design context: (i) practically, testing facilities required are around 10 times less expensive than transverse classical ones, (ii) it allows time and fertilisers saving during innovated phases of <b>fertiliser</b> and <b>spreader</b> developments, i. e. real tests can be replaced by computing simulations, and (iii) it allows analyses which should not be possible, in any case, using only the transverse spread pattern...|$|R
40|$|In an EU CRAFT project (COOP-CT- 2004 - 508458) {{running from}} March 2004 to March 2006, an {{international}} consortium of producers of environmentally benign crop inputs, RTD performers and end users, evaluated {{the production and}} use of products manu-factured from different raw materials such as seaweeds, pine needles, trees and herbaceous species or physically hydrolysed bovine fur and hair residues. At the field level, the products were applied as solid pellets or <b>liquids,</b> as <b>fertilisers</b> or sprays, respectively. This paper presents as an example results from field trials of organically grown potatoes and tomatoes at the University of Kassel. Assessments were per-formed on yield, plant health and quality aspects. In most of the experiments solid products (pellets) with nitrogen contents between 7 to 12...|$|R
