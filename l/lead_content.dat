5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas.

However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. <b>Lead</b> <b>content</b> in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters.

40|$|Summary. — The <b>lead</b> <b>contents</b> {{can vary}} greatly {{in a series}} of bronze coins {{belonging}} to a same type. This variation maybe due to changes in the bronze composition or to lead segregation during the casting process. A limestone mould for casting bronze blank was discovered at the Gallic-Roman site of Châteaubleau (France) and was used as a starting point to study lead segregation in bronze blanks. Bronze blanks were cast in a modern mould similar to the one found at Châteaubleau using ancient methods.

As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit <b>lead</b> <b>content</b> in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk.

As a result, {{it was found that}} with increasing <b>lead</b> oxide <b>content,</b> W- 10 /A(10) decreased, while the quantum efficiency increased.

The use of lead in these wares has produced health warning in both Mexico and the United States, with the risks being known as early as the late 19th century. Lead from the glaze tends to leach into foods after repeated use.

The towns of Trzebinia, Chrzanów within the towns of Krzeszowice, Jaworzno, Mysłowice, have been creating a base of well-connected Kraków-Upper Silesia agglomeration. The inhabitants of Trzebinia commune are flexible on labour market, often commute to work in Kraków or Katowice. They have detached houses with gardens {{of one or two}} acres size, where "home-made", fresh, low-processed food could be produced. At the same time the area of Trzebinia Community belongs to Chrzanów geochemical anomaly, which is reflected in high values of cadmium, <b>lead</b> and zinc <b>contents</b> in the soils. This is the result of both natural and anthropogenic factors. The purpose of the paper was to evaluate <b>lead</b> and iron <b>contents</b> in roots and leaves of parsley being cultivated within the area of the anomaly. Considering, there is a positive geochemical anomaly, the <b>lead</b> <b>contents</b> in soil were low - the average value was 88. 67 mg kg - 1 d. m. and only two contents - 218. 98 and 119. 35 exceeded 100 mg kg - 1 d. m. On the other hand the <b>lead</b> <b>contents</b> in parsley roots were high, many times higher than the allowable values. The <b>lead</b> <b>contents</b> in parsley leaves were also high. Phytoaccumulation indices low, only one had the average value, but at their minimal range (1. 02 and 10. 3 adequately for leaves and roots). Translocation index of lead was close to one. The iron contents in soils were not high and fall within the scope of low and average ranges that occur in Polish soils. The iron contents in leaves were high, attractive from nutrition point of view. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: parsley, geochemical anomaly, food quality...|$|R

30|$|The {{decorated}} blank {{was fired}} to adhere the gilding and fuse the enamels. Although the softening temperatures of the enamels differ {{due to their}} varying <b>lead</b> <b>contents,</b> Mamluk glassmakers likely applied all colors together, affixing them with a single firing. The complex pontil mark visible {{on the bottom of}} the vessel indicates that a pontil was reattached to the decorated vessel to reintroduce the object into the furnace, technology consistent with Mamluk manufacture, as opposed to stationary kiln firing not practiced until the 19 th century. The apparent double, but not triple or quadruple, pontil mark on the Brooklyn Museum lamp supports the hypothesis that all decorative materials were simultaneously fired. Evidenced in the enamel samples analyzed, the lamp’s red and white enamels are intimately mixed despite their differing <b>lead</b> <b>contents,</b> suggesting that these “hard” and “soft” enamels were fired together. The occurrences of decorative material contaminants in the enamels, such as the tin-rich and iron-rich inclusions identified in the blue enamel and the lazurite particle in the white enamel, also suggest simultaneous application and firing of the various decorative materials.|$|R

Glazes with even-higher <b>lead</b> <b>content</b> occur in Spanish and Italian maiolica, with up to 55% PbO and as low as 3% alkali. Adding lead to the melt allows the formation of tin oxide more readily than in an alkali glaze: tin oxide precipitates into crystals in the glaze as it cools, creating its opacity.|$|E

25|$|The {{brilliance}} {{of lead crystal}} relies on the high refractive index caused by the <b>lead</b> <b>content.</b> Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which}} a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be achromatic.|$|E
