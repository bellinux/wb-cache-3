In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying <b>lengths.</b> <b>In</b> fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella.

5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond <b>lengths</b> (<b>in</b> this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E

5|$|In the gas phase, and at {{very low}} {{temperatures}} in the condensed phase, the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules. The metal–metal bond <b>lengths</b> <b>in</b> these M2 molecules increase down the group from Li2 to Cs2, but then decrease after that to Uue2, due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital. The opposite trend is shown for the metal–metal bond-dissociation energies. The Uue–Uue bond should be slightly stronger than the K–K bond. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of ununennium is predicted to be 94kJ·mol−1 (the value for francium should be around 77kJ·mol−1).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{backflow}} region <b>length</b> <b>in</b> sudden-reduction {{oil tube}} {{is not only}} closely related with its energy loss, but also is closely related with the partition between orifice plate and plug. In this paper, the characteristics of backflow region <b>length</b> <b>in</b> sudden-reduction oil tube are researched. The results illustrate that backflow region length decreases {{with the increase of}} the contraction ratio; when Reynolds number is more than 105, Reynolds number have little impacts on backflow region length.

5|$|In the gas phase, the {{alkaline}} earth metals do not usually form covalently bonded diatomic molecules like the alkali metals do, since such molecules {{would have the}} same number of electrons in the bonding and antibonding orbitals and would have very low dissociation energies. Thus, the M–M bonding in these molecules is predominantly through van der Waals forces. The metal–metal bond <b>lengths</b> <b>in</b> these M2 molecules increase down the group from Ca2 to Ubn2. On the other hand, their metal–metal bond-dissociation energies generally increase from Ca2 to Ba2 and then drop precipitously to Ubn2, which should be the most weakly bound of all the group 2 homodiatomic molecules. The cause of this trend is the increasing participation of the p3/2 and d electrons as well as the relativistically contracted s orbital. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of unbinilium is predicted to be 150kJ·mol−1.|$|E
