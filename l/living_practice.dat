25|$|The town of Pau {{is marked}} by a strong {{cultural}} identity, with the presence of a French-Occitan bilingual school (calandreta Paulina) (90 students) in Pau and one in the metropolitan area in Lescar (60 students), by a <b>living</b> <b>practice</b> of Béarnese and the success of the Occitan cultural groups. The city has, however, received foreign influences of major importance (English, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian) and remains very open to the outside with a high English student community, along with the presence of Dutch, Portuguese, Spaniards and Moroccans. Near Dax, Bayonne and Biarritz, the Pau people have a love of city ferias. The bandas, bodegas (drinking places with typical animation) and Béarnese singing groups are numerous including Nadau, Lo Cèu de Pau and Balaguera. Since 2005, the city hosts the festival Hestiv'oc which is the grand festival of Occitania.

2500|$|The Ket {{traditional}} culture was researched by Matthias Castrén, Vasiliy Ivanovich Anuchin, Kai Donner, , and Yevgeniya Alekseyevna Alekseyenko. Shamanism was a <b>living</b> <b>practice</b> into the 1930s, {{but by the}} 1960s almost no authentic shamans could be found. Shamanism is not a homogeneous phenomenon, nor is shamanism in Siberia. As for shamanism among Kets, it shared characteristics with those of Turkic and Mongolic peoples. Additionally, there were several types of Ket shamans, differing in function (sacral rites, curing), power, and associated animals (deer, bear). Also, among Kets (as with several other Siberian peoples such as the Karagas) there are examples {{of the use of}} skeleton symbolics. Hoppál interprets this [...] as a symbol of shamanic rebirth, although it may symbolize also the bones of the loon (the helper animal of the shaman, joining the air and underwater worlds, just like the story of the shaman who travelled both to the sky and the underworld). The skeleton-like overlay represented shamanic rebirth among some other Siberian cultures as well.|$|E

50|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, several studies {{attempted}} to establish haoma as a psychotropic substance, and based their arguments on the assumption that proto-Indo-Iranian *sauma was a hallucinogen.

50|$|Some of {{the prehistoric}} peoples who {{once lived in}} Siberia have {{dispersed}} and migrated into other regions, bringing aspects of their cultures with them. For example, many Uralic peoples live now outside Siberia, however the original location of the Proto-Uralic peoples (and its extent) is debated. Combined phytogeographical and linguistic considerations (distribution of various tree species {{and the presence of}} their names in various Uralic languages) suggest that this area was north of Central Ural Mountains and on lower and middle parts of Ob River. The ancestors of Hungarian people or Magyars have wandered from their ancestral proto-Uralic area to the Pannonian Basin. Shamanism has {{played an important role in}} Turko-Mongol mythology. Tengriism - the major ancient belief among Xiongnu, Mongol and Turkic peoples, Magyars and Bulgars - incorporates elements of shamanism. Shamanism is no more a <b>living</b> <b>practice</b> among Hungarians, but remnants have been reserved as fragments of folklore, in folktales, customs.|$|E
5000|$|The idea {{of action}} {{research}} as a <b>living</b> <b>practice</b> entered {{the mainstream of}} action research from the book, [...] "Action Research as a Living Practice" [...] by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. The term [...] "educational theory" [...] originated {{with the work of}} Jack Whitehead, a former lecturer at the University of Bath, and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by Jean McNiff in 2009. Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008). In the eyes of Whitehead, radical constructivism {{is at the core of}} living educational theory research.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to outline an experiential way of {{understanding}} the organization, from a embodied perspective, that privileges the analyses of organizational practices situated in the environment. We take the dwelling perspective in order to enrich the comprehension of the life-world where the perception takes place and to clarify how knowledge emerges from situated <b>living</b> <b>practices.</b> This paper proposes an approach that describes <b>living</b> <b>practices</b> based on the entwinement with the life-world, such as an embodied process situated in the environment. The paper presents new possibilities of research about the relation between individuals and organizations, as the dwelling perspective enables the comprehension that the organization is not only inhabited, but is a living space. The goal is to fill gaps identified in the two studies on practices in Organizational Studies: (1) the effort to rescue the critical potential of practices in relation to positivist and rationalist concepts imposed on organizational studies and (2) the need to promote clearer articulation about the entwinement with life-world, considering that this idea is crucial {{for the analysis of}} practice rooted in the environment...|$|R

5000|$|Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker {{expressed}} the philosophy, ambition {{and spirit of}} P.A.R.T.S. as follows: “I cannot teach anyone to dance. One learns to dance oneself. But perhaps I can give them a desire, an experience, create a space for challenges.”In 2000, deputy director Theo Van Rompuy summarized {{the objectives of the}} school as follows: “Firstly, there is the basic need to provide training for contemporary dance. Secondly, we want to create an instrument to pass on the knowledge and information resulting from the turbulent development of Belgian dance. The intention is always to connect with <b>living</b> <b>practice</b> at home and abroad. To this end, we confront the young dancer during the training with work by William Forsythe, Pina Bausch, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Wim Vandekeybus, Meg Stuart and Pierre Droulers, as a landmark. It is all strong material that is obviously proven on the stage, and precisely because of this, the student will benefit from it, but he must also position himself, in relation to or in conflict with it. It is never the intention to form followers of any kind according to a particular model, but to train physically and technically good dancers and choreographers who develop their own language, their own voice.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The idea {{of action}} {{research}} as a <b>living</b> <b>practice</b> entered {{the mainstream of}} action research from the book, [...] "Action Research as a Living Practice" [...] by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ..." [...] participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the [...] "application" [...] of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account {{of the way in}} which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator [...] This requires what Martin Buber called an [...] "I-Thou" [...] approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's [...] "I-Thou" [...] approach toward another human being to an [...] "I/you/we" [...] approach to action research. This differs greatly from an approach to living theory action research imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002) where he imagines living theory action research as forming an [...] "I-theory" [...] of knowledge. Director of the Philosophy for Children Project at Notre Dame de Namur University William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a critical theory and emancipatory action research approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of discourse.|$|E
