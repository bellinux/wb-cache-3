500|$|In the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles asks Jim (John Krasinski) for a [...] "rundown" [...] of {{his client}} information. Jim {{does not know}} what a rundown is, but is too embarrassed to ask because he has been making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles. Jim spends much of the day {{trying to figure out what}} a rundown is, making several failed attempts to figure it out by chatting vaguely about it with Charles and other coworkers. When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim {{does not know what}} the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E

[...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series. They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford's personal favorite, {{despite the fact that it}} did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword. Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more like a game that I really wanted to make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E

500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old mixing board and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is {{going to come back to}} Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rrose Sélavy and {{the other}} pseudonyms Duchamp used may {{be read as a}} comment on the fallacy of romanticizing the {{conscious}} individuality or subjectivity of the artist, a theme that is also a prominent subtext of the Readymades. [...] Duchamp said in an interview,"You think you're doing something entirely your own, and a year later you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> you see actually the roots of where your art comes from without your knowing it at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, game {{designer}} Josh Millard released Ennuigi. Ennuigi adds metafictional commentary to {{the original}} game since it relates the story of Luigi's inability {{to come to terms}} with the lack of narrative. In a Reddit thread, Millard commented [...] "I [...] think it's a pretty weird implied narrative once you step back and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> enjoyed funneling some thoughts about all that into a recharacterization of Luigi as a guy who's as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you'd expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise." ...|$|E

So there's going to be that." [...] The band underwent 360 degree body scans for numerous lyric videos and artwork for the album. On April 9, 2012, the band released a teaser video for the album on Tumblr. The album's art was released on April 16, 2012, along with the album's first single, [...] "Burn It Down".|$|E
2500|$|According to Human Head's {{associate}} producer Matt Bisenius, all {{the previous}} {{work on the}} game up to its acquisition by ZeniMax/Bethesda was [...] "bouncing ideas around" [...] rather than any detailed development, believing 3D Realms/Radar Group had announced this sequel too early. As they started more in-depth planning and development for the game, the team came to an idea of a bounty hunter, and {{decided to take the}} core ideas from Prey while providing a game with more activities for the player do, partially inspired by the then-recent release of Red Dead Redemption. Bisenius noted that [...] "We didn't look at Prey 1 and pick out mistakes as much as <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> pick out the core themes of Prey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pollock {{signed a}} gallery {{contract}} with Peggy Guggenheim in July 1943. He received {{the commission to}} create Mural (1943), which measures roughly 8 feet tall by 20 feet long, for the entry to her new townhouse. At the suggestion of her friend and advisor Marcel Duchamp, Pollock painted the work on canvas, rather than the wall, {{so that it would}} be portable. After seeing the big mural, the art critic Clement Greenberg wrote: [...] "I took one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I thought, 'Now that's great art,' and I knew Jackson was the greatest painter this country had produced." [...] The catalog introducing his first exhibition described Pollock's talent as [...] "...volcanic. It has fire. It is unpredictable. It is undisciplined. It spills out of itself in a mineral prodigality, not yet crystallized." ...|$|E

2500|$|His work is methodical, because [...] "an artwork {{is not an}} act of 'imagination' (...) but of observation, perception, form manipulation." [...] "I {{start with}} shapes, still arbitrary. I put ten shapes on the frame; I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} a sort of spark ignites. Then the form appears. Color is secondary, used to accentuate {{the intensity of the}} form." [...] Nadir Afonso did not renege on his early expressionist and surrealist works: [...] "An individual initially does not see the true nature of things, he starts by representing the real, because he is convinced therein lies the essence of the artwork. I thought that too. But, as I kept working, the underlying laws of art, which are the laws of geometry, slowly revealed themselves in front of my eyes. There was no effort on my part, it was just the daily work what led me to that result, guided by intuition." [...] The illustrations in this article are a chronological representation of the evolution of Nadir Afonso's style and thought towards the original geometric alphabet with which he created his artworks, as explained in his books and seen most prominently in his Cities series.|$|E
2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
