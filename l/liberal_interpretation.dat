25|$|In February 2007, Lieutenant General (ret.) Aloysius Casey {{and his son}} Patrick Casey {{published}} an article in Air Force Magazine about the Lavelle affair.

25|$|Prior to my order, {{there was}} no {{authorization}} (under McNamara or Clifford) to destroy dangerous targets except when fired upon without special permission. General Bus Wheeler, Admiral Tom Moorer, and General Abrams all agreed with the <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> on my order on protective reaction. The new orders permitted hitting anti-aircraft installations and other dangerous targets if spotted on their missions, whether they were activated or not.|$|E

25|$|The central {{government}} funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities {{for the construction}} of the island's other infrastructures (water works, power stations, telecommunications, etc.) and had taken a very <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the {{central government}} to re-finance the special district.|$|E
25|$|Their {{first attempt}} ends up recreating (after a <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the results) the Mary Magdalene {{conspiracy}} theory central to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Casaubon jokingly suggests that {{to create something}} truly new Belbo must look for occult connections in non-obvious contexts, such as by linking the Kabbalah to a car's spark plugs. (Belbo actually does this, and after some research concludes that the powertrain {{is a metaphor for}} the Tree of life.) Pleased with the results of the random text program, the three continue resorting to Abulafia whenever they reach a dead-end with their game.|$|E
25|$|Bracton's <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{of the law}} (as {{expressed}} in portions of his book) were slow in taking root in English law. The decline of Bracton's influence {{in the middle of}} the fourteenth century coincides with Parliament's first assertions of its powers. Already, it had come to be the principal and only legislative body, and the dominant interest in it was that of the common law lawyers. This had become a narrow profession. The Crown adopted the practice of appointing judges from the leading practitioners of the bar. These also controlled legal education. There was no liberal outlook on the law. To these, Bracton's treatise must have seemed impractical and academic. Justice became more centralised.|$|E
50|$|Many traditionalists further {{believe that}} errors have {{crept into the}} {{presentation}} and understanding of Catholic teachings {{since the time of}} the Council. They attribute the blame for this to <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the documents produced by the Second Vatican Council, to harmful post-conciliar pastoral decisions, to the text of the conciliar documents themselves, or to some combination of these.|$|R
5000|$|Prostitution in Japan {{has existed}} {{throughout}} the country's history. While the Anti-Prostitution Law of 1956 states that [...] "No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it," [...] loopholes, <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> and loose {{enforcement of the}} law have allowed the sex industry to prosper and earn an estimated 2.3 trillion yen ($24 billion) a year.|$|R

Followers of the Little Sparrow should merely be aware that Tethered Moon have painted her with broad strokes".|$|R
25|$|Uzbeks {{come from}} a {{predominantly}} Sunni Muslim background, usually of the Hanafi school, but variations exist between northern and southern Uzbeks. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, Uzbekistan's population is 96.3% Muslim. The majority of Uzbeks from the former USSR came to practice religion with a more <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> due to the official Soviet policy of atheism, while Uzbeks in Afghanistan and other countries to the south have remained more conservative adherents of Islam. However, with Uzbek independence in 1991 came an Islamic revival amongst segments of the population. People living {{in the area of}} modern Uzbekistan were first converted to Islam as early as the 8th century, as Arabs conquered the area, displacing the earlier faith of Manichaeism.|$|E
25|$|During {{the middle}} {{portion of the}} 20th century, there were a {{substantial}} number of synagogues which considered themselves Orthodox but did not have one. However, the Orthodox Union (OU), the main body of Modern Orthodox synagogues in the United States, adopted a policy of not accepting synagogues without mechitzot as new members, and strongly encouraging existing synagogues to adopt them. Men and women are generally not separated in most Conservative synagogues, although it is a permissible option within Conservative Judaism; some Conservative synagogues, particularly in Canada, have one or have separate seating for men and women without a physical partition. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, consistent with their view that traditional religious law is not mandatory in modern times and a more <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of gender roles, do not use mechitzot in their synagogues.|$|E
25|$|Calvin's {{concept of}} God and man {{contained}} strong elements of freedom that were gradually {{put into practice}} after his death, in particular {{in the fields of}} politics and society. After the successful fight for independence from Spain (1579), the Netherlands, under Calvinist leadership, became the freest country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, e.g. French Huguenots, English Independents (Congregationalists), and Jews from Spain and Portugal. The ancestors of philosopher Baruch Spinoza were Portuguese Jews. Aware of the trial against Galileo, René Descartes lived in the Netherlands, out of reach of the Inquisition. Pierre Bayle, a Reformed Frenchman, also felt safer in the Netherlands than in his home country. He was the first prominent philosopher who demanded tolerance for atheists. Hugo Grotius was able to publish a rather <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Bible and his ideas about natural law. Moreover, the Calvinist Dutch authorities allowed the printing of books that could not be published elsewhere, e.g. Galileo's Discorsi.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} glancing over these papers was, however, to enhance in the bishop's mind a growing disposition {{to minimize the}} importance of all dated and explicit evidences and arguments for orthodox beliefs, and to resort to vague symbolic and <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations,</b> {{and it was in}} this state that he came to his talk with Eleanor.|$|R
50|$|Prostitution {{has existed}} {{in some form}} {{throughout}} Japan's history. Despite the Anti-Prostitution Law of 1956, various legal loopholes, <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the law, and loose enforcement have allowed the sex industry to prosper and earn an estimated 2.3 trillion yen a year. Notably, the Anti-Prostitution Law makes prostituting oneself a crime whereas those who use {{the services of a}} prostitute are immune from prosecution.|$|R
2500|$|Some liberal Muslims see {{themselves}} as returning {{to the principles of}} the early Ummah and to a claimed ethical and pluralistic intent of the Quran. They distance themselves from some traditional and less <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> of Islamic law which they regard as culturally based and without universal applicability. The reform movement uses monotheism (tawhid) [...] "as an organizing principle for human society and the basis of religious knowledge, history, metaphysics, aesthetics, and ethics, as well as social, economic and world order".|$|R
500|$|While an {{immigrant}} himself {{and although he}} had been an ardent defender of the <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the naturalization law for a long time, in 1939 and in the wake of World War II, Cotillo advocated more stringent naturalization methods. Immigrants would be forced to pay the costs of an exhaustive investigation of their qualifications. He argued that there was a [...] "need for more hesitation in the granting of this charter of liberty to each and every applicant without a more thorough search of each and every applicant’s capacity to benefit from such a gift." [...] He also recommended revocation of citizenship when found guilty of fraud or other wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|Another central scene depicts {{death of}} the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Ulrich von Jungingen. Dressed in white Order garb and riding a white horse, von Jungingen is being killed by two {{anonymous}} figures, which historian of art Danuta Batorska identifies as [...] "savage looking Lithuanian peasants". One of them wields a Saint Maurice Spear (one of the objects with the {{claim to be the}} Spear of Destiny), which according to historian of art Jarosław Krawczyk implies that Matejko saw Jungingen's death as a retribution for taking arms against another Christian ruler. Next to the spearman is an executioner, who symbolizes the punishment Jungingen receives for the Order raids and pillages against the common folk. Those symbolic figures are one of many <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> that Matejko took with his painting; furthermore, modern scholarship indicates that he died in a cavalry duel, and not {{at the hands of a}} peasant.|$|E
500|$|After the Court {{issued its}} {{decision}} in Schmerber, a split of authority emerged in lower courts {{with regard to}} whether the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination prohibited {{the use of a}} suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt. The United States Supreme Court resolved this split in authority in South Dakota v. Neville, where the Court held that prosecutors could use a suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt, and the introduction of this evidence at trial does not violate the suspect's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Writing for the Court's majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor concluded that [...] "the state did not directly compel respondent to refuse the test" [...] and that a [...] "simple blood-alcohol test is so safe, painless, and commonplace" [...] a suspect would not feel coerced to refuse the test. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall, in which he argued that the Court in Schmerber intended to adopt a broad and <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Labour Minister for Posts & Telegraphs Conor Cruise O'Brien amended Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. He also {{issued a}} new Section 31 Order. O'Brien censored spokespersons for {{specific}} organisations, including the Sinn Féin political party, rather than specified content. This prevented RTÉ from interviewing Sinn Féin spokespersons under any circumstances, even where {{the subject was}} not related to the IRA campaign in Northern Ireland conflict. The changes eroded <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> by RTÉ of its censorship responsibilities, afforded by the original 1971 Order, and encouraged a process of illiberal interpretation.|$|R
50|$|After the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the {{government}} ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2010, although with certain reservations. The {{status of women}} in the country is complex, and partly dependent on their religion and on where they reside in the states and federal territories of Malaysia, factors which affect certain legal issues. The issue of women's rights in the country is subject to ideological disagreements between conservative and <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> of Islam, and between more secular forces.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as his}} {{political}} activism Sardinha was also noted as a somewhat controversial historian. Much of his work was given over to a historical revisionism that sought to counter <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> of history. Amongst his pet theories was that António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca had collaborated with France during his time as Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Peninsular War. Similarly he rejected the widely celebrated Portuguese discoveries as ushering {{in an era of}} capitalism and cosmopolitanism and thus flying in the face of his ruralist ideals.|$|R
500|$|Pretorius {{stepped down}} as President in November 1871. In the 1872 {{election}} Kruger's preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend Thomas François Burgers, a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the scriptures. He {{did not believe in}} the Devil, for example. Kruger publicly accepted Burgers's election, announcing at his inauguration that [...] "as a good republican" [...] he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new President. He particularly disliked Burgers's new education law, which restricted children's religious instruction to outside school hours—in Kruger's view an affront to God. This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of Commandant-General was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg, and for a time absented himself from public affairs.|$|E
500|$|It {{was held}} in the Malaysian Court of Appeal case of Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah (1998) that the term life in Article 5(1) of the Constitution is not limited to mere existence, but is a wide concept that must receive a broad and <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Likewise, {{personal}} liberty should be similarly interpreted, as any other approach to construction will necessarily produce an incongruous and absurd result. On the facts, personal liberty extended to the liberty of an aggrieved person to go to court and seek judicial review, and thus a statutory provision that sought to oust the power of judicial review was apparently inconsistent with this fundamental liberty. However, the apparent inconsistency could be resolved by permitting an ouster clause to immunize from judicial review only those administrative acts and decisions that are not infected by an error of law. Although the Federal Court reversed the Court of Appeal on this point, in the subsequent case Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor (2009) the Federal Court held that the provisions of the Constitution should be interpreted [...] "generously and liberally", and that [...] "on no account should a literal construction be placed on its language, particularly upon those provisions that guarantee to individuals the protection of fundamental rights". In its view: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{approach}} {{taken in}} Lo Pui Sang {{can be compared}} to the more <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of liberty in the United States and Malaysia. In the US Supreme Court case of Allgeyer v. Louisiana (1897), where a Louisiana statute was struck down on the ground that it violated an individual's right to contract, it was held that liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution meant not only the right of the citizen to be free from any physical restraint of his person, but also the right to freely enjoy all his faculties – that is, to be free to use them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or avocation; and for that purpose to enter into all contracts that may be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out those purposes. Liberty was accorded the same broad reading in the subsequent case Meyer v. Nebraska (1923), in which the Supreme Court held that a state statute mandating that English be the only language used in schools was unconstitutional as it infringed on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court stated that liberty ...|$|E
50|$|In Conservative Judaism, {{both men}} and women are ordained as rabbis and cantors. Conservative Judaism differs with Orthodoxy in that it sees Jewish Law as binding but also as subject to many <b>interpretations,</b> {{including}} more <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Academic requirements for becoming a rabbi are rigorous. First earn a bachelor's degree before entering rabbinical school. Studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism and most importantly the academic study of Bible, Talmud and Rabbinic Literature, Philosophy and Theology, Liturgy, Jewish History, and Hebrew Literature of all periods.|$|R

5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|R
500|$|The Colour of Magic is {{the second}} live-action {{adaptation}} of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, following the highly successful Hogfather, which was broadcast over Christmas 2006 {{to an audience of}} 2.6 million. After the success of Hogfather, Pratchett was easily persuaded to release the rights for The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. Vadim Jean was employed to adapt the two literary works into a three-hour, two-part screenplay. [...] While Pratchett was given [...] "carte blanche" [...] to [...] "turn up whenever [...] wanted", he was happy to see a more <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of his first two works than he had been for Hogfather. Speaking to Sky Magazine, Pratchett said that, [...] "There [...] not so much emotional baggage... riding on The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. It was just this book of mine that suddenly started selling incredibly well". Jean's main challenge was to streamline the plot and remove the many irrelevant, but highly amusing, tangents that are an iconic feature of Pratchett's work, without destroying the appeal of the books. [...] Jean said that [...] "there [...] a real danger, with this story, that one could strip out the 'Pratchett-ness'... I had to fight to keep [...] in". Pratchett was pleased with the final script, saying [...] "it wasn't the slaughter job I thought it would have to be", and [...] " [...] to keep the soul... it's still recognisably [...] book".|$|E

He then studied Oriental philology in Breslau and graduated in 1898. In the following decades, Dienemann's works were published in Jewish newspapers, as he published sermons and <b>Liberal</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the Torah. His lectures, held throughout Germany, testified to his more traditional attitude towards Judaism. He warned against nationalism and racism and pleaded for Zionism. From 1903 to 1919 he was a rabbi in Racibórz in Upper Silesia. In 1919, he was appointed rabbi by the Israelite community in Offenbach am Main and acted until 1938.|$|R
50|$|When {{the case}} reached the Supreme Court, the appellants argued that section 6(1) should be {{interpreted}} {{in the way it}} was meant, namely to guard against arbitrary exile and not extradition, which may not be a permanent removal and does not terminate Canadian citizenship. Hansard from 1981, just before the implentation of the Charter, was cited to reinforce this point. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court majority decision, written by Gerard La Forest, cited Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act (1985) to say the framers' intent was not binding in Charter case law. Rights can be given generous, <b>liberal</b> <b>interpretations,</b> and the right considered in this case was deemed to be important enough that limits would have to be justified.|$|R
