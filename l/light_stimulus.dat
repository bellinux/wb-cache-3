40|$|ABSTRACT Background : One of the {{negative}} impacts from the iron work industry is heat in working environment. The heat stress in the working environment gives the workers additional burden and may result an adverse health effect, especially the metabolism of  their body.   Consequently, it may couse fatigue that causes the decrease of their working productivity. The fatigue may be clearly observed {{on the basis of}} the measurement of reaction time of <b>light</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The study aims for determining factors related to reaction time of <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> of the employees exposed to heat in PT. Baja Kurnia Ceper, Klaten. Method : The study used  cross sectional approach. The samples of the study were 43 workers. It was conducted on January – May 2005. Data was collected using measurement of ambient temperature in the production room, measurement of the fatigue with the reaction time of <b>light</b> <b>stimuli,</b> counting of arterial pulse, measurement of body weihgt/high and interview with respondent. Data was analyzed by using Pearson Product Moment Corelation, Independent t-Test and Multiple Linier Regression Result : Result of the study indicated that ambient temperature was 30, 640 C, age was 34, 35 on average, nutritional status 19, 89 on average, working periode was 8, 23 on average, the pre-working of reaction time of <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> was 352, 46 mmdet on average, and the post-working of reaction time of <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> was 500, 78 mmdet on average, while 27 employees were in the condition of helath dan 16 employees were in the condition of not helath.

40|$|While {{connections}} between inhibitory interneurons are common circuit elements, {{it has been}} difficult to define their signal processing roles because of the inability to activate these circuits using natural stimuli. We overcame this limitation by studying {{connections between}} inhibitory amacrine cells in the retina. These interneurons form spatially extensive inhibitory networks that shape signaling between bipolar cell relay neurons to ganglion cell output neurons. We investigated how amacrine cell networks modulate these retinal signals by selectively activating the networks with spatially defined <b>light</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The roles of amacrine cell networks were assessed by recording their inhibitory synaptic outputs in bipolar cells that suppress bipolar cell output to ganglion cells. When the amacrine cell network was activated by large <b>light</b> <b>stimuli,</b> the inhibitory connections between amacrine cells unexpectedly depressed bipolar cell inhibition. Bipolar cell inhibition elicited by smaller <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> or electrically activated feedback inhibition was not suppressed because these stimuli did not activate the connections between amacrine cells. Thus the activation of amacrine cell circuits with large <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> can shape the spatial sensitivity of the retina by limiting the spatial extent of bipolar cell inhibition. Because inner retinal inhibition contributes to ganglion cell surround inhibition, in part, by controlling input from bipolar cells, these connections may refine the spatial properties of the retinal output.

40|$|AbstractHistorically, it {{was assumed}} that the light-evoked neural signals driving the human pupillary light reflex (PLR) {{originated}} exclusively from rod and cone photoreceptors. However, a novel melanopsin-containing photoreceptive cell class has recently been discovered in the mammalian retina. These intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) project to the pretectum, the retinorecipient area of the brain responsible for the PLR. This study was therefore designed to examine the relative contribution of rod, cone and the melanopsin photoresponses of ipRGCs to the human PLR. We establish that the melanopsin photoresponse of ipRGCs contributes significantly to the maintenance of half maximal pupilloconstriction in response to <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> of 30 s or longer, even at low photopic irradiances. Furthermore, we show that the melanopsin photoresponse contributes significantly to three-quarter maximal pupilloconstriction in response to <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> as short as 2 s. We also demonstrate that cone photoresponses driving pupilloconstriction adapt considerably and contribute little after 30 s, but rod photoresponses adapt less and contribute significantly to the maintenance of pupilloconstriction in response to steady-state <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> at irradiance levels which are below the threshold of the melanopsin photoresponse...|$|R

Arbor Acres fertile broiler eggs (n = 480) were randomly assigned to 3 incubation groups and exposed to continuous white light, green light, or a dark environment (control) from the first day to 19 d of incubation. The light sourced from LED lamps with the intensity of 30 lx at eggshell level. The results showed that either green or white <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> during incubation did not significantly affect the weight loss rate of fertile eggs, hatching time, hatchability, chick embryo, or body weight (BW), the weight percentage of heart, liver, and eyes, as well as obvious systematic abnormalities in eye weight, side-to-side, back-to-front, or corneal diameter from 15 d of embryogenesis to 6 d of posthatch (p> 0. 05). Compared with the dark condition, green <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> during incubation tended to increase feed intake (p = 0. 080), improved the BW gain of chicks during 0 to 6 day posthatch (p< 0. 05), and increased the percentage of pectoral muscle to the BW on 3 - and 6 -day-old chicks. In addition, embryos or chicks in green light had lower weight percentage of yolk retention on 19 d of embryogenesis and 1 d of posthatch in comparison to those in dark or white group (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that providing 30 lx green LED <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> during incubation has no detrimental effect on the development of eyes, heart and liver of embryos and hatchlings, but does have potential benefits in terms of enhancement of the chick growth during the early posthatch stages. In addition, the fertile broiler eggs stimulated with 30 lx green LED light during incubation does not cause an overheating effect...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study aims to {{identify}} which aspects of the pupil light reflex are most influenced by rods and cones independently by analyzing pupil recordings from different mouse models of photoreceptor deficiency. METHODS: One-month-old wild type (WT), rodless (Rho-/-), coneless (Cnga 3 -/-), or photoreceptor less (Cnga 3 -/-; Rho-/- or Gnat 1 -/-) mice were subjected to brief red and blue <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> of increasing intensity. To describe the initial dynamic response to light, the maximal pupillary constriction amplitudes and the derivative curve of the first 3 seconds were determined. To estimate the postillumination phase, the constriction amplitude at 9. 5 seconds after light termination {{was related to the}} maximal constriction amplitude. RESULTS: Rho-/- mice showed decreased constriction amplitude but more prolonged pupilloconstriction to all blue and red <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> compared to wild type mice. Cnga 3 -/- mice had constriction amplitudes similar to WT however following maximal constriction, the early and rapid dilation to low intensity blue light was decreased. To high intensity blue light, the Cnga 3 -/- mice demonstrated marked prolongation of the pupillary constriction. Cnga 3 -/-; Rho-/- mice had no pupil response to red light of low and medium intensity. CONCLUSIONS: From specific gene defective mouse models which selectively voided the rod or cone function, we determined that mouse rod photoreceptors are highly contributing to the pupil response to blue <b>light</b> <b>stimuli</b> but also to low and medium red stimuli. We also observed that cone cells mainly drive the partial rapid dilation of the initial response to low blue <b>light</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Thus photoreceptor dysfunction can be derived from chromatic pupillometry in mouse models...|$|R

At the time, most psychologists agreed with William James that fear (in this usage, synonymous with anxiety) was an instinctive response.

The subjects were attached to galvanic skin response recorders and to electrodes which could deliver an electric shock. They were then exposed to a <b>light</b> <b>stimulus</b> which was sometimes (randomly) followed by a shock. Mowrer discovered two unexpected phenomena. There was a substantial galvanic stress response to the first presentation of the <b>light</b> <b>stimulus,</b> before any shock had been administered.

The post-stimulus pupil size (PSPS) at the 6 th second following stimulus offset was the marker of intrinsic ipRGC activity.
