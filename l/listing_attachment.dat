40|$|This {{paper is}} based on Bowlby's {{attachment}} theory in the exploration of Christian pastoral care literature. Kirkpatrick and Granqvist account {{for the majority of}} previous research on the subject, however, not related to counselling or counselling literature. The selected pastoral literature, which is three books by each author: Liselotte J Andersson and Margareta Melin provide several possible associations with attachment theory. In the process, nonetheless, more literature has been studied than those reported here. This paper aims to investigate whether a relationship with God is given as an attachment relationship of the selected pastoral literature. The questions are divided into a descriptive and analytical one: "In what way are visible extension made of pastoral literature written by J Andersson and Melin?" and "Is God's relationship stated as an attachment relationship in pastoral literature? If yes, in what way?" The method used is controlled theory analysis, which means that attachment theory is the base from which the counselling literature is interpreted. It is an interpretative method whose goal, according Malterud (2014), is to “explore the meaning of the content of social and cultural phenomenon as it is experienced by those involved themselves in their natural context” (s. 31). It's more about understanding than explaining. The conclusion is that God's relationship in several ways is <b>listed</b> as <b>attachment</b> relationship, based on Bowlby's attachment theory. ...|$|R
