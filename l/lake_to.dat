5|$|The routing of NY28N was {{originally}} designated, but not signed, {{as part of}} legislative Route25 in 1908. In 1924, the portion of Route25 from Long <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> North Creek was designated {{as part of the}} signed NY10. The segment of former Route25 between Blue Mountain Lake and Long Lake became part of NY10A in the late 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering, the NY10A designation was eliminated, and NY10 was rerouted south of Long <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> follow the modern routing of NY30 south to Speculator. The former routing of NY10 between Long Lake and North Creek was then administratively redesignated as NY28N, which continued southward from Long <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> Blue Mountain Lake by way of an overlap with NY10.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{what is now}} NY17A from Greenwood <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> Goshen was {{designated}} as part of NY55, a connector between NY17 in Goshen and the New Jersey state line. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY55 was incorporated into two longer routes: NY210 from New Jersey to Greenwood Lake and NY17A from Greenwood <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> Goshen. The modern routing of NY17A between Greenfield Lake and Southfields was originally only part of NY210, which continued past NY17 and into Rockland County. NY17A was extended east to Southfields by 1933, completing the alternate loop of NY17 and creating an overlap with NY210.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{what is now}} NY210 was {{originally}} designated as part of NY55, a connector between NY17 in Goshen and the New Jersey state line south of the village of Greenwood Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY55 was incorporated into two longer routes: NY210 from New Jersey to Greenwood Lake and NY17A from Greenwood <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> Goshen. Initially, NY17A ended in Greenwood Lake while NY210 continued east to U.S. Route9W (US9W) {{on the banks of}} the Hudson River in West Haverstraw. From Greenwood <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> Southfields, NY210 was routed on modern NY17A. The route continued east from there along Southfields Road to the eastern fringe of Harriman State Park, at which point it headed to West Haverstraw via Willow Grove and Letchworth Village roads, Suffern Lane, and Railroad Avenue.|$|E

5|$|NY28N was {{assigned}} as a suffixed {{route of the}} extended NY28 in the 1930 renumbering. The concurrency that runs from Blue Mountain <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> Long Lake was originally part of NY10, which used to occupy all of modern NY30 north of Speculator. When NY10 was truncated , the highway became concurrent with NY30 instead.|$|E
5|$|NY30 {{runs through}} the Adirondacks, {{accessing}} communities such as Speculator, Blue Mountain Lake, and Tupper Lake as a scenic byway named the Adirondack Trail. From Wells to Speculator, NY30 is concurrent to NY8, then with NY28 from Indian <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> Blue Mountain Lake. Between Blue Mountain Lake and Long Lake, NY30 is concurrent with the western third of NY28N.|$|E

5|$|Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby feed {{a stream}} that is {{believed}} to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes {{the creation of the}} <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged the labor of surrounding villagers to dig the lake {{at the site of the}} spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing zebu at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into the <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> inaugurate it.|$|E

Jason escapes {{from the bottom of}} Crystal <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> resume his hunt for Ash, but is captured by the U.S. government. Freddy helps him escape and appoints him the general of his Deadite army, using the Necronomicon to heal his accumulated injuries and decomposition; it removes his natural deformities in the process. At the climax of the story, Jason battles his nemesis Tommy Jarvis and his great-niece Stephanie Kimble; Stephanie impales him before Tommy decapitates him with a shard of glass. Jason's soul is then absorbed by Freddy, who uses it to increase his own power.|$|E
5|$|A story {{tells of}} a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into the lake and was {{astonished}} {{to see that the}} Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.|$|E
5|$|Additional realignments were {{completed}} by the MSHD to move US2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet. From there east, it was numbered just M‑48, removing US2 from a concurrency. Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M‑117. The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the <b>lake,</b> <b>to</b> take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E

Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes.

5|$|At Tupper Lake, {{the route}} serves {{a cluster of}} {{recreational}} buildings at its intersection with Warren Point Road, a private drive leading to Warren Point. Here, NY421 turns southward, running along the lake shore to nearby Paradise Point Road, which leads east to Paradise Point and the lakeside Veterans' Mountain Camp. After Paradise Point Road, the highway follows a winding, southeasterly course along Tupper Lake, passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth. NY421 follows the <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> its southern tip, where the route ends at an intersection with NY30 {{just west of the}} St. LawrenceFranklin county line.|$|E
