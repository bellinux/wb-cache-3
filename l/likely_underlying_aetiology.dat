30|$|Facial {{swelling}} is {{a common}} clinical scenario in the paediatric setting, associated with a diverse range of possible causes. The <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> ranges from congenital lesions to infective and inflammatory conditions, and various other benign or malignant masses [1].|$|R
40|$|Introduction or background: Many {{tests are}} {{available}} for the investigation of patients with heart failure. The identification of the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> of ventricular dysfunction is crucial as early treatment may limit or even reverse myocardial abnormalities. Sources of data: This article describes cardiac radionuclide imaging technique...|$|R
30|$|Ultrasonography {{is useful}} for {{identifying}} haemobilia and potential <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiologies.</b> Haemobilia forms avascular tubular lesions of hyper reflectivity filling and expanding the biliary ducts and minimally mobile, hyper-reflective, avascular masses within the gallbladder. With these finding, serial ultrasound showing decreasing reflectivity over time is highly suggestive of haemobilia.|$|R
50|$|Treatment is {{dependent}} on the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology.</b> Organic causes may include systemic or ocular medications, brain stem injury, or active ocular inflammation such as uveitis. Functional pseudomyopia is managed though modification of working conditions, an updated refraction, typically involving a reduction of a myopic prescription to some lower myopic prescription, or through appropriate ocular exercises.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of late-onset {{isolated}} thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency in a woman who presented with oligomenorrhoea and secondary hyperprolactinaemia. Hypothalamic and pituitary radiology and function was otherwise normal. The <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> of this condition {{is thought to be}} due to an inborn defect in the thyrotroph and treatment is with standard thyroid replacement therapy...|$|R
40|$|Necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC) is {{a devastating}} disease that affects premature neonates. Associated mortality {{has not changed}} appreciably {{over the past several}} decades. The <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> of NEC remains elusive, although bacterial colonization of the gut, formula feeding, and perinatal stress have been implicated as risk factors. We aimed to characterize clinical indicators predicting mortality from NEC...|$|R
30|$|Air/gas is {{normally}} seen in some body structures, {{such as in}} paranasal sinuses, and in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. However, when present in subcutaneous tissues, cervical, mediastinal, retroperitoneal, extraperitoneal abdomen and pelvis spaces, involving muscular fibres or interstitial tissues, it is abnormal, indicating a “pathological process”, and represents a challenge {{to search for the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology.</b>|$|R
50|$|In short, men {{are less}} likely to seek or accept {{appropriate}} treatment, more likely to be treated for symptoms of BPD such as substance abuse rather than BPD itself (furthermore, the symptoms of BPD and ASPD may derive from a similar <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology)</b> and possibly men are simply more likely to commit suicide prior to diagnosis.|$|R
30|$|Ectopic air/gas {{represents}} {{a challenge to}} the radiologist. The search for the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> may be tricky, since air can be detected almost anywhere (away from its source). Continuity is described between neck, mediastinum, retroperitoneum and the pelvis on the basis of anatomy and fascial-defined spaces; vascular perforations of the fasciae and muscle insertions also constitute potential conduits between compartments.|$|R
40|$|TX- 1 - 42 Pre-eclampsia {{occurs in}} 2 - 10 % of pregnancies {{and is a}} leading cause of {{maternal}} and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

40|$|Two {{cases of}} subfoveal choroidal {{neovascular}} membranes (CNVM) {{in the absence}} of other pathology are described in two young patients who were successfully treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. The natural history of idiopathic CNVM and factors influencing the decision to treat using various options are discussed. Current experience with use of anti-VEGF is also outlined. Lastly, the importance of timely referral for thorough investigations to exclude <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> and consideration for treatment is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the utilization patterns and effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) for treatment of spasticity in clinical practice. Design: An international, multicentre, prospective, observational study at selected sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patients: Adult patients with newly diagnosed or established focal spasticity, including those who had previously received treatment with onabotulinum-toxin A. Methods: Patients were treated with onabotulinumtoxinA, approximately every 12 weeks, according to their physician’s usual clinical practice over a period of up to 96 weeks, with a final follow-up interview at 108 weeks. Patient, physician and caregiver data were collected. Results: Baseline characteristics are reported. Of the 745 patients enrolled by 75 healthcare providers from 54 sites, 474 patients had previously received onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for spasticity. Lower limb spasticity was more common than upper limb spasticity, with stroke the most common <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology.</b> The Short-Form 12 (SF- 12) health survey scores showed that patients’ spasticity had a greater perceived impact on physical rather than mental aspects. Conclusion: The data collected in this study will guide the development of administration strategies to optimize the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA in the management of spasticity of various <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that certain {{cardiovascular}} and metabolic risk factors tend to cluster together. For example, in the 1940 s the French clinician, Vague, described the diabetic and atherogenic risk associated with android (upper body) obesity. The relatively recent concept of a metabolic syndrome suggested that the clustering represents a discrete entity due to a single <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> (insulin resistance). Yet, despite several definitions and its own International Classification of Diseases code its validity and utility remains unclear. The evidence does not fully support the existence of a single <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology,</b> and most, but not all, evidence suggests that the syndrome as currently defined appears to have little value in predicting cardiovascular disease risk over other approaches that consider individual risk factors. At present there is no specific treatment for the syndrome other than targeting the individual risk factors. It is concluded that at this time its main utility is as a reminder to the clinician that certain risk factors tend to cluster, and as an indicator of the public health importance of the risk factor clustering associated with obesity and physical inactivity...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} 15 {{patients}} (10 boys, 5 girls) with clinical anophthalmos.

30|$|Knowledge of {{the normal}} {{axillary}} anatomy aids in determining the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> of an axillary mass. The differential diagnosis of an axillary mass is broad, including skin lesions, infections, haematoma, lymphadenopathy (hyperplastic, inflammatory, neoplastic or metastatic), accessory breast tissue, fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change, post-operative fluid collections, primary breast cancer and intramuscular neoplasms. For most cases, imaging evaluation entails diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound. If intervention is warranted, FNA or core needle biopsies are safe and accurate methods for diagnosis and for guiding the management of an axillary mass.|$|R
40|$|Neuropathic pain is {{initiated}} or {{caused by}} a primary lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system. A consensus regarding the classification and assessment of neuropathic pain {{has yet to be}} reached. The diseases responsible for neuropathic pain are diverse; the clinical presentation of pain can vary widely between individuals despite the same <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology.</b> Common features of neuropathic pain include spontaneous and evoked pains. Investigations may help to identify evidence of nerve dysfunction but it cannot be assumed that it is necessarily the cause of their pain...|$|R
40|$|Acute liver {{failure is}} a complex {{multisystemic}} illness that evolves quickly after a catastrophic insult to the liver leading {{to the development of}} encephalopathy. The <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> and the pace of progression strongly influence the clinical course. The commonest causes are paracetamol, idiosyncratic drug reactions, hepatitis B, and seronegative hepatitis. The optimal care is multidisciplinary and up to half of the cases receive liver transplants, with survival rates around 75 %– 90 %. Artificial liver support devices remain unproven in efficacy in acute liver failure...|$|R
40|$|Restrictive {{cardiomyopathy}} (RCM) {{is defined}} {{on the basis}} of the haemodynamic finding of restrictive ventricular physiology. However, restrictive ventricular pathophysiology is also a feature of other subtypes of cardiomyopathy, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Clinically and aetiologically, there is an overlap between RCM and HCM with restrictive physiology. However, the clinical distinction between these two entities can be an important pointer towards the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology.</b> This review highlights the importance of the recognition of the clinical phenotype as the first step in the classification of cardiomyopathies...|$|R
30|$|There {{are various}} <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiologies</b> for {{pathology}} of the radial nerve as described above. Patients presenting with symptoms of radial nerve palsy have been conventionally diagnosed using clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Use of high-resolution ultrasound and MRI will {{usher in a}} new era of a multimodality approach in diagnosis and treatment of nerve pathologies. It allows direct visualisation of the nerve with every anatomical detail which will help in better clinical decision making. This pictorial review describes the hallmark of imaging findings in a wide spectrum of radial nerve pathologies.|$|R

40|$|Tooth wear is a {{condition}} that affects a substantial cohort of dental patients. It has a measurable impact on patients’ satisfaction, and overall quality of life. Recently, with growing evidence, {{our understanding of the}} aetiology, progression, and management of tooth wear has evolved. The paper argues that pathological tooth wear should not be solely considered as a dental condition, but rather a dental manifestation of other mental and medical disorders. As such, successful management of tooth wear, and its <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology,</b> requires a holistic, multidisciplinary management approach, involving dental, medical, and mental healthcare providers...|$|R

30|$|Given {{the vagaries}} of rebound growth, it is not {{possible}} to anticipate the likelihood of recurrent deformity. Therefore, I typically remove the plate when the mechanical axis is neutral. Depending upon the age and <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> of the deformity, rebound growth may still occur. Continued periodic follow-up and parental education are strongly recommended; the parents are easily informed about how to monitor alignment by observing the intercondylar distance (varus) or intermalleolar distance (valgus). If the mechanical axis drifts back out of the physiologic range — usually evident within 12 months of plate removal — guided growth may be repeated.|$|R
40|$|Eosinophilic {{myocarditis}} (EM) {{represents a}} rare form of myocardial inflammation with very heterogeneous aetiology. In developed countries, {{the most prevalent}} causes of EM are hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, as well as hematological diseases leading to eosinophilia. The disease may have a variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic forms to life-threatening conditions. Most patients with EM have marked eosinophilia in peripheral blood. Endomyocardial biopsy needs to be performed in most cases {{in order to establish}} a definitive diagnosis of EM.

40|$|Extract] Thrombocytopaenia {{is defined}} as a {{reduction}} in the number of circulating platelets, the normal circulating platelet count being 150 - 400 x 10 ^ 9 /L. It is the most common cause of abnormal bleeding. Like anaemia, thrombocytopaenia itself is not a diagnosis, but rather a manifestation of another underlying disease process. In the emergency department setting, thrombocytopaenia may present as an incidental finding on a routine blood count or may be diagnosed in the context of abnormal bleeding. In most cases, the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> can be determined by a careful history and physical examination combined with interpretation of the blood count...|$|R
30|$|Volume {{overload}} {{conditions such}} as long-standing aortic or mitral regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy lead to complex forms of adaptation resulting in eccentric LV hypertrophy. The LVWT and LVWM are increased, but the RWM is lower than normal due to ventricular dilation. MRI can quantify the regurgitation {{as well as its}} secondary effects on the ventricle including abnormal chamber size and function. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the LV is dilated and there is global systolic dysfunction. A nonischemic pattern of LGE may be seen, in a mid-myocardial or subepicardial distribution depending on the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> [36]. A linear mid-myocardial pattern has been described in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [36].|$|R
40|$|As our {{understanding}} of the <b>underlying</b> <b>aetiology</b> of hypertension is far from adequate, over 90 % of patients with hypertension receive a diagnosis of essential hypertension. This non-specific diagnosis leads to suboptimal therapeutics and a major problem with non-compliance. Understanding the normal control of blood pressure (BP) is, hence, important for {{a better understanding of the}} disease. This review attempts to unravel the present understanding of BP control. The local mechanisms of BP control, the neural mechanisms, renal-endocrine mechanisms, and a variety of other hormones that have a bearing in normal BP control are discussed and the possible role in the pathophysiology is alluded to...|$|R
