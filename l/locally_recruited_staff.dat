40|$|The {{independence}} of International Civil Servants (ICSs) from {{their country of}} origin is often presumed but rarely accounted for empirically. In order to address this gap, we investigate whether ICSs face conflicts between national and international interests and which conditions are more conducive to the manifestation of this conflict in International Organizations. We adopt a mixed-methods design, including a survey with 1400 respondents working in two United Nations humanitarian organizations, followed by semi-structured interviews to a purposive sample of respondents. The findings show that such conflicts matter for ICSs, hierarchical grade has stronger explanatory power than the other factors, and the higher the level in the International Organization, the less frequently ICSs face conflict. The qualitative analysis explains this result by pointing to the effects of socialization among ICSs but also by shedding light on a related effect: dilution of national identity, {{as well as on the}} implications of <b>locally</b> <b>recruiting</b> lower-level <b>staff...</b>|$|R

The document includes a transmittal {{letter from the}} CGIAR Executive Secretary to the CGIAR Chairman, the response of ILRAD's Board of Directors, and a transmittal from the panel. The panel's primary concern was ILRAD's progress in addressing the serious managerial problems described in the 1980 Quinquennial Review. Panel members found a 'remarkable recovery,' in which confidence had been restored, relations between the Director and Board of Directors dramatically improved, and administration improved. ILRAD was {{now in a position}} to carry out its mandate purposefully and effectively. The panel recommended greater delegation of management responsibility to project leaders and appointment of two program coordinators for trypanosomiasis and theileriosis to assist the center's Director of Research. They suggested creation of a Research Review Committee to examine planning and implementation, and interact with the Board's Program Committee in setting research policy. The report urged the Program Committee to pay less attention to the details of laboratory work and more to research strategy and policy. The Financial Committee should play a stronger role in the budget process, in the evaluation of and follow-up on external reviews, and in formulating investment policy. The panel urged formalization of the financial management role of the Director of Administration, and giving more responsibility to middle management. It also recommended expanding and improving facilities including those provided to other centers, lengthening the tenure of senior positions, and training for both international and <b>locally</b> <b>recruited</b> <b>staff.</b> More consultation by management with staff was encouraged.

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} and treatment of malaria cases is one of the basic elements of the current global malaria control strategy. In order to provide this service to people in rural areas {{there is a need for}} new cost-effective approaches. To ensure that such new approaches are acceptable to the target communities, it is important to know the rationale for people's malaria treatment-seeking behavior. The present study provides insights into the reasons for people's preferences for different types of healthcare facilities and describes variation of these preferences within a rural community in Sri Lanka. The study reports on the experiences with the establishment of a village health facility and its effect on the treatment-seeking behavior of the population. After the introduction of the village treatment center it quickly took over the role of main provider for {{diagnosis and}} treatment of malaria from the government facilities. The treatment center did not improve the response time in seeking treatment for young children, but the delay for adults was reduced by 1 - 2 days. Mothers with small children often preferred the government facilities since they wanted a more qualified opinion than available from the <b>locally</b> <b>recruited</b> <b>staff</b> of the village treatment center. The treatment center significantly reduced the stress and discomfort experienced by the elderly and handicapped segment of the community. The study indicated that the effective catchment area of a village treatment center will be influenced by the degree of initial support from key individuals in the communities, the selection procedure and training of assistants, and the history of the relationships between different villages to be served by the center. The government health services and communities across the dry zone of Sri Lanka could benefit substantially from the establishment of more village treatment centers. To ensure the long-term sustainability of these type of facilities it is necessary to assess the feasibility of charging a user fee and establishing multi-purpose clinics. Government policies and administrative procedures will need to be adjusted to make the successful operation of village treatment centers possible.

40|$|A unique {{forested area}} survives on the Usambara {{mountains}} of north-eastern Tanzania. These forests have been {{isolated from the}} Guinea-Congo rainforests {{for a very long}} period and, as a result, 25 - 30 % of plant species are endemic to the area. The forests are also home to several endemic birds, mammals and a remarkably large number of amphibians. However, many of these plant and animal species are threatened with extinction by extensive forest clearance for agriculture and timber extraction. Much of the forest was cleared in the colonial period, firstly for coffee and later for tea cultivation. Recently the tea estates have suffered from poor management and many people have abandoned work on them and have cleared forest land to practice low-grade agriculture. A particular problem has come with the growing of cardamom. The ground storey of the forest is cleared to cultivate the cardamom under the canopy. This cultivation prevents regeneration of the forest trees and when, after seven or eight years, the yields of the cardamom begin to decline, the people clear the canopy trees to plant maize, sugar cane and cassava. Large areas of forest are being destroyed in this way. Further problems have come from pit-sawers who illegally cut timber in the forests for sale, both in near-by markets and across the border in Kenya. The forest had also been the subject of industrial logging by a parastatal cooperation but this was stopped recently {{when it became clear that}} the logging was unsustainable. Since 1986 IUCN has had a project in the Usambaras funded by the EEC, which has been attempting to give more effective protection to the forest, whilst helping the local people to develop agricultural systems which will be less destructive. The project is based on a process of consultation with local communities. A <b>locally</b> <b>recruited</b> <b>staff</b> member is assigned to each of the thirteen villages in the East Usambaras to encourage the formation of a village development committee. Through the village coordinators the project is able to engage in a dialogue with the villagers, both to ascertain their needs and aspirations and to explain to them the long term environmental problems that will result if the forests are lost. The village committees have been encouraged to come up with their own ideas on solutions to the problem and if these ideas are felt by the project staff to be viable, support is available to help implement them. This support takes the form of the provision of agricultural tools, tree seeds and seedlings, plastic bags for tree growing, earth moving equipment to build fish ponds and fish fry to stock them, and help with transporting building materials and agricultural produce. Attempts have been made to bring the artisanal pitsawing of timber under proper control. The intention was to license villagers to pit-saw timber in forests adjacent to their village land. So far the difficulties in preventing outsiders from logging the forests have been so great that it has been found necessary to put a total ban on all timber extraction. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the forest could support a moderate yield of valuable timber, which is much in demand in local towns; this could provide an incentive to the villagers to maintain forest areas. In its first three years of operation the villagers working with the project have planted 100 kilometres of boundary strips around the forest reserves and 30 hectares or communal plantations, a total of half a million trees. Five central and 168 village tree nurseries have been established. The project has helped villagers put in contour strips on a thousand farms, over an average of 1 - 2 hectares per farm and 40 fish ponds have been constructed and stocked. More importantly/here have been changes in the attitudes of the farmers. They are adopting contour terracing on a wide scale and many farmers have started to plant cloves, pepper and coffee as a source of cash. The forests of the East Usamabaras are still very much under threat. The number of people in the area is simply too great for the land resources available. But working with the villagers has resulted in increased sensitivity to conservation problems, law enforcement is much better tolerated and there is now a genuine effort being made on the part of everybody, from the small farmer to the national administration, to find ways of reconciling the needs of the peoples of me Usambaras and the need to conserve its rich flora and fauna. A unique forested area survives on the Usambara mountains of north-eastern Tanzania. These forests have been isolated from the Guinea-Congo rainforests for a very long period and, as a result, 25 - 30 % of plant species are endemic to the area. The [...] ...|$|E
