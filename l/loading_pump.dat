Aimed at the working condition, energy saving torque loading test program of power head was put forward and mathematical and simulation models of hydraulic energy closed-loop torque loading system were established {{in order to make}} an analysis of torque loading system. Combined with bond graph and state equations of torque loading system with single pump, effect of the logical relationship of discharge between the driving motor and <b>loading</b> <b>pump</b> and the relationship between the adjusting proportion of series and parallel pressure on the torque loading system was analyzed because both hydraulic flow and pressure can have an influence on the system stability. It proves that the torque loading system is stable when the adjusting proportion of series pressure is larger than that of the parallel pressure.

40|$|Abstract. By {{analyzing}} two old {{forms of}} hydraulic winch test benches (Traditional hydraulic winch test bench and throttling hydraulic winch test bench), the new hydraulic winch test bench applies a new energy recycle technology and avoids enormous energy consumption.

It also analyzes the working principles of the new test bench’s obverse processes. The displacement of the <b>loading</b> <b>pump</b> should adapt to the change of the diameter ratio of the main drum and the auxiliary drum, so we use one <b>loading</b> <b>pump</b> and limit its displacement to realize energy recycle. Furthermore, the new test bench’s experiment is carried out to evaluate the efficiency of this test bench’s energy saving rate.

40|$|Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the {{terminal}} enzyme of the respiratory chain, reduces oxygen to water {{and uses the}} released energy to pump protons across a membrane. Here, we use kinetic master equations to explore the energetic and kinetic control of proton pumping in CcO. We construct models consistent with thermodynamic principles, the structure of CcO, experimentally known proton affinities, and equilibrium constants of intermediate reactions. The resulting models are found to capture key properties of CcO, including the midpoint redox potentials of the metal centers and the electron transfer rates. We find that coarse-grained models with two proton sites and one electron site can pump one proton per electron against membrane potentials exceeding 100 mV. The high pumping efficiency of these models requires strong electrostatic couplings between the proton <b>loading</b> (<b>pump)</b> site and the electron site (heme a), and kinetic gating of the internal proton transfer. Gating is achieved by enhancing the rate of proton transfer from the conserved Glu- 242 to the pump site on reduction of heme a, consistent with the predictions of the water-gated model of proton pumping. The model also accounts for the phenotype of D-channel mutations associated with loss of pumping but retained turnover. The fundamental mechanism identified here for the efficient conversion of chemical energy into an electrochemical potential should prove relevant also for other molecular machines and novel fuel-cell designs...|$|E

40|$|In many {{turbopump}} applications it {{is desirable}} to run the pump at the highest possible speed to minimise the size and weight of the unit and facilitate matching with a drive turbine. Frequently, a limit on rotational speed is imposed by pump cavitation with its associated deterioration in performance and structural damage. For conventional single sided centrifugal pumps cavitation occurs when the suction specific speed [...] . exceeds 8 - 10, 000 (1) so that for such pumps the maximum rotational speed without cavitation {{is determined by the}} flow and the suction head available. To permit operation at higher speeds an inducer or boost pump may be mounted in front of the main pump (f ig. 1). A typical axial inducer is simply a very lightly <b>loaded</b> axial <b>pump</b> which raises the pressure of the fluid sufficiently to avoid cavitation in the main pump. It has been found possible to operate inducers successfully at suction specific speeds up to 30, 000, so that considerable reductions in total pump weight can be achieved when they are employed. Of course, since the inducer is simply a lightly <b>loaded</b> <b>pump</b> which is capable of handling a cavitating fluid, the functions of inducer and main pump may be combined by designing the main pump so that the inlet is lightly loaded. However, it is not always convenient to do this and in many applications conventional centrifugal pumps are still used, preceded by a separate inducer. The objective of this report is to put the design of such inducers on a rational basis by developing a method of calculating blade shapes for the optimum pressure distribution.
