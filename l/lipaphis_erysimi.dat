30|$|Host plant {{seems to}} have a direct {{influence}} on prey preference and prey suitability in ladybirds (Ferrer et al. 2008; Giorgi et al. 2009). Apart from nutrition, certain host plants provide an ecological refuge to the aphids by chemically protecting them from their natural enemies (Chaplin-Kramer et al. 2011). Toxic plant allelochemicals deteriorate the aphid quality and make them unsuitable for predators (Pratt 2008). However, continuous rearing of aphidophagous ladybirds on toxic prey for generations enables the offspring to easily thrive on the toxic prey than the nutritious ones (Rana et al. 2002). Mixing toxic aphids with nutritious ones perhaps compliments the nutrient-deficiency of the former and cumulatively enhances the fitness of ladybirds (Nedved and Salvucci 2008; Guroo et al. 2017). Mustard aphid, <b>Lipaphis</b> <b>erysimi</b> (Kaltenbach), infesting Brassica campestris L. is known to decrease the fitness of certain ladybirds (Omkar and Mishra 2005), as it sequesters toxic allelochemicals from the host plant (Ahuja et al. 2010).|$|E

Significantly higher aphid reduction was recorded under these treatments over thecontrol without any phytotoxic effect and found safe to natural enemies of mustard aphid and honeybee. Mostfavourable cost-benefit ratio was obtained under the treatment i. e. dimethoate 30 EC @ 300 g a. i/ha (1 : 38) followed by neem seed kernel extract @ 5 % (1 : 18), onion extract @ 5 % (1 : 17), cow urine @ 50 litre/ha (1 : 11),Beauveria bassiana @ 5 g per litre of water (1 : 10), Verticillium lecanii @ 5 g per litre of water (1 : 10), Metarhiziumanisopliae @ 5 g per litre of water (1 : 8), tobacco extract @ 5 % (1 : 6) and water spray (1 : 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Aphid survey {{has been}} {{conducted}} since 1988 to April, 1997. Aphids were collected from colonies and were mounted on microscopic slides for identification. The purpose of this report is to mainpulate the new in aphids recorded {{for the first time}} in the world. Arabian Peninsula and Saudi Arabia. Two new species were found in Asir region. Sitobion asirun was collected from upper leaf surface of Phragmanthera regularis and Pseudaphis arabica from Pennisetum setaceum. Aloe vera was recorded as a new host for A. gossypii and A. craccivora. Prosopis sp. was recorded as a new host for Brachyungius harmalae. P. regularis was recorded as a new host for A. gossypii. Five aphid species were recorded {{for the first time in}} the Arabian Peninsula. These aphids are: Aphis armoraciae, A. hellerislambersi, Dysaphis emicis, Hyalopterus amygdali, Paraschizaphis rozazevedoi. Fourteen aphid species were recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia: A. solanella, A. affinis, Hyalopterus pruni, Schizaphis rotundiventris, Acyrthosiphon kondoi, Aulacorthum solani, Brachycaudus rumexicolens, Dysaphis apiifolia, D. foeniculus, Metopolophium festucae cerealium, Nasonovia ribis-nigri, Sitobion fragariae, Cinara maghrebica, Peterochloroides persicae. Oviviparous females of <b>Lipaphis</b> <b>erysimi</b> were recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabi...|$|E
40|$|Aphids in unsprayed canola (Brassica napus Linnaeus) {{fields in}} Isfahan {{province}} (central Iran) were sampled for two growing seasons, 2011 - 2013. Sampling unit {{was a whole}} plant and 20 plants were sampled weekly. In the laboratory, heat-extraction and sub-sampling techniques were used to estimate the density of aphids. To determine the relationship between population growth rate of the aphids and degree-days, linear regressions were done between log of aphid density and accumulated degree-days. Homogeneity tests were done using pairwise comparisons between slopes. Aphids' preference for upper (10 - 15 cm upper part of stem) and lower (the rest of stem) parts of the plant was analyzed using Student’s t-test. Aphid fauna included: Cabbage Aphid [CA; Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) ], Green Peach Aphid [GPA; Myzus persicae (Sulzer) ], and Turnip Aphid [TA; <b>Lipaphis</b> <b>erysimi</b> (Kaltenbach) ]. The GPA developed small population in comparison with CA and TA and was occasionally found. The population density of CA and GPA tended to show two peaks, and during flower initiation, population began to decrease. The average population growth rates of GPA and CA were 0. 001 and 0. 003...|$|E
