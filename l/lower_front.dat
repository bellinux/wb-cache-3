5|$|On a 12-battle victory streak, Razer {{fought in}} the {{eleventh}} heat of the fifth series of Robot Wars. Therein, it defeated BigNipper, Widow's Revengea machine reportedly constructed by the Razer team's wivesand Rick to reach its first series semi-final. Their next opponent was Spawn Again, which was armed with a pneumatic flipper. Equipped with a new <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> wedge, Razer {{was able to get}} underneath Spawn Again and crush it until it broke down. In the quarter finals, Razer faced S3, a cylindrical robot with a vertical spinning blade. Razer's arm sliced into S3's weapon controls, stopping the disc, which allowed Razer to dominate the fight and win on a judges' decision.|$|E
5|$|The third design, by George Ivatt, {{initially}} was Type 'C1' {{and it was}} paired with the three locomotives Nos. 6253–6255. It was partially riveted and resembled a Type 'A' at its front end and a Type 'B' at the rear. The design was quickly followed by Type 'C2', which differed from the 'C1' in {{that it had a}} <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> edge and was fitted with Timken roller bearings. Only two 'C2's were built and they were coupled to the last two of the class, Nos. 6256 and 6257.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{formula is}} , {{as in all}} lemurids. The toothcomb—a comblike {{structure}} formed by the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> teeth, characteristic of lemurs and lorisoids—is {{similar to that of}} other lemurids. The two halves of the mandible (lower jaw) do not fuse at the mandibular symphysis. However, there are some differences in tooth morphology from the living brown and ring-tailed lemurs, similar to those between the ruffed lemurs and the other genera. In Pachylemur, the talonid basin (a basin at the back end of the lower molars) is more elongate, and it is not lined by an entoconid cusp. In the first two upper molars, the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) is expanded towards the front. The two species differ in details of tooth morphology. P.insignis had narrower lower premolars and molars, and the buccal (outer) cusps on these teeth are located to the front of their lingual counterparts. Relative to the ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur has more massive jaws and larger molars.|$|E

5|$|The large orbit {{was shaped}} like an {{imperfect}} ellipse (with the longest axis {{from front to}} back), and faced {{to the side and}} slightly forward. The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the occipital condyle was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The nasal {{openings}} {{were large}} and faced frontwards. The nasal bone was thick, heavily sculpted, {{and had a}} convex profile. It formed a boss (shield) on the middle top of the skull together with the frontal bone. The <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> of the premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was rugose and thickened. A small foramen (hole) was present in the suture between the premaxillae, leading into the nasal cavity, and possibly connected to the Jacobson's organ (an olfactory sense organ). The maxilla was short and deep, and probably contained a sinus. The maxilla {{had a series of}} foramina that corresponded with each tooth position there, and these functioned as passages for erupting replacement teeth. The mandible articulated with the skull below the back of the orbit. The tooth-bearing part of the lower jaw was long, with the part behind being rather short. Though not preserved, the presence of a predentary bone is indicated by facets {{at the front of the}} lower jaw. Like other pachycephalosaurs, it would have had a small beak.|$|E

25|$|With the {{diffuser}} change, the {{new rules}} {{in place for the}} 2009 season required cars to have narrower and higher rear wings and wider and <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> wings, designed to reduce air disturbance for following cars and hence make overtaking easier. Slick tyres were also re-introduced in the 2009 Formula One season, having been absent since , this said to increase tyre grip by about 20%.|$|E
25|$|Spitting cobras {{of the genera}} Naja and Hemachatus, when irritated or threatened, may eject streams or a {{spray of}} venom a {{distance}} of 4 to 8 feet.

Spitters may spit repeatedly and still be able to deliver a fatal bite.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Crawley buses feature a light blue base {{with a dark}} blue roof which swoops down at the front. It also has a white stripe separating the roof from the base, and a light blue lower dash panel. The Fastway livery is a silver base with navy blue cantrail panels and a navy blue <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> panel. Some older buses feature light blue with a dark blue roof and skirt panels along with a dark blue lower dash panel.|$|E
50|$|Most bus {{manufacturers}} {{achieve a}} low floor height by making rear-engined rear-wheel drive buses with independent front suspension, {{so that no}} axle is needed to pass under {{the floor of the}} front part of passenger compartment, or a <b>lowered</b> <b>front</b> axle. Some full low-floor buses also have a lowered rear axle, while the rear axle is not an issue on a low-entry bus.|$|R

25|$|FIA President Max Mosley {{announced}} dramatic rule {{changes for}} the 2009 season {{in a bid to}} improve the spectacle of the sport, with the cars undergoing major changes in an effort to increase overtaking. The design changes significantly altered the design of the cars, incorporating wider and <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> wings, taller and narrower rear wings, and a reduction on aerodynamic bodywork. Also introduced were slick tyres and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems, as well as implementing cost-cutting measures in a response to the rising costs of competing.|$|E
25|$|The scapula {{had a large}} {{rectangular}} acromion, with a sharp upper corner, on the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> edge. The more narrow coracoid had {{a rounded}} lower edge. Both the upper arm and ulna and radius (lower arm bones) are also {{comparable to those of}} Stegosaurus. The tuberosity of the rear humerus serving as attachment for the musculus triceps brachii is well-developed but the vertical ridge running from it to below is not. In the pelvis, the pubic bone had a deep front part, the processus praepubicus, with a little upward projecting process as seen in Dacentrurus; the rear shaft had a lightly expanded tip.|$|E
25|$|This LeSabre {{came out}} in 1991 for the 1992 model year, the LeSabre was {{redesigned}} {{along the same lines}} as the previous year's Park Avenue. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door ("family-style") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.|$|E

25|$|Sinocalliopteryx had an {{elongated}} {{head with a}} pointed snout, showing a convex upper profile. There were four teeth in the premaxilla which were small but exceptionally had denticles on their front edges. Only six, larger, teeth {{were present in the}} maxilla of the holotype specimen but the number of its tooth positions could not be adequately determined. Specimen CAGS-IG-T1 preserves ten maxillary tooth sockets with room for one or two more in damaged areas. The jugal was a strongly built element with a high-rising front branch that formed part of the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> edge of the eye socket. The lower jaw lacked an opening in its outer side.|$|E
25|$|The Caprice PPV had a {{positive}} reception, with near perfect scores in an assessment by The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and with the only criticism being directed at over-cautious electronic stability control. The US Chevrolet Caprice PPV was different to its Australian and Middle Eastern counterparts in that the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> bumper {{is based on the}} Commodore Omega Series II front-end, and the interior is also from the Commodore Omega, the low-end trim of the VE Commodore that is used by law enforcement in Australia and New Zealand.

25|$|The describers {{established}} six distinguishing traits. At {{their very}} midline, the praemaxillae {{meet in a}} small sharp point, set within a larger notch in the snout tip as a whole. The front lower side edge of the praemaxilla protrudes to below. At least seventeen cervical vertebrae are present. The neural spines of the middle cervical vertebrae have a notch at their <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> edge with immediately above it a process directed to the front. The vertebrae of the middle neck, rear neck and front back possess neural spines that have a transversely expanded upper end. On the neck two rows of triangular bony plates are present that have a lightly convex outer side and a notch at the upper front edge creating a hook.|$|E
