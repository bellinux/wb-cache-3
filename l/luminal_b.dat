40|$|Background. Luminal tumors {{account for}} 65 % of all breast cancer (BC) cases; however, within this group, there are {{multiple}} subtypes with various clinical and morphological characteristics, disease course and prognosis. Choosing an optimal strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) in postmenopausal women with primary operable <b>luminal</b> BC <b>B</b> subtype without overexpression of HER 2 /neu {{appears to be the}} most challenging. Objective: to evaluate treatment outcomes in postmenopausal women with primary operable luminal BC without overexpression of HER 2 /neu depending on the ACT used. Materials and methods. We analyzed treatment outcomes in 190 postmenopausal women with stages T 1 – 2 N 0 – 1 M 0 primary operable luminal BC without overexpression of HER 2 /neu. Of them, 105 patients had luminal BC A subtype, whereas 50 patients were diagnosed with <b>luminal</b> BC <b>B</b> subtype. All patients underwent radical mastectomy or organ-preserving surgery + external beam radiotherapy + adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors; 35 patients with <b>luminal</b> BC <b>B</b> subtype additionally had 6 cycles of FAC ACT. Results. We observed no significant differences in overall and relapse-free survival (assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method) across the groups during 37 months of follow-up (p > 0. 05). Conclusions. <b>Luminal</b> BC <b>B</b> subtype without overexpression of HER 2 /neu is an extremely heterogeneous group in terms of planning ACT, especially in postmenopausal women. Our results encourage to pay particular attention to finding additional biological characteristics of the tumor, which will ensure more individual approach to treatment of these patients...|$|R
40|$|Despite constituting {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} all breast cancers, the <b>luminal</b> A and <b>B</b> tumours are poorly classified at both clinical and molecular levels. There are contradictory reports {{on the nature of}} these subtypes: some define them as intrinsic entities, others as a continuum. With the aim of addressing these uncertainties and identifying molecular signatures of patients at risk, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic and genomic analysis of 2, 425 luminal breast cancer samples. Our results indicate that the separation between the molecular <b>luminal</b> A and <b>B</b> subtypes-per definition-is not associated with intrinsic characteristics evident in the differentiation between other subtypes. Moreover, t-SNE and MST-kNN clustering approaches based on 10, 000 probes, associated with luminal tumour initiation and/or development, revealed the close connections between <b>luminal</b> A and <b>B</b> tumours, with no evidence of a clear boundary between them. Thus, we considered all luminal tumours as a single heterogeneous group for analysis purposes. We first stratified luminal tumours into two distinct groups by their HER 2 gene cluster co-expression: HER 2 -amplified luminal and ordinary-luminal. The former group is associated with distinct transcriptomic and genomic profiles, and poor prognosis; it comprises approximately 8 % of all luminal cases. For the remaining ordinary-luminal tumours we further identified the molecular signature correlated with disease outcomes, exhibiting an approximately continuous gene expression range from low to high risk. Thus, we employed four virtual quantiles to segregate the groups of patients. The clinico-pathological characteristics and ratios of genomic aberrations are concordant with the variations in gene expression profiles, hinting at a progressive staging. The comparison with the current separation into <b>luminal</b> A and <b>B</b> subtypes revealed a substantially improved survival stratification. Concluding, we suggest a review of the definition of <b>luminal</b> A and <b>B</b> subtypes. A proposition for a revisited delineation is provided in this study...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the level of protein expression of the critical components of the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) pathway and to evaluate their prognostic significance across the different early breast cancer subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Archival tumor tissue from 1, 021 women with early, node positive breast cancer, who were prospectively evaluated within two randomized clinical trials, was used to construct tissue microarrays that were stained for hormone receptors (HR), Ki 67, HER 2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytokeratins 5 / 6, to classify tumors into five immunophenotypical subgroups. Immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of IGF 1 R-alpha and beta subunits, IGF 2 R and IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP 2) was assessed using the immunoreactive score (IRS). Repeated internal cross-validation was performed to examine the statistical validity of the cut off points for all biomarkers. RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 105. 4 months, overall 370 women (36. 2 %) had relapsed and 270 (26. 4 %) had died. Tumors expressing IGF 1 R-alpha above the median IRS were significantly more frequently HR positive (luminal A+B+HER 2), as compared to HER 2 -enriched and triple negative ones (p< 0. 001 for both comparisons). IGF 2 R was overexpressed significantly more frequently in HR negative tumors (p =  0. 001) and had an inverse correlation with all other biomarkers. Patients with <b>luminal</b> A and <b>B</b> tumors with high IGF 1 R-alpha and negative EGFR expression (N =  190) had significantly higher 4 -year survival rates, {{as compared to the}} rest (log-rank p =  0. 046), as did patients with <b>luminal</b> A and <b>B</b> tumors with high IGF 1 R-alpha and low IGF 2 R expression, as compared to the rest (N =  91), (log-rank p =  0. 035). After adjustment for significant variables, patients in the latter group had a relative 45 % reduction in the risk of death, as compared to the rest (p =  0. 035).

40|$|Alterations in p 53 and Rb tumor {{suppressors}} {{or their}} pathways {{are common in}} human breast cancer. We used newly generated MMTVCre 105 Ayn mice to inactivate p 53 and/or Rb strictly in the mammary epithelium. Inactivation of p 53 led to formation of estrogen receptor positive raloxifene-responsive mammary carcinomas with features of <b>luminal</b> subtype <b>B.</b> Rb deficiency was insufficient to initiate carcinogenesis but accelerated formation of mammary carcinomas in combination with p 53 inactivation and promoted genomic instability. The recurrent amplification of the cIAP 1, cIAP 2 and Yap 1 protooncogenes in the 9 A 1 locus was observed only in neoplasms associated with p 53 inactivation alone. However, all three genes remained overexpressed in carcinomas with p 53 and Rb inactivation due to elevated E 2 F expression and cooperated in carcinogenesis. To test involve ment of the stem cell compartment in the initiation of mammary carcinogenesis we have isolated mammary stem cells (MRU; CD 24 medCD 49 fhigh), and their progeny (Ma-CFC, CD 24 highCD 49 flow). Loss of either p 53 or Rb led {{to an increase in}} the number and proliferation rate of Ma-CFC but not MRU. Both parameters were further increased in Ma-CFC pool deficient for both p 53 and Rb. Notably, the resulting mammary neoplasms contained CD 24 +CD 49 f+ cells. Far fewer of CD 24 +CD 49 f+ cells were required for orthotopic transplantation, as compared to CD 24 -CD 49 f- cell population. CD 24 +CD 49 f+ cells yielded carcinomas much earlier and were able to reconstitute all tumor cell populations more efficiently than CD 24 -CD 49 f- cells in secondary and tertiary transplantations. Thus, CD 24 +CD 49 f+ cells meet the definition of cancer stem cells (CSC). We have determined that CSC show higher genomic stability and are characterized by upregulation of Aldh 1, cIAP 1 and downregulation of microRNAs miR- 376 b and miR- 467 b. Importantly we have identified cIAP 1 and cIAP 2 as targets of both miRNAs and shown that miR- 376 b, miR- 467 b, cIAP 1 and cIAP 2 affect stem cell properties of CSC. Taken together, these findings establish a model of <b>luminal</b> subtype <b>B</b> mammary carcinoma, demonstrate that p 53 and Rb cooperate in the maintenance of genomic integrity, identify critical role of cIAP 1, cIAP 2 and Yap co-expression in mammary carcinogenesis.

Results The high expression of Ki- 67 antigen was detected in 236 tumors; no cases of luminal A subtype showed high expression of the Ki- 67 antigen, but more than 85 % of tumors of the other subtypes showed high expression.

30|$|Breast cancer (BC) is {{a complex}} and {{heterogeneous}} disease which includes several subtypes with different molecular and clinical characteristics. A major milestone on the classification of the breast carcinomas is the so called “intrinsic classification”, which divides breast tumors into at least five clinically and biologically relevant intrinsic molecular subtypes based on genome-wide expression analyses: luminal A, <b>luminal</b> <b>B,</b> HER 2 -enriched, basal-like, and normal breast-like. In this respect, the <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> subtype constitutes the most heterogeneous group, both clinically and molecularly. In fact, {{although many of the}} <b>Luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors are ER+/HER 2 −/high Ki- 67, expression profiles also classify the ER+/HER 2 + tumors as <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> and these patients receive a different therapy regimen (that incorporates targeted anti-HER 2 therapy) compared to other <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> BC subtypes (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012). With respect to the HER 2 -negative <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors, they are inherently more aggressive than the luminal A and they require a more aggressive therapy. However, although recent studies have reported that some of the HER 2 -negative tumors could benefit from anti-HER 2 therapy treatment (Pogue-Geile et al. 2013), <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors are generally treated with a combination of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, though this approach is not always effective. In view of the clinical/molecular heterogeneity of the <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors, the 12 th St. Gallen International Expert Consensus proposed a new classification system that was further updated in the 13 th Consensus by which the luminal BC subtypes were separated into three groups based on the ER, progesterone (PgR), HER 2 and Ki- 67 status—(1) luminal A-like tumors are ER-positive and HER 2 -negative with low Ki- 67 expression (< 20  %) and high PgR levels (≥ 20  %); (2) luminal B-like (HER 2 -negative) tumors are ER-positive and HER 2 -negative with high Ki- 67 expression (≥ 20  %) or with low PgR levels (< 20  %); and (3) luminal B-HER 2 tumors are ER-positive and HER 2 -positive regardless PgR or Ki- 67 expression. Luminal A disease is stated to require only endocrine therapy, whereas in <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> disease, chemotherapy should be also considered. Thus, one major challenge in the management of luminal BCs is to discriminate those patients that would benefit from cytotoxic drugs or anti-targeted therapy from those that would not.|$|E

A total of 2148 patients (592 premenopausal, 1556 postmenopausal) were classified into subgroups according to BMI distribution. High BMI was signifi-cantly associated with larger size tumor both in pre (p = 0. 01) and postmenopausal women (p = 0. 00). Obese premenopausal women showed worse histopathologic features (more metastatic axillary lymphnodes, p = 0. 017 and presence of vascular invasion, p = 0. 006) compared to under/normal weight group. Postmenopausal patients with BMI> 25 developed more frequently ER/PgR posi-tive cancers (87 % versus 75 %, p = 0. 017), while no association was found in premenopausal women. We could not found any statistically significant correlation between breast cancer subtypes (<b>luminal</b> A, <b>B,</b> HER- 2 and basal-like) and BMI both in pre and post-menopause.

30|$|From the {{epigenetic}} {{point of}} view, {{previous studies have}} documented that specific DNA methylation patterns {{can be related to}} some different luminal subtypes (Dedeurwaerder et al. 2011; Bediaga et al. 2010; Holm et al. 2010; Stefansson et al. 2015; Cornen et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Kamalakaran et al. 2011; Fang et al. 2011; Conway et al. 2014; Van der Auwera et al. 2010; Flanagan et al. 2010). Specifically, <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> cancers have been usually associated with a methylator phenotype characterized by an extent DNA methylation in CpG islands (Bediaga et al. 2010; Holm et al. 2010; Stefansson et al. 2015). On the contrary, luminal A tumors have been described as being more heterogeneous in terms of their methylation patterns and with less methylation changes with respect to the normal (Bediaga et al. 2010; Stefansson et al. 2015). Aware of the biologic/epigenetic heterogeneity within luminal subgroup, we have compared {{for the first time the}} DNA methylation profiles associated the newly proposed IHC-based surrogate definition of the <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> and compared it to that of the luminal A and B-HER 2, thus providing new insights into the molecular features of the <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> BCs. Our results, based on the unsupervised clustering of the luminal BC samples identified two significant DNA methylation groups. Sixty-two percent of the <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> samples were grouped in cluster I (CI) together with luminal A tumors, while approximately third of the <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> samples was clustered in cluster II (CII), which showed a higher proportion of methylation events and grouped the whole set of luminal B-HER 2. Interestingly, tumors in CII were significantly bigger, had higher proliferative activity and worse outcome than those at CI. Further functional analysis of the epigenetic signatures associated with each of the two clusters indicated that distribution of the aberrant CpGs across the different gene annotations does not differ significantly for each cluster. On the other hand, when we investigated the extent to which genes with cluster specific methylation patterns were also PRC 2 targets in ES cells, we found that both aberrant DNA methylation patrons in CI and CII were significantly enriched in PRC 2 gene targets (i.e. they had a higher proportion of PRC 2 than what is it expected), although CII showed a slightly higher enrichment in PRC 2 target genes compared to tumors in CI. Finally, comparison of these two epigenetic signatures also revealed an extent overlap in the aberrantly methylated genes between the two cluster, i.e. 97.5  % of the CpGs showing aberrant methylation in CI were also deregulated in CII. Taken all together, our results indicated that (1) based on the St. Gallen IHC classification system, <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> phenotype itself does not show a distinctive DNA methylation pattern (significant at AU >  95  %; by the pvclust method) but rather an heterogeneous methylation signature where 62  % of the samples clustered with luminal A and 30  % with the luminal B-HER 2; (2) DNA methylation profiles enable the stratification of <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> samples in two categories with differing epigenetic and clinical features, thus suggesting that adding certain epigenetic markers to the latest St. Gallen IHC classification scheme could improve the clinical relevance of the surrogate scheme; and (3) <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> cancers have significantly greater numbers of methylation events than the luminal A, but methylation events in luminal A are present in <b>luminal</b> <b>B,</b> besides distribution of the methylation events across gene annotations is similar which all together may support the hypothesis that <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> cancer precursors evolve from luminal A cancer/cancer precursors as has been previously speculated in Creighton et al.

The aim {{of the study was}} to map the amplified 8 p 12 -p 11 region in a large set of breast tumors in an effort to identify the genetic driver and to explore its impact on tumor progression and prognosis. Copy number alterations (CNAs) were mapped in 359 tumors, and gene expression data from 577 tumors (359 tumors included) were correlated with CNA, clinical-pathological factors, and protein expression (39 tumors). 8 p 12 -p 11 was amplified in 11. 4 % of tumors. The smallest region of amplification harbored one full-length gene, ZNF 703. ZNF 703 mRNA expression was significantly higher in estrogen receptor (ER) -positive than ER-negative tumors (P =  2  ×  10 (- 16)), a reflection of high expression in luminal tumors. Forty-eight percent of tumors with ZNF 703 amplification were <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors in which the best correlation between DNA copy number and mRNA was seen (P =  1. 2  ×  10 (- 7)) as well as correlation between mRNA and protein expression (P =  0. 02). High ZNF 703 mRNA correlated with poor survival in patients with ER-positive <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors (log rank P =  0. 04). Furthermore, high ZNF 703 mRNA expression correlated with poor outcome in patients with ZNF 703 copy number neutral, ER-positive, <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors (log rank P =  0. 004). The results support ZNF 703 as the driver gene of the 8 p 12 amplification and suggest that independent of amplification, high expression of the gene affects prognosis in <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors. Our mapping of 8 p 12 -p 11 and analyses of ZNF 703 mRNA and protein expression in breast tumors support ZNF 703 as an oncogene in <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumors.

40|$|The histopathologic and {{molecular}} heterogeneity {{of prostate cancer}} and the limited availability of human tumor tissue make unraveling the mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis a challenging task. Our goal was to develop an ex vivo model that could be reliably used to define a prognostic signature based on gene expression profiling of cell cultures that maintained the tumor phenotype. To this end, we derived epithelial cultures from tissue explanted from 59 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or cistoprostatectomy because of prostate benign hyperplasia/prostate cancer or bladder carcinoma. Patient selection criteria were absence of hormonal neoadjuvant treatment before surgery and diagnosis of clinically localized disease. Using this unique experimental material, we analyzed expression of 22, 500 transcripts on the Affymetrix Human U 133 A GeneChip platform (Affymetrix, Inc., High Wycombe, United Kingdom). Cultures from normal/hyperplastic tissues with a prevalent luminal phenotype and from normal prostate epithelial tissue with basal phenotype (PrEC) served as controls. We have established {{a large number of}} prostate primary cultures highly enriched in the secretory phenotype. From them, we derived an epithelial-restricted transcriptional signature that (a) differentiated normal from tumor cells and (b) clearly separated cancer-derived lines into two distinct groups, which correlated with indolent or aggressive clinical behavior of the disease. Our findings provide (a) a method to expand human primary prostate carcinoma cells with a <b>luminal</b> phenotype, (<b>b)</b> a powerful experimental model to study primary prostate cancer biology, and (c) a novel means to characterize these tumors from a molecular genetic standpoint for prognostic and/or predictive purposes...|$|R

We performed immunohistochemical staining of amine oxidase proteins (LOX, lysyl oxidase, AOC 3, amine oxidase, MAOA, monoamine oxidase A, MAOB, monoamine oxidase B). Based on their hormone receptors, such as estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER- 2), and Ki- 67 immunohistochemical staining, breast cancer was divided into four molecular subtypes: luminal A, <b>luminal</b> <b>B,</b> HER- 2 type, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Luminal A was observed in 380 cases (49. 4 %), <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> in 224 (29. 1 %), HER- 2 type in 68 (8. 8 %), and TNBC in 98 (12. 7 %). Stromal AOC 3, MAO-A, and MAO-B expression varied according to molecular subtypes. Stromal AOC 3 expression was high in <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> and HER- 2 type and MAO-A expression was high in luminal A and <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> (p < 0. 001). MAO-B expression was higher in TNBC than in other subtypes (p = 0. 020). LOX positivity was associated with high histological grade (p < 0. 001) and high Ki- 67 labeling index (LI) (p = 0. 009), and stromal AOC 3 positivity was associated with high histological grade (p = 0. 001), high Ki- 67 LI (p < 0. 001), and HER- 2 positivity (p = 0. 002). MAO-A positivity was related to low histological grade (p < 0. 001), ER positivity, PR positivity (p < 0. 001), and low Ki- 67 LI (p < 0. 001). In univariate analysis, MAO-A positivity was related to short disease-free survival in HER- 2 type (p = 0. 013), AOC 3 negativity was related to short disease-free survival and overall survival in ER-positive breast cancer, PR-positive breast cancer, HER- 2 -negative breast cancer, and lymph node metastasis. In conclusion, the expression of amine oxidase proteins varies depending on the molecular subtype of breast cancer.

40|$|Introduction: Five {{different}} molecular subtypes {{of breast}} cancer have been identified through gene expression profiling. Each subtype has a characteristic expression pattern suggested to partly depend on cellular origin. We aimed to investigate whether the molecular subtypes also display distinct methylation profiles. Methods: We analysed methylation status of 807 cancer-related genes in 189 fresh frozen primary breast tumours and four normal breast tissue samples using an array-based methylation assay. Results: Unsupervised analysis revealed three groups {{of breast cancer}} with characteristic methylation patterns. The three groups {{were associated with the}} luminal A, <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> and basal-like molecular subtypes of breast cancer, respectively, whereas cancers of the HER 2 -enriched and normal-like subtypes were distributed among the three groups. The methylation frequencies were significantly different between subtypes, with <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> and basal-like tumours being most and least frequently methylated, respectively. Moreover, targets of the polycomb repressor complex in breast cancer and embryonic stem cells were more methylated in <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> tumours than in other tumours. BRCA 2 -mutated tumours had a particularly high degree of methylation. Finally, by utilizing gene expression data, we observed that a large fraction of genes reported as having subtype-specific expression patterns might be regulated through methylation. Conclusions: We have found that breast cancers of the basal-like, luminal A and <b>luminal</b> <b>B</b> molecular subtypes harbour specific methylation profiles.

A more complete under-standing of the subtypes of breast cancer may elucidate the mechanisms affecting the etiology and mortality associated with each subtype. Tumor data on 531 invasive breast cancer cases subtyped by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her 2) status were obtained [luminal A, <b>luminal</b> <b>B,</b> triple-negative (TN) and Her 2 -type]. Demographics (age at diagnosis, menopausal status and BMI) were collected from medical records. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were esti-mated using logistic regression, adjusting for age at diagnosis. Of the 531 cases, 333 (62. 7 %) were luminal A, 85 (16. 0 %) were <b>luminal</b> <b>B,</b> 43 (8. 1 %) were Her 2 -type and 70 (13. 2 %) were TN.

40|$|Previous {{electron}} microscopic {{studies on}} the coiled duct of the eccrine sweat glands have described the luminal cells as having "a cuticle of fibrous texture " (1) or "osmiophilic bands " (2). These terms were apparently used to describe a structure which we have now resolved to be a highly developed terminal web associated with an elaborate system of desmosomes. OBSERVATIONS The coiled duct of the eccrine sweat glands consists {{of two or three}} layers of epithelial cells concentrically arranged around the lumen (Fig. 1). The superficial cells have a fibrous luminal border; the peripheral cells, usually contain moderate amounts of glycogen and rest on a poorly developed basement membrane. Numerous blood vessels and unmyelinated nerves adhere to the coiled duct. The Luminal Border: The low microvilli on the inner surface of the luminal cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane composed of two adielectronic lines separated by a light band. The outer dense line is ~ 50 A thick, the thinner one ~ 20 A; the light band between them is about 25 A wide. A few smooth surfaced vesicles in the cytoplasm beneath the microvilli may result from FIGURE 1 A low power electron micrograph through the eoilcd eccrine sweat duct of the rhesus monkey. A small portion of the lumen (L) of the gland is visible. Low microvilli surmount the <b>luminal</b> border (<b>B),</b> where several large dense desmosomes (D) are visible joining the plasma membranes of two adjacent luminal cells. Numerous small mitochondria (M), agranular and granular membranes appear in the cytoplasm of the superficial and the peripheral cells. Organized Golgi elements and ergastoplasm have not been observed in the duct cells. The opposed plasma membranes of these cells are elaborately folded.

When the tumor node is localized in the upper-inner quadrant of the breast, it is difficult to achieve good aesthetic results. One of the solutions to the problem is the use of a sliding flap with a Z-shaped incision. In P. Hertsen MORI from 2014 to 2016, the operation {{with the use of a}} sliding flap was performed in 13 patients. The prevalence of the process, patients were distributed as follows: ТisN 0 М 0 – 1, Т 1 N 0 М 0 – 7, Т 2 N 0 М 0 – 3, Т 1 N 1 М 0 – 2. Molecular subtypes distribution was the following — luminal type A— 8, <b>luminal</b> type <b>B</b> — 3, triple-negative subtype — 1 patient. Localization of the tumor site in the breast: the upper-internal quadrant — 9, upper — 1, lowerinner quadrant — 3. The upper Zshaped flap was used in 10 patients, the lower Zshaped flap in 3 cases. Postoperative period in all patients was without com plications. The wound healed by primary intention in all patients. Cosmetic effect was good. The observation period is from 6 months to 2 years, the median is 1. 1 years.

40|$|Barrier {{vessels in}} {{the central nervous system}} are lined with endothelial cells which {{constitute}} the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and show selective expression of certain biochemical markers. One of these, the endothelial barrier antigen (EBA), is specific to the rat. The exact role of EBA in the BBB is not known, although several studies have shown a correlation between the reduction in EBA expression in endothelial cells and the opening of the BBB. However, in these studies {{it was not possible to}} determine if EBA reduction was a primary event or was secondary to opening of the BBB. A recent light microscope study demonstrated that immunological targeting of EBA in vivo, by intravenous injection of a monoclonal antibody (anti-EBA), leads to acute and widespread opening of the BBB. In the current study we have employed this model together with tracer application and immunoperoxidase electron microscopy to determine the site of binding of the injected antibody and the route of opening of the BBB. The results showed that (a) the anti-EBA injected in vivo became bound to brain endothelial cells, principally to <b>luminal</b> membranes. (<b>b)</b> Endothelial cells showed widened intercellular junctions and increased cytoplasmic vesicles and vacuoles. (c) Many perivascular astrocytic processes were swollen. (d) The macromolecular tracer HRP was present in vesicles, vacuoles, widened paracellular clefts, the perivascular space and brain parenchyma. In conclusion, the in vivo targeting of EBA leads to opening of the BBB apparently via paracellular and transcellular routes. This model is useful for the study of vascular permeability in the CNS and experimental manipulation of the BBB. It may have a potential application in experimental studies on drug delivery throughout the CNS. Mounir N. Ghabriel, Chunni Zhu and Chris Leigh[URL]...|$|R
