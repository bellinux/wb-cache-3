25|$|A <b>linear</b> <b>Fresnel</b> {{reflector}} {{power plant}} uses {{a series of}} long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small parabolic mirror can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. This {{is similar to the}} trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.|$|E
50|$|A compact <b>linear</b> <b>Fresnel</b> {{reflector}} (CLFR) - {{also referred}} to as a concentrating <b>linear</b> <b>Fresnel</b> reflector - is a specific type of <b>linear</b> <b>Fresnel</b> reflector (LFR) technology. <b>Linear</b> <b>Fresnel</b> reflectors use long, thin segments of mirrors to focus sunlight onto a fixed absorber located at a common focal point of the reflectors. These mirrors are capable of concentrating the sun’s energy to approximately 30 times its normal intensity. This concentrated energy is transferred through the absorber into some thermal fluid (this is typically oil capable of maintaining liquid state at very high temperatures). The fluid then goes through a heat exchanger to power a steam generator. As opposed to traditional LFR’s, the CLFR utilizes multiple absorbers within the vicinity of the mirrors.|$|E

The 5. 6 m^sup 2 ^ reflective surface concentrator of the distiller was constructed with 32 plane rectangular mirrors; the heat absorber cavity was made with a rectangular blackened aluminum tube 1 m long and installed 2. 5 m over the plane of mirrors. The <b>Fresnel</b> <b>linear</b> distiller was installed at the University of Lima and experimental tests were performed during no cloudy summer days. There were measured ambient temperature, heat absorber cavity temperature, radiant flux and fresh water volume. From this, it was obtained a production of 0. 89 liters/hour and 0. 79 L/m^sup 2 ^, and it was calculated a total performance of 34. 5 % in desalting sea water. Finally, it is presented a comparison between <b>Fresnel</b> <b>linear</b> distiller (FLD) and parabolic trough distiller (PTD) with similar dimensions and characteristics. It is obtained that the last one produced almost 32 % more fresh water than the former, {{but at the same}} time, the FLD is almost 20 % cheaper than PTD. However, water cost production with both distillers using is almost the same.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a deep {{investigation}} upon {{levelized cost}} of heat (LCOH) produced by small-scale solar <b>linear</b> concentrating <b>Fresnel</b> collectors (CSLFC) is proposed. Solar {{industrial process heat}} applications have temperature requirements from about 60 °C to 260 °C. CSLFCs can effectively integrate conventional fossil fuel thermal systems.

So, {{on the basis of}} a framework specifically developed for these economic assessments, the best investment scenarios, in terms of industrial application, geographical location and technical design solutions, where to effectively apply the technology of CSLFC, are highlighted. The analysis has been focused on specific cost of several existing CSLFCs associated with declared performances at different operating temperatures. Two main classes of CSLFC with different total efficiency (optical and thermal) corresponding to various design solutions and specific cost were selected. The expected performances in the whole application temperature range have been evaluated through Glayx Tech proprietary simulation code, including optical and thermal unsteady analysis. A huge database coming from full CSLFC simulation varying latitude, yearly DNI, operating fluid, outlet temperature, thermal storage options, has been collected. CLSFC design and performance requirements are the key-choice to achieve competitive LCOH: the use of high efficiency – high cost components is not always rewarding in terms of final LCOH and must be attentively decided basing on site, irradiation, heat quality and LCOH target. In this perspective, CLSFCs are the most promising for industrial small scale heat applications since they show the greatest potential to reduce manufacturing costs...|$|R

Based on this idea, the paper presents two novel contributions {{to the problem of}} surface reconstruction.

This is done using robust statistics to estimate how the measured pixel brightnesses depend on the surface orientation.

The second contribution is to use the refined estimates to establish correspondence between two views of an object. To do this, a set of patches are extracted from each view and are aligned by minimizing an energy functional based on the surface normal estimates and local topographic properties. The optimum alignment parameters for different patch pairs are then used to establish stereo correspondence. This process results in an unambiguous field of surface normals, which can be integrated to recover the surface depth. Our technique is most suited to smooth, non-metallic surfaces. It complements existing stereo algorithms since it does not require salient surface features to obtain correspondences.

40|$|Air {{condensed}} water ammonia absorption chillers are attractive for solar cooling {{because of low}} parasitic consumption and high thermal COP. The main drawback {{is the need for}} medium temperature heat (200 °C above ambient temperature). Heat storage at medium temperature is expensive and, fortunately, not necessary in solar cooling. Instead, cool can be stored in order to compensate for the intermittent availability of solar radiation. Based on this concept, two demonstration plants have been erected within the MEDISCO project. The first one makes use of a high concentration ratio (about 25) <b>linear</b> focusing <b>Fresnel</b> reflector, with highly insulated (vacuumed) absorber tubes. On the contrary, the second one relies on a low concentration ratio (16. 5) PTC, with glass covered atmospheric absorber tubes. The apparent contrast existing between the two solar technologies was the motivation for this study. Is the low concentration ratio PTC coupled with atmospheric absorber tubes an optimal choice from an efficiency point of view, at the temperature of interest for solar cooling? If so, would this still be the optimal choice with high performing vacuumed tubes available on the market nowadays? To answer these questions, optical and thermal characteristics of PTC are reviewed and a design optimization method for PTC is proposed. A PTC design optimization method is proposed along with the analytical formulation of collector efficiency and intercept factor. According to proposed method, PTC design for temperature difference above ambient in the order of 200 °C will be sensitive to the insulation level of absorber tube. Market available PTC with non insulated tube are optimally designed for the temperature range of interest. However, substituting non evacuated tubes with evacuated ones would lead to a decrease in optimal concentration ratio from about 15 to about 11 and an increase in efficiency of about 30...|$|R
