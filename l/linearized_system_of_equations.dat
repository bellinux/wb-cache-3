40|$|The power {{distribution}} systems are continuously expanding {{due to the}} rise in world population and its migration to urban areas. But consuming the non-renewable resources to generate the electric power, the carbon emissions have made a serious call to global warming so, during the last decade, the electric power systems have seen the penetration of renewable energy resources. This phenomenon has given flexibility to the power grid but also its complexity has increased. In order to successfully integrate the distribution generation of the renewable energy resources, the power grid demands modern power electronic equipment and state-of-the-art techniques, control approach and simulation tools to assess the practical like conditions of the systems. In this continuous struggle to modernize and advance state-of-the-art power grid, this master research thesis investigates the two-stage converter topology for the grid-connected photovoltaic generator using the Newton Raphson iterative method in MATLAB programming. The reason to choose the photovoltaic generator is {{the rapid growth of}} such systems and the Newton Raphson method has the advantage of being fast in convergence and robust. The analytical tool for this research thesis is MATLAB coding. The maximum power point tracking of the photovoltaic generator was applied in MATLAB coding to always extract the maximum power from the photovoltaic panels. Later on the admittance matrix, nodal voltages, <b>linearized</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>equations</b> of the dc converter are constructed.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present two new advancements in {{verified}} scientific computing using interval analysis: 1. The Corner Taylor Form (CTF) interval extension. The CTF {{is the first}} interval extension for multivariate polynomials that guarantees smaller excess width than the natural extension on any input interval, large or small. To help with the proofs we introduce the concept of Posynomial Decomposition (PD). Using PD we develop simple and elegant proofs showing the CTF is isotonic and has quadratic or better (local) inclusion convergence order. We provide methods for computing the exact local order of convergence {{as well as the}} magnitude of excess width reduction the CTF produces over the natural extension. 2.

40|$|State and {{parameter}} estimations of non-linear dynamical systems, {{based on}} incomplete and noisy measurements, are considered using Monte Carlo simulations. Given the measurements. the proposed method obtains the marginalized posterior distribution of an appropriately chosen (ideally small) {{subset of the}} state vector using a particle filter. Samples (particles) of the marginalized states are then used to construct a family of conditionally <b>linearized</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>equations</b> and thus obtain the posterior distribution of the states using a bank of Kalman filters. Discrete process equations for the marginalized states are derived through truncated Ito-Taylor expansions. Increased analyticity and reduced dispersion of weights computed over a smaller sample space of marginalized states are the key features of the filter that help achieve smaller sample variance of the estimates. Numerical illustrations are provided for state/parameter estimations of a Duffing oscillator and a 3 -DOF non-linear oscillator. Performance of the filter in parameter estimation is also assessed using measurements obtained through experiments on simple models in the laboratory.

40|$|The {{route to}} hyperchaos is studied by direct {{numerical}} simulation of Rayleigh-Bénard convection in the Boussinesq approximation. The fluid is confined between two planes in a square periodicity cell and convective attractors are obtained for the Rayleigh number varying from 1760 to 2500, for which the hyperchaotic regime emerges; all other parameters of the system are fixed. The temperature of the upper and bottom plane are held constant and the horizontal boundaries are stress-free and isothermal. In the range of parameter considered, 9 convective attractors were found. The three largest Lyapunov exponents were computed in order to characterize all the attractors. For this, two different numerical methods were employed, one considering hypervolumes deformation (standard method) and the other the <b>linearized</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>equations</b> (linearization method). Both numerical methods used to compute Lyapunov exponents produce similar results. While the linearization one {{can be applied to}} spatially extended systems with no dimension limit the standard is faster but restricted to low dimension dynamical systems.

The results suggest that the hyperchaotic attractor is created in a crisis involving an chaotic attractor and a hyperchaotic saddle.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{practical issues}} associated with the numerical enforcement of constraints in flexible multibody systems, which are characterized by index- 3 differential algebraic equations (DAEs). The need to scale the equations of motion is emphasized; in the proposed approach, they are scaled based on simple physical arguments, and an augmented Lagrangian term {{is added to the}} formulation. Time discretization followed by a linearization of the resulting equations leads to a Jacobian matrix that is independent of the time step size, h; hence, the condition number of the Jacobian and error propagation are both O(h 0) : the numerical solution of index- 3 DAEs behaves {{as in the case of}} regular ODEs. Since the scaling fac-tor depends on the physical properties of the system, the proposed scaling decreases the dependency of this Jacobian on physical properties, further improving the numerical conditioning of the resulting linearized equations. Because the scaling of the equations is per-formed before the time and space discretizations, its benefits are reaped for all time integration schemes. The augmented Lagrangian term is shown to be in-dispensable if the solution of the <b>linearized</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>equations</b> is to be performed without pivoting, a requirement for the efficient solution of the sparse system of linear equations. Finally, a number of nu-merical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach to scaling. ...|$|E
