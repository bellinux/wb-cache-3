40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{and evaluate the}} indicators of absenteeism for low back pain among municipal public servants {{of the city of}} Goiania in 2008 and 2009. Material and methods This is a descriptive, epidemiological, retrospective study. We used secondary data provided by the Municipal Medical Board of Goi&# 226;nia. The sample was composed by active, statutory and commissioned civil servants of the executive branch, of both sexes, who took sick leaves for health care in the period from January 2008 to December 2009. We analyzed all cases of sick leave for health care which were taken for a period of more than 3 days and caused by low back pain. Frequency and severity indexes, proportion of lost time and average <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>absences</b> were calculated. The data were statistically analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results 625 sick leaves were analyzed. In 2008, 32 % of public servants took sick leave for health care. 2. 83 % of these leaves were for low back pain, generating 3541 days <b>of</b> <b>absence.</b> In 2009, the total percentage of sick leaves was 30 %. 5. 38 % of these were due to low back pain, leading to 6890 lost working days. The indicators of absenteeism for 2008 and 2009 were, respectively: frequency index = 0. 009 and 0. 015; severity index = 0. 14 and 0. 26, proportion of lost time = 13. 89 % and 27. 34 %; average <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>absences</b> = 16. 39 and 16. 84 days.

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the association between the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> sickness <b>absence</b> and sustained return to work (SRTW) and the predictors of SRTW in depression, anxiety disorders, intervertebral disc disorders, and back pain in a population-based cohort of employees in the Finnish public sector. Methods We linked data from employers' registers and four national population registers. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with a cluster option was applied. SRTW was defined as the end of the sickness benefit period not followed by a recurrent sickness benefit period in 30 days. Results For depression, the median time to SRTW was 46 and 38 days among men and women, respectively. For anxiety disorders, the figures were 24 and 22 days, for intervertebral disc disorders, 42 and 41 days, and, for back pain, 21 and 22 days among men and women respectively. Higher age and the persistence of the health problem predicted longer time to SRTW throughout the diagnostic categories. Comorbid conditions predicted longer time to SRTW in depression and back pain among women. Conclusions This large cohort study adds scientific evidence on the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> sickness <b>absence</b> and SRTW in four important diagnostic categories among public sector employees in Finland. Further research taking into account, eg, features of the work environment is suggested. Recommendations on the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> sickness <b>absence</b> at this point should be based on expert opinion and supplemented with research findings...|$|R

These estimates allow us to test hypotheses on the influence of the Big Five personality traits on work attendance.

The files combined register data from The Norwegian Patient Registry with individual characteristics and sickness absence data from Statistics Norway, and was analysed using zero-truncated negative binomial regression. We found that about one in four employees who had one or more spells of sick leave in the period, was also waiting for consultation or treatment in specialist health care. Yet, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the waiting period had no substantial effect on the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> sickness <b>absence</b> (i. e., less than 0. 1 % reduction). Therefore, while measures to reduce waiting times for hospital treatment in many instances could be beneficial for the individual patient, such policies would probably not have any substantial impact on the national sickness absence rate...|$|R

30|$|The {{types of}} shocks {{considered}} in the model are demographic shocks that refer to illness or death of a household member or social shocks such as theft or conflict with neighbors in the village. Agricultural shocks such as floods, droughts, crop pests, or livestock diseases and economic shocks that relate to job loss, collapse of business, strong increase of input prices, or strong decrease of output prices are also included. Households that experienced a higher number of demographic and social shocks make their migrant members stay longer in the cities, while households that experienced a higher number of agricultural shocks reduce the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>absence</b> of their migrant members. In general, {{it can be said}} that idiosyncratic shocks of rural households such as illness (demographic shocks) or social insecurity (social shocks) positively affect the duration of migrants’ stay in the cities. In contrast, covariate shocks, such as weather damages, or crop and livestock epidemics shorten the length of stay of migrants in the cities. In case of agricultural shocks, the rural households may require more labor force and hence forcing the migrant to return home in order to allow the household to recover.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how {{and when}} {{differences}} in work behaviour {{between men and women}} develop, focusing on the evolution of the gender gaps over the period of family development. The findings support the theory that gender differences in the formal labour market stem from the presence of children in the home and that childbirth and children entering school are critical times in women's employment. Births mark a dramatic decline in participation in work for women, while school entry is a time of considerable turnover in participation. The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>absence</b> from work following a subsequent birth is closely related to whether the mother was in work between births, while maternity pay and leave entitlements appear to influence the precise timing of the return to work. In addition, a return to work following birth is often only temporary. The gradual decline in women's relative wages following the first birth appears to stem from the accumulation of several shorter periods of unusually low wage growth for women around the times of birth and school entry. There is also a sharp movement into part-time work for women following childbirth and a transition towards non-permanent positions and non-supervisory roles at both critical points.

Data collected as part of a longitudinal study of adaptation and achievement in newly immigrant students were analyzed. Participants had varying experiences with parental absence, in terms of <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>absence,</b> gender of absent parent, and reason for absence. Reasons for parental absence included parental divorce, parental death, and serial migration, a cause unique to immigrant children. Students who experienced parental absence reported lower educational expectations. Students who experienced the death of a parent had lower achievement scores and lower expectations than students who did not experience parental death. Prolonged absence was also important, with students who experienced parental absence for more than one year performing worse than students who had minimal parental separation. In addition, boys who experienced parental absence because of serial migration performed worse academically than boys who did not have this occurrence. Educational expectations were reduced among students who experienced parental absence {{as a result of the}} migratory process, especially for younger students.
