40|$|Experiments were {{undertaken}} to investigate changes of {{total serum protein}} and its protein fraction concentrations after the short and <b>long</b> <b>time</b> all-out physical loads with the bicycle ergometer. Results were summarized as follows: 1) Total serum protein concentration reached the maximal value just after the short and <b>long</b> <b>time</b> loads, but thereafter it began to decrease gradually and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one. And total serum protein concentration was significantly higher just after exercise on the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> load than on the short time one. 2) Albumin relative and absolute concentrations in serum protein reached the maximal value just after exercise on both the short and <b>long</b> <b>time</b> loads, but thereafter they began to decrease and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one. And albumin relative and absolute concentrations were significantly higher just and 15 minutes after exercise on the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> load than on the short time one. 3) Globulin relative concentration in serum protein reached the minimal value just after exercise on both the short and <b>long</b> <b>time</b> loads, but thereafter it began to increase and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one. On the other hand, globulin absolute concentration did not show significant change after exercise on both the short and <b>long</b> <b>time</b> loads. And globulin relative concentration was significantly lower just after exercise on the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> load than on the short time one. 4) α-and β-globulin relative and absolute concentrations in serum protein did not show significant change after exercise on the short time load. On the other hand, α-and β-globulin relative concentrations reached the minimal value just aftere xercise on the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> load, but thereafter they began to increase and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise. Butα- and β-globvlin absolute concentrations on the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> load did not show significant change after exercise.

On the other hand, γ-globulin absolute concentraion on both the short and <b>long</b> <b>time</b> loads did not show significant change after exercise. In the relative concentration, γ-globulin decreased more markedly than α-and β-globulin. 6) The ratio of albumin to globulin in serum protein reached the maximal value just after exercise on both the short and <b>long</b> <b>time</b> loads, but thereafter it began to fall gradually and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one.

Chic Bates, Macari's assistant, was {{appointed}} manager for the club's inaugural season in the new ground. Bates struggled as his side slipped from a play-off place towards the relegation zone, with the club's bad run culminating in a 7–0 home defeat to Birmingham City. Bates was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes, and he left in April. Alan Durban, Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took charge {{for the remainder of}} season. Durban was unable to keep the club up, with a 23rd-place finish consigning Stoke to relegation from Division One.|$|E

5|$|In 1982 Edwards, by now an {{established}} scholar of diplomatic history, was appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975. Based {{out of the}} Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert J. O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a holistic approach that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. But in dealing with twenty-seven years of history, the series spanned the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The end result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians.|$|E

5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the <b>longest</b> <b>time.</b> The stable, white, hygroscopic iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E
5|$|When it was active, Hurricane Ava set many records. Several {{have since}} been broken, but Ava still holds a few. Ava ceased being a Category5 {{hurricane}} on June 7, 1973. 1994's Emilia reached Category5 intensity on July 19, 1994. This span of 7,712days, which Ava began and Emilia ended, is the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> between successive Category5 hurricanes in the northeastern Pacific, and anywhere worldwide, in recorded history. When Hurricane Gilma reached Category5 strength on July 24 also in 1994, it marked the shortest gap between Category5 Pacific hurricanes recorded. Ava was also a Category5 hurricane for exactly 24hours; a record at the time. Hurricane John broke that in the 1994 season, and hurricanes Linda and Ioke also lasted longer, tied with John. In addition, Ava is the strongest June tropical cyclone {{in the western hemisphere}} north of the equator.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the album}} was {{similarly}} successful.

It first brought total sales to over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, thus earning a Gold certification, but was later certified three times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It has sold over 987,000 copies in the UK as of November 2016. In France, Unorthodox Jukebox debuted in the top ten and spent the whole year within the top twenty, except for two weeks. One year after its release, album sales exceeded 580,000 copies, therefore being certified Diamond by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP). As of 2014, the record sold 580,000 units in that territory. In Switzerland, the album debuted atop the charts and was certified Platinum, while opening at number four on the Danish Albums Chart and earning a Gold disc there after five months. The record further charted within the top ten on the Spanish Albums Chart for the first time after 30 weeks, the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> an album needed since American rock band The Black Keys's El Camino (2011) (61 weeks).|$|E
