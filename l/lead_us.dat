Brown went on to <b>lead</b> <b>U.S.</b> Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) from October 2000 to 2002.|$|E
5|$|Complex {{powers and}} {{logarithms}} are more naturally handled as single valued functions on a Riemann surface. Single valued versions {{are defined by}} choosing a sheet. The value has a discontinuity along a branch cut. Choosing one out of many solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous, and the usual rules for manipulating powers can <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> astray.|$|E

Hogarth ditches Kent long enough to move the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, where they are able to pretend the Giant is one of Dean's scrap metal sculptures. Nevertheless, the easily spooked Kent issues orders for the military, led by General Shannon Rogard, to move into town.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00, the San Francisco {{aircraft}} spotted Jojima's force off Guadalcanal {{and reported}} it to Scott. Scott, believing that more Japanese ships were likely {{still on the}} way, continued his course towards {{the west side of}} Savo Island. At 23:33, Scott ordered his column to turn towards the southwest to a heading of 230°. All of Scott's ships understood the order as a column movement except Scott's own ship, San Francisco. As the three <b>lead</b> <b>U.S.</b> destroyers executed the column movement, San Francisco turned simultaneously. Boise—following immediately behind—followed San Francisco, thereby throwing the three van destroyers out of formation.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because it}} was the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta was the target of fire and torpedoes from several Japanese ships—probably {{including}} Nagara, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi—in addition to Akatsuki. The gunfire caused heavy damage to Atlanta, and a type 93 torpedo strike cut all of her engineering power. The disabled cruiser drifted into the line of fire of SanFrancisco, which accidentally fired on her, causing even greater damage. Admiral Scott and many of the bridge crew were killed. Without power and unable to fire her guns, Atlanta drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by. The <b>lead</b> <b>U.S.</b> destroyer, Cushing, was also caught in a crossfire between several Japanese destroyers and perhaps Nagara. She too was hit heavily and stopped dead in the water.|$|E

5|$|At 08:50, the <b>lead</b> <b>U.S.</b> attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four {{ships from}} Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers {{and prepared to}} attack. Three Zeros from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing {{them away from the}} bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of decoding, or factorizing in {{a single}} way, biinfinite words with a finitary {{language}} <b>leads</b> <b>us</b> to consider two distinct notions of factorization for biinfinite words. For one of these notions, requiring singleness of decoding periodic biinfinite words <b>leads</b> <b>us</b> to study circular codes. The other notion <b>leads</b> <b>us</b> to define the new notion of precircular codes. Precircular codes are defined and analyzed. The family of precircular codes is compared {{to the family of}} circular codes and to the family of almost circular codes. The structure of two-element precircular codes is determined. Codes and precircular codes are characterized by their way of acting upon periodic biinfinite words...|$|R
