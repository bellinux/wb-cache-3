It {{is known}} to be inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK 506), endothall (ENDO), microcystin (MCYST), okadaic acid (OA) and trifluoperazine (TFP). CsA and FK 506 are known inhibitors, which inhibit CN by binding to cyclophilin A (CyPA) and FK 506 binding protein 12 (FKBP 12), to form CsA-CyPA and FKBP 12 -FK 506 complexes, respectively. These complex molecules finally bind to CN to inhibit its phosphatase activity. The mode of action of the inhibitors and their binding affinity to CN's subunits and close associates is not very clear. The current study is to dock CN subunits, such as, calcineurin A (CNA), calcineurin B (CNB) and calcineurin AB (CNAB), with known inhibitors as well as close associates of CN like calmodulin (CaM), FKBP 12 and CyPA. This was done using Autodock Vina to evaluate their binding free energy (DG) and binding affinities. The results suggest that inhibition can be brought about by either directly binding to CN and its subunits or associates. The binding affinity of known inhibitors of CN is given as follows: OA>TFP>MCYST>FK 506 >CsA>ENDO. These inhibitors exhibit very <b>low</b> <b>docked</b> free energy not only with associates of CN, but also with CN subunits.

In order to analyze the role of Mg 2 + in the interaction or coupling between 3, 5 -DCQA and Integrase, three models were created:i) {{in the absence of}} Mg 2 + ions, ii) with a Mg 2 + ion coordinated at Asp 15 and Asp 72 and iii) model with two Mg 2 + ions coordinated atAsp 15 -Asp 72 and Asp 72 -Glu 108.

Conclusion. Altogether, these results strengthen thehypothesis that the presence of one Mg 2 + ion could enhance the interaction in the complex by decreasing free energy, therefore increasing the affinity.

The most potent compound 6 b, having the greatest resemblance to CA- 4 and isoCA- 4 displayed antiproliferative activity at nanomolar concentrations against various cancer cell lines and inhibited tubulin assembly at a micromolar range. In addition, benzoxepin 6 b led {{to the arrest of}} HCT 116, K 562, H 1299 and MDA-MB 231 cancer cell lines in the G(2) /M phase of the cell cycle, and strongly induced apoptosis at <b>low</b> concentrations. <b>Docking</b> studies demonstrated that benzoxepin 6 b adopt an orientation similar to that of isoCA- 4 at the colchicine binding site on Î²-tubulin...|$|R
