With the establishment of the Armoured Cavalry Regiments, 5 and 7 RAR gave up their M113 armoured personnel carriers and re-roled as light infantry. Meanwhile, the motorised battalions also re-roled as light infantry with a transport squadron being established in each Combat Service Support Battalion equipped with Bushmaster PMVs to provide protected mobility. 2 RAR was selected to specialise in amphibious warfare.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{secondary}} schools as <b>learning</b> <b>organisations</b> was being examined {{as part of}} a research project involving South Australian and Tasmanian secondary schools. <b>Learning</b> <b>organisations</b> were defined as schools that: employ processes of environmental scanning; develop shared goals; establish collaborative teaching and learning environments; encourage initiatives and risk taking; regularly review all aspects related to and influencing the work of the school; recognise and reinforce good work; and, provide opportunities for continuing professional development. A survey of 2, 000 teachers and principals was conducted using items representing these seven dimensions. The data were analysed and confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL was employed to test the four measurement models generated. The discussion clarifies the characteristics and processes recognised as existing in secondary schools that relate to the reconceptualisation of schools as <b>learning</b> <b>organisations</b> and addresses the usefulness of this approach.

40|$|This report {{provides}} a revised model of workbased learning for the vocational {{education and training}} (VET) sector in Australia, in response to emerging needs.

This examination of the literature enables the development of a model of an integrated approach to workbased learning. The model integrates compatible ideas from adult <b>learning,</b> <b>learning</b> <b>organisations</b> and action learning/research and facilitates new ways of thinking about workbased learning as a staff development model.

Increased flow of trade in commodities, manufactured goods and information as well as mobility of people have led to increased global interdependence, interconnectedness and cultural diversity. People and teams within <b>learning</b> <b>organisations</b> have become globally distributed {{with the aid of}} improved communication technologies. As a result, more sophisticated approaches to developing a global mindset, understanding multiple perspectives and improving intercultural communication are needed for successful collaboration between teams and team members. A tool that has proved beneficial in educational learning environments - the Cage Painting Simulator (CPS) - can be used to improve: intercultural communication, perspective taking and development of a global mindset. In this article, we integrate the CPS-framework for intercultural communication competence and global mindset development into the Senge's theoretical framework for <b>learning</b> <b>organisations,</b> focusing on the context of globally distributed teams and team members...|$|R

50|$|<b>Learn</b> Local <b>organisations</b> {{deliver a}} broad range of {{education}} and training in community settings. Each year over 110,000 Victorians undertake training at a <b>Learn</b> Local <b>organisation.</b> To be part of the Learn Local network and deliver pre-accredited training, an organisation must be registered with the Adult, Community and Further Education (ACFE) Board. <b>Learn</b> Local <b>organisations</b> can deliver both pre-accredited and accredited training. Pre-accredited training is unique to the Learn Local sector. Pre-accredited training programs are designed to help learners gain the confidence and skills needed to seek employment and further education opportunities. They include courses in communication, job search skills, returning to work skills and literacy and numeracy skills.In order to offer accredited training, <b>Learn</b> Local <b>organisations</b> have to be Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) which results in the delivery of qualifications equivalent to TAFE and private RTOs.

50|$|Many of the {{controls}} on the production and distribution of content {{and the provision of}} telecommunications services through licensing or other subsidiary arrangements, or by standards and codes (whether co-regulatory or self-regulatory) are subject to revision and adaptation to the networked society and information economy.

Other challenges for regulators include cross-jurisdictional issues and the need for engagement and collaboration with stakeholders locally, regionally and internationally.

40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} a <b>learning</b> <b>organisation</b> model for Hong Kong Chinese enterprises. It {{examines}} {{the case of the}} McDonald's Learning Programme, which shows how company-wide problems can be solved by the stakeholders in the company through a strategic learning initiative. The McDonald's Learning Programme has provided a practical implementation framework and a localised model for companies aspiring to become a <b>learning</b> <b>organisation.</b> The success factors for becoming a <b>learning</b> <b>organisation</b> and for a system supporting a <b>learning</b> <b>organisation</b> are identified. In order to explore the <b>learning</b> <b>organisation</b> concept in greater depth and to triangulate these factors, selected Hong Kong Chinese enterprises have been studied through the following two surveys: • The Executive Interview Survey This survey analyses executives' views on business success and <b>learning</b> <b>organisation.</b> Organisational learning is considered as one important factor in maintaining organisational competitiveness. • The Staff Learning Climate Survey This survey examines staff learning climate. It shows a crucial point that the development of a learning culture is greatly influenced by the management’s (directors') initiatives and involvement. With the findings of the case study of McDonald's Learning Programme and the two surveys, a <b>learning</b> <b>organisation</b> model is built. This model provides a practical implementation framework, which composes of three main parts: organisation and stakeholder initiatives, individual and team level learning and a framework supporting a <b>learning</b> <b>organisation.</b> This study should provide useful and valuable reference material on <b>learning</b> <b>organisation</b> development for other Hong Kong Chinese enterprises...|$|E
