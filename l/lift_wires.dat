40|$|From this study, {{lift-off}} {{process of}} monopile in single crane vessel scenario and two vessels scenario are all considered. Challenges from environmental conditions and upending process are all cleared. In the single crane vessel scenario, the vessel was assumed as jack-up and floating structures respectively. Different lifting methods were concerned under former assumption, such as constant angular velocity, vertical lifting velocity, vertical lifting forces, fixed crane tip and horizontal moving crane tip. Some suggestions about <b>lift</b> <b>wire</b> force and <b>lifting</b> velocity were listed from these analysis. Regular translation and rotation motions of crane vessel were concerned under latter assumptions. Results of time {{series of three}} concerned forces(lift wire, horizontal and vertical support force) were studied with heave and roll motions of crane vessel. Based on this analysis, vessel motion had little effects to concerned forces compared with upending process. In order to minimize maximum value of three concerned forces, different sea states and upending process were considered. High sea state(means large Hs and Tp) just leaded large standard deviation, which means environmental load was not very important. Then smaller lifting velocity was used to minimize challenge to safety. When the two vessels scenario concerned, distance between transport barge and crane vessel was the main factor.

40|$|This thesis {{serves as}} a preparatory study for a new concept in {{subsurface}} towing proposed by Acergy Norway. 3 different mathematical methods for determining the most important dynamics occurring during a subsurface towing operation is therefore discussed and compared. The 3 models examined is a simple mass-spring system with forced excitations implemented in Matlab (chapter 6), a multibody time domain simulation in SIMO (chapter 7) and a model test for verification of results (chapter 9). The accuracy of the relatively simple hand calculations is discussed and compared to experimental values in chapter 10. The {{first part of this}} thesis includes a description of different concepts for transportation of subsea templates to installation site. Transportation by subsurface towing instead of using a barge can reduce operational costs if the dimensions of the structure require a heavy-lift vessel. Also risk related to pendulum motions in air is reduced, and subsurface towing is therefore of great interest to marine contractors. The most significant parameters to check by hand calculations in a subsurface towing operation is natural frequencies and modes of the dynamic system, and also estimates of the maximum/minimum loads <b>lifting</b> <b>wires</b> and slings. Since simple hand calculation models are of interest in early concept studies, formulas for these values are derived in chapter 6. These formulas are also found in (DNV Recommended practice H 103, 2009). SIMO is a time domain simulation program for multibody systems, which allows export of station keeping forces and connecting force mechanism (<b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> and slings). Based on a system description file provided by Acergy Norway, a suitable model of the Gjøa ITS subsea template is made, and positioned 50 [m] below the moonpool hangoff point. Multiple analyses with different sea conditions and towing velocities have been done in SIMO to determine the feasibility and best practice of a subsurface towing operation. In addition, a towing tank experiment was performed in Marine Cybernetics towing tank at Tyholt in Trondheim. A detailed model of the Gjøa ITS was made in 2008, and numerous previous experiments have been conducted (e. g Solaas(2008) and Eilertsen(2008)) which provided valuable information and reduced the required amount of work in planning a model experiment. In the experiment the template was towed with a vertical oscillator to simulate the vessel translation in head sea and forces were measured in the <b>lifting</b> <b>wire.</b> These model experiments were made for various environmental conditions, and compared to the numerical models previously described. A correct representation of the towing arrangement in SIMO provides a relatively inexpensive model for further dynamic analysis of the system. A heave compensation device can easily be implemented in SIMO when the model of the vessel and template is correctly represented and can therefore be of valuable importance when designing a new conceptual hangoff-structure. </p...|$|R
40|$|As the {{offshore}} industry operates on deeper seas, subsea technology {{becomes more and}} more important. As a consequence of this, marine lifting operations of subsea equipment has become very common. Prior to such an operation it is necessary to define the limiting sea states. Many methods for doing this are very conservative and will underestimate the operational conditions. Defining the limiting sea states can be done by numerical simulations using commercial software. However this may be very time consuming. The focus on this report is put on modeling lifting of objects through the splash zone using the computer program USFOS. Dynamic analyses of the lowering were performed. Even though this program is not initially intended for such use, it has features that makes such analyses possible. In this report the applicability of USFOS for such use will be studied. Three main models have been considered. The first of them was a very simple model of a horizontal pipe that was lowered into the sea. The wire forces was considered, and it was studied how different input parameters affected the results. The input parameters for this simple model was taken further by simulating the lowering of a subsea spool through the splash zone. This model consisted of a subsea spool, a spreader bar, 4 slings and a <b>lifting</b> <b>wire.</b> Both flat sea and regular waves were simulated. For the regular wave cases, the forces in the wires and slings was studied. This showed that slack in the <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> or slings would occur in 3 out of 4 sea states. Further the elastic utilization of the structure was evaluated according to API-RP- 2 A-WSD, which is implemented in USFOS. In this study {{it was found that the}} utilization of the structure increases as the wave height in- creases. However it is questioned how accurately USFOS calculates the forces in the splash zone for the most extreme cases of regular waves. The last and most realistic model that was considered in this thesis, was lowering of the subsea spool into irregular waves. These waves were simulated according to the JONSWAP wave spectrum. Different sea states were modeled by changing the value of significant wave height and peak period. In addition the top end of the <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> was connected to the moving crane tip of a vessel. The vessel motions were defined by RAO functions that were included in the input files. For all of the sea states that were modeled, the minimum wire forces were found. This resulted in an overview of which sea states that would give slack in <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> or slings. The trend showed that as the significant wave height was increased, the minimum forces in the wires and slings decreased. From the work that was carried out it was concluded that USFOS can be used for modeling simple marine lifting operations. The program calculates the equilibrium forces in the top end of the wire element in the right way. But its use for this purpose is limited. If damping is introduced to the system, the force in the wire element will decrease due to this, and thus give an error in the equilibrium value. Further the special beam formulation used to model the elongating wire element, requires that a dynamic analysis is performed. Thus there will be oscillations in the system due to initiation of gravity and self weight. Therefore this initial phase should be neglected when considering the structural response. One of the advantages of the program for this type of use is its ability to evaluate non-linear structural behavior, and calculate elastic utilization of the structure. There are, however, uncertainties in the elastic utilization calculations when it comes to definitions of parameters such as buckling length. </p...|$|R

The accidental release of drop weights had caused fatal diving bell accidents in the North Sea in 1974 and 1976.

40|$|In this Master's thesis the sea lift {{operation}} from {{a supply}} vessel onto a oil platform has been evaluated. Two {{models have been}} built and analysed with different input parameters, as well {{as compared with the}} current load charts based on the calculation procedure found in the standard EN 13852 - 1. The most critical part of the sea lift operation with regards to the structural safety of the crane is the lift-off from the supply vessel deck. The snap-load in the <b>lift</b> <b>wire</b> will depend on the motions of the lifted object, which is following the supply vessel deck motions. For floating platforms the motions of the crane tip must be accounted, and hence the coupled system of the supply vessel and the platform must be evaluated to estimate the extremal snap-loads in the <b>lifting</b> <b>wire.</b> The two simulation models have been developed in the simulation program SIMA, which is a state of the art simulation program developed especially for simulation of marine operations. The first model is built to represent a fixed platform, and is hence a general model representing bottom-supported and jack-up platforms. The second model is modelled as a semi-submersible platform, representing the Kristin platform located at Haltenbanken in the North-Sea. The wave statistics for Haltenbanken have been analysed to find the most common significant wave heights, spectral peak periods and wave headings for the area over time. The extremal snap-loads are found by fitting a Gumbel distribution to the respective simulation results sample. It is found that the probability level of exceedance for the dynamic factors given by EN- 13852 are deviating between the models. For the different significant wave heights for the fixed platform, the EN 13852 - 1 represents a probability of exceedance of 0. 999 when the container is placed in the stern end of the supply vessel deck. For the floating platform the same probability of exceedance are roughly 10 % below the standard, and is hence much more conservative.|$|R

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{industry is}} constantly seeking {{to operate in}} more extreme conditions. DeepOcean is a subsea service company, where offshore lifts {{is a part of}} every day operations. To remain competitive, it is important to reduce operational downtime, where time spent waiting on weather {{is one of the main}} contributors. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate how shielding effects influence the operational limit for offshore lifting operations at different heading angles. Common practice in the offshore industry is to use long-crested waves when determining the operational limit, and shielding effects are often neglected, which is a conservative approach. A case study of two different structures, a Manifold and a ROV system, has been conducted. Repeated launch and recovery analyzes has been performed in Orcaflex, a time domain finite element program developed for static and dynamic analysis of offshore systems. Irregular waves are applied using a JONSWAP spectrum with $T_{p}= 5 - 19 s $ and $H_{s}= 1 - 4 m$ for the Manifold and $H_{s}= 2 - 8 m$ for the ROV system. Both long- and short-crested waves, as well as 4 heading angles have been investigated. Shielding effects has been accounted for by the use of Sea State RAOs calculated in WADAM, a hydrodynamic analysis program for calculation of wave-structure interaction. The maximum tension in the <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> is considered as the dimensioning parameter. Gumbel extreme value statistics has been used to evaluate the distribution of maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> tension, based on 20 simulations per sea state. The calculated maximum wire tension was found to be highly dependent on whether or not slack would occur during a simulation. A slack wire result in snap loads with unpredictable magnitude. Incorporation of shielding in the simulations resulted in a significant drop in the occurrence of slack, for both structures. Thus, shielding effects is found to reduce the uncertainty related to the maximum tension due to a reduction in snap loads. The operational limit for the Manifold was increased with 0. 5 - 1. 0 m on average when shielding was included for most periods and heading angles, for both long-and short crested waves. The results obtained for the ROV was found to be highly unpredictable in magnitude due to slack occurring in the dominating part of the simulations, especially for steep waves. In contrast shielding showed to have a consistent positive effect, for heading angles with low vessel motion in roll...|$|R

40|$|As {{a service}} company {{performing}} subsea operations, DeepOcean wishes {{to operate in}} the widest range of sea conditions. The majority of all offshore operations are performed using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), where lifting through the splash zone is considered the most critical phase during launching and recovery of the ROV system. Available standards from DNV propose a systematic and analytical approach for estimating the hydrodynamic loads occurring in the splash zone. A maximum operational significant wave height, Hs, is determined using a proposed acceptance criteria. Experience from the industry have shown that the method is unreasonable conservative, consequently leading to a restrictive operational Hs window. The main objective of this master thesis is to compare results obtained from the analytical calculations with results obtained from the time domain simulation programs; Simulation of Marine Operations (SIMO) and OrcaFlex. The operational limit established in the time domain programs {{is based on the assumption}} that the maximum relative velocity between the crane tip and the waves represent a worst case scenario and that a slack <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> is not acceptable. This is due to the uncertainties associated with snap loading after a slack <b>lifting</b> <b>wire.</b> Three different ROV models have been established, two in OrcaFlex and one in SIMO. A sensitivity study regarding the hydrodynamic coefficients for the ROV models is also performed. The three different ROV models show different dependency of the added mass and drag term. The overall trend for the ROV systems is that the added mass dependency is reduced for the structures modelled with multiple elements, while the drag dependency is increased. The Simplified Method is certainly conservative compared to time domain simulations performed in SIMO and OrcaFlex. The present operational sea state of Hs = 4. 5 m is rejected by the Simplified Method. If the operation is to be performed independent of a Tz value, an operational Hs of 0. 75 m is acceptable according to the analytical calculations. From the time domain analyses in SIMO and OrcaFlex, the current operational sea state of Hs = 4. 5 m could be justified if a limiting Tz is given. For launching this limiting value is 9 s, while for recovery of the ROV system the limiting Tz value is 8 s. The operational limit should not only be set by a Hs value, but also a Tz due to the large dependency of the wave period for lifting though the splash zone. Simulating the ROV lift operation in a time domain simulation program has proven to be a good alternative compared to the Simplified Method. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the dynamic air cushion {{pressure}} inside suction anchors during low- ering through the splash zone has been studied. A non-linear continuity equation {{for the air}} mass is used to establish a theoretical model for the dynamic air cush- ion pressure. Buoyancy forces due to dynamic air cushion pressure inside the suction anchors are calculated until the wave elevation inside the suction anchor reach the top. At impact Wagner s wedge method together with Von Karman s wetted length {{is used to calculate}} the impact force on the cone-shaped suction anchor top. Important parameters aﬀecting the dynamic air cushion pressure and thus the buoyancy forces have been investigated. Force measured in <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> during splash zone transition of a single suction anchor is used as basis for comparison. The parameters that are investigated are introduction of a time-varying lowering velocity, changing characteristics of the ventilation hatch outlet and introducing regular and irregular waves. By varying these parameters a best-ﬁt comparison with 2. 5 [%] deviation between calculations and measurements have been ob- tained. Further, a comparison between theoretical calculations and force measurements from a lifting operation of a subsea structure with suction anchors as foundation has been performed. The buoyancy forces calculated prior to impact are due to the dynamic air cushion pressure alone. The total force in the <b>lifting</b> <b>wire</b> for this phase are corresponding well to the magnitude of the measured force. During this comparison the eﬀect of changing perforation ratio clearly show an increase of buoyancy forces for decreasing size of ventilation hatch. Including both inﬂow and outﬂow of air from the suction anchors when oscillating in large waves have also been studied. When comparing with force measurements the im- portance of including both inﬂow and outﬂow of air to account for both suction and compressive pressure has been shown. This lead to negative and positive buoyancy forces respectively. Long crested waves accounting for wind and swell sea are calculated with the JONSWAP- and Torsethaugen-spectra. By using empirical formulas for the lim- iting case between wind and swell sea it is shown that wind sea is the dominating part for the sea state measured during splash zone transition of the suction an- chors. Using Wagner s wedge model together with Von Karman s wetted length for cal- culating impact force on a ﬂat suction anchor top is also performed. Impact forces with impact angles in the range of 5 - 15 degrees between the wedge-shaped water and top overestimate the force compared with measurements. A best-ﬁt for the impact forces with the measurements has been obtained with deadrise angle of 17. 5 [deg] in addition to impact forces calculated with a time-varying slamming coeﬃcient. Possible resonant phenomena connected with oscillations of suction anchor and pressure measurements at impact have been studied. Simpliﬁed models for cal- culating A) natural period of oscillating air cushion, B) piston mode of water column and C) coupled piston mode of air cushion and water column has been developed. These have been compared with oscillation-period of pressure mea- surements observed after impact of a single suction anchor. These calculations have also been compared with oscillations of the suction anchor observed from videos of experiment. Case B) proved to give the most similar results with the suction anchor oscillations while case A) and C) were not in the proximity of the observed oscillations. This showed that the air cushion were not causing any resonant motion. Using a common safety criterion for avoiding slack in <b>lifting</b> <b>wire,</b> the calculation model have been used to give a recommendation for perforation ratios for the suction anchors used on the installation of the subsea structure studied here. Perforation ratios in the range 1 - 3 [%] used on suction anchor with diameters in the range 3 - 6 [m] proved to be well within the slack-wire limit. When using the theoretical model developed in this thesis a design recommen- dation for using ventilation hatches with a certain height have been made. Also uniform hatches are advised to ensure as similar conditions as possible for outﬂow and inﬂow of air...|$|R

A numerical model of the coupled system of the monopile and vessel is established.

The shielding effects of the vessel during the continuous lowering operation are accounted for in this study by developing an external Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that interacts with SIMO program in the time-domain simulations. The DLL is implemented by interpolating fluid kinematics between pre-defined wave points near the vessel.

During the lifting operation, especially under harsh environment, the waves, winds {{as well as the}} currents will leave significant influences on the template. Hence, to study how the template performed under such environmental conditions is the main purpose of this thesis. A brief introduction to the marine operation industry as well as the lifting operation is presented first. During the installation, template is exposed to the magnificent dynamic loads from the environment. So during the lifting process, the forces acting on the template as well as the displacement of the template should be inspected and controlled. Thus, the wave description and an introduction to the different dynamic loads due to the wave movement are performed. In addition, the methodology and the theory background of SIMA program is also included in this thesis. After building up the model of the lifting system in SIMA, the static and dynamic analysis of the lifting operation is performed. The results of the static and dynamic analysis are all listed in the thesis as figures or tables. The finding of the studies shows that the template experiences a significant drift in the wave induced direction for all sea-states. Besides, the dynamic load of the lifting lines can be more than twice than the static load. This will lead to a huge challenge to the capacity of the <b>lifting</b> <b>wires.</b> Additionally, the vertical motion of the template is sufficient large during the lifting operation and may lead to potential risk. Overall, the environmental conditions have magnificent influences on the lifting structures. In particular, lifting operations must not take place once the significant wave height exceeds an up-limitation. On the meantime, the lifting action needs to be paused if the wave peak period is approaching a critical value. </p...|$|R

Thinner incidence wires are sometimes run diagonally between fore and aft interplane struts to stop the wing twisting and changing its angle of incidence to the fuselage. In some pioneer aircraft, wing bracing wires were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under side loads such as when turning. Besides the basic loads imposed by lift and gravity, bracing wires must also carry powerful inertial loads generated during manoeuvres, such as the increased load on the landing wires at the moment of touchdown.|$|R
