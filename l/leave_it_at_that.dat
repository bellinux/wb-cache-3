25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Not Fade Away" [...] {{the finale}} of the series, Angel visits Connor for {{coffee on the}} eve of his final battle with the Circle of the Black Thorn. Connor reveals that he remembers that Angel is his father. He tells Angel he is {{grateful}} for all he has done for him, but he prefers to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> When Angel fights Marcus Hamilton, Connor shows up to fight by his father's side (knowing that Angel wouldn't do something so innocuous unless the world were about to end), saving Angel from being staked by Hamilton and helping him gain the upper hand. As the Senior Partners begin to exact their vengeance, Angel tells Connor to go home to his foster parents and assures him that as long as Connor is safe, the Partners can never destroy Angel.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{takes its}} title from a quote often {{attributed}} to Hassan-i-Sabbah: [...] "Nothing is true, everything is permitted". When {{it comes to}} how this quote relates to the album's concept, Turner is again reluctant to reveal too much. [...] "I'll just say that much of working on this record, for me, was about the power and nature of perception, {{and the ways in}} which it affects our behavior and the way we see the world," [...] he says. [...] "I'll just <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> and people can draw their own conclusions." ...|$|E
50|$|Everyone around Augustus is {{amazed at}} his explanation, and they wholeheartedly believe his point {{that nothing is}} impossible, though the warden asks what would have {{happened}} if many of the key elements of Augustus's escape had not been present. Augustus smiles smugly and states that there were also two other ways out, and <b>leaves</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{questioned}} about if anything {{she could have}} said indirectly have caused Marie to hang herself, the warden denies this. One of the girls talks to Anne and apologizes for their actions towards her and tells Anne that she knows she's innocent of the crime she was accused of committing. She tells her to talk to Dear Old Margen and <b>leaves</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
50|$|Striking down section 72(4) and <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> {{the court}} held, would leave a vacuum {{in the present}} {{legislative}} structure {{which was designed to}} deal with conduct that hinders the administration of justice. In this regard, the court thought it important to bear in mind that section 72(4) deals with the case of an accused who has failed to comply with the warning to appear in court. There was no other provision that dealt with such an accused. While it was true that Parliament could remedy the situation, that would take time; in the interim a gap would remain.|$|R
2500|$|In the Nicomachean Ethics, {{written in}} 350 BCE, Aristotle stated that {{happiness}} (also being well and doing well) {{is the only}} thing that humans desire for its own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy. Note that eudaimonia, the term we translate as [...] "happiness", is for Aristotle an activity rather than an emotion or a state. Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way. Specifically, Aristotle argues that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity. [...] He arrives at this claim with the Function Argument. [...] Basically, if it's right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For humans, Aristotle contends, our function is to reason, since it is that alone that we uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is one's good. Thus, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle does not <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> however. For he argues that there is a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity. This second best life is the life of moral virtue.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the reunion}} {{between father and}} {{daughter}} proved to be joyous, {{there was no such}} reunion between Jeanie and Gladys. Jeanie did manage to contact Gladys, but Gladys wanted no part of the relationship and refused to see her. She later died in 2001, but not without informing her only son Peter, (by her marriage to George Seibert who had died a number of years earlier), that he had a half sister named [...] "Jeanie". <b>Leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> she kept the pictures and letter Jeanie sent in her desk where Peter was able to locate them after she died, and he ended up contacting Jeanie.|$|R
60|$|Sex {{attraction}} is so purely {{a question of}} the taste of the individual that the wise man never argues about it. He accepts its vagaries as part of the human mystery, and <b>leaves</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> To me there was no charm whatever about Mary Campbell. It may have been <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> the moment, I was in love with Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley--for at Marois Bay, in the summer, a man who is worth his salt is more than equal to three love affairs simultaneously--but anyway, she left me cold. Not one thrill could she awake in me. She was small and, to my mind, insignificant. Some men said that she had fine eyes. They seemed to me just ordinary eyes. And her hair was just ordinary hair. In fact, ordinary was the word that described her.|$|R
5000|$|On June 20, 2008, bassist Derek Harn {{issued a}} {{statement}} via blabbermouth.net as follows:"After 10+ years, four releases, countless tours and almost incomprehensible (yet constant) upheaval, {{the last three years}} of the band have been relatively stable. Having sacrificed everything we had in order to ensure the band's survival it's time to let it go. We made a great CD ('Summon in Thunder', Century Media); reportedly, our best. We've got a great label. We're getting along, we've toured and we’re fine. It's all good. We're <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> A relatively unremarkable closing to HIMSA's gi-normously dramatic career, {{there appears to be no}} acrimony or unpleasantness, simply the end of a blistering, phenomenal, tumultuous era of the metal that HIMSA permeated into the modern musical landscape. References have been made to the band's evolving difficulties with the relentless touring schedules that have been the hallmark of HIMSA's career. If we can't tour, and our reality is we can't tour as we have in the past, then it's not HIMSA. Better to hang it up than fade away.” ...|$|R

50|$|Harvard 1980, {{a radical}} {{human rights activist}} group are seeking {{a way to put}} their group into the public eye. Member Kathy Lakas {{suggests}} they organise the rescue of Rudolf Hess, then being held for nearly 40 years {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Lakas, given the permission to employ a mercenary soldier to plan the rescue bid, hires Lebanese mercenary John Haddad. Haddad accepts the offer in part and travels to West Berlin, in the heart of East Germany, to conduct a reconnaissance into the feasibility of the operation. While in West Berlin, Haddad is kidnapped by a mysterious group of vicious Germans led by an ill looking middle aged man. They already know who Haddad is and have guessed why he is in Berlin, but they torture him all the same and leave him for dead. Hospitalised from the beating, Haddad is visited by British Army Major Reed-Henry who questions him on his activities. He shows Haddad photographs of the men who attacked him, revealing the leader as Karl Stroebling, a KGB operative and terrorist group leader. Again Reed-Henry already suspects why Haddad is in Berlin, but <b>leaves</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{next day}} Lord Ambrose sends a {{dismissal}} to Christine {{for refusing to}} come back to his apartment. Lord Ambrose chooses a more willing but less talented singer to take Christine's place. When Harry refuses to accept this he is also dismissed by Lord Ambrose. Visiting Christine at her boarding house, Harry finds some old manuscripts which he recognizes as a rough draft of the opera he has been producing. Questioning Christine's landlady Mrs. Tucker, he learns that it was written by a former boarder by the name of Professor Petrie, who had been killed in a fire <b>at</b> a printers <b>that</b> was to print his music. Making further inquiries, he learns that Petrie did not actually perish in the fire, but was splashed with Nitric Acid while apparently trying to extinguish the blaze, had run away in agony and was drowned in the River Thames. This is confirmed by the policeman who was in the area at the time, but the body was never recovered. Harry and Christine have a romantic day together. While having a moonlight carriage ride Harry tells her about Petrie, and that he is convinced that Lord Ambrose stole Petrie's music. He <b>leaves</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> as he believes that the Professor is long since dead.|$|R
5000|$|In retrospect, it is {{apparent}} that the Tu-144 suffered from a rush in the design process to the detriment of thoroughness and quality, and this rush to get airborne exacted a heavy penalty later. The rush {{is apparent}} even in outward timing: the 1963 government decree launching the Tu-144 programme defined that the Tu-144 should fly in 1968; it first flew {{on the last day of}} 1968 (31 December) to fulfill government goals set five years earlier. (By the way of comparison, Concorde's first flight was originally scheduled for February 1968, but was pushed back several times until March 1969 in order to iron out problems and test components more thoroughly). Unlike Concorde development, the Tu-144 project was also strongly driven by ideologically and politically motivated haste of Soviet self-imposed racing against Concorde; Aleksei Poukhov, one of Tupolev's designers, reminiscences: [...] "For the Soviet Union to allow the West to get ahead and <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> behind <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time was quite unthinkable. We not only had to prevent the West from getting ahead, but had to compete and leapfrog them, if necessary. This was the task Khrushchev set us... We knew that when Concorde's maiden flight had been set for February or March, 1969, we would have to get our plane up and flying by the end of 1968." ...|$|R

50|$|Ralf Mojsiejenko’s 52-yard field-goal attempt went wide left, costing Michigan State {{three points}} early. Another {{chance at the}} Army 5 for a {{touchdown}} led to an interception. A Spartan fumble led to an Army score. Clarence Jones scored the first Army points in a bowl game with a 4-yard touchdown run with 6:31 {{left in the first}} half to culminate a 8 play, 46 yard drive. This proved to be the halftime lead for the Cadets. In the fourth quarter, another Spartan fumble led to a score as Craig Stopa increased the lead to 10 with his 38-yard field goal with 8:40 left in the game. Bob Wasczenski caught a 36-yard touchdown pass to narrow the lead with 4:19 remaining. On their conversion attempt, the pass failed, <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> 10-6. From <b>that</b> point, Army and Michigan State played stalemate as Army won their first ever bowl game. The Cadets controlled the clock for 34:05. Nathan Sassaman rushed for 136 yards on 28 carries. Yarema was sacked three times and intercepted three times on route to an 11-of-25 155-yard performance.|$|R
