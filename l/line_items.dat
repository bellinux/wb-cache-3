25|$|When {{asked how}} this {{proposed}} legislation {{was different from}} the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending <b>line</b> <b>items,</b> the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.|$|E

These program cuts are part of Rendell's proposal to cut state expenditures to a level 1 percent below the 2002-2003 budget in response to an expected 2.3 billion dollar budget shortfall. As a result of the budget crisis, Rendell spokesman Chuck Ardo resigned.|$|E

An offshore fueling terminal began operation in September 1967, allowing commercial tankers to unload fuel oil and aviation gas without docking at the busy fuel pier. The depot also supplied Clark Air Base with aviation fuel through a 41-mile (66km) pipeline. In addition to its fuel operations, NSD also stocked over 200,000 various items {{for use by the}} fleet.

25|$|Though the Supreme Court {{struck down}} the <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> Veto Act in 1998, President George W.

First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal Legislative <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> Veto Act of 2006 to Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senator Bill Frist, Senator John McCain, and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell jointly introduced this proposal.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012, Shaffir joined 10,000 protestors {{demanding}} that the proposed 2013 Israeli State Budget be made more favorable to middle and lower income Israelis. She was to soon learn that this was {{only the first step}} in creating the real budget. Almost immediately after the 2013 State budget was passed, the Finance Committee pushed through changes that largely benefited West Bank settlements and right wing ideological projects, while chipping away at social benefits. Shaffir learned that while the Finance Committee process is in theory meant to fill in the bits and pieces the national budget failed to account for, it quietly shifts <b>line</b> <b>items</b> by as much as 87%, dramatically altering the original budget. [...] Shaffir appointed a team of volunteers to investigate the budgetary transfers and eventually brought her concerns to the Supreme Court which ruled that the Finance Ministry must reach a compromise with Shaffir on a new method for budget transfers by February 2015.|$|E

50|$|In {{the draft}} of the Navy's unfunded {{priorities}} list for FY 2015, a $796 million <b>line</b> <b>item</b> was included for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) of USS George Washington. Before it {{was approved by the}} Pentagon and sent to Congress, it was vetted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and signed by Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert, after which the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> was removed. In a 31 March 2014 letter to Congress, Admiral Greenert said that the decision to remove the RCOH <b>line</b> <b>item</b> from the unfunded priorities list was made to align with budget decisions over the next several years. The list was for the FY 2015, so a decision to refuel or inactivate the carrier has to be made during FY 2016 budget planning with the fiscal outlook at that time and the possibility of sequestration funding levels. The removal of the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> removes funding for advanced procurement of materials for the overhaul; another <b>line</b> <b>item</b> had funding to remove the fuel from the ship, but not to overhaul or refuel it.|$|R

30|$|To {{generate}} the pallet {{data from the}} information contained in a TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item,</b> DALP-TS computes upper and lower bounds on the required number of pallets. The bounds indicate the smallest and largest number of pallets that could be created from the given cargo weight. In order to be a non-trivial load, pallets were assumed to have a lower weight bound of 2500  lb. The structural limitations of the pallet base, as well as most cargo aircraft, restrict the pallet upper weight limit to 10, 000  lb. Thus, if a TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item</b> specified 63, 800  lb of cargo, the minimum number of possible pallets is: 63, 800 / 10, 000  =  7, and the maximum number of pallets is: 63, 800 / 2500  =  25. DALP-TS randomly selects an integer between these bounds (inclusive) as the total number of pallets and assigns a random weight between 2500 and 10, 000  lb to each pallet such that the sum of the pallet weights equals the specified weight by the TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item.</b> Each pallet associated with a given TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item</b> has identical temporal constraints.|$|R
40|$|<b>Line</b> <b>item</b> veto, {{a feature}} present in most American States, gives the {{governor}} {{the power to}} veto single appropriation items from the budget. Its effects on the tax level, however, are still controversial in the empirical and theoretical literature (cf. Holtz-Eakins (1988) and Besley and Case (2003)). <b>Line</b> <b>item</b> veto is mostly a time invariant feature and to asses its effects previous studies have interacted it with political control variables such as a divided government. The endogenity problems that arise from using a political variable to explain a policy variable, however, have not been dealt with in these studies. We use three empirical approaches to tackle the problem and show that <b>line</b> <b>item</b> veto does have a significant {{negative effect on the}} tax rate in the States: diffs-in-diffs estimation with instrumental variables (election results in lower offices at the state level), regression discontinuity design, and a dynamic panel. Our prior on its effects comes from adapting the separation of powers model by Persson, Roland and Tabellini (2000) to the American States setup: we add <b>line</b> <b>item</b> veto and an executive. Our model delivers a clear prediction on the tax level, on the amount of public good, and on the importance of group specific transfers. ...|$|R
