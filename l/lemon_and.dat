5|$|The breed's {{history is}} {{uncertain}} before {{the middle of}} the 19th century. One theory is that it originated in France, stating that the Duc de Noailles {{at the time of the}} French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. The theory goes, that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was bred with Basset Hounds, and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees. A second theory is that it is descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel, which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel. Originally these dogs were large gundogs, colored <b>lemon</b> <b>and</b> white whereas the modern breed of them is a much smaller lap/toy breed of dog.|$|E
