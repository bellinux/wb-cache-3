40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{describes a}} <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> model that applies social media to foster contextualized and connected <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> in communities. The model emphasizes weaving together {{different forms of}} <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> activities {{that take place in}} different learning contexts to achieve seamless <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> It promotes social interactions with social media about the learners’ day-to-day life using the targeted second or foreign language. The paper first identifies three key features of the <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> approach, namely, authenticity, contextualization and socialization. How these features are related to the communicative approach of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> are subsequently explicated. This is followed by further explication on how the notion of seamless <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> could inform learning designers and learners in synergizing the desired characteristics of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> together. Eventually, we propose the SMILLA (Social MedIa as <b>Language</b> <b>Learning</b> Artifacts) Framework to operationalize seamless <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> with the use of social media. A case of seamless <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> environment design known as MyCloud will be described to illustrate the practicality of the SMILLA Framework...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{capability}} theory {{asserts that}} the learning capabilities of construction organisations influence {{the degree to which}} value-for-money (VfM) is achieved on collaborative projects. However, there has been little study conducted to verify this relationship. The evidence is particularly limited within the empirical context of infrastructure delivery in Australia. Primarily drawing on the theoretical perspectives of the resource-based view of the firm (e. g. Barney 1991), dynamic capabilities (e. g. Helfat et al. 2007), absorptive capacity (e. g. Lane et al. 2006) and knowledge management (e. g. Nonaka 1994), this paper conceptualises learning capability as a knowledge-based dynamic capability. Learning capability builds on the micro-foundations of high-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines,</b> which are deliberately developed by construction organisations for managing collaborative projects. Based on this conceptualisation of learning capability, an exploratory case study was conducted. The study investigated the operational and higher-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> adopted by a project alliance team to successfully achieve VfM. The case study demonstrated that the <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> of the alliance project were developed and modified by the continual joint learning activities of participant organisations. Project-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> were found to significantly influence the development of organisational-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines.</b> In turn, the learning outcomes generated from the alliance project appeared to significantly influence the development of project management routines and contractual arrangements applied by the participant organisations in subsequent collaborative projects. The case study findings imply that the higher-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> that underpin the learning capability of construction organisations have the potential to influence the VfM achieved on both current and future collaborative projects...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} various issues related to curriculum in foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> and in particular focuses on learning English as a foreign language (EFL). Foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> is taken to mean the <b>learning</b> of a <b>language</b> other than the learner’s first language (L 1), and this language is not ordinarily used in the learner’s everyday life. Thus, foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> contexts {{are very different from}} second <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> contexts, for in second <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> contexts, the <b>language</b> being <b>learned</b> is often used in the learner’s larger social context (even though it might not be always used in the learner’s immediate home or community).
