40|$|One of {{the main}} factors {{limiting}} molluscs production {{is the presence of}} pathogens and diseases. Disease agent transfer via transfers of live molluscs has been a major cause of disease outbreaks and epizootics. Because of that, the European Union has adopted several decisions and directives, the last in 2006 (2006 / 88 /EC) to control movements of marine organisms over the European countries. Once the disease is established in a determined area its eradication is a complicated task because life cycle of pathogens are not completely known and only a good and early diagnosis of the disease could be the most appropriate way to deal with it. Besides, molluscs do not have an adaptive immune response and vaccination strategies are not possible. Molluscs <b>listed</b> <b>diseases</b> under EU legislation are mainly protozoan parasites, that's why histological techniques are recognized for their diagnosis. However, molecular techniques are being increasingly used primarily as confirmatory techniques of the presence of the pathogens but also in disease monitoring programs. Research perspectives are mainly focussed in the optimization, of the already described techniques to gain in sensitivity and sensibility and in the development of new molecular biology techniques (quantitative real time PCRs), that are faster and easier to apply and that allow a positive diagnosis even in early stages of infection. However, molecular tools detect DNA sequences of the pathogen which does not imply that pathogen is viable in the cell host and the infection is established. Consequently, it needs to be validated against other techniques, such as histology or in situ hybridization, so that its reliability can be determined.

40|$|Acute hepatopancreatic {{necrosis}} disease (AHPND), formerly called early mortality syndrome (EMS), {{was first}} reported in 2010 among penaeid shrimps cultivated in the Mekong Delta Region of Viet Nam albeit without any laboratory confirmation. The disease subsequently spread {{to a wide}} range of shrimp production areas in the same region (Soc Trang: 1, 719 ha; Bac Lieu: 346 ha; and Ca Mau: 3, 493 ha), so that the Government of Viet Nam requested for technical assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in 2011. In 2012, FAO supported Viet Nam through the project TCP/VIE/ 3304 Emergency assistance to control the spread of an unknown disease affecting shrimps in Viet Nam, under which the Department of Animal Health of Viet Nam (DAH) collaborated with the University of Arizona and FAO experts to carry out indepth studies to identify the etiologic agent of the disease. As a result, unique isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was identified as the causative agent of AHPND in 2013. Viet Nam has been vigilant and transparent with regard to aquatic animal diseases through official notifications to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA). AHPND outbreaks have no clear temporal pattern with black tiger (Penaeus monodon) and whiteleg (P. vannamei) shrimps showing similar incidence risk. The disease occurs at any stage of shrimp cultivation, i. e. on average about 35 days after stocking. To date, unwarranted outbreaks of AHPND in major shrimp-producing provinces in Viet Nam have been apparently regulated. Aside from AHPND, white spot disease (WSD) has also been a persistent problem responsible for serious economic losses in many shrimp-producing areas in Viet Nam. To prevent and control the further spread of infectious diseases of shrimps including AHPND and WSD, multiple control measures have been implemented including guidance of farmers to improve production conditions, facilities and biosecurity application, active surveillance of shrimp production areas for early warning, screening of broodstock and postlarvae for any OIE <b>listed</b> <b>diseases,</b> regulation on movement of stocks, and collaboration with regional and international organizations in carrying out in-depth epidemiological studies that will be needed in the formulation of pragmatic and holistic disease interventions...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary In 1999, the National Disease Surveillance Centre (NDSC) {{was asked}} by the Department of Health and Chil dren to review the list of {{notifiable}} diseases and to make recommendations regarding additions or amendments to the current list. It was also asked to review the operation of the no tification system, to co nsider the need for case definitions, and whether laboratories should be required to notify the <b>listed</b> <b>diseases.</b> A sub-com m ittee of the NDSC was established to complete this task. In drawing up the report the sub-committee cons ulted widely with a ll professional grou ps involved in notification of infectious diseases. The main points highlighted in the report are as follows: • A new national system for surveillance of infectious diseases of public health importance should be established. In this system there will be four categories of notifiers, namely GPs, hospital clinic i ans, laboratory directors and public healt h doctors. Each notifier will be required to notify the Director of Public Health listed dis e ases or isolates that they enc ount er during the course of their work. As each c a tegory of notifier is likely to regularly identify only a subset of the total list of diseases, separate lists will be pr esented for each category, as w e ll as one masterlist of al l notifiable diseases. • The report recomme nds that th e term Me dical Officer of Health, which was abolished in law in 1998, be reintroduced, and that the Medical Officer of Health be the Director of Public Health. • There is litt l e advantage in hav ing an appro p riate list of diseases for notification if there is no formal 24 -hour a day, 7 -da ys per week system for responding to urgent notifications that require public health action. The report recommends that this issue be addressed as a matter of urgency. Page 4 • The changes propos ed are wide ranging. In order that the new system envisaged in the report group can be estab lished, a s i gnificant investment of resources will be required. This need for resources will arise in primary care, public healt h, in laboratories and at NDSC. • There is an urgent need to develop a nd support initiatives to introduce electronic communication between all partners in the system. Finally, the sub-committee are of the opinio n that establishing an implementation group would help the ordered, phased intr oduction of th e proposed new system...|$|E
