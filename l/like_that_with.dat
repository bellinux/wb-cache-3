5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E

They looked the same and performed the same acts as they had in their real-life pageants. To prepare for filming, the directors attended several pageants in Southern California and met with a coordinator {{to learn more about}} the pageant process. A mother of a contestant in the film claimed that the film overplayed practices that the contestants go through: [...] "Most pageants aren't quite <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> shaving the girls' legs, spraying them with fake tans and putting on so much makeup." ...|$|E

500|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} Brazil, Rapinoe came on as a {{substitute}} and served the precise cross to Abby Wambach's equalizer goal in the 122nd minute of the game: a goal that holds the record for latest goal ever scored in a World Cup match. Rapinoe would later convert her shot during the penalty shootout to help send the United States to the semifinals. Rapinoe described her last minute cross against Brazil: [...] "I just took a touch and friggin' smacked it with my left foot. I don't think I've hit a ball <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> my left foot. I got it to the back post and that beast in the air just got a hold of it." ...|$|E

This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E

Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, [...] "not least because I had {{recently}} sent Emilie a check myself." [...] He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there. Filmmaker Michael Haneke criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: [...] "There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well – but it was dumb." ...|$|E

In professional and research contexts, the term [...] "alcoholism" [...] sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.|$|E
500|$|The weapon {{fire on the}} set was {{considered}} dangerous, which led the crew {{to build a new}} bulletproof plexiglas shield that could be bolted to the camera. This shield was useful particularly for one sequence in Hard Target where Van Damme empties a magazine of ammo into the camera. These camera dollies were nicknamed by the crew as [...] "the Woo-Woo Choo-Choo". Russell Carpenter found difficulty in filming the huge gunfight scenes. Carpenter specifically noted the Mardi Gras parade warehouse by recollecting that [...] "just the lighting for a space <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> all those strange shapes and shadows was difficult enough, but John then added the further complication of wanting the scene shot from several angles at once—often with more than one of the cameras moving". Producer James Jacks supported this style of filming finding it the most economical way to shoot these types of action scenes.|$|E

[...] He told Chicago Tribune that his main intention of recording the album with Gaga was to introduce the jazz standards to a younger audience, believing that the tracks had a [...] "universal appeal" [...] and [...] "timeless quality" [...] about them. Gaga told The Daily Telegraph that with her earlier releases like The Fame (2008), The Fame Monster (2009), and Born This Way (2011), she felt unable to achieve her full vocal potential. She described Cheek to Cheek as a [...] "rebellious" [...] and [...] "liberating" [...] album for {{her because she was}} able to sing without worrying about record producers engineering it for radio.|$|E

The first single off the album, [...] "Next Thing You Know", was released June 20, a day before the album's release.

He then joined tobyMac's Winter Wonder Slam tour, beginning on December 1, 2005, along with John Reuben, BarlowGirl, GRITS, and DJ Maj. Two additional songs were released off History as singles: [...] "Only Grace" [...] and the title track [...] "History".|$|E
500|$|American rapper Angel Haze has {{released}} one studio album, one internet album, two extended plays (EPs), four mixtapes and nineteen singles (including four as a featured artist and nine promotional singles). In July 2012, after releasing two prior mixtapes, Haze released a mixtape Reservation online for free. The title {{is inspired by}} the act of reserving a table at a restaurant, saying [...] " [...] For me, it's <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> the rap industry. I made my reservation there [...] and now I'm finally arriving". The lead single [...] "New York" [...] peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the UK R Singles Chart. Shortly after, Haze released a commercial EP compiled of tracks from Reservation, titled New York, followed by a fourth mixtape, Classick. Throughout late 2013, during {{the run-up to the}} release of the debut album, Haze released a cover of a popular song every day, for thirty days. Most famous from these freestyles was the adaptation of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's track [...] "Same Love", which discusses childhood, prejudice, homophobia and sexuality.

500|$|Castroneves {{was upset}} about the penalty and leapt from his car and yelled in anger at the flagman (looking for an explanation) and grabbed the Head of Security Charles Burns as he sought an answer. He argued {{that he did not}} change his line: [...] "I {{actually}} gave him room outside. When you go side by side <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> your teammate and the guy [...] has just swept ... literally, literally just takes it away from you ... it's just absurd." [...] Castroneves was fined $60,000 by the IRL for unsportsmanlike conduct and was placed on probation {{for the rest of the}} season. It was later revealed by IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard that the series considered suspending Castroneves but chose not to because of his popularity with its fanbase. Castroneves later apologized for his actions but still did not agree with the penalty. Comparisons were made between Castroneves' block and the Brazilian's manoeuvre against Wilson in the 2008 Detroit Indy Grand Prix. Gordon Kirby of Motor Sport Magazine opined that Castroneves' move was fair and sportmanslike and noted that several fans saw it as [...] "good, hard racing".|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he {{and others}} {{involved}} with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa. He called the casting a [...] "no-brainer"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered {{for the role of}} Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that someone else is going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of what happened in this case," [...] stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 [...] "amazing". He added, [...] "You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> the numbers." [...] Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows.

[...] "I understand he (Cooke) is on my team but, hey, he's in a tough spot." [...] In a ruling, which has received wide criticism, Cooke was not given a suspension for the hit on Savard. On March 24, {{in response to the}} outcry over Cooke not being suspended, the league implemented a new rule aimed at prohibiting blindside hits to the head like the one Cooke delivered to Savard. In announcing the rule, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, [...] "The elimination of these types of hits should significantly reduce the number of injuries, including concussions, without adversely affecting the level of physicality in the game." [...] Earlier, Bettman appeared on Leafs Lunch on Mojo 640 in Toronto to discuss the Cooke hit on Savard. [...] "I was very unhappy and upset with that hit," [...] said Bettman. [...] "I was more upset there was nothing (in the League rules) to do to punish it." ...|$|E
