30|$|Figure  3 is {{the map of}} Taipei showing all 41 <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> that we analyse in this paper. We divide 41 Taipei <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> or housing sub-markets {{into five}} regions in Table  1, namely Central Taipei City (CT), the rest of Taipei City (RT), Satellite City (SC), Western Periphery (WP) and Eastern Periphery (EP) to {{investigate}} and compare the house price movements. We also combine these five regions into more coherent clusters according to administrative boundaries. Specifically, we combine CT and RT into a region-cluster; CT, RT, ST into a region-cluster; WP and EP into a region-cluster. The central Taipei city is the central geographic area in Taipei city, {{while the rest of}} Taipei city is referred to the other areas of Taipei city. Areas contiguous to Taipei city are named as Satellite city because these areas could be seen as extended areas of the Taipei city due to improved transportation and low commuting costs. The annual data is obtained for all 41 <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> in Taipei from 1992 to 2010. Therefore, in panel models, total number of observations is 738. In Central Taipei city, there are 5 <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> consisting of 90 observations; in the Rest of the Taipei city, there are 7 <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> consisting of 126 observations; in Satellite city, there are 11 <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> consisting of 198 observations; in the West Peripheral region, there are 7 <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> with 126 observations and in the East Peripheral region there are 11 <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> with 198 observations.
