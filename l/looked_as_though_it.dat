5|$|Elsewhere, Potemkin's {{scheme to}} develop a Russian {{presence}} in the rapidly disintegrating state of Persia failed. Plans for a full-scale invasion had previously been cut back and a small unit sent to establish a trading post there was quickly turned away. Potemkin focused instead on Russia's southern provinces, where he was busy founding cities (including Sevastopol) and creating his own personal kingdom, including his brand new Black Sea Fleet. That kingdom was about to expand: under the Treaty of Kuçuk Kainarji, which had ended the previous Russo-Turkish war, the Crimean Khanate had become independent, though effectively under Russian control. In June 1782 it was descending again into anarchy. By July 1783, Potemkin had engineered the peaceful annexation of the Crimea and Kuban, capitalizing {{on the fact that}} Britain and France were fighting elsewhere. The Kingdom of Georgia accepted Russian protection a few days later with the Treaty of Georgievsk searching for protection against Persia's aim to reestablish its suzerainty over Georgia; the Karabakh Khanate of Persia initially <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> might also, but eventually declined Russian help. Exhausted, Potemkin collapsed into a fever he barely survived. Catherine rewarded him with one hundred thousand roubles, which he used to construct the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg.|$|E
500|$|The injured paceman {{blocked the}} first ball he faced—the {{third of the}} over—and ran a bye after missing the next. The West Indian wicket-keeper tried to run Meckiff out, but missed the stumps at the non-striker's end with the batsman many metres out of his ground. Grout top-edged the {{following}} ball straight up into the air, but the two fielders who converged beneath it collided and dropped the catch, allowing the Australians to take another run. The hosts thus needed three runs from the last three balls. Meckiff faced the sixth ball; it was a half volley and he lofted it over square leg. The ball <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> would reach the boundary for a match-winning four runs; however, after landing close to the fence, it stopped rolling a metre short on the slow outfield. Grout attempted a third run, which would have won the match, but an accurate long throw saw him run out. The last man Lindsay Kline came in for the final two balls, with scores level, and the Australian pair agreed to run under all circumstances. Meckiff backed up significantly {{in anticipation of a}} quick single, and set off for the winning run after his partner hit the ball to square leg. However, he was run out by roughly a metre when Joe Solomon directly hit the stumps from side on, causing the first tie in Test history. Umpire Col Hoy said of his decision to give Meckiff out: [...] "God, it was easy. He was miles out." [...] The entire stadium—players and spectators alike—invaded the ground in excitement, but nobody was sure of the exact scores. It was only later that they realised the match was the first Tied Test; Meckiff initially thought Australia had lost and blamed himself for the result.|$|E

2500|$|The other seven {{opposition}} premiers were startled: Campaigning {{against the}} protection of rights was generally seen as political suicide, and a national referendum {{could be seen as}} [...] "conventionalizing" [...] the charter without the need for provincial approval. Further, Canadians nationwide were mostly in agreement with Trudeau on the issue and were tired of the constant constitutional talks; [...] The draft text of the Federal proposal was later revealed to involve the approval of Trudeau's reforms, with referendums being only if provinces representing 80% of the population demanded them within the two years. This prompted Lévesque to back away from the referendum proposal, saying it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "written in Chinese." [...] The conference descended again into acrimony, with Trudeau and Lévesque angrily clashing over language rights. Trudeau announced that he would attend one final meeting at 9am the following day and head to Westminster if agreement was not reached. Peckford announced that Newfoundland would forward a proposal the next day. Lévesque and the Quebec delegation went to sleep in Hull, Quebec, for the night.|$|E

[...] "I think my win the other day against Marat really gave me a confidence booster", he said. [...] It was Levine's first five-set victory, and only his second five-set match. [...] "I could have played a little bit longer", he said, [...] "But I'm glad I didn't have to." [...] Levine and Andy Roddick {{were the only two}} American men left standing in the tournament, and Levine was also by far the lowest-ranked player left in the men's draw.

[...] "Once again I'm the underdog", said Levine." [...] "I've got nothing to lose, so I'll go out there swinging away. [...] For the first set and a half of their match, Levine (described by The Sunday Times as having [...] "the pugnacity of Jimmy Connors and the fashion sense of Eminem") <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> was he who was the top 20 player, as he hit low forehands and approached and dominated the net, but in the end Wawrinka prevailed, 7–5, 5–7, 3–6, 3–6, despite Levine saving 17 of 23 break points in the match.|$|E
2500|$|Travis' second album, 1999's The Man Who, was {{produced}} by Nigel Godrich and recorded at producer Mike Hedges' chateau in France. The band continued recording at, among other studios, Abbey Road Studios in London. Shortly after release, The Man Who initially <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> would mirror the release of Good Feeling. Although it entered the charts at No.7, with little radio play of its singles, it quickly slipped down. Worse, many critics who had raved about the rocky Good Feeling rubbished the album for the band's move into more melodic, melancholic material (for example, [...] "Travis will be best when they stop trying to make sad, classic records"—NME). However, when the album slipped as far as No.19, it stopped. Word of mouth and increasing radio play of the single [...] "Why Does It Always Rain on Me?" [...] increased awareness of the band and the album began to rise back up the charts. Then, when Travis took the stage to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being dry for several hours, it began to rain {{as soon as the}} first line was sung. The following day the story was all over the papers and television, and with word of mouth and increased radio play of this and the album's other singles, The Man Who rose to No.1 on the British charts. It also eventually took Best Album at the 2000 BRIT Awards, with Travis [...] being named Best Band. Music industry magazine Music Week awarded them the same honours, while at the Ivor Novello Awards, Travis took the Best Songwriter(s) and Best Contemporary Song Awards.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{estimated}} that around 3.7 million people in Africa have {{died as a result}} of wars funded by conflict diamonds. Failed elections, money laundering, civil wars (in Angola, Liberia, and other parts of Africa) etc. have encouraged a significant amount of illegal gem sales, with profits aiding rebel forces like the Revolutionary United Front and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and allowing for the continuation of civil unrest. Though reports differ, it {{is estimated}} UNITA produced about $600 million in diamonds annually in the late 1990s. These funds are used for foreign representation, travel, commodity procurement, and arms purchases, among other things. Angola's decades-long civil war <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> was ending in 1992, when its first multi-party democratic elections were held, but UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi declared the election [...] "neither free nor fair" [...] after he lost, and the fighting resumed. (The United States, under the Ronald Reagan administration and his successor, George H.W. Bush, had strongly supported Savimbi and the UNITA rebels in the late 1970s as he advocated for democracy and freedom during the Cold War.) [...] The United Nations took several steps to attempt to discipline these rebel actions, including restricting travel of UNITA senior officials, and prohibiting the sale of petroleum and related products from any country to Angola through United Nations Security Council Resolution 864. United States president Bill Clinton issued executive order 12865 to add U.S. sanctions in addition to the UN's efforts. In 1998 UNITA repealed another peace treaty and returned to war with the Angolan army, prompting the United Nations Security Council to investigate sanctions-busting operations and helping focus international attention on the link between diamonds and conflict in Africa.|$|E
