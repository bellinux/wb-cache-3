40|$|The lock {{planning}} problem aims at transferring {{a number}} of ships, which arrive within a certain time horizon, in the most efficient way. The problem requires a multi-objective approach: minimize the number of turnings of the lock by arranging different ships into the chambers and minimize the waiting time for each ship. This waiting time is the time between {{the arrival of a}} ship and the turning time of the ship. We applied a multiple neighbourhood search approach to the lock planning problem. In this approach the neighbourhoods are explored separately using the same starting solution. The best resulting solution from these searches is selected as the new starting solution for the multiple neighbourhood search. This process is repeated until none of the neighbourhoods generate improvements. When exploring the neighbourhoods, a candidate solution is accepted if it satisfies the <b>Late</b> <b>Acceptance</b> criterion. It depends on one parameter L only, which is the length of the acceptance list. A candidate solution will be compared to the solution that was ‘current’ L steps before. Increasing this parameter will allow more worsening moves, and thus help avoiding local optima. When several improving moves exist, the best of them will be selected to update the acceptance list. To validate this new approach, we generated several test instances for the lock planning problem.

40|$|Abstract—Hyper-heuristics are {{high-level}} search methodologies used to {{find solutions}} to difficult real-world optimisation problems. Hyper-heuristics differ from many traditional optimisation techniques as they operate on a search space of low-level heuristics, rather than directly on a search space of potential solutions. A traditional iterative selection hyper-heuristic relies on two core components, a method for selecting a heuristic to apply at a given point and a method {{to decide whether or}} not to accept the result of the heuristic application. Raising the level of generality at which search methods operate is a key goal in hyper-heuristic research. Many existing selection hyper-heuristics make use of complex acceptance criteria which require problem specific expertise in controlling the various parameters. Such hyper-heuristics are often not general enough to be successful in a variety of problem domains. <b>Late</b> <b>Acceptance</b> is a simple yet powerful local search method which has only a single parameter to control. The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we will test the effect of the set of low-level heuristics on the performance of a simple stochastic selection mechanism within a <b>Late</b> <b>Acceptance</b> hyper-heuristic framework. Secondly, we will introduce a new class of heuristic selection methods based on roulette wheel selection and combine them with <b>Late</b> <b>Acceptance</b> acceptance criteria.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The Yogiebogeybox is a novel-in-stories. This novel explores spiritual {{transcendence}} and {{the connection}} of art to that spiritual journey. A variety of points of view are employed in the narrative in order to depict the journey of the protagonist, Ant Malo, through this journey. Some of the narrative threads are layered, told through filters, and filters {{are central to the}} theme of this novel. In each story, the narrators, many of whom speak through the author (a character named Tracy Boothman Duyck) comment on these journeys. In "Practical Jokes" a neighbor of Ant's, Sally, has a physical experience that is orchestrated by Ant, who rests secure in his good deeds. He believes that his deeds alone, inspired by a spirit of goodwill, make him a good man. "Prince Lovely and the Little Bigs" offers a portrait of Ant's daughter Regina, an adolescent girl whose opinion of her father, in the light of events that happen in her life, would differ from his own. "In the Company of Bards" illustrates Ant's <b>late</b> coming-of-age and <b>acceptance</b> of his transgressions in the physical world and depicts how the consequence of those transgressions compel him to seek a penance that shadows his daughter's fate. Stories like "Jimi Hendrix's Banshee," "Liturgy of the Hour," and " 2001 - A View from a Dreamscape Out West" and "More in the Way of Dreams," bring the spiritual and sub-conscience life of Ant Malo together, and couple the presence of the metaphysical with the mystery of existence. "Mama Junk," "The Salt of Time" and "Kennedy Plaza at Dusk" examine loss, a sense of obligation to self-preservation and the limitations that individuals bring to marriage, relationships and parenthood. Levity is provided through the sections that chronicle the process of the author and her muse, both of whom sincerely and vicariously experience events in these stories. Those sections further illustrate the reality of the writing life. Work is accomplished while the author and muse slog along, gossiping, sniping, mothering and imagining elaborate book deals and Hollywood options. Incidentally, all sections depicting the author-as-character are strictly fictional. Any similarity to the actual author's personality, temperament, appearance, predilections, or habits are purely coincidental...|$|R
40|$|In law {{practice}} financial problems between parties {{have a special}} value. On account of this, codes which include economicalsubstantials are being studied as research subjects. The most considerable of that codes which involve these features is The Codeof Execution and Bankruptcy. A lot of prescription periods are foreseened at the Code of Execution and Bankruptcy. Because,the Code of Execution and Bankruptcy saves creditor’s benefits and provides pulling in cash his credit promptly. By the way, thecode also conserves debitor’s benefits. One of the examples of this at Turkish Law of Execution and Bankruptcy is late objection. Actually, late objection helps to debitor, when he missed prescription period. Late objection is the only exception of objectionperiod. Late objection concept is put in order article sixty five and one hundred seventy four (paragraph four) at TurkishExecution and Bankruptcy Act. This research which embraces late objection in the law of execution and bankruptcy is consisted of four paragraphs. The firstparagraph’s primary topic is about {{the definition of the}} late objection. Secondary topic here is about practice of the late objectionin the law of execution and bankruptcy. After this topic the juridicial meaning of late objection takes place in the last topic in thisparagraph. The terms of the late objection demand are explained at the second paragraph. Whole paragraph includes fivefundamental terms of the late objection. All terms are explained with details in here. Third paragraph is about the juridicialconsequences of the <b>late</b> objection demand. <b>Acceptance</b> and refusal of the late objection demand are placed at this paragraph. Appeal request about the late objection adjudgement is expressed end of the paragraph. Also, this paragraph tells correction ofadjustment. At the conclusion paragraph, the concept of late objection is censured with negative and constructive aspects in thelight of de lege ferenda. According to Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Act, objection period to the order of payment is seven days. This periodstarts when debitor gets writing notice. If debitor does not object to order of payment in this period, the execution proceedingcome final. Hereafter, the only way of cutting down foregoing proceeding is late objection demand. But, the term of head to lateobjection demand is to be free from fault of debitor. Also, the debitor must have an excuse, like beiing in severe illness. Compelling reasons and unexpected events are rate as excuse for late objection, too. In this respect, late objection is accepted as alegal remedy. Essentially, with late objection demand, foregoing proceeding does not stop. Before all else, the court which takesthe objection demand can adjudge to cut down the proceeding with temporary injunction. If the court does not adjudgetemporary injunction about this demand, execution or bankruptcy proceeding does not stop. Whenever the excuse is accepted bythe court, foregoing proceeding is cut down. In this case, the court can accept the excuse or refuse the excuse. Because, Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Act article sixty five, gives to judge a judicial discretion. Thanks to this, in all the present cases, judgecan adjudge different decisions. Furthermore, judge can investigate this demand at a trial or only on a document basis. With thisassistance, time loss can be blocked. However, the debitor must put forward objections to order of payment with the lateobjection demand. Herein, the aim is barring time loss. With the same reason, article sixty five involves to pay all expenses of trial. This is one of the term of late objection demand according to article sixty five. The payment of trial expenses before judgedecides to give a hearing is can be criticised. Scarcely, this term increases the speed of judgement. Late objection can bu used in law of execution. It is also can be used in law of bankruptcy. This estimation is argued fromTurkish Execution and Bankruptcy Act article 65 and 173 / 4 clearly. But, there is a discussion here. Because, Turkish Executionand Bankruptcy Act subject that late objection is possible bankruptcy proceeding about commercial set. On the other hand, theact does not subject whether late objection is possible or not about general bankruptcy proceeding. According to doctrine andcaselaw debitor can use late objection right in spide of there is no clause in Execution and Bankruptcy Act. Therefore, there aresome fundamental terms of late objection demand. Before everything, debitor must have an excuse. And this acceptable excusemust have been prevented his objection to order of payment. Besides, debitor must be free from fault. If he has a fault aboutmissing objection period, he can not use this right. In one go, debitor must present his late objection brief to the venue. At last,trial expenses must have been paid by the debitor. When does the debitor present his late objection demand to the venue? He hastwo period limits here. He must present his late objection demand in three days. This period starts when the excuse disappears. The other time limit is about upper limit. Under the circumstances, the debitor must present late objection until converting intomoney pledged goods. This upper time limit changes in the law of banktrupcy. In here, the debitor can present his late objectiondemand until commercial court adjudjes debitor’s bankruptcy. Late objection is not similar with the case of unmethodicalnotification. For using late objection right, debitor must miss seven days objection period and late objection is his last chance. Butin this case, debitor does not know order of payment. In the case of unmethodical notification, period for order of payment doesnot start. If debitor has heard the notification, objection period starts at this time. Once at for all, parties of execution or bankruptcy proceeding can appeal with the Supreme Court for the adjudgment oflocal court. There is no article in the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Act about appeal. Certainly, right about appeal is aninalienable right. Just because of this, not only doctrine but also caselaw believe that parties appeal the adjudgement of courtabout late objection demand. In the mean time, the parties of execution or bankruptcy proceeding can want correction ofadjustment from Supreme Court, too...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Software testing {{relates to}} the process of {{accessing}} the functionality of a program. To ensure conformance, test engineers often generate a set of test cases to validate against the user requirements. When dealing with large line of codes (LOCs), there are potentially issues of redundancy as new test cases may be added and old test cases may be deleted during the whole testing process. To address redundancy issues, many useful strategies (e. g. HGS, GE, and GRE) have been developed in the literature. These strategies often put focus on getting the most minimum test suite size but give poor emphasis on test prioritization (i. e. ordering of tests). Here, as most testing activities happen toward the end of software development, testers are often forced to consider partial test suite, that is, to be in line with the project deadline. In this manner, some impactful defects may be missed owing to the need to accommodate deadline shift from earlier development activities. In order to address these issues, this paper highlights our on-going work on the development of a novel test redundancy reduction strategy based <b>Late</b> <b>Acceptance</b> Hill Climbing, called (LAHCS). LAHCS is the first known strategy that adopts <b>Late</b> <b>Acceptance</b> Hill Climbing Algorithm for test redundancy reduction and prioritization. I...|$|E

40|$|Interaction (t-way) {{testing is}} a common {{sampling}} strategy to minimize combinatorial test data from large configuration space based on the defined interaction strength (t). Here, all t-way strategies generate the t-way test suite with the aim to cover every possible combination produced by the interacting parameters (or also known as tuples). In many systems under test (SUT), there are some known combinations that are impossible to occur based on the requirements set to the system. These combinations (termed constraints) have to be excluded from the final test suite.

Tool characteristics, generalized in tool sets, prevent a particular tool from being installed on incompatible machines. However, tool generalization provides less detailed schedules. These schedules are conceived as timetables, {{as a result}} of the problems' xed time characteristics. General and specic constraints for tools and tool sets, in combination with a makespan objective, are considered while constructing schedules. In practice these schedules are constructed manually and are thus limited to a period of up to two weeks (short term), leaving room for improvement. This work presents techniques for generating long term (mul- tiple weeks or months) feasible solutions, focusing on multiple objectives. A <b>late</b> <b>acceptance</b> heuristic consisting of swap moves has been developed and tested on benchmark data. In addition, a prototype decision support tool has been developed and approved by practitioners. status: publishe...|$|E
