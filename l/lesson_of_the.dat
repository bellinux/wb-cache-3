5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E

25|$|Conspicuous compassion, the {{practice}} of publicly donating great sums of money to charity to enhance the social prestige of the donor, is sometimes described {{as a type of}} conspicuous consumption. This behaviour has long been recognised and sometimes attacked—for example, the New Testament story <b>Lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> widow's mite criticises wealthy people who make large donations ostentatiously while praising poorer people who make small but comparatively more difficult donations in private.|$|E

25|$|LaSalle sales had {{consistently}} exceeded Cadillac's since 1933, so {{the question}} arises, why did GM decide to drop LaSalle? Evidently the <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packard One-Twenty had been weighing {{on the minds of}} the executives at GM. Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively. Since LaSalle had been a Cadillac in all but name for most of its lifespan, it was {{decided it was time to}} bestow upon it the prestigious title of Cadillac.|$|E
500|$|In the Academy Award winning Errol Morris {{documentary}} The Fog of War, Robert McNamara recalls {{an anecdote}} he read about Sherman during the Civil War, {{in which the}} mayor of Atlanta pleaded with Sherman for mercy before he torched {{the city to the}} ground, to which Sherman responded, [...] "War is cruelty." [...] McNamara uses the story as a parallel to the usage of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, while he was Secretary of Defense, to illustrate the ninth <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film: [...] "In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Militarily, {{there was}} not {{much in the way of}} {{tactical}} or strategic innovation during the Persian invasion, one commentator suggesting it was something of [...] "a soldier's war" [...] (i.e., it was the soldiers rather than generals that won the war). Thermopylae is often used as a good example of the use of terrain as a force multiplier, while Themistocles's ruse before Salamis is a good example of the use of deception in warfare. The major <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invasion, reaffirming the events at the Battle of Marathon, was the superiority of the hoplite in close-quarters fighting over the more-lightly armed Persian infantry. Taking on this lesson, the Persian empire would later, after the Peloponnesian War, start recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries.|$|E

500|$|Finland has {{received}} some very critical feedback from Russia for even considering {{the possibility of}} joining NATO, with a 2009 study suggesting this could have repercussions for Russia's relations with the EU and NATO as a whole. Following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen reiterated that Finland {{had no plans to}} join NATO, and stated that the main <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war was the need for closer ties to Russia. In a June 2014 interview in the Finnish newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet, Vladimir Putin's personal envoy Sergey Alexandrovich Markov accused Finland of extreme [...] "Russophobia" [...] and suggested that Finland joining NATO could start World War III. [...] In July 2016, Putin stated on a visit to Finland, that Russia would increase the amount of troops on the Finnish border if Finland were to join NATO. He also warned that NATO would [...] "fight to the last Finn against Russia".|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} their new-found attitude, the town holds a [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival. However, the festival soon goes awry because {{those responsible for}} building the stages and maintaining the rides [...] "didn't feel like" [...] doing a thorough job, resulting in a runaway Ferris wheel and more. Arguments begin, as everybody has been encouraged to always say exactly what is on their mind, and soon a riot starts. Bart is quickly blamed for starting the whole [...] "Do As You Feel" [...] trend. The town chases after Bart, but Homer drives by in a float and saves him. The town gives up the chase despite the float's slow speed and decides {{to go to the}} old mill to get some cider.

500|$|New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley {{published}} {{a volume of}} memoirs, Time Present, Time Past in 1996. [...] In it, the Democrat mentioned having written a high-school report on Hanna—his history teacher, Bradley related, {{told him that the}} <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1896 campaign is that money is power. [...] Bradley, a former basketball player, mentioned that when he was being interviewed in high school, he stated that Hanna was one of his heroes. [...] By the time he wrote the book, however, Bradley had come to believe in limits on campaign spending and blamed Hanna for a sharp escalation in campaign costs. [...] Bradley also stated what Horner terms mischaracterizations of Hanna: that he was the Republican boss of Ohio, and that he did his best to disrupt Roosevelt's presidency. [...] Bradley alleged that since 1896, Republicans have raised money easily from the rich. [...] Despite his condemnation of Hanna, Bradley wrote that he regretted that he could not find a Hanna-like figure who could play an analogous role in advancing his political career.|$|E
