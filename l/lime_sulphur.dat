Its control is {{especially}} difficult in organic production systems that rely on copper- and sulphur-based fungicides which are not very effective and demand {{a high number of}} applications throughout the season. The most commonly used fungicide in organic apple production is <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur,</b> which is known to be phytotoxic, especially towards the cultivar 'Braeburn'. The influence of different application rates of <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> (1 % anti 2 %) was evaluated when applied 11 times throughout the growing season from October to February. As varieties differ in their susceptibility to <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur,</b> the two cultivars 'Royal Gala' and 'Braeburn' were compared in this study. Black spot incidence and severity, russet development and postharvest quality parameters were evaluated. At harvest, residues of sulphur on and in the apple were determined as total sulphur, total water-soluble non-protein thiol compounds and cysteine content. Both cultivars behaved similarly to the application of <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur,</b> but 'Braeburn' was affected to a greater extent. <b>Lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> decreased background colour, blush, firmness, soluble solids content and dry matter content in both cultivars; fruit size in 'Braeburn' and titratable acidity in 'Royal Gala'.

40|$|Conclusions {{and further}} studies The {{significant}} reduction of T. pyri and of larvae of predaceous gall midges, {{the complete loss of}} mite-diversity {{and the possible}} enhancement of P. ulmi and other harmful mites (i. e. C. vitis) are clear disadvantages of <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Densities of T. pyri between 0. 5 and 1 mite per leaf as mentioned to be necessary for controlling harmful mites (BOURQUIN 1989, FORTMANN 1993, HARZER 1993, KARG 1992, KOHLER ET AL. 1991), were never reached in <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> treatment, while the untreated control always showed densities above this value. On the other hand low densities of predaceous mites are quite normal in intensively sulphur treated, biological orchards and are often replaced by other mite predators, like predatory bugs (Miriadae, Anthocoridae) or the coccinellid beetle Stethorus punctillum (HÄSELI & BOSSHARD 1994). Therefore further studies should include these arthropods, because <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> may also have adverse effects on them (BORIANI 1994, BROWN 1978). Furthermore the lowest application strategy in terms of frequency and concentrations for scab control should be examined to minimise the quantity of applied <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> (ZIMMER 2000). In addition the effects of different application methods, for example by sprayer or overhead irrigation on beneficial arthropod as well as on scab should be studied (KELDERER ET AL. 2000). The side effects of <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> should not be considered separated from other used fungicides, moreover the whole spraying program should be included, because wettable sulphur (MILAIRE ET AL. 1974) and clay powder (HÄSELI & BOSSHARD 1994) also harm arthropods. For agronomic interests but also from the points of view of the registration of <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> and the public image of organic apple growing, the question is: whether lots of preventive applications with copper, sulphur and clay powder have more adverse effects on beneficial arthropods than fewer curative applications of <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> by using an infestion prediction model. Only by further studies under realistic farming conditions it is estimable, whether the use of <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> in organic orchards can be accepted.

40|$|AbstractIn Kenya, {{smallholder}} farmer's production {{accounts for}} 75 % of total agricultural output and 70 % of marketed agricultural produce.

Consequently, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) in collaboration with OCP-Morocco initiated a three year multi-location on-farm trials to evaluate the efficiency of two OCP sulphur fertilizer formulations: NPS: 19 : 38 : 0 : 7 S and NPS: 12 : 46 : 0 : 7 S on maize, soybean and climbing beans. The field trials started in October and were conducted in 56 farms across four counties of Central Kenya. The trials design is randomized complete block (RCB) with farms in one cluster acting as replicates. Four treatments consisting of two OCP sulphur containing fertilizers (NPS), Diammonium phosphate and NP- 23 : 23 were all tested against the farmer's practice (FP) on maize, soybeans and climbing beans. Results obtained indicated significant yield differences between treatments (P< 0. 05) within the counties.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a {{heavy metal}} trace element which {{presents}} risks for the horticultural industry in New Zealand (NZ). This element is added to soils through phosphate fertiliser application, and once there may be available for plant uptake and food chain transfer. When food products exceed international standards for Cd concentrations, these products may be excluded from international markets upon which NZ relies to maintain its economy. This presents a reputational risk for NZ’s horticultural exports. Soil pH and organic matter (OM) content are the two key drivers influencing Cd’s bioavailability, and field trials are currently being undertaken in four horticultural sites throughout NZ – Pukekawa, Manawatu, and two adjacent sites at Lincoln – to test {{the efficacy of the}} use of lime and compost amendments to influence these soil variables and thus reduce Cd plant uptake from soils. Potatoes are grown at all sites while Lincoln also includes wheat. This research aimed to characterise these soils, including total and plant-exchangeable Cd concentrations, pH, OM content, cation exchange capacity, total and plant-exchangeable Zn concentrations, aluminium and iron oxide content, total phosphorus and total nitrogen content. Findings indicated that total Cd concentrations varied among sites, with the highest (0. 52 mg kg- 1) at Pukekawa, followed by Manawatu (0. 26 mg kg- 1) and Lincoln Wheat and Potato sites (both 0. 13 mg kg- 1). Exchangeable Cd concentrations were low at all sites (0. 01 - 0. 02 mg kg- 1) indicating little risk of plant uptake from these soils. The mitigation strategy tested in this work focuses on pH as a key soil variable that can be readily changed to restrict Cd uptake. However, the effectiveness of amendment rates to effect target pH values is dependent on soil chemistry and rates will vary across sites. Incubation experiments were conducted to determine amendment rates for <b>lime</b> and <b>sulphur,</b> and to compare the pH of amended soil in a laboratory situation with the in-field situation. Incubation and field situations were found to be similar, with no significant differences between pH values after a period of 274 days in the incubator and 169 days in the field. The accuracy of the calculated amendment rates at achieving target pH values was assessed with extended incubation experiments. The results here varied between soils, with the sulphur application rate proving more accurate in the Pukekawa soil, however too high for the Manawatu and Lincoln potato soils. The calculated liming application rate similarly resulted in a higher-than-target pH, however after a period of 231 - 274 days the pH reduced and approached the target value. A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken to determine the economic viability of the proposed mitigation strategy at each potato site. Results proved the strategy to be a viable option, which would remain viable in the face of varying uncertainty and reductions in potato yields. Practical considerations including timing and weather conditions, and compost availability were considered. Implementation of this strategy within NZ’s current framework of the Tiered Fertiliser Management System, which focuses on total rather than exchangeable Cd concentrations, may present difficulties, and thus there is a clear need for risk-based, soil and crop specific guidelines for Cd management within a NZ context. Considering the apparent difficulties in designing pH amendments strategies, a model to convert pH buffer curve-generated lime application rates which can be derived in as little as 24 hours, to field applicable application rates which target a specific soil pH was developed for the Pukekawa soil. A similar model was not achieved for the Lincoln Wheat soil, and thus the development of such a model is not possible for all soil types. Where possible, the development of this model would be an innovative and useful tool for farmers with which to accurately and quickly determine required lime application rates to achieve a targeted soil pH. This would be of great benefit in the implementation of a Cd mitigation strategy using lime amendments, and would allow greater control over, and management of, soil pH in a horticultural context...|$|R

40|$|Abstract –The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the toxicity of organic farming‑compatible products to the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella. <b>Lime</b> <b>sulphur,</b> enriched Bordeaux mixture (Viça Café Plus), and the “supermagro ” biofertilizer were first tested in laboratory. The most promising product was tested afterwards under field conditions. In laboratory, different concentrations of each product were applied on L. coffeella eggs and on infested coffee‑mined leaves. Only <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> had ovicidal effects at an acceptable concentration (1. 6 %) for field applications, but no significant effect on larvae mortality was found.

40|$|In {{less than}} 50 years Africa {{has changed from}} a food {{exporting}} region to being the largest importer of food worldwide. An increase {{in the use of}} fertilizers could help to rectify this situation but imported fertilizers are expensive to purchase and to transport to remote rural areas. The use of locally-available supplies, on the other hand, would transform the availability and cost of the much-needed plant nutrients. Throughout Africa crop production is constrained by low-fertility soils and even with adequate moisture soil nutrient levels are invariably insufficient for crops to express their full yield potential. Compost and manure can help maintain soil fertility but only by removing nutrients from elsewhere. Nitrogen-fixing plants can add nutrients to the soil, but even they contribute relatively small quantities of nitrogen and should be seen as a complement to fertilizer nitrogen rather than a substitute (see Spore No. 40 'Azolla for rice'). In addition to nitrogen, plants require a range of major and minor nutrients including phosphorus, potash, sulphur, calcium, magnesium, manganese and boron. A fertilizer demonstration programme organized by FAO over a decade ago showed that on traditional African farms nitrogen is almost always the nutrient which most limits crop yield; phosphorus is a close second. Potash deficiencies are more localized, but sulphur deficiency is now widely recognized as being as important as nitrogen and phosphorus in many areas. Several African countries have reserves of oil or natural gas which are sufficient to produce ammonia for nitrogen fertilizers, and some are using them for this purpose. Countries that have excess hydro-electric power can produce ammonia by the electrolytic hydrogen process. However, low rainfall has reduced water levels in major hydro-electric dams and they have had little surplus electricity after meeting the soaring industrial and domestic demand. Fertilizer resources in Africa According to the International Fertilizer Development Center - Africa, there are agromineral deposits throughout West Africa that may have potential as indigenous sources of plant nutrients. IFDC-Africa has launched a programme to start the long and arduous process of identifying these deposits and developing proposals for research projects to examine the agronomic and economic feasibility of using these materials (mainly phosphatic) as sources of nutrients for food production. IFDC-Africa will establish a database on West African deposits of phosphate, <b>sulphur,</b> <b>lime,</b> gypsum and dolomite. Phosphate deposits have been found in 36 African countries: the main producers are Algeria, Côte d'lvoire, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. Of the ACP countries, only Senegal and Zimbabwe produce sufficient phosphate for export. Several countries have indigenous ores which present processing problems, although some of those which prove unsuited to chemical processing might be suited to direct application. Fertilizer production Zambia is one country where locally-available phosphate rocks could, in theory, reduce the need for imported phosphatic fertilizers, the annual requirement for which is over 30, 000 t. A local company, Mining Exploration (MINEX), has carried out tests using acidulation on low grade areas to make Partially Acidulated Phosphate Rock (PAPR), which has been used successfully on maize and soya beans. MINEX has also shown that where residual brown soils, resulting from the weathering of carbonates, are washed the coating of iron oxide is removed and ores of 10 % grade can be enriched to 30 % phosphorus. This technique looks promising but the washing process requires large volumes of water: and water is in short supply in this region. There is virtually no production of potash in Africa although resources are reported to exist in more than ten countries. Solar evaporation of potash brines could provide a possible source in several countries. National options Faced with insufficient foreign exchange and transport difficulties almost all African ACP countries must develop whatever local resources are available for enhancing soil fertility. Preventing soil erosion and avoiding the burning of crop residues will reduce the loss of soil nutrients, and composting crop wastes and integrating nitrogen-fixing crops and trees into farming systems will go some way towards meeting crop requirements. Research is needed into simple, low-cost processing of low-grade rocks into utilizable fertilizers. Where deposits are too small for large-scale commercial exploration, they can still be useful regionally or locally. And where labour-intensive extraction and processing is the only alternative, this {{can be seen as a}} source of employment for rural people in slack seasons. In the final analysis government planning must recognize that the central position of food production in national economies demands that more resources be directed to all activities that can increase food production, including the utilization of all local resources for fertilizer production: oil and natural gas, hydro-electricity and native ore deposits.

40|$|In a 3 -year study, the {{effectiveness}} of copper hydroxide, <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur,</b> and their combinations with Aureobasidium pullulans were investigated for blossom blight control in organic sour cherry production. The effect of treatments on phytotoxicity on spur-leaf clusters and yield was also determined. A major aim was to evaluate the integrated control approach of the combined A. pullulans treatments to reduce allowed chemical damage on spur-leaf clusters. Among fungicide treatments suitable for organic production, copper hydroxide and <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> alone were most effective for blossom blight control when applied three times (at closed blossom, full bloom, and petal fall) during bloom. Both treatments were not {{as effective as the}} conventional standard, caused more damage on spur-leaf clusters, but significantly increased crop yield compared to the untreated control. A. pullulans treatments, applied three times during bloom (at closed blossom, full bloom, and petal fall), resulted in significantly higher blossom blight incidence but lower phytotoxicity compared to copper hydroxide or <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> treatments applied alone. All A. pullulans treatments controlled blossom blight significantly better in all years and increased crop yield in two out of three years compared to the untreated plots. The need for an integrated approach to improve blossom blight management in organic sour cherry production is discussed. This is the first in-depth study on the multiyear effects of A. pullulans applications on blossom blight control in comparison with organically approved plant protection compounds of copper or <b>lime</b> <b>sulphur</b> for organic sour cherry production...|$|E
