5000|$|Bobbin <b>tape</b> <b>lace</b> is {{bobbin lace}} where {{the design is}} formed {{of one or more}} tapes curved so they make an {{attractive}} pattern.

40|$|Volume 1 of the 16 th century {{pattern book}} 2 ̆ 2 Le Pompe 2 ̆ 2 was printed by the Sessa {{brothers}} for Matio Pagano in 1557. Volume 2 appeared in 1560 {{with a new}} set of patterns. These works are among the earliest existing devoted entirely to bobbinlace. The patterns are drawings meant to be interpreted by the lacemaker. Most are highly adaptable to the plaited techniques we now associate with Venice. But more flowing designs are also present (fig 1), and seem to point the way toward <b>tape</b> <b>lace</b> development, or perhaps a side branch that was not fully developed in subsequent years. Little lace from this period survives, and it has been a challenge for modern lacemakers to interpret the more advanced patterns using modern techniques. This {{may not be the best}} approach. A new example has come to light which exactly copies one of the Le Pompe designs (fig 2), even matching the scale of the original plate. The piece is of fine linen and of a surprisingly advanced technique bearing little resemblance to modern interpretations. This paper will present a technical analysis of the piece, compared and contrasted to contemporary plaited <b>laces,</b> later <b>tape</b> <b>laces,</b> and modern attempts at copying such designs...|$|R

5000|$|The {{outline of}} the design is made of bought tape. Manufacturers {{produced}} {{a huge number of}} suitable tapes in different widths and sometimes with picots or other decoration. The lacemaker bought the tape and sewed it onto a paper with the pattern. Then she filled up the empty spaces with a needle using a variety of stitches. Finally the lace was cut from the paper. [...] The <b>tape</b> <b>laces</b> varied from well-worked versions with a variety of filling stitches to those where the tapes were simply joined with a few needle-made bars. Some regard the whole genre as being Renaissance Lace, with varying forms such as Branscombe, Princess and Battenberg. Others regard Renaissance Lace as one of the types.|$|R

He could tell of a wicked widow, too--a beautiful receiver of smuggled goods upon the English coast--who smiled so sweetly upon the smugglers when they sold her silks and <b>laces,</b> cheap as <b>tape</b> and ginghams.

5000|$|Shenandoah was {{originally}} designated FA-1, for [...] "Fleet Airship Number One" [...] {{but this was}} changed to ZR-1. The airship was 680 ft long and weighed 36 tons (32658 kg).

Shenandoah was assembled at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey in 1922-1923, in Hangar No. 1, the only hangar {{large enough to accommodate}} the ship; its parts were fabricated at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia.

5000|$|The band {{started in}} 1984 as a loose {{collective}} of around eight members called the Brotherhood VIP. VIP stood for [...] "Vagabonds in Power", {{taken from a}} Fela Kuti record of the same name. They were a collective of rappers, dancers, graffiti artists, and DJ's who were black, white, Muslim and Jewish. The group included Aston Harvey, later known as DJ Hasty of the Freestylers, a Muslim Tanzanian MC named Sir Yes and a producer named Secretgrooves. In later interviews, founding member Lorenzo (Laurence Knopf, later called Mr Shylok) told the press the name had referred to the collective's ideal of [...] "brotherhood between races". The Brotherhood VIP were a regular feature at North London underground hip hop jams and blues parties in the original 80s underground scene. Their mix <b>tapes</b> <b>laced</b> with rap circulated until 1989, when the original line up amicably parted ways. 1990 saw The Brotherhood, now including DJ/Producer Son of Funk (Jason Roth, later known as DJ Diablo, part of Roots Manuva's [...] "Banana Clan" [...] and featured in DJ MK's The Funhouse), continue to record demo tracks, assisted by production from Secretgrooves who had formed a new group called VIP with Sir Yes.

60|$|All this costuming {{had taken}} some time, and Mrs. Green had already {{called up the}} {{staircase}} that dinner was nearly ready before Mopsey had commenced to clothe himself in such garments as he supposed Richard the Third wore. First {{he put on a}} thin pair of cotton pants that had once been white, but were now a drab, and which fitted quite closely to his skin. On the outside seams of these he pinned a strip of gilt paper, and then drew on a pair of boots, the tops of which came up quite as high on him as the rubber ones did on Paul. Around these boots was <b>laced</b> more red <b>tape,</b> until {{it would have been a}} difficult matter to have formed any idea as to what they might have been intended for originally. He had a broad leather belt, and outside of it was a red sash, with ends that nearly touched the floor. As weapons he wore a sword in a scabbard, a carving-knife, a portion of a pistol, and a table-fork. His coat was a soldier's overcoat, cut down to prevent it from trailing on the floor when he walked, and on his head was a paper cap nearly twice as large, and with very much more ornamentation in the way of feathers and red paint than had the one worn by Paul.|$|R
40|$|Context: Ankle sprains {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{injuries}} in the physically active population. Previous research has shown that supporting the ankle with taping or bracing methods is effective at preventing ankle sprains. However, no research exists on the effects of self-adherent <b>tape</b> and <b>lace</b> up ankle braces on the restriction of range of motion and dynamic balance in collegiate football players. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of self-adherent <b>tape</b> and <b>lace</b> up ankle braces in reducing ankle range of motion and improving dynamic balance before and after a typical collegiate football practice. Design: Crossover. Setting: Athletic Training Room. Participants: Twenty-nine division I football athletes (age 19. 2 Â± 1. 14 yrs, height 187. 52 cm Â± 20. 54, mass 106. 44 kg Â± 20. 54). Interventions: Each participant wore each prophylactic ankle support condition during a single practice; self-adherent tape on one leg and lace up ankle brace on the other. Range of motion and dynamic balance were assessed three times on each leg throughout the testing session (baseline, pre-practice, post-practice). Main Outcome Measures: Range of motion was assessed using a goniometer. The composite score for the Y-Balance test was used to quantify dynamic balance. Results: There were no significant differences between the tape and brace conditions in range of motion (p=. 10) or dynamic balance (p=. 83). Conclusion: Both the self-adherent <b>tape</b> and <b>lace</b> up ankle brace provided equal range of motion restriction before and after exercise with no change in dynamic balance.
