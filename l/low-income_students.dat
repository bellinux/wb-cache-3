40|$|Many <b>low-income,</b> {{minority}} <b>students</b> {{are performing}} poorly in American schools (Gay, 2000). Two problems {{that contribute to}} minority students 2 ̆ 7 poor academic performance are teachers 2 ̆ 7 negative perceptions of and instructional disconnection between their <b>low-income,</b> minority <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 home lives and community experiences (Cagle, 1998; Sternberg, 2006). Culturally responsive training {{has the potential to}} ameliorate teachers 2 ̆ 7 negative perceptions in these areas (Ginsberg, 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2005; Villegas 2 ̆ 6 Lucas, 2002). ^ This study investigated the influence that culturally responsive training had on teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy perceptions and instructional strategies with respect to teaching their <b>low-income,</b> minority <b>students</b> (Ashton 2 ̆ 6 Webb, 1986; Ginsberg, 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2005). The research questions were the following: (1) How does culturally responsive training influence elementary and middle school teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy perceptions with respect to teaching their <b>low-income,</b> minority <b>students?,</b> (2) How does culturally responsive training influence a change in elementary and middle school teachers 2 ̆ 7 instructional strategies concerning their <b>low-income,</b> minority <b>students?,</b> and (3) Is there a significant difference between elementary and middle school teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy with respect to teaching their low-income, minority students?^ A type II single-case, embedded case study design was used (Yin, 2003). The purposeful sample of N= 35 teachers, n= 20 elementary and n= 15 middle school participated in the study. The data were gathered and triangulated for corroboration purposes using the following strategies: questionnaires, document analysis, and interviews (Yin,). The questionnaires used a 5 -point Likert agreement scale. Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used to analyze the questionnaire data (Gall et al., 2007). Hodder 2 ̆ 7 s (2003) material culture strategy was employed to analyze teacher lesson plans, and Rubin and Rubin 2 ̆ 7 s (2005) coding strategy was used in the analysis of the teacher interview typescripts. ^ Findings indicated that culturally responsive training did not influence teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy or instructional strategies with respect to teaching their <b>low-income,</b> minority <b>students.</b> It was concluded that teachers 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of <b>low-income,</b> minority <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 home lives was essential for developing supportive accommodations to their teaching practices for these students.
