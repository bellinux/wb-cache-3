In this tranquil <b>level</b> <b>length</b> of the wood there was the one spot, the churchyard, where, oddly enough, the green earth heaved into little billows as if to show the turbulence of that life which those who lay below them had lately quitted. It was a relief to the somewhat studied and formal monotony of the well-ordered woodland,--every rood, of which had been paced by visitors, keepers, or poachers,--to find those decrepit and bending tombstones, lurching at every angle, or deeply sinking into the green sea of forgetfulness around them. All this, and the trodden paths of the villagers towards that common place of meeting, struck him as being more human than anything he had left behind him at the Grange.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} factors {{concerning}} postdischarge rehospitalization and in-hospital mortality among Taiwanese women older than 50 years with hip fracture. Materials and methods: The National Health Insurance database from 2000 to 2006 {{was used to}} identity relevant cases. Women inpatients aged over 50 years with new-onset hip fracture in 2003 were identified. We analyzed the factors affecting postdischarge rehospitalization and in-hospital mortality. Results: In 2003, there were 9467 new-onset hip fracture inpatients claimed among Taiwanese women aged over 50 years. The 3 -year cumulative rates of rehospitalization after discharge and in-hospital mortality rate were 11. 01 % (1043) and 7. 10 % (672), respectively. The factors determined {{to be related to}} rehospitalization were patient age, hospital <b>level,</b> <b>length</b> of stay of the initial hospitalization due to hip fracture, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score. The factors determined to be related to in-hospital mortality were age, urbanization level of region where patients were insured, hospital <b>level,</b> <b>length</b> of stay of the initial hospitalization due to hip fracture, and CCI score. Conclusion: Characteristics of women aged over 50 years with hip fracture remain an important issue based on high rehospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates.

Partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to collect the data from 176 family businesses from two {{sectors of the economy}} - product-manufacturing and service-based organizations. The empirical results indicated that family firm owners’ entrepreneurial experience (business owner’s education <b>level,</b> <b>length</b> of time as a business owner, and the number of businesses owned in the past) is a significant predictor of the business’ support for community. Entrepreneurial experience was also found to have a significant and indirect effect on family firm performance. Additionally, the structural model was examined across product and service-based organizations. Our findings suggest that entrepreneurial experience has a stronger effect on family firm performance among service-based organizations. PublishedN/...|$|E

The nozzles are manufactured using hot isostatic pressing (HIP) technology. Microscopic blowholes are likely to be created during the process of manufacturing the nozzles, which causes the roughness on the surface even after fine machining. The objective of this research is to develop a technique to detect these microscopic blowholes. Digital image processing and a computational system are used to measure the roughness <b>level.</b> <b>Length</b> and breadth of the blowhole is measured using edge detection technique associated with a Gaussian filter and then edge drawing algorithm is used to draw fine edges along the detected edges.

Recently arrested detainees at Grayson County Jail were administered oral and written Miranda warnings from the Miranda Statements Scale (MSS; Rogers, 2005) to measure their comprehension of the warnings.

For all warnings at or above 8 th grade, a substantial minority (27. 1 % - 39. 6 %) of defendants exhibited failed (i. e., < 50 % understanding) Miranda comprehension. Regardless of other variables, oral administrations resulted in a substantially larger number of defendants with failed Miranda comprehension.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{interference}} effects caused by electric power lines on neighboring metallic utilities such as water, gas or oil pipelines {{became a major}} concern due to {{significant increase in the}} load and short circuit current levels needed to satisfy the load requirements. Another reason for increased interference levels originates from the environmental concerns, which impose on various utilities the obligation to share common corridors. This paper presents three different scenarios of a pipeline in which all types of electromagnetic interferences (coupling) will be investigated and their effects on the pipeline will be predicted. The level of the calculated voltage, owing to each type of coupling, depends on different factors (voltage <b>level,</b> <b>length</b> of parallelism, separation distance, soil resistivity, load current magnitude and pipeline coating). The effects of these factors are discussed; some factors such as the fault current level, separation distance and soil resistivities are found to exhibit a large influence on the pipeline voltage. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the comprehensive analyses presented in this paper considering all types of interferences have not yet been published elsewhere...|$|E
