We find that, in the previous simulations with an optically thin approximation, the UVB was sinking into the H_I cloud too deeply, and therefore we underestimated the f(N_HI) at 19 6 x 10 ^{- 3 } cm^{- 3 }, then we reproduce the observed f(N_HI) at z= 3 very well. We also investigate the effect of <b>local</b> stellar <b>radiation</b> by post-processing our simulation with a radiative transfer code, and find that the <b>local</b> stellar <b>radiation</b> {{does not change the}} f(N_HI) very much.

The most commonly used therapeutic options for palmoplantar psoriasis are long-term therapy with topical corticosteroids and local PUVA. Frequently, it is a recalcitrant disease. We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of topical calcipotriol with <b>local</b> UVA <b>radiation</b> in comparison with local PUVA therapy. METHODS: In a total of 43 patients with palmoplantar psoriasis, 33 were given 15 sessions of <b>local</b> UVA <b>radiation</b> and topical calcipotriol and the remainder received 15 sessions of local PUVA (psoralen + UVA radiation). RESULTS: The statistical analyses of {{the results showed that}} the effect and tolerability of both therapeutic modalities are comparable.

Although early treatment of DCIS was similar to invasive breast cancer, involving full mastectomy and sometimes lymph node dissection, an evolution in understanding about the different kinds of breast cancer prompted investigations into the adequacy of less extreme surgical treatments.

40|$|Context. In photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{could be}} {{produced}} by evaporation of Very Small Grains (VSGs) by the impinging UV radiation field from a nearby star. Aims. We investigate quantitatively the transition zone between evaporating Very Small Grains (eVSGs) and PAHs in several PDRs. Methods. We study the relative contribution of PAHs and eVSGs to the mid-IR emission {{in a wide range}} of excitation conditions. We fit the observed mid-IR emission of PDRs by using a set of template band emission spectra of PAHs, eVSGs and gas lines. The fitting tool PAHTAT (PAH Toulouse Astronomical Templates) is made available to the community as an IDL routine. From the results of the fit, we derive the fraction of carbon f_eVSG locked in eVSGs and compare it to the intensity of the <b>local</b> UV <b>radiation</b> field. Results. We show a clear decrease of f_eVSG with increasing intensity of the <b>local</b> UV <b>radiation</b> field, which supports the scenario of photo-destruction of eVSGs. Conversely, this dependence can be used to quantify the intensity of the UV radiation field for different PDRs, including non resolved ones. Conclusions.

However, disagreements between barcoding and morphological data have already led to controversy. Species delimitation should therefore not be based on mtDNA alone. Here, we explore the use of nDNA and bioclimatic modelling in a new species of aquatic beetle revealed by mtDNA sequence data. The aquatic beetle fauna of Australia is characterised by high degrees of endemism, including <b>local</b> <b>radiations</b> such as the genus Antiporus. Antiporus femoralis was previously considered to exist in two disjunct, but morphologically indistinguishable populations in south-western and south-eastern Australia.

Diagnostic characters from the highly variable nuclear protein encoding arginine kinase gene confirmed the presence of two isolated populations. We then used ecological niche modelling to examine the climatic niche characteristics of the two populations. All results support {{the status of the}} two populations as distinct species. We describe the south-western species as Antiporus occidentalis sp. n.

After discussing the renormalization of the string tension induced by time-symmetric self-interactions (thereby correcting errors in the literature concerning {{the effect of the}} dilaton field), we concentrate on the finite radiation damping force associated with the half-retarded minus half-advanced ``reactive'' fields. We revisit a recent proposal of using a ``local back reaction approximation'' for the reactive fields. We find, contrary to previous claims, that this proposal leads to antidamping {{in the case of the}} axionic field, and to zero (integrated) damping in the case of the gravitational field.
