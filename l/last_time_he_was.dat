5|$|In 1948 Pechersky {{was arrested}} by the Soviet {{authorities}} along with his brother during the countrywide Rootless cosmopolitan campaign against the Jews suspected of pro-Western leanings. Only after Stalin's death in 1953 was he released from jail {{due in part to}} mounting international pressure. However, the harassment did not stop there. Pechersky was prevented by the Soviet government from testifying in multiple international trials related to Sobibor, including the Eichmann Trial in Israel. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> refused the permission to exit the country and testify was in 1987, for a trial in Poland.|$|E

On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E

5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on {{stage for the}} <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.|$|E

25|$|As a result, Hogan filed a {{defamation}} {{of character}} lawsuit against Russo soon after, which was eventually dismissed in 2002. Russo claims {{the whole thing}} was a work, and Hogan claims that Russo made it a shoot. Eric Bischoff agreed with Hogan's side of the story when he wrote that Hogan winning and leaving with the belt was a work (devised by Bischoff rather than Russo), and that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the success of the angle, but that Russo coming out to fire Hogan was an unplanned shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan. It was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seen in WCW.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Dutch embassy diplomat Herman Knippenberg was {{investigating}} {{the murders of}} Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly even met Sobhraj, although the latter's true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued gathering evidence. With {{the help of a}} neighbour of Sobhraj, Knippenberg built a case against him. Knippenberg was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj's apartment, a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims' documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes. The trio's next stop was Malaysia, where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ever seen, and neither Chowdhury nor his remains were ever found. It is believed that Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving Malaysia to continue his and Leclerc's roles as gem salesmen in Geneva. A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in Germany, the claim appeared unsubstantiated. The search for Chowdhury continues.|$|E
25|$|Wakahaguro was {{expected}} to quickly push on to yokozuna promotion, but his second tournament as an ōzeki ended with an extremely disappointing 7–8 record. After this {{it was clear that}} Wakahaguro had neither the consistency nor the determination to reach sumo's highest rank, and he was to be overtaken by two younger rivals, Taihō and Kashiwado. In November 1960 Wakahaguro managed to defeat Taihō {{for the first time in}} five attempts but could not prevent him from winning his first championship. Wakahaguro's 12–3 runner-up performance was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to challenge for a tournament title. In January 1961 it was Kashiwado's turn to win his first championship, and Wakahaguro could produce only a 10–5 score. After a poor 5–10 record in July 1961 he missed the September tournament through injury. In November 1961, the same tournament in which both Taihō and Kashiwado made their yokozuna debuts, Wakahaguro lost his ōzeki rank after managing only a 5–10 record on his comeback. The rules in place at the time meant three consecutive make-koshi or losing scores would result in demotion, and his absences in September were counted as losses.|$|E

500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves and picked up his first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did not surprise Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> up, you {{knew he was going to}} get another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s going to be his ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as we stay in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E
500|$|On the January 30 {{episode of}} Raw, Chris Jericho {{attacked}} Punk and Daniel Bryan during their Champion vs. Champion match, giving Bryan the win. The following week, Jericho explained his actions by dismissing the WWE roster as imitations {{of himself and}} singling out Punk for calling himself [...] "the best in the world", a moniker Jericho used the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in WWE. Their rivalry continued through Elimination Chamber where Punk retained the WWE Championship in the namesake structure; while four competitors were eliminated, Jericho was unable to continue the match after being {{kicked out of the}} chamber by Punk, causing temporary injury. The next night on Raw, Jericho earned a match against Punk at WrestleMania XXVIII, and in a bid to psychologically unsettle him, he revealed Punk's father was an alcoholic and alleged that his sister was a drug addict, asserting that Punk's straight edge philosophy was paranoia to avoid the same vices and vowing to make Punk turn to alcohol by winning the title from him. John Laurinaitis added the stipulation that the WWE Championship could change hands via disqualification, which led to Jericho inciting Punk into using a weapon, but Punk resisted and retained the title. On the April 2 and 9 episodes of Raw, Punk retained the WWE Championship against Mark Henry after losing to him via count-out and disqualification. Following both matches, Jericho attacked Punk and doused him with alcohol. On the April 16 Raw, Punk pinned Henry in a no disqualification, no countout match to retain his title. After repeated altercations, the feud between Jericho and Punk culminated in a Chicago Street Fight at Extreme Rules where Punk defeated Jericho to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E

They were turned down, and, as a result, the Australian side in this match showed 11 changes; Jack Blackham's run of playing in the first 17 Tests came to an end; for 5 Australians, this second game was the only Test they were to play. Lillywhite was allowed to umpire this Test, {{but it was the}} <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> allowed to do so. Against this weakened Australian squad, Shaw's XI scored 401, before dismissing Australia for 279 and 126 to win by 10 wickets. Australia were 2–0 down in the series.|$|E

In an interview, Sam Raimi states that the music selected for the series {{is based on the}} lack of growth the Ash character has progressed over the past 30–35 years, and that, [...] "the music should reflect the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> engaged in society, and living".|$|E

2500|$|After Brian overdosed on a {{combination}} of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, Landy was once more employed, and a more radical program was undertaken to try to restore Brian to health. This involved removing him from the Beach Boys on November 5, 1982 at the behest of Carl Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine, in addition to isolating him from his family and friends in Hawaii, and putting him on a rigorous diet and health regimen. According to Carolyn Williams, Brian refused to see Landy: [...] "They told him that the only way that he could be a Beach Boy again, and the only way they would release his 1982 tour disbursement money, was if he would agree to see Dr. Landy. Brian started yelling that he didn't like Dr. Landy and that [...] was charging him $20,000 a month the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> willing to see anybody to get the weight off, but he didn't want to see Landy.
