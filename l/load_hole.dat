40|$|Although the {{literature}} contains {{a number of}} studies which have been developed to describe the non- linear behaviour of ordinary plates, few works are available on perforated plates, and studies on non- linear behaviour of perforated plates under localised symmetrical load are not studied in depth. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide some insights into the elasto-plastic behaviour of plate girder web panels with circular holes under localised symmetrical load. Numerical analyses of square and rectangular perforated plates with centred and eccentric holes were developed. Results provide new insights into post-critical mechanisms in perforated plates subjected to localised loads when the length of the symmetrical compressive <b>load,</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and steel yield limit vary. An increase in the critical slenderness of the plate (a value at which transition from elastic to plastic collapse occurs) and a corresponding reduction in the elastic critical load occur when the dimensions of the hole increase. A further increase in the critical slenderness occurs when the length of the localised load is reduced. High-performance steel may be subject to buckling with a lower possibility of post-critical mechanisms: a reduction in critical slenderness occurs when the steel grade increases. Lastly, numerical analyses of slender and thick perforated plates were developed and their results compared...|$|E

40|$|Holes {{are often}} {{unavoidable}} in webs of steel beams and in plates, due to inspection, maintenance and also aesthetic purposes. In these situations, {{the presence of}} holes may cause redistribution of plane stresses in plates with a significant reduction of stability. In this paper, linear buckling analyses of perforated plates subjected to localised symmetrical load, with circular and rectangular holes, are developed. The results show some relevant differences between the behaviour of the plate subjected to localised symmetrical load with respect to that of uniform compressive load, already known in literature, with {{a significant increase in}} the elastic critical load value. The buckling coefficient of square and rectangular perforated panels under symmetrical uniform compression assumes the same value of corresponding whole panels, and it strongly increases for localised symmetrical load, reducing its increment on the basis of the diameter of the hole. Lastly, some indications are given on the best orientation of rectangular <b>holes</b> when localised <b>load</b> are applied showing differences with the uniform compression <b>load</b> case. <b>Holes</b> with the longest edge parallel to the transverse direction of the panel subjected to uniform compression loads are preferable for stability purposes.

Specimens were impacted by aluminum spheres while under tensile or compressive loads. Impact-failure thresholds and residual strengths were obtained. Loaded-hole specimens were tested in three configurations that were critical in bearing, shear, or tension. Partial bonding reduced the tensile and compressive strengths of undamaged specimens by about one-third. For impact, partial bonding did not change the threshold for impact failure under tensile preload. However, under compressive preload, partial bonding caused serious degradation of impact resistance. Partial bonding reduced the maximum load-carrying capacity of all three types of loaded-hole specimens. Overall, partial bonding degraded both impact resistance and bearing strength of holes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We develop {{performance}} approximations {{that can}} help manage the pace of play in golf. In previous work we developed a stochastic model of successive groups of golfers playing on an 18 -hole golf course and derived expressions for the capacity (maximum possible throughput) of each hole and the golf course as a whole. That model captures the realistic feature that, on most holes, more than one group can be playing at the same time, with precedence constraints. We now facilitate further performance analysis with that model by developing two new approximations. First, we develop an approximation involving a series of conventional single-server queues, without precedence constraints. The key idea {{is to use the}} times between successive departures on a fully <b>loaded</b> <b>hole</b> as aggregate service times in the new model. Second, we apply established heavy-traffic limits for a series of conventional queues to develop explicit approximation formulas for the mean and variance of the time required for group n to play the entire course, as a function of n. We conduct simulation experiments showing that both approximations are effective. We show how these formulas can help design and manage a golf course...|$|R

Laboratorio de Ondas Milimétricas y TeraherciosIn this paper, a deep {{numerical}} {{as well as}} {{experimental study}} of the anisotropy response of extraordinary transmission metamaterials constructed by stacking subwavelength hole arrays is presented. Two-dimensional (2 D) dispersion diagrams for S- and P-polarization were obtained from simulation.

Moreover, the richness of the anisotropic characteristic exhibited by the stacked hole array structure allows for designing structures with complex electromagnetic response other than solely negative refraction. Thus, the results presented here could be taken as a novel route to achieve exotic behaviour, such as negative refraction at other frequency ranges, like terahertz or the visible.

40|$|To allow {{structural}} designs {{with lower}} mass, {{it is necessary}} to have access to accurate failure prediction theories for composite plates with holes subjected to arbitrary loading conditions. For design purposes, however, the most accurate failure theories require a considerable amount of computational resources which is often not available. Additionally, current theories allowing less computational resources are unfortunately only valid for a specific <b>load,</b> material, <b>hole</b> or specimen size and their reliability is still questioned. The purpose of this work is to examine the existing methods to estimate stress and failure in composite plates with holes and subsequently join or modify them to provide an analytic tool for a quick and fairly accurate estimation of the static failure load. The plate is represented as a two-dimensional structure containing arbitrary loaded/unloaded holes and edge force boundary conditions. From a literature study, it is decided that an analytical model based on the method by Xiong and Poon [2] is used for the determination of the stress field. A new general failure criterion on the basis of Kweon [3] is constructed to determine failure. The stress and failure theories are implemented in a software package, verified by hand calculation and validated with finite element analysis and experimental data. The performance of the new failure theory was also compared to the performance of the in-house Point Stress Criterion at the company where the work was performed. The stress field methodology is able to accurately determine the stress field in two-dimensional plates with holes. The performance of the new failure criterion is better with respect to the in-house criterion and has a maximum discrepancy of + 20 % which is acceptable for design purposes. Unfortunatley, due to issues with the assumption of the stress boundary conditions for <b>loaded</b> <b>holes,</b> the method is restricted to laminates with a directionality lower than 1. 13.

40|$|A {{dramatic}} increase in pesticide usage in agriculture highlights the need for on-site monitoring for public health and safety. Here, a paper-based sensor combined with a wet system was developed for the simple and rapid screening of organophosphate (OP) and carbamate (CM) pesticides based on the inhibition of acetylcholinester-ase (AChE). The paper-based sensor {{was designed as a}} foldable device consisting of a cover and detection sheets pre-prepared with indoxyl acetate and AChE, respectively. The paper-based sensor requires only the incubation of a sample on the test zone for 10 minutes, followed by closing of the foldable sheet to initiate the enzymatic reaction. Importantly, the buffer <b>loading</b> <b>hole</b> was additionally designed on the cover sheet to facilitate the inter-action of the coated substrate and the immobilized enzyme.
