[...] The binding site of <b>loreclezole</b> has been shown experimentally to be shared by valerenic acid, an extract of {{the root of the}} valerian plant. Structurally, <b>loreclezole</b> is a triazole derivative. In animal seizure models, <b>loreclezole</b> is protective against pentylenetetrazol seizures but is less active in the maximal electroshock test. In addition, at low, nontoxic doses, the drug has anti-absence activity in a genetic model of generalized absence epilepsy. Consequently, <b>loreclezole</b> has a profile of activity similar to that of benzodiazepines. A potential benzodiazepine-like interaction with GABA receptors is suggested by the observation that the anticonvulsant effects of <b>loreclezole</b> can be reversed by benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, however, fails to alter the anticonvulsant activity of <b>loreclezole,</b> indicating that <b>loreclezole</b> is not a benzodiazepine receptor agonist. Using native rat and cloned human GABA-A receptors, <b>loreclezole</b> strongly potentiated GABA-activated chloride current. However, activity of the drug did not require the presence of the γ-subunit and was not blocked by flumazenil, confirming that <b>loreclezole</b> does not interact with the benzodiazepine recognition site.|$|E
40|$|Effect of some convulsants on the {{protective}} activity of <b>loreclezole</b> and its combinations with valproate or clonazepam in amygdala-kindled rats. K. K. BOROWICZ, S. J. CZUCZWAR. Pol. J. Pharmacol., 2003, 55, 727 – 733. <b>Loreclezole</b> (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala-kindled rats, reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations. The combinations of <b>loreclezole</b> (2. 5 mg/kg) with valproate, clonazepam, or carbamazepine (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test. However, only two first combinations occurred {{to be of}} pharmacodynamic nature. Among several chemoconvulsants, bicuculline, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and BAY k- 8644 (the opener of L-type calcium channels) reversed {{the protective}} activity of <b>loreclezole</b> alone and its combination with valproate. On the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and BAY k- 8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of <b>loreclezole</b> combined with clonazepam. The results {{support the hypothesis that}} the protective activity of <b>loreclezole</b> and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L-type of calcium channels...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>loreclezole</b> on the {{function}} of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A. (GABA(A)) receptor complex in rat cerebral cortical membrane preparations were compared with those of propofol and diazepam. <b>Loreclezole</b> and propofol modulated [H- 3]muscimol binding and t-[S- 35]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([S- 35]TBPS) binding to washed and unwashed membranes with potencies and efficacies greater than those of diazepam. <b>Loreclezole</b> and propofol enhanced [H- 3]flunitrazepam binding to washed membranes with efficacies lower than those of GABA and muscimol. Both <b>loreclezole</b> and propofol showed biphasic effects on [S- 35]TBPS binding to washed membranes: at low concentrations (5 to 10 mu M), both drugs, with different efficacies, enhanced [S- 35]TBPS binding whereas, at higher concentrations (30 to 100 mu M), they inhibited this biochemical parameter. In contrast, diazepam enhanced [S- 35]TBPS binding to washed membranes at all concentrations tested. The combination of <b>loreclezole</b> with GABA, at a concentration (0. 3 mu M) that only slightly increased [S- 35]TBPS binding to washed membranes, reversed the increase in binding elicited by <b>loreclezole</b> (5 to 10 mu M) and significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect exerted by higher concentrations (30 to 100 mu M) of this drug. Similar effects were observed with the combination of GABA and propofol. However, GABA had no effect on the enhancement of [S- 35]TBPS binding induced by diazepam. The ability of GABA to reverse and potentiate the effects of <b>loreclezole</b> and propofol on [S- 35]TBPS binding to washed membranes was shared by pentobarbital (200 mu M) and alphaxalone (3 mu M). These anesthetics showed greater efficacies in combination with propofol than with <b>loreclezole.</b> These results suggest that, unlike diazepam, <b>loreclezole</b> and propofol may activate the receptor-associated Cl- channel in the absence of GABA. Furthermore, the difference in the pharmacological profiles of <b>loreclezole</b> and propofol may result from their different effectiveness in activating the receptor Cl- channel directly...|$|E
40|$|Type A {{gamma-aminobutyric acid}} (GABAA) receptors of the {{mammalian}} nervous system are {{a family of}} ligand-gated ion channels probably formed from the coassembly of different subunits (alpha 1 - 6, beta 1 - 3, gamma 1 - 3, delta) in the arrangement alpha beta gamma or alpha beta delta. The activation of these receptors by GABA can be modulated by a range of compounds acting at distinct allosteric sites. One such compound is the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant <b>loreclezole,</b> which we have recently shown to act via a specific modulatory site on the beta subunit of the GABAA receptor. The action of <b>loreclezole</b> depends {{on the type of}} beta subunit present in the receptor complex; receptors containing beta 2 or beta 3 subunits have &# 62; 300 -fold higher affinity for <b>loreclezole</b> than receptors containing a beta 1 subunit. We have used this property to identify the amino acid residue in the beta subunit that determines the subunit selectivity of <b>loreclezole.</b> Chimeric beta 1 /beta 2 human GABAA receptor subunits were constructed and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with human alpha 1 and gamma 2 s subunits. The chimera beta 1 /beta 2 Lys 237 -Gly 334 conferred sensitivity to 1 microM <b>loreclezole.</b> Within this region there are four amino acids that are conserved in beta 2 and beta 3 but differ in beta 1. By mutating single amino acids of the beta 1 subunit to the beta 2 /beta 3 equivalent, only the beta 1 mutation of Ser- 290 [...] &# 62;Asn conferred potentiation by <b>loreclezole.</b> Similarly, mutation of the homologous residue in the beta 2 and beta 3 subunits to the beta 1 equivalent (Asn [...] &# 62;Ser) resulted in loss of sensitivity to <b>loreclezole.</b> The affinity for GABA and the potentiation by flunitrazepam were unchanged in receptors containing the mutated beta subunits. Thus, a single amino acid, beta 2 Asn- 289 (beta 3 Asn- 290), located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the putative channel-lining domain TM 2, confers sensitivity to the modulatory effects of <b>loreclezole...</b>|$|E
40|$|Interations were {{investigated}} between <b>loreclezole,</b> chlormethiazole and pentobarbitone as potentiators of depolarization responses mediated by γ-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors on afferent nerve terminals in the rat cuneate nucleus in vitro. These drugs were also compared as modulators of [3 H]-flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding to synaptic membranes prepared from rat whole brain homogenate. In rat cuneate nucleus slices, the drugs shifted muscimol log dose–response {{lines to the}} left in an approximately parallel fashion {{with the result that}} 200 [*]μM chlormethiazole potentiated muscimol responses by 0. 567 ± 0. 037 log unit (mean±s. e. mean, n= 4) while <b>loreclezole</b> gave a maximal potentiation at 10 [*]μM of only 0. 121 ± 0. 037 (n= 6) log unit and 0. 071 ± 0. 039 (n= 22) at 50 [*]μM. While 50 [*]μM chlormethiazole and 30 [*]μM pentobarbitone showed no significant interactions between each other when potentiating muscimol responses in combination, 50 [*]μM <b>loreclezole</b> in combination with either chlormethiazole or pentobarbitone attenuated their potentiating effects, possibly by inducing desensitization of GABAA receptors. In the [3 H]-FNZ binding studies on well-washed membranes, <b>loreclezole</b> enhanced binding to a maximum of 47. 3 ± 2. 83 % of control (mean±s. e. mean, n= 3) at 300 [*]μM. Scatchard analysis revealed no change in Bmax but a decrease in KD for [3 H]-FNZ from 3. 9 ± 0. 29 [*]nM to 2. 7 ± 0. 10 [*]nM (mean±s. e. mean, n= 4) in the presence of 100 [*]μM <b>loreclezole.</b> In contrast, 100 [*]μM chlormethiazole caused no potentiation. A small component of the enhancement by <b>loreclezole</b> could be blocked by 100 [*]μM bicuculline and could also be blocked by 100 [*]μM chlormethiazole. It seems likely that the effects on [3 H]-FNZ binding are due predominantly to direct actions of the drugs on the GABAA receptor and are separate from the GABA-potentiating effects. The results indicate distinctly different profiles of action for <b>loreclezole,</b> chlormethiazole and pentobarbitone on GABAA receptors...|$|E
40|$|The pulse {{frequency}} of hypothalamic GnRH secretion increases {{at the onset}} of puberty. In rodents and primates, this process involves facilitatory and inhibitory effects mediated through hypothalamic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, respectively. Precocious puberty was observed in an 11 -month-old girl with nonketotic hyperglycinemia. This was thought to result from the effect of high concentrations of glycine (112 micromol/L in cerebrospinal fluid; normal, 3 - 12) acting on NMDA receptors as a coagonist of glutamate. Regression of pubertal development during anticonvulsive treatment with GABA agonists (<b>loreclezole</b> and vigabatrin) suggested that the stimulatory effects of glycine could be overcome by GABA receptor-mediated inhibition. These two hypotheses were tested in the in vitro model of the explanted hypothalamus from infantile (15 -day-old) male rats. Glycine concentrations of 1 - 10 micromol/L increased the {{pulse frequency}} of GnRH secretion. This acceleration was prevented by 7 -chlorokynurenic acid, a glycine antagonist at the NMDA receptor complex, and by the GABA agonist <b>loreclezole.</b> In addition, <b>loreclezole</b> and vigabatrin suppressed the developmental increase in the frequency of pulsatile GnRH secretion. The observation of precocious puberty in an infant with hyperglycinemia followed by pubertal regression during GABA agonist therapy and the in vitro findings in hypothalamic explants suggest that stimulatory inputs mediated through NMDA receptors and inhibitory inputs through GABA receptors are involved in the initiation of puberty. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{electrophysiological}} measurements the β-carboline ethyl 6 -benzyloxy-β-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (ZK 91085) acts as {{a positive}} allosteric modulator on rat recombinant α 1 β 2 γ 2 GABAA receptors and binds with high affinity (IC 50 = 1. 5 [*]nM) to the [3 H]-flunitrazepam site. Flumazenil was able to partially counteract the current modulation. These observations indicate an action of ZK 91085 at the benzodiazepine binding site. At the dual subunit combination α 1 β 2, which lacks the γ subunit required for benzodiazepine modulation, we still observed a potentiation of GABA currents. Thus ZK 91085 acts via an additional site on the channel. At the subunit combination α 1 β 1, ZK 91085 potentiation is strongly reduced as compared to α 1 β 2. In binding studies, ZK 91085 was able to decrease [35 S]-TBPS binding in α 1 β 2 γ 2 and α 1 β 2 but not in α 1 β 1. This selectivity of ZK 91085 for receptors containing the β 2 isoform over those containing the β 1 isoform {{is reminiscent of the}} action of <b>loreclezole.</b> To identify amino acid residues important for the second type of modulation, we functionally compared wild type α 1 β 2 and mutant receptors for stimulation by ZK 91085. The mutation β 2 N 265 S, that abolishes <b>loreclezole</b> effects, also abolishes ZK 91085 stimulation. The mutation β 2 Y 62 L increased stimulation by ZK 91085 3 – 4 fold, locating an influencing entity of the second type of action of ZK 91085 at an α/β subunit interface. Structural intermediates of ZK 91085 and the β-carboline abecarnil, the latter of which only slightly potentiated GABA currents in α 1 β 2, were analysed to determine structural requirements for modulation. ZK 91085 thus allosterically stimulates the GABAA receptor through two sites of action: the benzodiazepine site and the <b>loreclezole</b> site in contrast to classical β-carbolines, that confer negative allosteric modulation through the benzodiazepine site...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitory {{neurotransmission}} is {{a critical}} determinant of neuronal network gain and dynamic range, suggesting that network properties are shaped by activity during development. A previous study demonstrated that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in gerbils leads to smaller inhibitory potentials in L 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons in the thalamorecipient auditory cortex, ACx. Here, we explored the mechanisms that account for proper maturation of g-amino butyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission. SNHL was induced at postnatal day (P) 10, and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons in thalamocortical slices at P 16 [...] 19. SNHL led {{to an increase in}} the frequency of GABAzine-sensitive (antagonist) spontaneous (s) and miniature (m) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), accompanied by diminished amplitudes and longer durations. Consistent with this, the amplitudes of minimum-evoked IPSCs were also reduced while their durations were longer. The a 1 - and b 2 / 3 subunit [...] specific agonists zolpidem and <b>loreclezole</b> increased control but not SNHL sIPSC durations. To test whether SNHL affected the maturation of GABAergic transmission, sIPSCs were recorded at P 10. These sIPSCs resembled the long SNHL sIPSCs. Furthermore, zolpidem and <b>loreclezole</b> were ineffective in increasing their durations.

Chloride currents elicited by agonists were measured using two electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. Where compounds behaved as full agonists, i. e. GABA on all subtypes and 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo [5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol (THIP) on α 2 β 3 γ 2 GABAA receptors, agonist concentration-response curves were shifted to the left by the benzodiazepine full agonist chlordiazepoxide and the anticonvulsant <b>loreclezole,</b> or to the right by the inverse agonist 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl-β-carboline- 3 -carboxylic acid methyl ester (DMCM), with {{no effect on the}} maximal currents (Imax). In contrast, maximal responses for different partial GABAA agonists on all benzodiazepine-sensitive αxβ 3 γ 2 GABAA receptors were enhanced by chlordiazepoxide. Imax values for piperidine- 4 -sulphonic acid (P 4 S) on α 1 β 3 γ 2, THIP on α 3 β 3 γ 2, and 5 -(4 -piperidyl) isothiazol- 3 -ol (thio- 4 -PIOL) on α 2 β 3 γ 2 and α 5 β 3 γ 2 GABAA receptors were increased by chlordiazepoxide, while that for P 4 S on α 1 β 3 γ 2 receptors was decreased by DMCM. The Imax values for partial agonists were also enhanced by pentobarbitone, the neurosteroid allopregnanolone and <b>loreclezole</b> irrespective of receptor subtype or the nature of the partial agonist. In the light of models of ligand-gated ion channel receptor activation we suggest two possible mechanisms of action for the effects of allosteric modulators on partial agonist receptor activation: either selective modulation of agonist affinity for the open/closed state, or direct modulation of the gating process itself...|$|E
40|$|Synchrony {{within the}} thalamocortical system is {{regulated}} {{in part by}} intranuclear synaptic inhibition within the reticular nucleus (RTN). Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in RTN neurons are largely characterized by slow decay kinetics that result in powerful and prolonged suppression of spikes. Here we show that some individual RTN neurons are characterized by highly variable mixtures of fast, slow and mixed IPSCs. Heterogeneity arose largely through differences in the contribution of an initial decay component (τD ∼ 10 ms) which was insensitive to <b>loreclezole,</b> suggesting involvement of the GABAA receptor β 1 subunit. Single-cell RT-PCR revealed the presence of β 1 subunit mRNA only in those neurons whose IPSCs were dominated by a rapid and prominent initial decay phase. These data show that brief, β 1 -dependent, loreclezole-insensitive IPSCs are present in a subpopulation of RTN neurons, and suggest that striking differences in IPSC heterogeneity within single neurons can result from of {{the presence or absence}} of a single GABAA receptor subunit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe GABAA {{receptor}} (GABAAR) {{is a major}} {{target of}} antiseizure drugs (ASDs). A variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and <b>loreclezole,</b> actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation {{is one of several}} possible antiseizure mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR function, {{led to the development of}} ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic “tone” by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for “GABAergic” ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs. Manipulation of subunit expression patterns or novel ASDs targeting the altered receptors may provide a novel approach for seizure prevention...|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{into the}} modulatory effects of chlormethiazole at human {{recombinant}} γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors was undertaken to {{gain insight into}} its mechanism of action and determine if the drug exhibited any subtype-selective activity. Despite a structural similarity to the β-subunit-selective compound <b>loreclezole,</b> chlormethiazole did not show any difference in maximum efficacy and only a slight difference in EC 50 in its potentiating action at α 1 β 1 γ 2 and α 1 β 2 γ 2 GABAA receptor subtypes with preference for α 1 β 1 γ 2. Similar to the previously reported subtype-dependent activity of pentobarbital, chlormethiazole elicited a significantly greater degree of maximum potentiation on receptors lacking a γ 2 subunit, and also those receptors containing an α 4 or α 6 subunit. This also demonstrates that chlormethiazole does not act via the benzodiazepine binding site. Unlike pentobarbital and propofol, chlormethiazole elicited only a slight direct GABAA receptor activation at concentrations up to 1 mM. In addition, the drug did not potentiate anaesthetic-mediated currents elicited by pentobarbital or propofol, suggesting that chlormethiazole may be acting via an anaesthetic binding site. Chlormethiazole produced weak nonselective inhibition of human NMDA NR 1 a+NR 2 A and NR 1 a+NR 2 B receptors. IC 50 's were approximately 500 μM that likely exceed the therapeutic dose range for chlormethiazole, indicating that the primary mechanism of the compounds in vivo activity is via GABAA receptors...|$|E
40|$|Locally {{projecting}} GABAergic interneurons are {{the major}} providers of inhibition in the neocortex and {{play a crucial role}} in several brain functions. Neocortical interneurons are connected via electrical and chemical synapses that may be crucial in modulating complex network oscillations. We investigated the properties of spontaneous and evoked IPSCs in two morphologically and physiologically identified interneuron subtypes, the fast-spiking (FS) and low threshold-spiking (LTS) cells in layer V of rodent sensorimotor cortex. We found that IPSCs recorded in FS cells were several orders of magnitude more frequent, larger in amplitude, and had faster kinetics than IPSCs recorded in LTS cells. GABAA receptor �- and �-subunit selective modulators, zolpidem and <b>loreclezole,</b> had different effects on IPSCs in FS and LTS interneurons, suggesting differential expression of GABAA receptor subunit subtypes. These pharmacological data indicated that the � 1 subunit subtype is poorly expressed by LTS cells but makes a large contribution to GABAA receptors on FS cells. This was confirmed by experiments performed in genetically modified mice in which the � 1 subunit had been made insensitive to benzodiazepine-like agonists. These results suggest that differences in IPSC waveform are likely attributable to distinctive expression of GABAA receptor subunits in FS and LTS cells. The particular properties of GABAergic input on different interneuronal subtypes might have important consequences for generation and pacing of cortical rhythms underlying several brain functions. Moreover, selective pharmacological manipulation of distinct inhibitory circuits might allow regulation of pyramidal cell activities under specific physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether GABAA receptor-mediated hyperpolarizing and depolarizing {{synaptic}} potentials (IPSPAs and DPSPAs, respectively) are evoked by (a) the same populations of GABAergic interneurones and (b) exhibit similar regulation by allosteric modulators of GABAA receptor function. We have attempted to address these questions by investigating the effects of (a) known agonists for presynaptic receptors on GABAergic terminals, and (b) a range of GABAA receptor ligands, on each response. The GABA uptake inhibitor NNC 05 - 711 (10 [*]μM) enhanced whereas bicuculline (10 [*]μM) inhibited both IPSPAs and DPSPAs. (−) -Baclofen (5 [*]μM), [D-Ala 2,N-Me-Phe 4,Gly 5 -ol]-enkephalin (DAGO; 0. 5 [*]μM), and carbachol (10 [*]μM) caused substantial depressions (up to 99 %) of DPSPAs that were reversed by CGP 55845 A (1 [*]μM), naloxone (10 [*]μM) and atropine (5 [*]μM), respectively. In contrast, 2 -chloroadenosine (CADO; 10 [*]μM) only slightly depressed DPSPAs. Quantitatively, the effect of each agonist {{was similar to that}} reported for IPSPAs. The neurosteroid ORG 21465 (1 – 10 [*]μM), the anaesthetic propofol (50 – 500 [*]μM), the barbiturate pentobarbitone (100 – 300 [*]μM) and zinc (50 [*]μM) all enhanced DPSPAs and IPSPAs. The benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist flunitrazepam (10 – 50 [*]μM) and inverse agonist DMCM (1 [*]μM) caused a respective enhancement and inhibition of both IPSPAs and DPSPAs. The BZω 1 site agonist zolpidem (10 – 30 [*]μM) produced similar effects to flunitrazepam. The anticonvulsant <b>loreclezole</b> (1 – 100 [*]μM) did not affect either response.

40|$|It {{was aimed}} to further {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} the GABAergic neurotransmission system in the mechanisms underlying absence epilepsy. More specifically, the aim of this thesis is to investigate whether GABAergic neurotransmission is either quantitatively or qualitatively (or both) involved in the mechanisms underlying SWDs and whether this involvement is specifically determined by GABAA or GABAB mediated neurotransmission. To summarise, manipulation of different types of GABA receptors was shown to differentially affect the SWD activity. Systemic administration of GABA agonistic drugs resulted in an enhancement of SWD activity, with the exception of diazepam and <b>loreclezole</b> (discussed in 8. 1. 3.). It has been predicted that (relatively) enhancing GABAB-related neurotransmission in TC cells should slow down the peak frequency of SWDs (Destexhe, 1999; Destexhe and Sejnowski, 2003), which was confirmed in this thesis (chapter 4). Also, it was shown that hazard rate analysis can be a useful tool for hypothesising about the SWD starting and stopping mechanisms. Moreover, it was shown that this type of analysis might reveal more information on these mechanisms than the standard analysis of averages (of incidence and duration). In general, stimulation of GABAA receptors was shown to increase the probability of the generation of SWDs and to decrease the probability of the cessation of SWDs. Stimulation of GABAB receptors was also shown to increase the probability of SWD generation. Moreover, GABAB receptor activation not only decreased the probability of the stopping of a SWD, but also changed the course of this probability as the SWD lasts. Possible biological mechanisms responsible for these effects were discussed, and some possible types of drugs for the treatment of absence epilepsy were proposed...|$|E

The decay time of mIPSCs halved between 6 days in vitro (DIV) and DIV 12. This was paralleled by the decrease of � 2 and � 3 subunits, the increase of � 1 and � 6 subunits expression at synapses {{and changes in the}} action of selective � subunit modulators.

Oocytes expressing either β 4 subunit {{alone or in}} combination with the chicken α 1 subunit were studied using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Both the β 4 L and β 4 S subunits form homomeric GABA-gated Cl- channels with similar efficiencies. In comparison, oocytes expressing either the chicken α 1 or β 2 S polypeptide show no or barely detectable GABA responses, as reported by others for most single-subunit vertebrate GABA(A) receptors. The GABA-gated currents due to the β 4 L-subunit homomer were not affected by the presence of actinomycin D during cRNA expression, indicating that nascent oocyte polypeptides are not required for channel formation. The homomeric β 4 L-subunit receptors show high affinity for GABA with an EC 50 value of 4. 3 ± 0. 4 μM and a Hill coefficient of 1. 1 ± 0. 1 (n= 6). In response to GABA application at the EC 25 value, currents elicited from the β 4 L-subunit receptor are enhanced by 50 μM pentobarbital (110 ± 10 %, n= 3) and 10 μM <b>loreclezole</b> (60 ± 3 %, n= 3), inhibited by 10 μM picrotoxinin (93 ± 3 %, n= 3), but not affected by 1 μM diazepam.

Thymol, 1 – 100 μM, resulted in a dose-dependent potentiation of the EC 20 GABA response in oocytes injected with either α 1 β 3 γ 2 s GABAA subunit cDNAs or the RDLac subunit RNA. At 100 μM thymol, current amplitudes in response to GABA were 416 ± 72 and 715 ± 85 % of controls, respectively. On both receptors, thymol, 100 μM, elicited small currents {{in the absence of}} GABA. The EC 50 for GABA at α 1 β 3 γ 2 s GABAA receptors was reduced by 50 μM thymol from 15 ± 3 to 4 ± 1 μM, and the Hill slope changed from 1. 35 ± 0. 14 to 1. 04 ± 0. 16; there was little effect on the maximum GABA response. Thymol (1 – 100 μM) potentiation of responses to EC 20 GABA for α 1 β 1 γ 2 s, α 6 β 3 γ 2 s and α 1 β 3 γ 2 s human GABAA receptors was almost identical, arguing against actions at benzodiazepine or <b>loreclezole</b> sites. Neither flumazenil, 3 -hydroxymethyl-β-carboline (3 -HMC), nor 5 α-pregnane- 3 α, 20 α-diol (5 α-pregnanediol) affected thymol potentiation of the GABA response at α 1 β 3 γ 2 s receptors, providing evidence against actions at the benzodiazepine/β-carboline or steroid sites. Thymol stimulated the agonist actions of pentobarbital and propofol on α 1 β 3 γ 2 s receptors, consistent with a mode of action distinct from that of either compound. These data suggest that thymol potentiates GABAA receptors through a previously unidentified binding site...|$|E

40|$|A {{high-throughput}} assay {{utilizing the}} voltage/ion probe reader (VIPR) technology identified salicylidene salicylhydrazide (SCS) {{as being a}} potent selective inhibitor of α 2 β 1 γ 1 θ GABAA receptors with a maximum inhibition of 56 ± 5 % and an IC 50 of 32 (23, 45) [*]nM. Evaluation of this compound using patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques demonstrated that the compound behaved in a manner selective for receptors containing the β 1 subunit (e. g. maximum inhibition of 68. 1 ± 2. 7 % and IC 50 value of 5. 3 (4. 4, 6. 5) nM on α 2 β 1 γ 1 receptors). The presence of a β 1 subunit was paramount for the inhibition with changes between α 1 and α 2, γ 1 and γ 2, {{and the presence of}} a θ subunit having little effect. On all subtypes, SCS produced incomplete inhibition with the greatest level of inhibition at α 1 β 1 γ 1 θ receptors (74. 3 ± 1. 4 %). SCS displayed no use or voltage dependence, suggesting that it does not bind within the channel region. Concentration – response curves to GABA in the presence of SCS revealed a reduction in the maximum response with no change in the EC 50 or Hill coefficient. In addition, SCS inhibited pentobarbitone-induced currents. Threonine 255, located within transmembrane domain (TM) 1, and isoleucine 308, located extracellularly just prior to TM 3, were required for inhibition by SCS. SCS did not compete with the known allosteric modulators, picrotoxin, pregnenolone sulphate, dehydroepiandrosterone 3 -sulphate, bicuculline, <b>loreclezole</b> or mefenamic acid. Neither was the inhibition by SCS influenced by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. In conclusion, SCS is unique in selectively inhibiting GABAA receptors containing the β 1 subunit via an allosteric mechanism. The importance of threonine 255 and isoleucine 308 within the β 1 subunit and the lack of interaction with a range of GABAA receptor modulators suggests that SCS is interacting at a previously unidentified site...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} certain NSAIDs were {{determined}} on agonist-evoked responses recorded from rat neurones maintained in vitro using electrophysiological techniques. Initially, the rat isolated vagus and optic nerves were employed. Alphaxalone, pentobarbitone, propofol and the NSAID, mefenamic acid (MFA), potentiated GABA-evoked {{responses of the}} vagus nerve. Propofol (1 - 100 µM) selectively potentiated GABA and glycine-evoked responses of the rat vagus and optic nerves, but {{had little effect on}} nicotinic acetylcholine-, a,β-methylene-ATP or 5 -hydroxytryptamine-mediated responses. The interaction between MFA and ligand-gated receptors was investigated further using voltage-clamped rat hippocampal neurones maintained in culture. MFA (3 - 100 µM) selectively, concentration-dependently and reversibly potentiated GABA-evoked responses, consistent with the observations made using the vagus nerve. MFA (3 - 100 |aM) however had little or no effect on glycine, AMPA, kainate or NMDA-receptor mediated responses. A final series of experiments investigated the site and molecular mechanism of the interaction between MFA and the GABA-gated chloride ion channel. The potentiating effects of MFA (and other fenamates) were not the result of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, since other NSAIDs did not modulate the GABA(_A) receptor (GR). The actions of MFA were not mediated via the benzodiazepine site of the GR, nor where they due to inhibition of GABA- uptake or membrane perturbation. The modulatory effects of MFA were not use-dependent, but the potentiating effects of MFA were voltage-dependent, where the potentiation was 3 -fold greater at - 100 mV than at + 40 mV, with no change in the equilibrium potential for GABA. MFA activated a current, in the absence of GABA. Hippocampal neurones varied in sensitivity to modulation by MFA and the anticonvulsant, <b>loreclezole,</b> which may indicate a degree of sub- unit selectivity. These data are discussed in relation to the possible site and mechanism of action of fenamates at the GR, their similarities with other positive modulators of the GR and the neurophysiological implications of these findings...|$|E

Therefore, a continuous need remains to discover innovative chemical entities for the development of active and safer AEDs. Ligands targeting central histamine H 3 receptors (H 3 Rs) for epilepsy might be a promising therapeutic approach. To determine the potential of H 3 Rs ligands as new AEDs, we recently reported that no anticonvulsant effects were observed for the (S) - 2 -(4 -(3 -(piperidin- 1 -yl) propoxy) benzylamino) propanamide (1). In continuation of our research, we asked whether anticonvulsant differences in activities will be observed for its R-enantiomer, namely, (R) - 2 -(4 -(3 -(piperidin- 1 -yl) propoxy) benzylamino) propaneamide (2) and analogs thereof, in maximum electroshock (MES) -, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) -, and strychnine (STR) -induced convulsion models in rats having PHT and valproic acid (VPA) as reference AEDs. Unlike the S-enantiomer (1), the results show that animals pretreated intraperitoneally (ip) with the R-enantiomer 2 (10 mg/kg) were moderately protected in MES and STR induced models, whereas proconvulsant effect was observed for the same ligand in PTZ-induced convulsion models. However, animals pretreated with intraperitoneal doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg of structurally bulkier (R) -enantiomer (3), in which 3 -piperidinopropan- 1 -ol in ligand 2 was replaced by (4 -(3 -(piperidin- 1 -yl) propoxy) phenyl) methanol, and its (S) -enantiomer (4) significantly and in a dose-dependent manner reduced convulsions or exhibited full protection in MES and PTZ convulsions model, respectively. Interestingly, the protective effects observed for the (R) -enantiomer (3) in MES model were significantly greater than those of the standard H 3 R inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant, comparable with those observed for PHT, and reversed when rats were pretreated with the selective H 3 R agonist R-(α) -methyl-histamine. Comparisons of the observed antagonistic in vitro affinities among the ligands 1 - 6 revealed profound stereoselectivity at human H 3 Rs with varying preferences for this receptor subtype.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Functional tolerance to ethanol and physical dependence are thought to involve central nervous system (CNS) adaptive changes in the function of neurotransmitter systems which resist the initial intoxicating actions of ethanol. Increasing evidence suggests that the y-aminobutyric acid typeA(GABA,) receptor is one target of ethanol where such adaptive changes by the CNS may occur. Adaptation could occur by downregulation of GABAAreceptor number or uncoupling of the GABAAreceptor sensitivity to ethanol and related CNS depressants. These agents which show cross-tolerance and dependence with ethanol are allosteric modulators at the GABAAreceptor. Uncoupling is the decrease in the activity of an allosteric modulator at the receptor without a change in receptor number after prolonged exposure to either the agonist or allosteric modulator. Varying results have been obtained when looking at uncoupling at the GABAAreceptor with chronic drug treatment. The goal of this project was to determine-tine whether allosteric potentiation of GABAAreceptors by a benzodiazepine, a novel anticonvulsant or a neurosteroid is uncoupled by chronic ethanol treatment which may contribute to functional tolerance and physical dependence. Chronic ethanol was not found to induce an uncoupling of the potentiation seen with rnidazolam (0. I and 1. 0 liM), <b>loreclezole</b> (10 [uM), or allopregnanolone (0. I uM) to 3 uM GABA. However, the higher concentration of allopregnanolone (1. 0 [uM) did show potentiation of the 3 uM GABA response in the chronically ethanol treated cells. In contrast, an increased potentiation was seen with midazolam (0. I uM) and GABA (0. I uM) in the ethanol treated cells. No potentiation was seen of 30 liM GABA response with any of the allosteric modulators tested. Therefore, it does not appear that chronic ethanol uncoupled potentiation of loreciezole or 0. I [uM allopregnanolone acting by general allosteric mechanisms. However, the higher (1 [uM concentration of allopregnanolone, which is thought to be capable of directly activating the GABAAreceptor, did show uncoupling of potentiation with cells chronically exposed to ethanol; {{this finding is consistent with}} an adaptive change in GABAAreceptor function...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has indicated that}} NSAIDs might have direct effects on CNS tissue {{in addition to their}} classical inhibitory action on COX enzymes. This thesis addresses this hypothesis using electrophysiological and behavioural techniques. The effects of fenamate and other NSAIDs on native neuronal GABA(_A), 5 -HT(_ 3), nicotinic ACh, P 2 x and strychinine-sensitive glycine receptors, expressed on isolated vagus or optic nerves, was investigated using an extra-cellular recording technique. The fenamate NSAID, mefenamic acid (MFA) potentiated GABA (10 µM) - evoked responses in the vagus nerve. Application of MFA also resulted in non-competitive inhibition of 5 -HT-and a,βMeATP- evoked responses. Non-competitive like inhibition was also observed with flufenamic acid on DMPP- and a,βMeATP- evoked responses and with meclofenamic acid on GABA- evoked responses. Non-fenamate NSAIDs, including aspirin, did not significantly modulate the GABA(_A), 5 -HT(_ 3), nicotinic ACh, P 2 x or glycine receptors. The cognitive and behavioural effects of fenamates and other NASIDs were then investigated. MFA (5 - 20 mg/kg) caused a significant dose- and time-dependent enhancement in the non-spatial object discrimination working memory task when compared to saline controls. The enhancement observed with MFA was greater than that of the cognitive enhancer piracetam. This enhancement was not due to a change in non-mnemonic processes such as arousal, anxiety or locomotion. MFA also enhanced rats' performance in the spatial object location working memory task. The fenamate NSAID, meclofenamic acid (20 mg/kg) mimicked the effect of MFA, but the non-fenamate NSAIDs aspirin and ibuprofen, did not enhance object discrimination indicating that these cognitive effects are not via inhibition of COX. The GABA(_A) receptor modulators diazepam, bicuculline and <b>loreclezole,</b> did not replicate the effect of MFA on object discrimination, suggesting that its effects do not depend entirely on the GABAa receptor. Scopolamine (0. 25 -lmg/kg) significantly impaired object discrimination in a dose-dependent manner. This action could be fully reversed by co-treatment with MFA (20 mg/kg). In the T-maze task, MFA (20 mg/kg) decreased the number of arm entry errors and days taken to reach criterion. The number of arm entry errors made when a 5 -minute intra-trial interval was introduced was also significantly reduced by MFA compared with saline treated animals. In the radial maze, MFA (20 mg/kg) did not decrease the number of never baited arm entries to reach criterion. However MFA did significantly reduce the number of re-entry errors to baited arms, compared to controls, when an intra-trial delay (10 - 30 sees) was introduced. These results support the hypothesis that MFA enhances spatial working memory and that these effects are not task-specific. Overall, the data in this thesis show that fenamate NSAIDs can directly modulate native neuronal ligand-gated ion channels and that MFA can enhance working memory in normal and scopolamine-impaired rats. These results suggest additional pharmacological potential for certain fenamate NSAIDs...|$|E
