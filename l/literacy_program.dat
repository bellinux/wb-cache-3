A few programs have demonstrated that systematic evaluation of workplace <b>literacy</b> <b>programs</b> is possible and beneficial in improving programs and providing evidence of program effectiveness in support of requests for continued funding/expansion.

25|$|The Maccabean Revolt {{led to a}} twenty-five-year {{period of}} Jewish {{independence}} due to the steady collapse of the Seleucid Empire under attacks from the rising powers of the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire. The Hasmonean dynasty of priest-kings ruled Judea with the Pharisees, Saducees and Essenes as the principal social movements. As part of their struggle against Hellenistic civilization, the Pharisees established {{what may have been}} the world's first national male (religious) education and <b>literacy</b> <b>program,</b> based around synagogues. Justice was administered by the Sanhedrin, whose leader was known as the Nasi. The Nasi's religious authority gradually superseded that of the Temple's high priest (under the Hasmoneans this was the king).

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Language and Literacy)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. This thesis {{examined}} technology {{dedicated to}} literacy learning used by first-grade {{students at a}} Northern California school and was unified by the guiding question: what is the effectiveness and intended use of computer-based <b>literacy</b> <b>programs?</b> The guiding question led the researcher to ask three additional questions: a) How are students motivated to use computer-based <b>literacy</b> <b>programs?,</b> b) How are the assessment data used by the teachers to monitor student growth?, and c) How appropriately are students placed within each program? Furthermore, the research surveyed overall teacher satisfaction when using computer-based <b>literacy</b> <b>programs.</b> Sources of Data Data were collected from three first-grade teachers and 16 first-grade students in a suburban elementary school located in Northern California. The three first-grade teachers used trimester benchmark assessments obtained through the district to gather formal reading data regarding words per minute (WPM), accuracy, and comprehension. The teachers also used two computer-based <b>literacy</b> <b>programs,</b> Raz-Kids. com (A-Zlearning. com) and Accelerated Reader (Renlearn. com), to supplement and enhance the reading curriculum and to obtain further formal assessment data. The researcher obtained the quantitative data through student reports from Raz-Kids. com, Accelerated Reader, and the trimester benchmark assessments for the 16 students. The three first-grade teachers {{were also asked to}} complete an initial survey and follow-up questionnaire to obtain qualitative information regarding use, motivation, and overall satisfaction for the supplemental computer-based <b>literacy</b> <b>programs.</b> Conclusions Reached The data obtained indicated that the use of computer-based <b>literacy</b> <b>programs</b> is beneficial when there is appropriate training and placement. Finally, the study revealed that most students are extrinsically motivated while using computer-based <b>literacy</b> <b>programs</b> and the formal assessment data further gathered strengthens the ability to correctly obtain student reading levels and instructional needs.
