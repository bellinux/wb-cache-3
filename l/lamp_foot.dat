40|$|As {{computer}} use increasingly influence everyday life, {{we need to}} complement {{our knowledge of the}} computer as a technology for creating fast and efficient tools, with other perspectives on information technology. We describe Slow Technology, technology aimed at promoting moments of reflection and mental rest. Taking the design programme of Slow Technology as our starting point, we have explored expressions of the acts of reading and writing information using computers in everyday life. A number of design examples including the Fan House, the Chest of Drawers, the <b>Lamp</b> <b>Foot</b> and the Fabric Door, have been created. The purpose with these examples has not been to create new information displays, interaction devices, artworks or products, but to create a basic collection of examples that can support systematic investigation of the aesthetics of computational technology as material for the design of everyday things. Experiences from the design and exhibition of these examples are presented as design leitmotifs for future work with Slow Technology...|$|E

The <b>lamp’s</b> <b>foot,</b> however, presents a dissimilar composition, one significantly richer in sodium, magnesium, and potassium. The matrix compositions, colorants, and opacifiers of the body’s enamel decorations were characterized by SEM–EDS and Raman spectroscopy analyses and compared with Mamluk and 19 th-century production.|$|R

While a shrunken Paul hides in an ashtray, the cult attack the other Beatles and pour red paint on Ringo (as part of the sacrifice).

30|$|Current {{observations}} also {{inform the}} discussion regarding the lamp’s production date, {{as well as}} the relationship of the foot {{to the rest of the}} vessel. The double pontil mark visible on the base of this lamp is characteristic of vessels reintroduced into the furnace on a pontil rod to fuse gilding and enamels, a technology consistent with Mamluk production, as opposed to kiln-firing of enamels, a technique not practiced until the 19 th century [19]. Although both edges have been partially ground down, the broken edges of the body do not meet or match those of the foot; the diameter of the body’s broken edge fits entirely within that of the foot. As compared to other Mamluk era <b>lamps,</b> the <b>foot</b> seems disproportionate to the body. Additionally as opposed to the enamels decorating the lamp’s body, red and gold-colored paints, cold-applied and unfired, decorate the top edge of the foot, perhaps an attempt to visually integrate these two sections of the object and to cover an adhesive repair. The date of the paint application is, however, unknown.|$|R
