40|$|Due to {{geographically}} variable species interactions, plants {{may become}} locally adapted to their sympatric herbivores and pollinators. However, {{adaptation to the}} abiotic environment may significantly affect plant interactions with herbivores and pollinators. <b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to the abiotic environment may constrain <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to herbivores and pollinators under contrasting selection pressures, resulting in trade-offs in <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> We studied <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> of a perennial herb, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, in a reciprocal transplant experiment among four populations and measured plant fitness, pollination success and resistance to two specialist herbivores. We also estimated <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> of these two herbivores and generalist pollinators to their sympatric plant populations. <b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> was compared with within-population genetic variation, genetic and geographical divergence, and with divergence in terms of population size, environmental conditions and plant secondary chemistry. We further compared <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to the environment, to <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to herbivores and pollinators to detect possible trade-offs in <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> The existence and degree of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> varied among the plant populations. Plants from two populations were locally adapted to their sympatric leaf herbivores and plants from two populations were locally adapted to their abiotic environment. Herbivores from one population were locally adapted to their sympatric plant population. <b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> of V. hirundinaria to the seed predator increased with increasing among-population divergence in precipitation and temperature. <b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to the seed predator and the environment increased with increasing population genetic variation. <b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> of V. hirundinaria in fitness and in herbivore resistance also correlated positively, suggesting lack of trade-offs in <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Synthesis. These results demonstrate that species interactions {{can lead to a}} mosaic of locally adapted plant, herbivore and pollinator populations. In addition to natural enemies, genetic variation, the abiotic environment and mutualistic interactions contribute to the evolution of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in long-lived plants.

40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> is {{an outcome}} of {{divergent}} selection on microbial populations and {{has been linked to}} the immense genetic diversity of microbes observed in nature. Because it is difficult to study microbes in their natural habitats, most tests of microbial <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> have been performed in model laboratory systems; as a result, microbiologists have limited understanding of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> among natural microbial populations. In this review, we summarize the evidence for microbial <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in nature. <b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> has been most frequently studied, and most frequently found, in host–pathogen systems. We argue that {{more research is needed to}} understand the prevalence of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in free-living microbial populations. However, researchers will need to overcome a variety of logistical and conceptual challenges when studying natural microbial <b>local</b> <b>adaptation,</b> including a lack of solid understanding of many microbes’ natural histories. We propose strategies to facilitate future natural history research on divergent selection. We also summarize laboratory experimental work investigating the ecological and evolutionary processes leading to <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Microbiologists’ ongoing challenge is to integrate the valuable knowledge gained from laboratory experiments into well-designed field experiments.

40|$|Studies of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> provide {{important}} insights into the power of natural selection relative to gene flow and other evolutionary forces. They are a paradigm for testing evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular environmental factors. This paper {{is an attempt to}} summarize the conceptual framework for <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> studies. We first review theoretical work relevant for <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in the pattern of deme · habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> – divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{fragmentation}} of their habitats, many organisms live in small and relatively isolated populations. In my thesis, I investigate the interplay of migration and <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Migration promotes genetic exchange among populations, thus contributing to the maintenance of genetic variation. Moreover, migration is a homogenising process that reduces the differences between <b>local</b> populations. <b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> (the adaptation of populations to their local circumstances) occurs when the direction of natural selection differs between habitats (diversifying selection). Hence, <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> results in the diversification of populations. By means of Drosophila experiments and computer simulations, I surveyed the interrelation between migration and <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> I found that diversifying selection strongly reduces the efficiency of migration. In the presence of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation,</b> migrants are not well-adapted to their new environment and therefore less able to spread their genes to future generations. This applies to all their genes, and not only to the genes involved in <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Hence, despite considerable migration, local populations become genetically isolated (‘isolation-by-adaptation’). In the presence of regular extinction and recolonisation, migration is more efficient in preventing genetic isolation. However, efficient migration is often associated with the loss of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> and therefore may reduce population viability. Already under the highly standardized conditions of my lab experiments and my simulations the interplay between migration and <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> turned out to be very intricate, with many surprising facets. This pleads for caution when making inferences and predictions in natural settings...|$|R
40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> has central {{importance}} {{in the understanding of}} co-evolution, maintenance of sexual reproduction, and speciation. We investigated <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in the alkaloid-bearing legume Crotalaria pallida and its seed predator, the arctiid moth Utetheisa ornatrix, at different spatial scales. When we studied three populations from south-east Brazil (150 km apart), we did not find evidence of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation,</b> although we did find interpopula-tional differences in herbivore performance, and a significant interaction between herbivore sex and plant population. These results indicate that both moth and plant populations are differentiated at the regional scale. In a comparison of populations from Brazil and Florida, the herbivore showed <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to its host plant; for both moth populations, the pupae were heavier when the larvae ate the sympatric than the allopatric host population. We discuss the scale dependence of our results and the possible causes for the lack of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> at the regional scale, even in the presence of plant and moth differentiation.

40|$|The {{ability of}} populations to rapidly adapt to new environments will {{determine}} their future {{in an increasingly}} human-modified world. Although meta-analyses do frequently uncover signatures of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation,</b> they also reveal many exceptions. We suggest that particular constraints on <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> might arise when organisms are exposed to novel stressors, such as anthropogenic pollution. To inform this possibility, we studied {{the extent to which}} guppies (Poecilia reticulata) show <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to oil pollution in southern Trinidad. Neutral genetic markers revealed that paired populations in oil-polluted versus not-polluted habitats diverged independently in two different watersheds. Morphometrics revealed some divergence (particularly in head shape) between these environments, some of which was parallel between rivers. Reciprocal transplant experiments in nature, however, found little evidence of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> based on survival and growth. Moreover, subsequent laboratory experiments showed that the two populations from oil-polluted sites showed only weak <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> even when compared to guppies from oil-free northern Trinidad. We conclude that guppies show little <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to oil pollution, which might result from the challenges associated with adaptation to particularly stressful environments. It might also reflect genetic drift owing to small population sizes and/or high gene flow between environments...|$|R
40|$|In sexual populations, gene-flow between niches is {{predicted}} to have differential consequences on <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> contingent upon the nature of trade-offs underlying <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Sex retards <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> if antagonistic pleiotropy underlies trade-offs, but facilitates adaptation if mutation accumulation underlies trade-offs. We evaluate the effect of sex in heterogeneous environments by manipulating gene-flow between two niches in sexual and asexual populations using steady-state microcosm experiments with yeast. We find that only sex {{in the presence of}} gene-flow promotes simultaneous <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to different niches, presumably as this exposes mutations neutrally accrued in alternate niches to selection. This finding aligns with work showing mutation accumulation underlies trade-offs to <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in asexual microbes, and with inferences of divergence in the presence of gene-flow in natural sexual populations. This experiment shows that sex may be of benefit in heterogeneous environments, and thus helps explain why sex has been maintained more generally.

40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>adaptation</b> is of {{fundamental}} importance in evolutionary, population, conservation, and global-change biology. The generality of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in plants and {{whether and how}} it is influenced by specific species, population and habitat characteristics have, however, not been quantitatively reviewed. Therefore, we examined published data on the outcomes of reciprocal transplant experiments using two approaches. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the performance of local and foreign plants at all transplant sites. In addition, we analysed frequencies of pairs of plant origin to examine whether local plants perform better than foreign plants at both compared transplant sites. In both approaches, we also examined the effects of population size, and of the habitat and species characteristics that are predicted to affect <b>local</b> <b>adaptation.</b> We show that, overall, local plants performed significantly better than foreign plants at their site of origin: this was found to be the case in 71. 0 % of the studied sites. However, local plants performed better than foreign plants at both sites of a pair-wise comparison (strict definition of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation)</b> only in 45. 3 % of the 1032 compared population pairs. Futhermore, we found <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> much more common for large plant populations (> 1000 flowering individuals) than for small populations (< 1000 flowering individuals) for which <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> was very rare. The degree of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> was independent of plant life history, spatial or temporal habitat heterogeneity, and geographic scale. Our results suggest that <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> is less common in plant populations than generally assumed. Moreover, our findings reinforce the fundamental importance of population size for evolutionary theory. The clear role of population size for the ability to evolve <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> raises considerable doubt on the ability of small plant populations to cope with changing environments.

Here, we explore the <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the perennial mountain herb Helleborus foetidus to variable environmental conditions of seedling emer- gence and establishment at two different spatial scales (habitats and regions) with special attention to the role of physical and chemical soil properties.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> {{is a key}} player in the evolution of plants, which are shaped by their environments {{perhaps more than any other}} organismal group. Botanists have often demonstrated adaptive trait differences between plant populations in different environments, and the concept of the "ecotype" was itself coined by an early plant biologist (Turesson, 1922). We continue striving to understand how the push and pull of selection and gene flow across heterogeneous environments contributes to the maintenance of genetic diversity and influences fundamental aspects of species biology such as geographic distribution, morphological diversity, and population response to environmental change. Understanding how often and why <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> occurs is an area of research that links both basic and applied branches of plant biology. In my dissertation I address fundamental questions regarding <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in plants including: 1) What is the prevalence and role of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in determining the geographic distribution of a species; 2) What are the genes involved in <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in the wild; and 3) do adaptive phenotypes evolve by similar genetic pathways in related species with different histories of selection. To address the first question, I examined the role of trait differentiation in range boundary formation in the annual wildflower Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. To explore the second and third questions, I examined patterns of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> and its genetic basis in the temperate grass Anthoxanthum odoratum. I iii focused on the ecologically and agriculturally important trait of tolerance to aluminum in acid soils. In C. x. ssp. xantiana I have shown that adaptive differentiation between populations is common. Counter to theoretical expectations however, <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> to conditions at the range edge does not preclude the existence of substantial heritable trait variation there and is thus unlikely to restrict adaptation to conditions beyond the range edge. In A. odoratum <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> is also prevalent even at the small spatial scale of experimental plots within a single hay meadow at the long-term ecological Park Grass Experiment. Using genomic techniques, I demonstrate that adaptation to soil Al stress in this wild grass has many genetic similarities to cultivated grasses, but also likely involves previously undescribed genetic pathways. Both novel and canonical pathways are also likely to have been the targets of selection during the process of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> during the history of the experiment. In combination, these studies reaffirm the prevalence of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation</b> in nature, but they also demonstrate that simple theoretical predictions about the exitence of <b>local</b> <b>adaptation,</b> its genetic basis, and its ecological consequences are suspect. Direct studies of adaptive traits and their underlying genes in diverse organisms will continue to be critical for understanding the true nature of the complex interaction between selection, gene flow, and genetic architechture to produce what we observe in the natural world. iv 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|R
