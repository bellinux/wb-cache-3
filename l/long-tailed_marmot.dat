50|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmot</b> is diurnal and {{feeds on}} plant material. It is most {{active in the}} morning when about forty percent of the time is spent foraging. After {{emerging}} from the burrow, the marmots spread out and do not forage as a group. Food is either collected from the ground by the mouth or plucked from taller plants. Between bouts of foraging, a marmot sometimes stands on its back legs and surveys its surroundings. Group members communicate with each other, emitting complex alarm calls when predators are spotted. They also react to the alarm calls of neighbouring groups. Predators of the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmot</b> include the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the grey wolf (Canis lupus), the snow leopard (Panthera uncia), the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and possibly the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmot</b> is a large, sturdy rodent {{weighing}} up to 9 kg. The eyes {{are close to}} the top of the rather-flattened head, the ears are small and the neck is short. The forelegs are longer than the hind legs and the tail is longer than in other species of marmot.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} the area include <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmots,</b> juniper voles, silver {{mountain}} voles, Tolai hares, Royle's pikas, Marco Polo sheep. Siberian ibex, snow leopards, Eurasian lynx, Pallas's cats, grey wolves, red foxes, Turkmenian weasels, stoats and brown bears.|$|R
50|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmot</b> usually forms monogamous {{relationships}} but {{lives in}} larger social groups, {{with up to}} seven adults sharing a single home range. These individuals {{are likely to be}} related to each other with young adults normally only dispersing after they have become fully grown at three or more years of age. Adult immigrants are tolerated in the group but only a single adult female normally lactates and rears young in any one season.|$|E
50|$|The Zabarwan {{mountain}} range possesses great Himalayan features with rich wildlife. The Dachigam National Park, spread over 141 km2, {{is the main}} feature of the range. The Dachigam National Park holds the last viable population of Kashmir stag (Hangul) and the largest population of black bear in Asia. The range {{is also home to}} musk deer, leopard, Himalayan brown bear, leopard cat, jungle cat, red fox, jackal, Himalayan wolf, serow, Himalayan yellow-throated marten, <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmot,</b> Indian porcupine, Himalayan mouse-hare, langur and Himalayan weasel.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmot</b> or golden marmot (Marmota caudata) is {{a species}} of marmot in the family Sciuridae.Found in mountainous regions in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, India and China, its altitudinal range is from 3200 to 4850 m above sea level. Its typical habitat is rough {{grassland}} and alpine meadows, often among rocks where dwarf junipers grow. Although the population trend is unknown, It has a wide range and large total population size, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|Home {{ranges of}} the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>marmot</b> average about three {{hectares}} and contain about three burrow systems (range one to six). In a chamber {{in one of}} these burrows the marmots hibernate from about September to April or May, a period during which the ground is covered with snow for much of the time. Different burrows may be used for hibernation in different years. Mating occurs in late April and early May and may take place underground before the marmots emerge from the burrow after the winter. The gestation period is about four and a half weeks and the litter of about four pups emerges from the nest at about six weeks of age. Only about half of the pups survive the summer, some being consumed by predators and others being killed by adult males joining the group. Most adults survive the hibernation period but a rather higher proportion of juveniles die during their first winter. Females do not usually breed as three-year-olds but wait till the following year.|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} marmots occur in India, the Himalayan Marmot Marmota himalayana and the <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Marmot</b> or Golden Marmot Marmota caudata.   Marmots {{constitute}} {{part of the}} diet of some globally endangered carnivores in the Trans-Himalaya, yet studies on marmots in India are scanty.   Besides, {{the status of the}} <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Marmot</b> is still unknown in India.   Considering this, a survey was carried out in Rangdum Valley, Kargil between May and July 2011 to collect baseline information on the <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Marmot.</b>   Trails and roads were explored through walk and slow moving vehicle, respectively.   The <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Marmot</b> was found to have a density of 14. 31 ± 2. 10 per sq. km. and an encounter rate of 2. 86 ± 0. 42 per km.   Most of the observations of <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Marmot</b> were in hilly areas (77. 7 %), lower slope (48. 8 %) and herbaceous meadow (38. 0 %).   The current information is expected to bring concern towards this lesser known species in India.    </div...|$|E
