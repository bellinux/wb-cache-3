5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal <b>length</b> <b>range</b> of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{monolithic}} columns {{were used}} by Roman builders who preferred them over the stacked drums typical of classical Greek architecture. The logistics and technology involved in the transport and erection of extra-large single-piece columns were demanding: As a rule of thumb, {{the weight of the}} column shafts in the <b>length</b> <b>range</b> between 40 and 60 Roman feet (c. 11.8 to 17.8m) doubled with every ten feet from c. 50 over 100 to 200t. Despite this, forty and also fifty feet tall monolithic shafts {{can be found in a}} number of Roman buildings, but examples reaching sixty feet are only in evidence in two unfinished granite columns which still lie in the Roman quarry of Mons Claudianus, Egypt. One of the pair, which was discovered only in the 1930s, has an estimated weight of 207t. All these dimensions, however, are surpassed by Pompey's Pillar, a free-standing victory column erected in Alexandria in 297AD: measuring 20.46m high with a diameter of 2.71m at its base, the weight of its granite shaft has been put at 285t.|$|E

2500|$|The oldest type of needle is the {{straight}} double-pointed needle. Double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which {{allows them to}} be knit from either end. [...] They are typically used (and sold) in sets of four and five, and are commonly used for circular knitting. Since {{the invention of the}} circular needle, they have been most commonly used to knit smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks. Usually two needles are active while the others hold the remaining stitches. Double-pointed needles are somewhat shorter than single-pointed or circular needles, and are usually used in the 13–20cm <b>length</b> <b>range,</b> although they are also made longer.|$|E
2500|$|Dakotaraptor is {{the first}} {{medium-sized}} predator discovered in the Hell Creek Formation, intermediate in length between gigantic tyrannosaurids like Tyrannosaurus and smaller deinonychosaurians like Acheroraptor. Especially {{if it was a}} pack-hunter, cooperating in groups, it could have preyed upon larger herbivores, possibly competing with subadult tyrannosaurids in the [...] <b>length</b> <b>range.</b> As its shinbone was longer than its thighbone, Dakotaraptor would have had a good running capacity, filling the niche of pursuit predator. The keeled claw of the second toe, the [...] "sickle claw", was used to bring down prey and had a more robust flexor tubercle than that of Utahraptor. To the contrary, the third foot claw was relatively smaller in size than with other dromaeosaurids and seems not to have had an important function in attacking prey animals.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{interrupted}} by frequent gaps, 141 sections of consecutive narrative have been preserved. These can be compiled into {{the length of}} a longer novella. The extant portions were supposedly [...] "from the 15th and 16th books" [...] from a notation by on a manuscript found in Trau in Dalmatia in 1663 by Petit. However, according to translator and classicist William Arrowsmith, [...] "this evidence is late and unreliable and needs to be treated with reserve, all the more since—even {{on the assumption that the}} Satyricon contained sixteen rather than, say, twenty or twenty-four books—the result would have been a work of unprecedented length." [...] Nonetheless speculation as to the size of the original puts it somewhere on the order of a work of thousands of pages, and reference points for <b>length</b> <b>range</b> from Tom Jones to In Search of Lost Time by Proust. The extant text runs 140 pages in the Arrowsmith edition. The complete novel must have been considerably longer but its true length cannot be known.|$|E

50|$|The {{shrimp scad}} {{is known to}} be a migratory species, with records from India {{indicating}} the fish resides and feeds in the waters of Madras from September to May, before migrating elsewhere to spawn. The shrimp scad feeds on a variety of prey, with at least two shifts in diet occurring as the fish mature. Older individuals feed mainly on young fishes, crustaceans like decapods, ostracods, amphipods and cladocerans with minor amounts of nematodes, insect body parts and insect larvae taken. Fish within a <b>length</b> <b>range</b> of 150-199 mm and 240-319 mm showed a preference for young fishes, while those in the <b>length</b> <b>range</b> of 200-239 mm primarily consumed ostracods and other crustaceans. Based on the food items taken, the species is an active midwater feeder. There is less food consumed during breeding season, which is indicative of reduced feeding activity during that period. Sexual maturity is attained by about 17 cm fork length and spawning is thought to occur in shallow coastal waters.|$|E
