40|$|The {{first attempt}} at European {{economic}} reconstruction after 1945 culminated in the economic crisis of 1947 (Tumlir, La Haye 1981). Due to state control over prices and production {{and the lack of}} sound money for both internal and external transactions, Europe had, to a large extent, returned to the stage of barter trade. This paper addresses the strategies chosen to overcome the shortage of international liquidity, the so-called dollar gap, during the second and successful attempt at European economic reconstruction from 1947 onwards. It focuses on those aspects which relate directly to the transition from bilateral barter to multilateral trade involving money, i. e. on the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> trade and <b>payments.</b> Since most early steps to remove restrictions on external trade and payments in Germany and Europe were initiated by the U. S. and implemented on a Western European level, this paper discusses these first measures in a European context before the emphasis shifts to the question why West Germany became a genuine pacemaker for the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> cross-border transactions from 1953 onwards. As a first step towards a more ambitious study, this paper provides an - admittedly theory-laden - description of some major aspects of the chosen subject rather than an in-depth theoretical analysis or a thorough evaluation of all historical evidence available. ...|$|R

Such a process has eased the access of multinational corporations (MNCs) to the country, which has promoted exports. However, it has also resulted in a higher import content and the displacement of local firms, which has limited Mexico's economic development through the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> constraint. The analysis {{is supported by the}} existence of linkages -bi-directional Granger causality- between exports, imports and FDI.

Chapter 3 discusses the importance of FDI flows, which are essential for new investments or for financing fortuitous deficits in host countries, {{and looks at the}} adjustment mechanisms for the equilibrium of the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> Chapter 4 gives attention to FDI flows, the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> financial markets and the financial account of the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in developing countries in providing more opportunities and mechanisms for development and economic growth.

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} conventional {{interpretations of}} the real plan in two different ways. First, it argues that the contractionary monetary and fiscal policies that adorned its launch were largely irrelevant. Inflation was reduced primarily by the elimination of inertia and the repression of the distributive conflict through the internationalisation and <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the economy. Second, {{it shows that the}} plan is inconsistent, because it relies heavily on permanently high domestic interest rates in order to attract foreign capital. However, they destabilise the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and worsen the fiscal deficit endogenously. 1 I am grateful to Howard Cox, Grazia Ietto-Gillies, Maria de Lourdes R.

40|$|Likely {{policy changes}} leading towards further <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the Common Agricultural Policy would {{certainly}} influence farmers’ income and revenue risks. Thus, a question arises both for farmers and for policy makers about possible effects and necessary adjustments {{that should be}} made to face such changes. The paper examines long-term impacts of changes of key policy factors on income risk in Polish dairy farms. Deterministic linear programming farm model was used to estimate farm incomes and likely changes in production pattern, while stochastic simulation farm model was applied for examining income risk. The main results of this model chain are optimal production structures for farm types modelled in a set of assumed policy conditions as well as farm income and its volatility. Comparison of model results across scenarios allows to state that increase of milk quota and reduction <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> significantly decrease farm incomes on dairy farms in Poland. Full <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the Common Agricultural Policy and withdrawal <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> results with even more radical negative income effects especially in the cluster of smaller milk producers. Simulation indicates significantly increased risk of achieving low farm incomes.

The methodology consists of a macro-micro simulation in which a CGE model provides labour market outcomes, which in turn are used to manipulate the sectoral allocation of employment to generate the income distribution consistent with the new labour market outcome. In the application to Jamaica, we find that the reallocation of resources away from rent-seeking activities in the presence of exchange controls is significant and has large macroeconomic effects. Opening up of the current account has little effect on poverty, but <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the capital account reduces poverty, especially amongst the very poor. Neither policy change taken separately, nor the combination of the two, has more than a negligible effect on the distribution of income. computable general equilibrium, economic reform, rent-seeking, Jamaica,...|$|R
40|$|Malaysia is set {{to embrace}} the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services. This will pose {{strategic}} challenges to Malaysian law firms and will impact on industry competition. It is not certain as to how Malaysian law firms perceive the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services, and what strategic actions will be taken by {{them in order to}} maintain their strategic position and competitiveness. Against this backdrop, this study seeks to find out the answers to the questions as to how Malaysian law firms perceive the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services – whether it is perceived as a threat or an opportunity; the strengths, weaknesses and core competencies of Malaysian law firms in face <b>of</b> the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services; and the strategic actions taken by Malaysian law firms in order to maintain their strategic position and competitiveness. The bodies of literature that were used to inform this research are the conceptual framework of Porter’s five forces and the theory of the resource-based view. Using qualitative approach, this research seeks to examine the research problem by interviewing participants who are partners of Malaysian law firms as well as a representative from the professional body which represent the largest State Bar Committee in Malaysia, i. e. the Kuala Lumpur Bar Committee. From the fieldwork, it was found out that Malaysian law firms generally perceive the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services as both a threat and an opportunity. It was also found out that Malaysian law firms do have their own strengths, weaknesses and core competencies in face of the challenges that arise from the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services. This research confirmed and prove the usefulness of Porter’s five forces framework to assess the attractiveness of the legal industry in Malaysia based on the strengths of five competitive forces and the resource-based view to analyse the internal asset (i. e. resources, capabilities and competencies) of Malaysian law firms. Future research may be built upon this research to study the impacts <b>of</b> the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services on Malaysian law firms...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a rapid {{growth in the number}} of {{preferential}} trade agreements (PTAs) between developed and developing economies. Typically however many of these PTAs only incorporate a partial <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> food and agricultural trade by developed economies. This paper reports the results from simulations conducted using a global comparative static model CGE model that has been calibrated with data from the GTAP database (version 5). Using the EU RSA FTA as an example the results indicate that the optimal degree <b>of</b> food trade <b>liberalisation</b> by the EU is less than 100 percent, and declines appreciably after the optimum. Qualitatively similar results emerge for South Africa. However, the welfare gains for South Africa increase rapidly with the increasing <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> EU food and agricultural trade, while the welfare gains for the EU increase slowly with the increasing <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> South African food trade. These results indicate that bilateral trade negotiations between developing and developed countries may involve a complex bargaining process, wherein the payoffs from different strategies are neither necessarily intuitively obvious nor are they necessarily consistent with the full <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> food trade by developed economies. ...|$|R
