5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{construction}} of a pier and a promenade in the 19th century, Sheerness acquired the added attractions of a seaside resort. Industry retains its important place in the town and the Port of Sheerness is one of the United Kingdom's <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> and fresh produce importers. The town is the site of one of the UK's first co-operative societies and also of the world's first multi-storey buildings with a rigid metal frame.|$|E
5|$|The Zephyrs power (<b>leading)</b> <b>car</b> was {{numbered}} 9900, the baggage-coach {{combine car}} 505, and the coach-observation 570. The train {{was placed in}} regular service between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, on November 11, 1934, replacing a pair of steam locomotives and six heavyweight passenger cars, weighing up to eight {{times as much as}} the Zephyr. By June 1935, it proved popular enough to add a fourth car, providing additional coach seating. The fourth car was originally a 40-seat coach number 525, but the following June it was switched to Twin Cities service, then back to the Pioneer Zephyr in December. Car 525 remained on the train until June 1938. Just over five years after it was introduced, the Pioneer Zephyr crossed the one million mile mark in regular service on December 29, 1939, near Council Bluffs, Iowa.|$|E

25|$|On May 28, 2008, a {{derailment}} was reported, {{with approximately}} 24 injuries. Two train {{cars on the}} four-car train appeared to be derailed, with the <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> abutting the one behind it at an angle of approximately 150 degrees. The train cars were separated at a switching point near 59th Street.|$|E
25|$|The {{southbound}} Metrolink train (#100) {{struck the}} parked Jeep {{that had been}} driven by Álvarez onto the tracks at the Chevy Chase Drive grade crossing just west of San Fernando Road, pushing the Jeep southward along the track towards the Los Feliz Boulevard undercrossing until automotive parts struck a track switch and became lodged under the <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> of the Metrolink train, raising it up and causing the train to derail. Cars from the derailed train jackknifed, hitting both the locomotive of the stationary freight train and sideswiping {{the rear of the}} passing northbound #901 Metrolink passenger train. This caused the rear cars of the northbound train to derail, and at least one car rolled over onto its side. A fire, involving one or more passenger cars, was caused by spilled diesel fuel.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{train was}} a High Speed Train, driven by 52-year-old Brian Cooper, {{who was killed}} in the accident. It {{comprised}} eight Mark 3 coaches with a Class 43 diesel power car at each end. It was of much more substantial construction than the Turbo train, the <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> of which was totally destroyed. The diesel fuel carried by this train was dispersed by the collision and ignited in a fireball, causing a series of separate fires in the wreckage, particularly in coach H {{at the front of the}} HST, which was completely burnt out. The drivers of both trains involved were killed, as well as 29 others (24 on the Turbo train, six on the HST as a result of the impact, with a further fatality as a result of the fire), and 227 people were admitted to hospital. A further 296 people were treated at the site of the crash for minor injuries.|$|E

50|$|On lap 35 the Safety Car was off and {{the race}} restarted. Alonso had a {{strategy}} to give an enormous gap with the SC and slow down the cars behind, and then blasted off and leave Räikkönen and Heidfeld with the trouble of Albers, creating a 3-second {{gap between the two}} <b>leading</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Solar {{cars are}} {{required}} to meet rigorous standards for brakes. Disc brakes are {{the most commonly used}} due to their good braking ability and ability to adjust. Mechanical and hydraulic brakes are both widely used. The brake pads or shoes are typically designed to retract to minimize brake drag, on <b>leading</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{the event}} of an {{incident}} that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a [...] "rolling start". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car. Mercedes-Benz supplies Mercedes-AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. Since 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayländer. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> takes over the role of the safety car until the first safety car line, which is usually a white line after the pit lane entrance. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, {{with several}} UK auto-producers losing market share, Datsun had grabbed the {{headlines}} as the UK's <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> importer. The magazine Autocar road tested a 180B Bluebird and recorded {{a top speed}} of 101mph (162km/h) along with a 0–60mph (0 – 96km/h) time of 13.6 seconds. The Datsun's overall fuel consumption for the test was 27.7 mpg (10.2 l/100km). For all three of these performance measurements, it was marginally better than the Ford Cortina 1600 GL which continued to dominate this sector in the UK, but both cars were beaten for speed and acceleration (though not for fuel economy) by the relatively crude Morris Marina 1.8HL. It was probably more significant that the Bluebird had a manufacturer's recommended retail price, including sales taxes, of £2950 as against £3263 for the Ford and £3315 for the Morris. The testers found the car matched the competition in most respects, though the brakes were criticised for being [...] "not up to current standards".|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms of the CoT {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of the CoT based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to {{know who it was}} who said this car would reduce the aero push because I could have told you from when I first drove this car that it would be worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how the CoT was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} <b>leading</b> <b>car,</b> thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E
25|$|Most of the <b>leading</b> <b>cars</b> {{ended up}} behind Alonso and some slower drivers, who proved {{difficult}} {{to pass on}} the narrow circuit, while those ahead of Alonso were lighter on fuel and were able to pull away, but had not pitted.

2500|$|On 28 April 2006, set VL29 was {{involved}} in a collision at a level crossing at Trawalla while travelling from Ararat. It collided with a large triaxle road trailer carrying a 16-tonne block of stone and two heavy press machines. The front of the train withstood the impact with the trailer, but the press machines were thrown loose, striking and penetrating the cab. At the time of the impact, three people were in the cab, the driver (who was seriously injured) and two off-duty Pacific National drivers (one of whom was injured, and the other killed). As the train continued through the crossing, the rear trailer swung around and the stone block was thrown off, striking and partially penetrating the side of the <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> (1129), killing the mother of the train driver, who had been travelling as a passenger. The final injury count is unknown. The unit had [...] been in service for seven days before the accident. After the accident, both cars were taken to Newport Workshops for examination. Carriage 1129 suffered the most damage and was written off. Carriage 1229, having received relatively minor damage, was sent to Bombardier, Dandenong for repairs. It was later renumbered 1241 and marshalled together with new cars 1141 and 1341.|$|E

50|$|The {{driver of}} the Coulsdon train {{initially}} thought that the London Bridge train was on another line, and only realised there was a conflict {{a few seconds before}} the accident. He made an emergency brake application, but the speed was not significantly reduced. The <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> of the Coulsdon train overrode the rear car of the London Bridge train, completely destroying the wooden bodywork of all but one of its compartments. Nine of the ten fatalities occurred in this car. The <b>leading</b> <b>car</b> of the Coulsdon train also suffered considerable damage, but there was no significant damage to any other car of either train, and neither train derailed.|$|E
