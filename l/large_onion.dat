The highest yielding onions were yellow varieties compared to the two white and one red varieties, but premiums for the non-yellow onions at harvest compensated for the lower yields.

During the reconstruction much of the internal design was destroyed and replaced with Orthodox frescoes {{as well as with}} a large iconostasis. In addition, <b>large,</b> <b>onion</b> domes were added to both towers.

40|$|Contact {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} between an onion lamellar phase and brine, in the SDS/octanol/brine system. Using video microscopy we have studied the nonequilibrium behaviour of the swelling and dissolution process of onions. Experiments at T = 20 ◦ C and 30 ◦ C showed that temperature has a strong effect on their behaviour. At low temperature onions are observed to diffuse away from the onion phase and only swell sightly. However by increasing the temperature we induce the formation of sponge phase (L 3) at the onion/brine interface. Onions that initially swell then dissolve into L 3 phase expel a stable core which moves to the micellar phase and remains there. Over {{a longer period of}} time (several days) we have also observed coalescence leading to the formation of <b>large</b> <b>onions</b> of up to ∼ 100 µm diameter.

40|$|Selection of {{the proper}} {{irrigation}} method will be advantageous to manage limited water supplies and increase crop profitability. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and furrow irrigation on onion yield and irrigation use efficiency. This study was conducted in two locations, a commercial field and a field located at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Center in Weslaco, TX. This study was conducted as a split-plot design for both sites with two treatments (SDI and furrow irrigation) and three replications per treatment. The total onion yield obtained with the SDI systems was more than 93 % higher than the yield obtained with furrow irrigation systems. The <b>large</b> <b>onion</b> size was 181 % higher for the SDI system than the furrow system in both sites. The colossal size yield was also higher. At one site colossal yield was 206 % higher than furrow, while at another site furrow yielded no colossal onions and SDI had some production. It was concluded that drip irrigation systems more than double yields and increased onion size while using almost half of the water. This was due to SDI allowing for more frequent and smaller irrigation depths with higher irrigation efficiency than furrow irrigation systems...|$|E

This cleaning and sorting of onion is done by women workers. The woman is born sincere and serious about the work and hence processing of onion is got done by woman instead of man.
