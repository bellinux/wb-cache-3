40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of e-commerce and the proliferation of liberal return policies, product returns have become daily routines for many companies. Considering the significant impact of product returns on the company’s bottom line, a growing number of companies have attempted to streamline the reverse logistics process. Products are usually returned to initial collection points (ICPs) in small quantities and thus increase the unit shipping cost due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> discount opportunities. One way to address this issue is to aggregate the returned products into a larger shipment. However, such aggregation increases the holding time at the ICP, which in turn increases the inventory carrying costs. Considering this logistics dilemma, the main objectives of this research are to minimize the total cost by determining the optimal location and collection period of holding time of ICPs; determining the optimal location of a centralized return centre; transforming the nonlinear objective function of the proposed model formulation by Min et al. (2006 a) into a linear form; and conducting a sensitivity analysis to the model solutions according to varying parameters such as shipping volume. Existing models and solution procedures are too complicated to solve real-world problems. Through a series of computational experiments, we discovered that the linearization model obtained the optimal solution {{at a fraction of the}} time used by the traditional nonlinear model and solution procedure, as well as the ability to handle up to 150 customers as compared to 30 in the conventional nonlinear model. As such, the proposed linear model is more suitable for actual industry applications than the existing models...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{commercial development}} of agriculturally based industries {{is the basis}} for many of the projects that the Organisation has executed on behalf of the Government of Pakistan over the years. Normally this is implicit in the technical advice that is offered, in the training that is given or the equipment that is purchased for use by a particular project. In the case of project TCP/PAK/ 0154 the model adopted has been more imaginative. The project was designed to encourage a shift in thinking; to introduce the commercial reality of the marketplace as the basis for production; to encourage the entrepreneur. The modest successes of the project should be seen in this context. The Agri-Business Cell (ABC) established in the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives in 1990 was supported for a period of more than two years by the project; the experience gained has enabled the ABC to attract further agency interest, and to determine the model most applicable to domestic requirements. The ABC has been (and continues to be) a pioneering unit; providing an enabling environment in which the resources of the Ministry concerned and the private sector can be re-directed into the commercial development of an industrial sub-sector which may show promise. Change has been a dominant feature of the ABC during the period of FAO technical assistance; this has resulted in a mixed investment programme, as competing project ventures were scrutinised, selected (or rejected) and developed. It was important to focus the limited resources of the ABC upon projects that could later be duplicated elsewhere within the private sector, and which could be scaled to suit the demands of the market and the levels of investment capital available. There {{have been a number of}} elements within this broad strategy of development, including project implementation, training and field work. The project focused upon two industrial sub- sectors for which government planners and the private sector had shown some interest, viz. fresh flower exports and the provision of certified banana planting materials. The Consultant engaged to undertake the industrial survey for the fresh flower market showed that the domestic industry would face difficulties in international markets. Most cut flowers are currently sold locally. High transport costs, inadequate cold storage handling facilities at airports and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> space on international aircraft would make it difficult for domestic growers to compete. Climatic constraints within the country would also limit the supply of cut flowers. Negative conclusions are an intrinsic part of the planning process, and enable resources to be shifted into ventures where the elements of risk may be lower. This has been the case with the banana project, in which the Consultant showed that sufficient high-quality planting materials could be produced by domestic institutions or companies, thereby negating the need for imports from France or Costa Rica (the predominant suppliers). The development of a tissue culture laboratory for the production of planting material represents a firm choice for industrial investment. Several visits were made to the project by FAO Headquarters Technical Officers and by the Consultants selected for the field work. Apart from the normal management function that such visits may offer and support for the banana and cut-flower projects, the ABC was able to focus upon alternative industrial sub-sectors including dehydrated fruits, tomato concentrate and essential oils. The study tour scheduled for ABC staff to visit offices of the Africa Project Development Facility (APDF) in Africa was not undertaken. This remains a lost opportunity for the ABC. Given the encouraging track record of the APDF with a host of clients in the more difficult trading and economic environment of parts of Africa, their example is one that may eventually apply to the ABC and Pakistan...|$|E

40|$|Now, 10 {{years after}} the first plans, we analyse in this paper what has {{happened}} with Underground Logistic Systems (ULS). The major question in this paper is: Which barriers and enablers led to the failure of ULS and what ULS spin-offs can be found nowadays? Several factors can be classified as barriers or enablers. The main conclusions that can be drawn are that the opportunities for try-out were too limited; political support could have been gained on higher levels; the costs were too high, the catchment area was too limited; ULS in itself is a very promising system, but there was no one clear goal. In particular, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a thorough and positive business model in combination with a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient <b>freight</b> volumes almost immediately guaranteed the failure of the initiative.

40|$|Freight {{transportation}} {{is an integral}} element of various supply chains and has a complex and dynamical interrelationship with human economic activities. Modern logistical strategies paved way to the current supply chain organisation and logistics network design resulting in a more global economy and huge economies of scale. Recent trends of volatility of oil price have major implications in the movement of commodities across the supply chains. Likewise, climate change issues have presented urgent challenges in reducing carbon emissions for the transport and logistics sector. Pressure on the sector comes from both governments and consumers alike, demanding future sustainability as well as corporate environmental and social responsibility. The original contribution {{of this research is}} to investigate the system-wide dynamics of freight transportation and production in the context of supply chains. A theoretical framework called the ‘Geographic Adaptive Potential’ or GAP is built to understand how constraints in energy and emissions affect the production and distribution of commodities. The changes in the supply chain were investigated in four different components, namely a) the potential to shift to less energy and emissions intensive modes for long-haul freight, b) logistical strategies in the last leg of the chain or urban freight and c) local production and distribution, and d) the accessibility of potential customers to the markets. The design of the GAP components is in correspondence with the links of the supply chain. The analyses yielded an evaluation of the adaptive capacity of the freight transport and production system. For long-haul freight, a GIS-based model was created called the ‘New Zealand Intermodal Freight Network’ or NZIFN. It is an optimisation tool integrating the road, rail and shipping network of New Zealand and calculates that minimum time, operating costs, energy and emissions routes between 2 given locations. The case studies of Auckland to Wellington and Auckland to Christchurch distributions of non-perishable products established that even a marginal increase of rail and coastal shipping share produced around 10 % reduction in both freight energy and greenhouse gas emissions. In the study of the last leg of the supply chain, the truck trip generation rates of different food stores were investigated. The strongest factors influencing the trip rates to a store are its size and product variation, the latter being a new parameter introduced in the dissertation. It is defined as the total number of brands for 6 chosen commodities commonly found in the stores. The trip rates together with the truck type and distance travelled were used to compute the freight energy usage of the stores. Results revealed that supermarkets consume the most energy for their delivery operations but relative to its physical size, they are more energy efficient than smaller stores. This is due to the utilisation of advanced logistical strategies such as freight consolidation and the effective use of distribution centres. The localised production chapter was explored in the context of Farmers’ markets and their difference with the conventional supermarket distribution system. Using a freight transport energy audit, the energy intensities of both systems were compared. The findings showed that Farmers’ markets were more energy-intensive than supermarkets owing to the low volumes of goods delivered to the market and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> consolidation effort in the system. The study on the active mode access of potential customers to both Farmers’ markets and supermarkets captured the interplay between freight and personal transport and is the final component of GAP. The results of the ArcGIS based model called ‘Active Mode Access’ or AMA demonstrated that both Farmers’ markets and supermarkets have the same level of accessibility for walking or biking customers. However, the calculations also showed that almost 87 % of New Zealanders have no AMA to stores and are at risk for fuel price increase. Finally, the key result of this dissertation is the assessment that there is actually limited adaptive capacity of the freight transport and production system. This is due to network infrastructure and geographical constraints as well as commodity type and mode compatibility and other operational concerns. Due to these limitations, the GAP model assessed that reduction in energy and allowable emissions will ultimately reduce the amount of commodities moved in the system...|$|E
50|$|In 1976, {{the owners}} of the railway decided to operate steam trains between Layerthorpe and Dunnington, which was {{the entire length of the}} line at that time.

A significant problem, for logistics companies, is the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> trip control. Continuous monitoring the trips <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> trucks is necessary. First of all, it does help logistics companies to prevent the fraud behaviours. But more importantly, it help us understanding the trip patterns <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> truck transportation. The development of Global Position System(GPS) and wireless communication together enables the possibility to analyze large scale freight trips. In this paper, we study a large GPS trajectory dataset <b>of</b> 14654 <b>freight</b> trucks from a 3 rd-party company, which helps logistics companies monitoring those freight trucks.

40|$|The field <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> {{transport}} modelling {{is relatively}} young compared to passenger transport modelling. However, some key issues in freight policy, like growing freight shares on the road, advanced logistics concepts or emerging strict freight transport regulations, have been creating increasing demand for freight transport models that satisfy the increased need for detail. (Tavasszy 2006). Especially regarding the increased detail needs, shortcomings in existing freight transport models are found. Firstly, mainly due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> disaggregate data in freight transportation, most existing freight transport models are aggregate models (De Jong 2007) rather than disaggregate models. This {{can result in}} a big loss of precision, particularly if aggregate groups <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> shipments are not homogenous with respect to their attributes. Secondly, logistics concepts, being a key issue in the development <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> transport, are insufficiently incorporated in freight models. Practically every freight transport model system proposed in literature or used in practice suffers from a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> explicit treatment of logistics choices or explicit incorporation of a logistics costs perspective. Thirdly, although it has been widely accepted that decision makers make their choices of mode and shipment size simultaneously (Abdelwahab 1998), many freight transport models consider key decisions in an oversimplified sequential order, or ignore shipment size altogether.
