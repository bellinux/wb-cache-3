40|$|ABSTRACT: Both {{fluidized}} sand {{baths and}} steam chambers {{have been used}} to heat <b>laboratory</b> <b>reactors,</b> in particular for studies of biomass pretreatment. In this study, several aspects of the heating performance of these devices were compared: time to heat reactors to reaction temperature, the stability of reactor temperature, and the convection coefficient. The convection coefficient was determined using correlations and multiple analyses of empirical data. On the basis of the results presented in this study, the steam chamber can heat reactors to temperature in a tenth of the time sand baths can, can maintain a more stable temperature during pretreatment, and has a convection coefficient one to two magnitudes greater than that of the sand bath. Therefore if heat transfer is critical, a steam chamber is advantageous. Heating <b>laboratory</b> <b>reactors</b> can be accomplished by a wide variety of devices.
