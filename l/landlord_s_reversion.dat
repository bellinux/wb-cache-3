40|$|Griffith (1) was {{the first}} to show that S forms of pneumococci could be {{transformed}} from one specific S type into other specific S types through the intermediate stage of the R form. In recent publications by one of the authors (2, 3), Griffith's observations on the transformation of pneumococcal types were confirmed and extended. The results of these investigations may be summarized as follows: It was shown that R forms of pneumococci could be converted into S forms of the original type by the subcutaneous injection, in white mice, of small amounts of living R organisms, together with S vaccines of the homologous type. (In this procedure, vaccines prepared from cultures of Type II S and Type III S organisms are equally effective whether heated for 15 minutes at 60 °, for 15 minutes at 80 ° or for 15 minutes at 100 °C. Vaccines prepared from Type I S organisms, however, are effective in producing reversion when heated for 15 minutes at 60 °C. and for 15 minutes at 80 °C., but not when heated for 15 minutes at 100 °C.) In vitro attempts to effect the R ~ <b>S</b> <b>reversion</b> by the use of vaccines were uniforml...|$|R
40|$|Since Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reversion</b> to China in 1997, the Special Administrative Region 2 ̆ 7 s {{government}} and its people have grappled {{with the problem of}} trying to pursue dual objectives at the same time. Firstly, to adjust to being a 2 ̆ 7 new 2 ̆ 7 part of China and what that means in terms of national consciousness and local identities, particularly given the Beijing leaders 2 ̆ 7 expectations that Hongkongers should come to 2 ̆ 7 love China 2 ̆ 7. Secondly, drawing at least in part on the past British colonial legacy, to maintain Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s international role as a cosmopolitan and commercial city as typified through the aspiration to be 2 ̆ 7 Asia 2 ̆ 7 s world city 2 ̆ 7. This paper explores the ways in which these two competing narratives intersect in the sports policy arena. Sport is frequently seen as a means to express or reflect nationalism {{or at the very least}} contribute to the formation of national identity. By using the case studies of Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s partial involvement in the 2008 Beijing Olympics (hosting the equestrian events), its hosting of the 2009 East Asian Games and the abortive domestic debates over applying to host the Asian Games, it will be shown that the mixed messages coming from these mega-events (or putative mega-events) reflect the ambivalence felt by many Hongkongers themselves about their place in China and the world...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{metabolic}} {{transformation of the}} monoterpenes Linalool (Lin), Myrcene (Myr) and Eucalyptol (Euc) was evaluated on their antimutagenic potential against t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) and 2 -nitropropane (2 NP) in E. coli WP 2 and in <b>S.</b> typhimurium <b>reversion</b> assays, respectively. Spontaneous mutagenesis was also monitored in both assays. Mammalian metabolic transformation was provided by rat liver microsomes (S 9 fraction). None of the monoterpenes was mutagenic, either with or without S 9. Results obtained without S 9 showed the antimutagenic potential of Lin against t-BOOH, of Myr against both t-BOOH and 2 NP, and of Euc against spontaneous and mutagenesis induced with both mutagens. Mammalian enzymes significantly reduced the antimutagenic effect of Lin, completely diminished the antimutagenic effect of Myr, but did not alter the antimutagenic effect of Euc. Considering the results, metabolic transformation by host enzymes could significantly influence antimutagenic potential and {{should be included in}} antimutagenicity studies in prokaryotic assays.

40|$|The conditionally lethal mutation, 286 lmis, {{has been}} mapped inside the ribosomal protein gene cluster at 72 {{minutes on the}} Escherichia coli {{chromosome}} and was found to cotransduce at 97 % with rpsE (S 5). The 2861 mis mutation leads to thermosensitivity and impaired assembly in vivo of 30 S ribosomal particles at 42 °C. The strain carrying the mutation has an altered S 17 ribosomal protein; the mutational alteration involves a replacement of serine by phenylalanine in protein <b>S</b> 17. Spontaneous <b>reversion</b> to temperature independence can restore the normal assembly in vivo of 30 S ribosomal subunits at 42 °C and the normal chromatographical sehaviour of the S 17 ribosomal protein in vitro.

40|$|The HIS 1 and THR 4 loci are the {{structural}} genes for phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphorylase and threonine synthetase, respectively. The allele his 1 – 1 S has no enzyme activity at 30 °, but does have activity at 15 ° provided the cell contains the wild-type THR 4 allele or a suppressing allele at another locus, designated SUP(his 1 – 1 S). Under these conditions, cells with the his 1 – 1 S mutation {{are capable of}} growth on minimal medium at 15 °. Three kinds of reversions of a his 1 – 1 S thr 4 sup(his 1 – 1 S) strain to histidine prototrophy have been obtained: (1) his 1 – 1 <b>S</b> locus <b>reversions</b> to HIS 1 that restore growth without added histidine at 30 °, (2) thr 4 reversions to THR 4 that simultaneously eliminate the requirement for threonine and restore the low-temperature effect on the his 1 - 1 S allele, and (3) mutations from sup to SUP. The SUP allele is not an ochre suppressor, {{and it is not}} linked to either HIS 1, THR 4 or a centromere. It may represent a missense suppressor. It is proposed that the effect of THR 4 is caused by aggregation of the wild-type threonine synthetase with defective his 1 – 1 S monomers, causing a favorable conformational change in the histidine protein that restores limited enzymatic activity. This can be regarded as a case of complementation between nonhomologous proteins...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters. In the first chapter, I investigate how political spending by corporations responds to regulatory concerns {{and if it is}} associated with improved firm value. Using the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster as an exogenous shock to the difficulty of obtaining offshore oil drilling permits, I show that offshore oil firms spent more money hiring lobbyists in order to influence the permitting process. In contrast, the evidence of a response through campaign contributions is weak. The lobbying spending was associated with both a higher probability of permit approval and faster time to approval. Permit approvals had a five-day cumulative abnormal return of 0. 69 % after the disaster. In particular, offshore firms hired more lobbyists with prior-employment connections to Congressmen or Federal agencies with oil industry oversight. My results show that corporate governance issues may be second-order in this setting and that lobbying may have a real impact on regulator decisions and a positive effect on firm value. In the second chapter, I establish a previously unknown fact about the value of firms engaging in lobbying. Despite evidence that firms respond to specific opportunities or concerns through lobbying spending, most corporations lobby persistently. I show that firms engaging in lobbying spending earn higher returns relative to non-lobbying firms in response to elections that result in a unified government (White House and Congress controlled by the same political party). In contrast, lobbying firms earn lower returns relative to non-lobbying firms in response to elections that result in a divided government (White House and Congress controlled by different political parties, or Congressional division). The results show that the balance of power within the government has an effect on the cross-section of stock returns. Disentangling expected return and abnormal return explanations for these results is an interesting area for future research. In the third chapter (with Ivo Welch), we investigate extended abnormal rates of return for S&P 500 index changes in a comprehensive 1979 - 2013 sample. The evidence suggests that the short-window portfolio announcement returns that did not revert in the 1980 s have fully reverted in the 2000 <b>s.</b> The <b>reversion</b> was a portfolio effect, not an individual stock effect...|$|R
40|$|Muddy floods due to runoff are a {{widespread}} {{problem on the}} South Downs of southern England and are associated with increased growing of autumn-sown cereals {{over the last two}} decades. The 10. 6 km 2 Sompting catchment has been monitored over the 12 -year period 1990 / 91 – 2001 / 02. A housing estate {{at the lower end of}} the catchment that was frequently inundated by muddy floods in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s has not been flooded since the winter of 1993 / 94, even during the heavy rainfall events of October and November 2000. This is a result of the ameliorative measures put in place in the early 1990 <b>s,</b> primarily the <b>reversion</b> of some winter cereal fields to permanent grassland (set-aside). Other land management changes helped, for example, some parts of the catchment were put down to short-term grass leys and small dams were constructed to impound runoff. Flooding of the housing estate occurred when more than 30 % of the catchment was covered by eroded fields, which contributed runoff to the valley floors leading down to the housing estate. The length of continuous down-valley flow was greater in the early 1990 s compared with later years. The introduction of grassland reduced the risk of flooding not only by reducing the area contributing to runoff, but also by stopping valley floor flows linking up. Such measures to alleviate runoff, erosion and flooding fit well with policies proposed in the recent report by the UK Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food...|$|R
40|$|The End of Decline {{provides}} a new critical framework for Anglo-Irish literary {{representations of the}} big house [...] -the familial residence and political symbol of Ireland 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>landlord</b> class. Whereas existing criticism reads late nineteenth- and twentieth-century big house literature as the continuation of a novelistic tradition, I argue that works by Elizabeth Bowen, Molly Keane, Edith Somerville and Martin Ross, and W. B. Yeats are most productively viewed as participating in a literary movement that comprises a range of genres. This big house literary movement is not coeval with the Act of Union between Britain and Ireland in 1800, but rather emerges in response to late nineteenth-century manifestations of dis-union within Ireland and Anglo-Ireland. My approach challenges a prevailing critical assumption that big house literature reflects, in form and content, the historical decline of the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy. Instead, this study shows that big house literature {{is engaged in a}} search for forms [...] -literary, generic, narrative [...] -through which to address the big house in its relation to the contemporary cultural and political moment. In {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, big house literary texts criticize the application of marital tropes to Irish political relations, and employ a gothic-realist mode to suggest the need for new cultural and literary forms that can address conflicts within Ireland. After the formation of an independent Irish state, big house literature engages critically with models of history and temporality; these works take the big house of the 1920 s and 1930 s as a prompt to challenge the deployment of cultural narratives, like that of decline, which foreclose or delimit the future. Literary representations of the big house during World War II [...] -in which Ireland remained neutral [...] -suggest alternatives to individual and cultural fantasies of a coherent identity that is rooted in, and guaranteed by, an ancestral home. Finally, I demonstrate the way that this framework can change the shape of big house literary studies by making visible literary interrelationships, as yet unexplored, which cross the boundaries of sectarian difference. ...|$|R
