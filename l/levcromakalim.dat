50|$|Cromakalim (INN) is a {{potassium}} channel-opening vasodilator. The active isomer is <b>levcromakalim.</b> It acts on ATP-sensitive potassium {{channels and}} so causes membrane hyperpolarization. It {{can be used}} to treat hypertension as it will relax vascular smooth muscle to lower blood pressure. Hyperpolarisation of smooth muscle cell membranes pulls their membrane potential away from the threshold, so making it more difficult to excite them and thereby cause contraction.|$|E
50|$|Reaction of 4-cyanophenol (4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) with 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-butyne under PTC {{probably}} {{proceeds to}} initial {{formation of a}} propargyl carbocation. The course of the reaction can be envisaged by assuming that this then attacks the aromatic ring; the resulting allylic cation can then capture the adjacent phenol oxygen and thus form the observed product (3). Treatment of that product with aqueous NBS leads to {{the addition of the}} elements of hypobromous acid and formation of the bromohydrin (4) as a mixture of the trans enantiomers. This cyclizes to the epoxide 5 in the presence of sodium hydroxide (5). Ring opening of the oxirane with ammonia gives a mixture of the trans amino alcohols (6). These are probably resolved at this stage and the 3S,4R-enantiomer used in the next stage. That isomer is next acylated with 4-Chlorobutyryl chloride to give the chloroamide (7). The anion from reaction of the amide with sodium hydride then displaces the chlorine {{on the end of the}} chain to form the pyrrolidine ring. There is thus obtained <b>levcromakalim</b> (8).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>levcromakalim</b> on {{vascular}} reactivity was exam-med in rat isolated pulmonary arterial (PA) rings. Vasoconstnc-tion {{in response to}} KCI, prostaglandin F 2 (PGF 2,) and hypoxia and vasodilatation in response to <b>levcromakalim</b> were studied isometrically in a small-vessel myograph. <b>Levcromakalim</b> caused a dose-dependent inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary Va-soconstriction (HPV) in pulmonary resistance vessels (PRV). At 10 M, <b>levcromakalim</b> caused 58 % inhibition in PRV compared with control. In contrast, HPV in large PM was not significantly inhibited by <b>levcromakalim.</b> At a higher concentration, levcro-makalim (1 00 pM) caused 88 % inhibition in PRV and 80 % inhibition in PA.

40|$|Effects of K+ channel opener, <b>levcromakalim,</b> on {{vascular}} endothelial {{cells were}} examined. Under voltage- and current-clamp conditions, application of acetylcholine to dispersed endothelial cells isolated from rabbit superior mesenteric artery (dispersed RMAECs) produced hyperpolarization and outward currents. On the other hand, dispersed RMAECs {{did not respond}} to <b>levcromakalim.</b> When membrane potential was recorded from endothelium in a mesenteric arterial segment, exposure to <b>levcromakalim</b> in a concentration range of 0. 1 to 3 [*]μM caused concentration-dependent hyperpolarization. The hyperpolarization was observed in the absence of external Ca 2 + and was inhibited by 10 [*]μM glibenclamide. The presence of 1 [*]mM heptanol did not affect the levcromakalin-induced hyperpolarization, whereas treatment of the mesenteric arterial segment with 20 [*]μM 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid significantly reduced the hyperpolarization. The response to acetylcholine of RMAECs in an arterial segment with 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid was, however, similar to that without 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid. These suggest that although RMAECs themselves are functionally insensitive to <b>levcromakalim,</b> those in an arterial segment are hyperpolarized by <b>levcromakalim</b> via myo-endothelial electrical communication...|$|E
40|$|<b>Levcromakalim</b> caused concentration-dependent {{relaxation}}s of methoxamine-induced tone in both endothelium-denuded and intact vessels. Its potency {{was reduced}} by the nitric oxide donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 0. 1 [*]μM or 1 [*]μM) in both denuded and intact vessels. The maximal relaxation (Rmax) was reduced only in denuded vessels. SNAP was more potent in endothelium-denuded than intact vessels {{but there were no}} differences in Rmax. Glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) did not affect relaxation to SNAP in endothelium-denuded or intact vessels. The soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ, 10 [*]μM) increased the potency and Rmax of <b>levcromakalim</b> in endothelium-intact vessels. ODQ had no effect in denuded vessels. ODQ (10 [*]μM) reduced the vasorelaxant potency of SNAP in both intact and endothelium-denuded vessels by 190 -fold and 620 -fold, respectively. 8 -bromo cyclic GMP (10 or 30 [*]μM) reduced both the potency and Rmax of <b>levcromakalim</b> in de-endothelialized vessels, but had no effect in intact vessels although it reduced both the potency and Rmax of <b>levcromakalim</b> in intact vessels incubated with ODQ (10 [*]μM). In the presence of ODQ (10 [*]μM), SNAP (0. 1 [*]μM or 1 [*]μM) reduced the potency of <b>levcromakalim</b> in intact vessels, without altering Rmax, but had no effect in denuded vessels. SNAP (50 [*]μM) reduced both the potency and Rmax of <b>levcromakalim</b> in intact and endothelium-denuded vessels. Therefore, although SNAP causes relaxation principally through generation of cyclic GMP, it can modulate the actions of <b>levcromakalim</b> through mechanisms both dependent on, and independent of, cyclic GMP; the former predominate in endothelium-denuded vessels and the latter in intact vessels...|$|E
40|$|Effects of <b>levcromakalim</b> and {{nucleoside}} diphosphates (NDPs) on both membrane {{currents and}} unitary currents in pig proximal urethra were investigated {{by use of}} patch clamp techniques (conventional whole-cell configuration, nystatin perforated patch, cell-attached configuration and inside-out patches). <b>Levcromakalim</b> produced a concentration-dependent outward current at a holding potential of − 50 [*]mV. The peak current amplitude showed little variation when measured by either conventional whole-cell or nystatin perforated patch configurations. In conventional whole-cell configuration, the <b>levcromakalim</b> (100 [*]μM) -induced outward current decayed by about 90 % in 18 [*]min. In contrast, with the nystatin perforated patch, approximately 86 % of the levcromakalim-induced outward current still remained after 18 [*]min. The peak amplitude of the <b>levcromakalim</b> (100 [*]μM) -induced outward membrane current recorded by the conventional whole-cell configuration was greatly reduced by inclusion of 5 [*]mM EDTA in the pipette. The much smaller but significant outward membrane current remaining was abolished by glibenclamide. In conventional whole-cell recordings, inclusion of an NDP in the pipette solution induced a small outward current which slowly reached a maximal amplitude (in 2 to 10 [*]min) and was suppressed by glibenclamide. Addition of 100 [*]μM <b>levcromakalim</b> after the NDP-induced current had peaked activated a further outward current which was larger than that recorded {{in the absence of}} NDPs. Approximately 50 % of this current still remained at 18 [*]min, even when conventional whole-cell configuration was used. In the cell-attached mode in symmetrical 140 [*]mM K+ conditions, glibenclamide inhibited the 100 [*]μM levcromakalim-activated 43 [*]pS K+ channel in a concentration-dependent manner, showing an inhibitory dissociation constant (Ki) of approximately 520 [*]nM. In inside-out patches in which the glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel had run down after exposure to <b>levcromakalim,</b> both uridine 5 ′-diphosphate (UDP) and MgATP were capable of reactivating the channel. Further application of Mg 2 + to the UDP-reactivated K+ channels enhanced the channel activity reversibly. In inside-out patches UDP was capable of activating the glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel without <b>levcromakalim,</b> providing that there was free Mg 2 + present (either UDP in 5 [*]mM EGTA or UDP in 5 [*]mM EDTA with Mg 2 +). Additional application of <b>levcromakalim</b> caused a further reversible activation of channel opening. In the presence of <b>levcromakalim,</b> application of adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) to the inner surface of the membrane patch inhibited UDP-reactivated channel opening in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of an untreated cytosolic extract of pig proximal urethra reactivated the glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel in the presence of 100 [*]μM <b>levcromakalim</b> in inside-out patches. These results demonstrate the presence in the pig proximal urethra of a glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel that is blocked by intracellular ATP and can be activated by <b>levcromakalim.</b> Intracellular UDP can reactivate the channel after rundown. Additionally, intracellular Mg 2 + may {{play an important role in}} regulating the channel activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the K+ channel opener <b>levcromakalim,</b> the {{guanylate}} cyclase stimulant nitroprusside and the dual drug nicorandil (K+ channel opener and guanylate cyclase stimulant) were analysed in piglet isolated endothelium-denuded pulmonary (PA) and mesenteric (MA) arteries stimulated by noradrenaline (NA) or by the thromboxane A 2 mimetic U 46619. Nicorandil, <b>levcromakalim</b> and verapamil were less potent in PA than in MA, the efficacy of <b>levcromakalim</b> was also reduced in PA. The effects of nicorandil and <b>levcromakalim</b> were similar in arteries pre-contracted by NA and U 46619, whereas verapamil was more potent in arteries pre-contracted by NA. Nitroprusside was equipotent in MA pre-contracted by either NA or U 46619 and in PA pre-contracted by NA whereas in PA pre-contracted by U 46619, nitroprusside showed lower potency and efficacy. The relaxant effects of <b>levcromakalim</b> and nitroprusside were inhibited by 10 − 5 [*]M glibenclamide and 10 − 6 [*]M ODQ, respectively. Nicorandil-induced relaxation was inhibited by ODQ in all experimental conditions, whereas glibenclamide had inhibitory effects in PA and MA pre-contracted by U 46619, had no effect in PA pre-contracted by NA and in MA pre-contracted by NA it was only inhibitory {{in the presence of}} ODQ. No apparent interactions were found between nitroprusside and <b>levcromakalim</b> as indicated by the lack of effects of pretreatment with one of them (producing 20 – 35 % relaxation) on the potency of the relaxant response to the other. However, in PA pre-contracted by U 46619, where nitroprusside or <b>levcromakalim</b> induced only partial relaxation, the combination of both mechanisms (either by combining nitroprusside plus <b>levcromakalim</b> or by nicorandil) was able to induce full vasodilatation. In conclusion, K+ channel opening and guanylate cyclase stimulation are independent pathways that induce additive vasorelaxation in piglet PA and MA. The mechanism of action of nicorandil is dependent on the artery and {{on the nature of the}} agonist employed to precontract the artery. The relative efficacy of K+ channel opening vs guanylate cyclase stimulation may partially explain the preferential contribution of each mechanism to the relaxant effects of nicorandil...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>levcromakalim,</b> an ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener, on {{isolated}} subcutaneous arteries from mammary tissues obtained from female patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery was investigated.

The contractile responses to K+ and 9, 11 -dideoxy- 11 a, 9 a-epoxy-methano-prostaglandin F 2 alpha (U 46619) and the relexant responses to <b>levcromakalim</b> and to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, methacholine, in these arteries remained fully intact after preservation in UW solution for at least 5 days.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>levcromakalim</b> and {{nucleoside}} diphosphates (NDPs) on both membrane currents and unitary currents in cat trachea myocytes were investigated {{by use of}} patch-clamp techniques. In conventional whole-cell configuration, <b>levcromakalim</b> produced a concentration-dependent K+ current which was suppressed by additional application of 5 [*]μM glibenclamide at − 70 [*]mV. When 3 [*]mM ATP was added in the pipette solution, the peak amplitude of the levcromakalim-induced current was much smaller than that {{in the absence of}} ATP. When 3 [*]mM uridine 5 ′-diphosphate (UDP) was included in the pipette solution, much higher concentrations of glibenclamide (⩾ 50 [*]μM) were required to suppress the 100 [*]μM levcromakalim-induced membrane current in comparison with those in the absence of UDP. In the cell-attached patches, <b>levcromakalim</b> activated a 40 [*]pS K+ channel which was inhibited by additional application of glibenclamide in symmetrical 140 [*]mM K+ conditions. UDP (⩾ 0. 1 [*]mM) was capable of reactivating the channel in inside-out patches in which the glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel had run down, in the presence of <b>levcromakalim.</b> The K+ channel reactivated by UDP was suppressed by additional application of either intracellular 3 [*]mM ATP or 100 [*]μM glibenclamide. These results demonstrate that smooth muscle cells in the cat trachea possess ATP-sensitive 40 [*]pS K+ channels which are blocked by glibenclamide (i. e.

40|$|The ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP channel) in A 10 cells, a {{cell line}} derived from rat {{thoracic}} aorta, {{was characterized by}} binding studies with the tritiated KATP channel opener, [3 H]-P 1075, and by electrophysiological techniques. Saturation binding experiments gave a KD value of 9. 2 ± 5. 2 [*]nM and a binding capacity (BMax) of 140 ± 40 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein for [3 H]-P 1075 binding to A 10 cells; from the BMax value a density of binding sites of 5 – 10 per μm 2 plasmalemma was estimated. KATP channel modulators such as the openers P 1075, pinacidil, <b>levcromakalim</b> and minoxidil sulphate and the blocker glibenclamide inhibited [3 H]-P 1075 binding. The extent of inhibition at saturation depended on the compound, <b>levcromakalim</b> inhibiting specific [3 H]-P 1075 binding by 85 %, minoxidil sulphate and glibenclamide by 70 %. The inhibition constants {{were similar to those}} determined in strips of rat aorta. Resting membrane potential, recorded with microelectrodes, was − 51 ± 1 [*]mV. P 1075 and <b>levcromakalim</b> produced a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization by up to − 25 [*]mV with EC 50 values of 170 ± 40 [*]nM and 870 ± 190 [*]nM, respectively. The hyperpolarization induced by <b>levcromakalim</b> (3 [*]μM) was completely reversed by glibenclamide with an IC 50 value of 86 ± 17 [*]nM. Voltage clamp experiments were performed in the whole cell configuration under a physiological K+ gradient. <b>Levcromakalim</b> (10 [*]μM) induced a current which reversed around − 80 [*]mV; the current-voltage relationship showed considerable outward rectification.

40|$|In {{arterial}} smooth muscle, {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP) -sensitive potassium channels are {{the targets of}} a variety of synthetic and endogenous vasodilators. In this study, we evaluated the influence of glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K(+) -channel blocker, on various vasodilator responses, including those by <b>levcromakalim</b> under hypoxic and low-glucose conditions in isolated rat aortic rings. The concentration-response curves induced by methacholine and sodium nitroprusside (after precontraction with 1 microM phenylephrine) were not affected by glibenclamide. Glibenclamide influenced neither the adenosine- nor the iloprost- (a stable prostacyclin) induced vasodilator effects. Glibenclamide caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentration-response curves of <b>levcromakalim.</b> The vascular tone induced by phenylephrine was not affected under low-glucose conditions, whereas hypoxia caused a decrease in the phenylephrine-induced contraction when compared with that under normal circumstances. Under all conditions, glibenclamide did not influence the phenylephrine-induced increase in vascular tone. Under low-glucose and hypoxic conditions, the concentration-response curves for <b>levcromakalim</b> showed a significantly less steep slope than under normal conditions, and higher concentrations of glibenclamide were necessary to inhibit the vasodilator response induced by <b>levcromakalim</b> under these experimental conditions adopted to mimic pathologic conditions. In conclusion, methacholine, sodium nitroprusside, adenosine, and iloprost appear not to induce vasodilation in the rat aorta by glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels, whereas hypoxia and low-glucose levels cause an impaired function of the glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel...|$|E

In pig coronary artery, IMID- 4 F inhibited the vasorelaxation {{response to the}} KATP channel opener <b>levcromakalim</b> with a pKB value of approximately 7. 1. IMID- 4 F (30 [*]μM) {{did not affect the}} vasorelaxation response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP). In rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells IMID- 4 F (1 – 10 [*]μM) caused a concentration-dependent depolarization of membrane potential. IMID- 4 F (10 [*]μM) abolished the hyperpolarizing effects of <b>levcromakalim</b> (10 [*]μM). In patch clamp experiments using rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells, KATP channel currents induced by <b>levcromakalim</b> (10 [*]μM) were inhibited by IMID- 4 F (0. 3 – 3 [*]μM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The calculated IC 50 for IMID- 4 F inhibiting KATP channel current was approximately 0. 8 [*]μM. Radioligand binding studies using bovine aortic smooth muscle cell membranes showed that IMID- 4 F (30 [*]μM) did not displace binding to the KATP channel opener [3 H]-P 1075. However, both <b>levcromakalim</b> (10 [*]μM) and glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) caused significant displacement of [3 H]-P 1075. These studies show that the imidazoline compound IMID- 4 F {{is one of the most}} potent antagonists of arterial KATP channels identified. Vasorelaxation, hyperpolarization and K+ currents through KATP channels were all inhibited by IMID- 4 F at micromolar concentrations. Radioligand binding studies indicate that IMID- 4 F does not bind to the same site as <b>levcromakalim</b> or as glibenclamide.

Each of these relaxants was antagonised by a K +-rich (80 mM) medium. Except {{in the case}} of <b>levcromakalim,</b> nifedipine (1 μM) offset this antagonism. Charybdotoxin (100 nM) antagonised isoprenaline in a nifedipine-sensitive manner but did not antagonise SCA 40 or benzafentrine. Iberiotoxin (100 nM) did not antagonise SCA 40. Acting on tissue precontracted with carbachol, SCA 40 potentiated isoprenaline but did not potentiate sodium nitroprusside. While <b>levcromakalim</b> (1 and 10 μM) induced hyperpolarisation, SCA 40 (1 and 10 μM) induced little change in the membrane potential of bovine trachealis. In trachealis preloaded with 86 Rb +, <b>levcromakalim</b> (1 and 10 μM) promoted efflux of the radiotracer while SCA 40 (1 and 10 μM) had no effect. Tested as an inhibitor of isoenzymes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, SCA 40 was most potent against the type III, less potent against the type IV and least potent against the type I isoenzyme. It is concluded that neither inhibition of phosphodiesterase type V nor the promotion of BK(Ca) channel opening explains the tracheal smooth muscle relaxant activity of SCA 40.

The local dilatation to ACh {{was associated with a}} rise in endothelial cell [Ca(2 +) ](i) (F/F(t = 0) = 1. 22 +/- 0. 33, n= 14) which did not spread beyond 0. 5 mm (F/F(t = 0) = 1. 01 +/- 0. 01, n= 14), while the local dilatation to <b>levcromakalim</b> was not associated with any change in endothelial cell [Ca(2 +) ](i). In contrast, ACh and <b>levcromakalim</b> both stimulated local (12. 7 +/- 1. 2 mV, n= 10 and 13. 5 +/- 4. 7 mV, n= 10) and spreading (at 2 mm: 3. 0 +/- 1. 1 mV, n= 5 and 4. 1 +/- 0. 7 mV, n= 5) smooth muscle hyperpolarization. The spread of hyperpolarization could be prevented by cutting the artery, so was not due to a diffusible agent. Both the spreading dilatation and hyperpolarization were endothelium dependent. The injection of propidium iodide into either endothelial or smooth muscle cells revealed extensive dye coupling between the endothelial cells, but limited coupling between the smooth muscle cells. Some evidence for heterocellular spread of dye was also evident. Together, these data show that vasodilatation can spread over significant distances in mesenteric resistance arteries, and suggest this reflects an effective coupling between the endothelial cells to facilitate [Ca(2 +) ](i) -independent spread of hyperpolarization...|$|E

In rat hepatic and mesenteric arteries with endothelium, carbenoxolone (100 or 500 [*]μM) depolarized the smooth muscle but did not modify hyperpolarizations induced by KCl or <b>levcromakalim.</b> In the mesenteric (but not the hepatic) artery, the acetylcholine-induced hyperpolarization was inhibited by carbenoxolone.

In the presence of phenylephrine, acetylcholine-induced hyperpolarization of both hepatic and mesenteric artery myocytes was partially inhibited by each of the gap junction inhibitors. Collectively, the data suggest that gap junctions play some role in the EDHF (endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor) response in rat hepatic and mesenteric arteries. However, in the guinea-pig internal carotid artery, electrotonic propagation of endothelial cell hyperpolarizations via gap junctions may be the sole mechanism underlying the response previously attributed to EDHF...|$|E

In current-clamp mode, subsequent application of higher concentrations of nifedipine (⩾ 30 [*]μM) caused a significant depolarization even after the membrane potential had been hyperpolarized to approximately − 82 [*]mV by application of 100 [*]μM <b>levcromakalim.</b> The 100 [*]μM levcromakalim-induced inward current (symmetrical 140 [*]mM K+ conditions, − 50 [*]mV) was inhibited by additional application of three different types of Ca antagonists (nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem, all at 100 [*]μM).

Under current clamp conditions in physiological solutions, <b>levcromakalim</b> (10 μm) evoked a hyperpolarization, which was inhibited by the sulphonylurea drugs glibenclamide and tolbutamide. Under voltage clamp conditions in symmetrical (140 mm) K+ solutions, bath application of <b>levcromakalim</b> evoked an inward current with a density of ∼ 8 pA pF− 1 at – 50 mV and a slope conductance of ∼ 9 nS, which reversed close to the potassium equilibrium potential (EK). Cell dialysis with an ATP-free intracellular solution also evoked an inward current, which was inhibited by tolbutamide. Bath application of either glibenclamide (10 μm) or tolbutamide (100 μm) depolarized adult intracardiac neurones by 3 – 5 mV, suggesting that a KATP conductance is activated under resting conditions and contributes to the resting membrane potential. Activation of a membrane current by <b>levcromakalim</b> was concentration dependent with an EC 50 of 1. 6 μm.

Metabolic inhibition with 2, 4 -dinitrophenol and iodoacetic acid or superfusion with hypoxic solution (PO 2 ∼ 16 mmHg) also activated a membrane current.

40|$|ATP-sensitive {{potassium}} (KATP) channels {{represent a}} class of K+ channel regulated by intracellular ATP and serve to transduce changes in cell metabolism into changes in membrane potential. The presence of an KATP conductance has recently been demonstrated in freshly dissociated endothelial cells from rabbit arteries.

Unitary currents were evoked in response to lowering intracellular ATP concentration or application of the K(+) -channel activator <b>levcromakalim</b> and were inhibited by the sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide. Exposure of the cytoplasmic face of an inside-out membrane patch to a solution containing 0. 1 mM ATP produced single-channel events with unitary conductances of approximately 150 and approximately 25 pS that were inhibited by either 6 mM ATP or 10 microM glibenclamide. A small conductance channel was also activated in cell-attached patches by bath-applied <b>levcromakalim</b> (25 microM).

Rings of human umbilical arteries from full-term caesarian deliveries were suspended in tissue baths containing warm Krebs–Henseleit buffer under normal and reduced oxygen conditions. These rings were contracted with cumulative additions of potassium chloride, serotonin, bradykinin, endothelin- 1, histamine and a thromboxane A 2 mimetic, U 46619. Among these vasoconstrictors, only serotonin and U 46619 elicited strong and sustained contractions at physiological concentrations in both oxygen conditions. Therefore, potassium chloride (50 mM), serotonin (10 µM) or U 46619 (1 µM) were used to contract human umbilical arterial rings, which were then relaxed with the nitrovasodilator sodium nitroprusside, the potassium channel opener <b>levcromakalim</b> or the calcium antagonist amlodipine. Our data suggest that {{the responses of}} the human umbilical arteries to constricting agents, but not relaxing agents, were greater in the condition with a reduced oxygen supply. The nature of the constricting agents used did not affect the potency or efficacy of sodium nitroprusside, <b>levcromakalim</b> or amlodipine to relax human umbilical artery. While all three relaxing agents had similar potencies in this tissue preparation, sodium nitroprusside induced significantly smaller relaxation compared to <b>levcromakalim</b> and amlodi pine. These data suggest that serotonin and thromboxane A 2 effectively constrict human umbilical artery at physiological concentrations. Moreover, the smooth muscle of the human umbilical artery is less responsive to vasodilators that act via the nitric oxide pathway. As such, nitric oxide donors may not be effective therapeutic agents to reduce the elevated umbilical contractile tone in pathological conditions. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Aim: We compared the vascular reactivity in aorta from streptozotocin-induced and Goto-Kakizaki (GK) diabetic rats to potassium channel openers. Methodology: Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at 65 mg/kg body weight. After four weeks of DM, vascular reactivity of the aortic rings from STZ-induced Sprague Dawley and age-matched GK and control rats to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, <b>levcromakalim</b> and naringenin was studied using standard organ bath procedure. Results: The phenylephrine-induced contraction was significantly (P< 0. 05) increased in STZ-diabetic aortic rings [2. 03 ± 0. 07 g] when compared with GK rats [1. 47 ± 0. 14 g] and STZ-control [1. 42 ± 0. 21 g]. Maximal relaxation and potency to acetylcholine, <b>levcromakalim</b> and (+/-) -naringenin were significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased in STZdiabetic aorta when compared with GK-diabetic and control groups. Conclusion: The phenylephrine-induced contraction, endothelium-dependent relaxation, KATP - and (+/-) -naringenin-induced vasorelaxation are not altered {{in the early stages}} of Type 2 diabetes whereas there is exaggerated contractile response and a relaxant dysfunction involving the endothelium, KATP in Type 1 diabetes mellitus...|$|E

Changes in the hyperpolarization-activated and ATP-sensitive K conductances during postnatal development {{and their role}} in neuronal excitability were examined. The hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation current, I, was observed in all neurons studied and displayed slow time-dependent rectification. An inwardly rectifying K current, I, was present in a population of neurons from adult but not neonatal rats and was sensitive to block by extracellular Ba. Using the perforated-patch recording configuration, an ATP-sensitive K (K) conductance was identified in ≥ 50 % of intracardiac neurons from adult rats. <b>Levcromakalim</b> evoked membrane hyperpolarization, which was inhibited by the sulphonylurea drugs, glibenclamide and tolbutamide.

We studied the effect on neurogenic secretion in ferret trachea in vitro of the OP 1 receptor (formerly known as δ opioid receptor) agonist [D-Pen 2, 5]enkephalin (DPDPE), the OP 2 receptor (formely κ) agonist U- 50, 488 H, the OP 3 receptor (formerly μ) agonist [D-Ala 2, N-Me-Phe, Gly-ol 5]enkephalin (DAMGO), the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel inhibitor glibenclamide, the large conductance calcium activated K+ (BKCa) channel blocker iberiotoxin, the small conductance KCa (SKCa) channel blocker apamin, the KATP channel opener <b>levcromakalim,</b> a putative KATP channel opener RS 91309, and the BKCa channel opener NS 1619. Secretion was quantified by use of 35 SO 4 as a mucus marker. Electrical stimulation increased tracheal secretion by up to 40 fold above sham-stimulated levels. DAMGO or DPDPE (10 [*]μM each) significantly inhibited neurogenic secretion by 85 % and 77 %, respectively, effects which were reversed by naloxone. U- 50, 488 H had no significant inhibitory effect on neurogenic secretion, {{and none of the}} opioids had any effect on ACh-induced or [Sar 9]substance P-induced secretion. Inhibition of neurogenic secretion by DAMGO or DPDPE was reversed by iberiotoxin (3 [*]μM) but not by either glibenclamide or apamin (0. 1 [*]μM each). Iberiotoxin alone did not affect the neurogenic secretory response. <b>Levcromakalim,</b> RS 91309 or NS 1619 (3 [*]nM– 3 [*]μM) inhibited neurogenic secretion with maximal inhibitions at 3 [*]μM of 68 %, 72 % and 96 %, respectively. Neither <b>levcromakalim</b> nor RS 91309 at any concentration tested significantly inhibited acetylcholine (ACh) -induced secretion, whereas inhibition (60 %) was achieved at the highest concentration of NS 1619, a response which was blocked by iberiotoxin. Inhibition of neurogenic secretion by <b>levcromakalim</b> (3 [*]μM) or RS 91309 (30 [*]nM) was inhibited by glibenclamide but not by iberiotoxin. In contrast, inhibition by NS 1619 (30 [*]nM and 3 [*]μM) was blocked by iberiotoxin but not by glibenclamide. We conclude that, in ferret trachea in vitro, OP 1 or OP 3 opioid receptors inhibit neurogenic mucus secretion at a prejunctional site and that the {{mechanism of the}} inhibition is via opening of BKCa channels. Direct opening of BKCa channels or KATP channels also inhibits neurogenic mucus secretion. In addition, opening of BKCa channels inhibits ACh-evoked secretion of mucus.

Isometric contractions were measured in rings exposed to noradrenaline (NA), 5 -HT, KCl and CaCl 2 while relaxations were measured in the presence of acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and <b>Levcromakalim.</b> Results show significant decreases (p< 0. 05) in both pD 2 and E max values for NA and 5 -HT in rings from K-adapted rats.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the smooth muscle of the human {{umbilical}} artery to relax may vary under physiological and pathological conditions. We investigated the responsiveness of that preparation to relaxation, {{as well as the}} influence of reduced oxygen condition on these responses. Rings of human umbilical arteries from full-term Caesarian deliveries were suspended in modified Krebs-Henseleit solutions bubbled with a gas mixture of 95 % O 2 : 5 % CO 2 (normal oxygen condition) or 2. 5 % O 2 : 8 % CO 2 balanced with N 2 (reduced oxygen condition). These rings were contracted with potassium chloride, serotonin or the thromboxane A 2 mimetic U 46619, before being exposed to either the nitrovasodilator sodium nitroprusside, the potassium channel opener <b>levcromakalim</b> or the calcium channel antagonist amlodipine. While sodium nitroprusside elicited relaxation in this blood vessel, the maximal relaxation to the nitric oxide donor was significantly smaller than that induced by <b>levcromakalim</b> and amlodipine. The nature of the constrictor agent used, or changes of oxygen conditions did not significantly affect the relaxation profile of this human blood vessel. These data suggest that the smooth muscle of the human umbilical artery may be less responsive to vasodilators that act via the nitric oxide pathway.

40|$|Objectives: While {{alterations}} in cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles partly account for menopause being {{a risk factor}} for coronary heart disease, recent studies have suggested that 17 β-estradiol may have vascular effects. Our aims were to study the short-term effects of 17 β-estradiol on vascular function in isolated porcine coronary artery rings. Concomitantly, we sought to determine if physiological concentrations of 17 β-estradiol could acutely potentiate relaxation. Results: 17 α- and 17 β-estradiol at pharmacological (> 1 μM) concentrations produced relaxation in U 46619 -pre-contracted porcine coronary artery rings. Relaxation evoked by 17 β-estradiol was not reversed by the estrogen receptor antagonists tamoxifen and ICI 182780. Following 20 min exposure to a physiological concentration of 17 β-estradiol (1 nM), which on its own had no effect, relaxation elicited by cromakalim, <b>levcromakalim</b> and sodium nitroprusside, but not bradykinin or calcium ionophore A 23187, were significantly enhanced. This potentiating action was also insensitive to tamoxifen and ICI 182780. Our data provide evidence for an acute indirect relaxant action of 17 β-estradiol and suggest that it may be via a tamoxifen- and ICI 182780 -insensitive estrogen receptor. While this response was only observed at pharmacological concentrations, the potentiation of cromakalim, <b>levcromakalim</b> and sodium nitroprusside relaxation was evident {{in the presence of a}} physiological concentration (1 nM) of 17 β-estradiol. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that short-term exposure to 17 β-estradiol, at concentrations that have no effect on their own, can enhance vasorelaxation. These vascular effects may partly account for some of the acute effects of 17 β-estradiol on blood flow. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} actions of K channel openers (KCOs) on KATe channels were studied with the patch clamp technique in excised inside-out patches from frog skeletal muscle fibers. Benzopyran KCOs (<b>levcromakalim</b> and SR 47063) opened channels partially blocked by ATP, ADP, or ATP~s, with and without Mg 2 +, {{but they had no}} effects in the absence of internal nucleotides, even after channel activity had significantly declined because of rundown. The effects of KCOs could therefore be attributed solely to a competitive interaction between KCOs and nucleotides, as confirmed by observations that ATP decreased the apparent affinity for KCOs and that, conversely, KCOs decreased ATP or ADP sensitivity. Protons antagonized the action of the non-benzopyran KCOs, pinacidil and aprikalim, by enhancing their dissociation rate. This effect resembled the effect of acidification on benzopyran KCOs (Forestier, C., Y. Depresle, and M. Vivaudou. FEBS Lett. 325 : 276 - 280, 1993), suggesting that, in spite of their structural diversity, KCOs could act through the same binding sites. Detailed analysis of the inhibitory effects of protons on channel activity induced by <b>levcromakalim</b> or SR 47063 revealed that, in the presence of 100 p~M ATP, this effect developed steeply between pH 7 and 6 and was half maximal at pH 6. 6. These results are in quantitative agreement with an allosteric model of the KAxp channel possessing four protonation sites, two nucleotidic sites accessible preferentially to Mg 2 +-free nucleotides, and one benzopyran KCO site.

40|$|In rat tail artery, {{activation}} of postjunctional α 2 -adrenoceptors by noradrenaline (NA) released from sympathetic axons produces a slow depolarization (NAD) of the smooth muscle through {{a decrease in}} K+ conductance. In this study we used intracellular recording to investigate whether the K+ channel involved is the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel. Changes in membrane resistance were monitored by measuring the time constant of decay of excitatory junction potentials. The KATP channel blockers, glibenclamide (10 μm) and PNU 37883 A (5 μm), depolarized the smooth muscle and increased membrane resistance. Conversely, the KATP channel openers, pinacidil (0. 1 and 0. 5 μm) and <b>levcromakalim</b> (0. 1 μm), hyperpolarized the smooth muscle and decreased membrane resistance. Activation of KATP channels with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 10 nm) also hyperpolarized the smooth muscle and decreased membrane resistance. The NAD was abolished by both glibenclamide and PNU 37883 A but was potentiated by CGRP. However, unlike CGRP, the directly acting KATP channel openers, pinacidil and <b>levcromakalim,</b> inhibited the NAD. The effects of other K+ channel blockers were also determined. A high concentration of Ba 2 +(1 mm), which {{would be expected to}} block KATP channels, abolished the NAD, whereas teteraethylammonium (1 mm) and 4 -aminopyridine (1 mm) increased its amplitude.
