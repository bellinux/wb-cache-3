40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{frequency}} of leadership transitions and their {{significant impact on}} team and organizational performance, little research has examined why and how teams develop an identification with a new leader or their subsequent receptiveness to the new leader’s change initiatives. Drawing from the contrast and congruence effects and the theoretical perspectives of leader identification, this study empirically tests a model in which the congruence of new leaders’ and their teams’ proactive personalities foster new leader identification, {{as well as the}} team’s behavioral responses to the new <b>leader’s</b> change <b>agenda.</b> This effect is strongest when the new leader’s proactive personality is higher than that of the former leader’s proactive personality (positive contrast). Our findings of a four-wave “before-and-after” transition survey of 155 hotel employees and 51 new leaders, achieved through polynomial regression analyses, proved very insightful. Essentially, we found that the congruence between a new leader’s and his/her team’s proactive personalities and the positive contrast between a former leader’s and the new leader’s proactive personalities enhanced new leader identification and the team’s shared identification with the new <b>leader’s</b> change <b>agenda,</b> and, thereby led the team to exhibit more behavioral engagement with, and voice behavior about, the new <b>leader’s</b> change <b>agenda...</b>|$|R
40|$|The article assesses {{whether the}} {{homogeneity}} of {{preferences of the}} largest member states is required for European Union (EU) cohesiveness to materialize ahead of the Group of Twenty (G 20) meetings. In particular, it examines the economic preferences of France, Germany and the United Kingdom against {{the content of the}} EU-agreed negotiating stance in the G 20 Leaders meetings that took place from 2008 to 2012. The analysis focuses on the three main economic dossiers that have characterized the G 20 <b>Leaders</b> <b>agenda</b> since its creation, namely: financial regulation, fiscal policy co-ordination and macroeconomic imbalances. In doing so, the article argues and illustrates that preference homogeneity was not a necessary condition for EU cohesiveness but medium levels of cohesiveness materialized on issues and at times when the economic preferences of the large member states were fundamentally different, provided that the issues under negotiations were not politically salient...|$|R

The 2014 G 20 <b>agenda</b> <b>notes</b> that “in recent years international tax laws have failed to keep pace with changes in the global business environment, particularly with the rapid growth of the global economy, meaning that multinational corporations aren’t necessarily taxed the way they should be”. In the UK and elsewhere in Europe, and the USA, austerity has resulted in a heightened focus on collecting revenues from business and there is an active debate on business taxation in the media, legislatures and from NGOs and the public. The OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan seeks to address these concerns. At the same time, corporation tax rates are falling worldwide and many governments are seeking to keep their tax systems competitive. Professor Judith Freedman will give a UK and European perspective on the debate and then discuss this, together with the view from Hong Kong and China, with a panel of experts including Professor Richard Cullen, Wilson Chow and Dr Doreen Qiu...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The growing personalization of elections and the increased focus of media campaign coverage on party leaders is well-established in political science research. However, despite its importance for understanding these developments, intermedia party <b>leader</b> <b>agenda</b> setting has received little academic attention. Using extensive news media content data from the 2015 UK General Election, this paper examines the dynamics of intermedia agenda setting, assessing whether, and to what extent, the volume and tone of leaders’ media coverage flows between different platforms and outlets. Our analysis provides evidence of reciprocal influence between television, newspapers and radio. Their interactions, however, are complex and contingent on the characteristics and identity of both party leaders and media outlets. Altogether, our findings reveal no systematic convergence on the salience and tone of leaders’ news coverage, and cast doubts {{on the ability of}} the media to act as an independent force in personalizing electoral campaigns.

Vicente Palacio of Fundación Alternativas said that Podemos could have [...] "very beneficial effects in terms of regenerating the Spanish democratic system", but is in danger of going [...] "toward populism and demagogy, as has happened in the case of Beppe Grillo and his Five Star Movement in Italy". As of November 2014, the PSOE has chosen, instead, to distance itself from populism and the extreme left, trying thus to preserve the center left.|$|R

40|$|The present paper reports an {{investigation}} of the self-reported needs of South Asian women suffering distress and mental health problems which may lead to self-harm and suicide, and uses the data to define indicators of good practice for primary care. The design was a qualitative study using focus group discussion. Four focus groups of South Asian women (using existing women's groups in Manchester, UK) formed the setting for this study. Each focus group was facilitated by one of the authors, and the discussions occurred in Urdu, English and Punjabi. An interview guide was used, although the direction of the discussions followed the women's <b>agenda.</b> <b>Notes</b> were taken during the focus group discussions. Analysis of notes to define themes and emergence of framework was carried out. The data were analysed according to the principles of framework analysis. A range of systemic issues were described by respondents including: social, political and economic pressures; domestic violence; poverty; language problems; family and children's issues; and health. These experiences were reinforced by an extremely efficient community grapevine and were evident in described experiences such as: racism and stereotyping of Asian women; Asian communities and Islam; and the concept of izzat (honour) in Asian family life, which was seen as a major influence in the lives of Asian women. These experiences were thought to result in mental distress, which was described {{in a variety of ways}} by the women. The women saw self-harm as a usable coping strategy to deal with their distress. Perceived barriers to services were described by the women. Services tended to be accessed only at a point of desperation, rather than prior to crisis points. This indicated the need for services to be able to respond rapidly when Asian women did ask for help. Whilst the present paper describes a local study, thus limiting its generalisability, the use of such work in commissioning local health and social services is outlined. A number of indicators for good practice were drawn up in relation to addressing systemic issues in service provision using these findings. Such indicators will be of use by primary care trusts in developing, commissioning and monitoring services for this patient group...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study {{was to understand the}} client and occupational therapist experiences of a mental health group. A secondary aim was to explore the extent to which this group seemed to have reflected a client-centred approach. The topic emerged from personal and professional issues related to the therapist as teacher and to inconsistencies in practice with the profession's client-centred philosophy. This philosophy, the study's frame of reference, was established in terms of themes related to the client-therapist relationship and to client values. Typical practice was illustrated through an extensive literature review. Structured didacticexperiential methods aiming toward skill development were predominant. The interpretive sciences and, to a lesser extent, the critical sciences directed the methodology. An ongoing support group at a community mental health clinic was selected as the focus of the study; the occupational therapist leader and three members became the key participants. A series of conversational interviews, the. core method of data collection, was supplemented by observation, document review, further interviews, and fieldnotes. Transcriptions of conversations were returned to participants for verification and for further reflection Analysis primarily consisted of coding and organizing data according to emerging themes. The participants' experiences of group, presented as narrative stories within a group session vignette, were also returned to participants. There was a common understanding of the group's structure and the importance of having "air time" within the group; however, differences in perceptions of such things as the importance of the group in members' lives were noted. All members valued the therapeutic aspects of group, the role of group as weekly activity and, to a lesser extent, the learning that came from group. The researcher's perspective provided a critique of the group experience from a client-centred perspective. Some areas of consistency with client-centred practice were noted (e. g., therapist attitudes); however the group seemed to function far from a client-centred ideal. Members held little authority in a -relationship dominated by the <b>leaders,</b> and <b>leader</b> <b>agendas</b> rather than member values controlled the session. Possible reasons for this discrepancy ranging from past health care encounters through to co-leader discord emerged. The actual and potential significance of this study was discussed according to many areas of implications: to OT practice, especially client-centred group practice, to theory development, to further areas of research and methodology considerations, to people involved in the group and to my personal growth and development...|$|R
