25|$|During WWII, on {{the order}} of Colonel I. Murgescu, commandant of the Vapniarka {{concentration}} camp in Transnistria, the detainees - most of them Jews - were fed nearly exclusively with fodder pea. Consequently, they became ill from <b>lathyrism.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Lathyrism</b> or neurolathyrism is a {{neurological}} disease {{of humans and}} domestic animals, caused by eating certain legumes of the genus Lathyrus.

2500|$|<b>Lathyrism</b> {{is mainly}} due to {{consumption}} of Lathyrus sativus ( [...] common name : Khesari [...] ) containing Cyanoalanine(neurotoxin) and mainly causes muscle cramps and excessive consumption may even lead to paralysis ...|$|E
2500|$|Murgescu's father, Ion, had [...] "strong pro-Nazi sympathies" [...] and was {{a willing}} {{participant}} in Antonescu's war crimes. By September 1942, he was the commandant of Vapniarka, a concentration camp for Jewish deportees, ordering them to be fed on grass pea, which caused an outbreak of <b>lathyrism</b> and resulted in several deaths and many more crippling infirmities.|$|E
2500|$|In Spain, a {{seed mixture}} known as comuña {{consisting}} of Lathyrus sativus, L. cicera, Vicia sativa and V. ervilia provides a potent mixture of toxic amino acids to poison monogastric (single stomached) animals. Particularly the toxin beta-cyanoalanine from seeds of V. sativa enhances the toxicity {{of such a}} mixture through its inhibition of sulfur amino acid metabolism [...] and hence depletion of protective reduced thiols. Its use for sheep does not pose any <b>lathyrism</b> problems if doses do not exceed 50 percent of the ration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consumption}} of {{large quantities of}} Lathyrus grain containing high concentrations of the glutamate analogue neurotoxin β-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP, also known as β-N-oxalyl-amino-L-alanine, or BOAA) causes paralysis, characterized by lack of strength in or inability to move the lower limbs, and may involve pyramidal tracts producing signs of upper motor neuron damage. The toxin may also cause aortic aneurysm. A unique symptom of <b>lathyrism</b> is the atrophy of gluteal muscles (buttocks). ODAP is a poison of mitochondria, leading to excess cell death, especially in motor neurons. [...] Children can additionally develop bone deformity and reduced brain development.|$|E

50|$|The pods can {{be eaten}} {{but like many}} members of the genus Lathyrus they contain β-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid, which can cause {{paralysis}} called <b>lathyrism.</b> The leaves of the plant are used in Chinese traditional medicine.|$|E

50|$|The {{seeds of}} the species {{are not to be}} {{confused}} with edible 'black peas', which are a form of Pisum sativum. Seeds of Lathyrus species are toxic, containing an enzyme that interferes with collagen synthesis to cause the disease <b>Lathyrism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In September 2013, Krakauer {{published}} an article in The New Yorker following up the claims of Ronald Hamilton. A sample of Hedysarum alpinum's fresh seeds were sent to a laboratory for HPLC analysis. Results suggest that the seeds contained 0.394% beta-ODAP by weight, a concentration well within the levels known to cause <b>lathyrism</b> in humans, although {{the interpretation of the}} results was disputed by other chemists. The article notes that while occasional ingestion of foodstuffs containing ODAP is not hazardous for healthy individuals eating a balanced diet, [...] "individuals suffering from malnutrition, stress, and acute hunger are especially sensitive to ODAP, and are thus highly susceptible to the incapacitating effects of <b>lathyrism</b> after ingesting the neurotoxin".|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms are}} strikingly {{similar to those}} of <b>lathyrism</b> and also similar to tropical spastic paraparesis and hereditary spastic paraparesis, only that the latter two disorders have a slow onset. Konzo is distinct from polio which is a flaccid paralysis and most often affects a person asymmetrically.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the edible pea, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that seeds of members of the genus Lathyrus are toxic if ingested in quantity. A related species, Lathyrus sativus, is grown for human consumption but when it forms {{a major part of the}} diet it causes symptoms of toxicity called <b>lathyrism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Krakauer {{was later}} validated, {{to a certain}} extent. Krakauer {{explains}} that he came across the research of Ronald Hamilton, who had concluded that the neurotoxin oxalyldiaminopropionic acid (ODAP) in the wild potato seed was responsible for a degenerative disease known as <b>lathyrism.</b> In August 2013, Krakauer sent a modest sample of the seeds for testing, discovering that they contained [...] ".394 per cent beta-ODAP by weight, a concentration well within the levels known to cause <b>lathyrism</b> in humans." [...] Krakauer concludes that [...] "Had McCandless's guidebook to edible plants warned that Hedysarum alpinum seeds contain a neurotoxin that can cause paralysis, {{he probably would have}} walked out of the wild in late August with no more difficulty than when he walked into the wild in April, and would still be alive today." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Lathyrism</b> or neurolathyrism is a {{neurological}} disease {{of humans and}} domestic animals, caused by eating certain legumes of the genus Lathyrus.

5000|$|Excitotoxicity due to {{excessive}} glutamate release and impaired uptake occurs {{as part of}} the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke, autism, some forms of intellectual disability, and diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <b>lathyrism,</b> and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, decreased glutamate release is observed under conditions of classical phenylketonuria [...] leading to developmental disruption of glutamate receptor expression.|$|E

5000|$|BAPN is {{the toxic}} {{constituent}} of peas from Lathyrus plants, e.g., lathyrus odoratus. <b>Lathyrism,</b> a disease known for centuries, encompasses 2 distinct entities: a disorder {{of the nervous}} system (neurolathyrism) leading to limb paralysis, and a disorder of connective tissue, causing either bone deformity (osteolathyrism) or aortic aneurisms (angiolathyrim). BAPN causes osteolathyrism and angiolathyrism when ingested in large quantities." [...] It can cause osteolathyrism, neurolathyrism, and/or angiolathyrism.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of lysyl oxidase-derived cross-linking was established from animal {{studies in which}} lysyl oxidase was inhibited either by nutritional copper-deficiency or by supplementation of diets with β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase. This resulted in <b>lathyrism,</b> characterized by poor bone formation and strength, hyperextensible skin, weak ligaments, and increased occurrence of aortic aneurysms. These abnormalities correlated well with decreased cross-linking of collagen and elastin.|$|E
50|$|Other {{species are}} grown for food, {{including}} the Indian pea (L. sativus) {{and the red}} pea (L. cicera), and less commonly Cyprus-vetch (L. ochrus) and Spanish vetchling (L. clymenum). The tuberous pea (L. tuberosus) is grown as a root vegetable for its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some Lathyrus species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause <b>lathyrism,</b> a serious disease.|$|E
50|$|Angio = Blood vessel, <b>Lathyrism</b> = disease due to Lathyrus Sativus. It is {{commonly}} associated with osteolathyrism and neurolathyrism and is caused by over consumption of Lathyrus sativus, also known as grasspea. The main chemical responsible is β-Aminopropionitrile, which prevents collagen cross-linking, thus making the blood vessel, especially the tunica media, weak. This can result in Cystic medial necrosis or a picture similar to Marfan syndrome. The damaged vessels are at {{an increased risk of}} dissection.|$|E
