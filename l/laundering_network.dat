40|$|Money launderers hide {{traces of}} their {{transactions}} with {{the involvement of}} entities that participate in sophisticated schemes. Money laundering detection requires unraveling concealed connections among multiple but seemingly unrelated human money <b>laundering</b> <b>networks,</b> ties among actors of those schemes, and amounts of funds transferred among those entities. The link among small networks, either financial or social, is the primary factor that facilitates money laundering. Hence, the analysis of relations among money <b>laundering</b> <b>networks</b> is required to present the full structure of complex schemes. We propose a framework that uses sequence matching, case-based analysis, social network analysis, and complex event processing to detect money laundering. Our framework captures an ongoing single scheme as an event, and associations among such ongoing sequence of events to capture complex relationships among evolving money laundering schemes. The framework can detect associated multiple money <b>laundering</b> <b>networks</b> {{even in the absence}} of some evidence. We validated the accuracy of detecting evolving money laundering schemes using a multi-phases test methodology. Our test used data generated from real-life cases, and extrapolated to generate more data from real-life schemes generator that we implemented. </p...|$|R

30|$|We {{propose to}} use {{top-level}} theory {{to identify which}} topological feature {{should be considered in}} the calculations and to use domain knowledge explicitly. As an example, similar to our proposed strategy, the authors in [34] use well known social network metrics, like centrality and PageRank, to determine roles each criminal has in a money <b>laundering</b> <b>network.</b> The link between topological metrics and top-level roles was only possible through the cooperation of investigators with field knowledge of laundering methods, an approximation between domain knowledge, and bottom-up metrics. This mixed strategy generated excellent results with real world datasets and is quite similar to the path we follow in this study.|$|E
40|$|Money {{laundering}} is the disguising of {{the illegal}} origin of money by bringing {{it back into the}} legal financial circuit. Therefore, in this dissertation I try to establish a theoretical framework to understand the role of social networks, and the link between criminals and legal actors in the money laundering process. I focus on the money laundering method called smurfing; the splitting of large criminal proceeds into small inconspicuous amounts, and since this technique typically requires a network, it requires potential criminals to form links with other people and to construct a money <b>laundering</b> <b>network</b> to launder their money. The research questions are focused on how the networks are formed when criminals strategically form links to launder their money and what the shape of the network is at the macro-level. Moreover, focus is also on optimal policies to fight crime and money laundering, both at the national and the international level. Towards this end, I introduce social network and game theory into the field of money laundering. The study also includes some simulations in order to find the optimal budget for anti-money laundering policy. InChapter 2, I analyze a typical drug-crime scenario by presenting a simple model to study the formation of a money <b>laundering</b> <b>network</b> in this context. I assume that there are three types of actors: criminal bosses, foot soldiers, and dishonest workers. I show that the money <b>laundering</b> <b>network</b> at the macro level has an extended inter-linked star structure in which the talented criminal bosses are fully interconnected. I also show that agents’ willingness to become criminals is endogenously dependent on the wage of workers. In Chapters 3 and 4, I consider only two groups of agents in the network, potential criminals and workers. After characterizing the network I analyze the national and international policy to combat money laundering. The crucial focus of Chapter 3 is the analysis of the optimal mixture of anti-crime and anti-money laundering policies. Which policies should a law enforcement agency focus on to combat either crime or money laundering in order to minimize total criminal activity in a society? In the present model, this is expressed in terms of an optimal budget sharing rule. I also empirically implement the model using real world data and calculate the optimal policy response numerically with a macro-level “sufficient statistics’’ approach. The aim of Chapter 4 is to theoretically assess different options for transnational policy cooperation to fight crime and money laundering. I consider four regimes to combat money laundering: a decentral regime without an international information exchange; a decentral regime with an information exchange; a central regime with an evenly split budget among the two countries; a central regime with a tailor-made budget. I determined the best option from the viewpoint of each country and from the overall viewpoint, considering countries that differ in average income and country sizes. My findings show that the first-best regime is to implement a central authority which allocates tailor-made budgets...|$|E
40|$|This PhD Dissertation adds two new {{results in}} {{detecting}} signs of financial fraud: (1) {{the application of}} automated learning techniques to internal accounting databases of companies to detect money laundering, and (2) the offer of information to the investigating authorities on how the money <b>laundering</b> <b>network</b> is organized, {{with the objective of}} orientating the judicial investigation towards those companies or physical persons who present signs of suspicious patterns. Thus, {{in the context of a}} real macro-case on money laundering in which the author has collaborated as forensic accountant, this study analyses the database available of the operations carried out between a core company and a set of 643 supplier companies, 26 of which had already been identified a priori by the Judicial Police as fraudulent. Faced with a well-founded suspicion that other suppliers within the network might have committed criminal acts, and in order to better manage the scarce police resources available, machine learning techniques are proposed with two different approaches to detect patterns of fraud. The first proposed approach is the implementation of Neural Network models to the expert-assisted work for the detection of fraud operations. For this purpose, based on machine learning techniques, the network structure used is that proposed by Hastie et al. (2008) : The Back-Propagation Network. In the second approach, it is proposed a more ambitious procedure to pattern detection than the previous one, in which Benford's Law (Nigrini and Mittermaider, 1997), a tool to characterize accounting records of the commercial operations between the main company and its supplier, is combined with four models of classification: Ridge Logistic Regression (LG) (Le Cessie and van Houwelingen, 1992), Artificial Neural Networks (NN) (Hastie et al., 2008), Decision Tree C 4. 5 (DT) (Quinlan, 1993 and 1996) and Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001). Overall, the Random Forest showed the best results with the SMOTE transformation, obtaining 96. 15...|$|E

25|$|On 20 June 1989, a sack {{filled with}} {{dynamite}} sticks was discovered near a beach house Falcone had rented {{in the town}} of Addaura by policeman Nino Agostino. Although Falcone had been threatened before, this failed attempt bothered him in the extreme because it had all the signs of an inside job. At the time, he was meeting Swiss prosecutors Carla Del Ponte and Claudio Lehman from Lugano who were helping to investigate the Mafia's financial holdings in Switzerland. Falcone believed that the assassination attempt not only involved the Mafia but some people in government as well. During the investigations into the money <b>laundering</b> <b>networks</b> of the Mafia, it became clear that former Palermo police chief Bruno Contrada who had moved to the intelligence service SISDE had warned a suspect about his impending arrest so that he could escape in time.|$|R

40|$|Money {{laundering}} {{investigations have}} been much in the news of late. There have been stories that Radil Salinas de Gortari laundered kickbacks from drug traffickers while his brother was President of Mexico. That Ferdinand Marcos stashed nearly {{half a billion dollars}} in Swiss banks while he ruled the Philippines. That two of Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s largest banks have pleaded guilty to laundering charges stemming from a controversial U. S. sting operation. That the former prime minister of Ukraine pleaded guilty to Swiss charges that he laundered 9 million in stolen funds, even as he faced U. S. charges of laundering 114 million. And, of course, that Russian organized crime <b>networks</b> <b>laundered</b> billions of dollars through the Bank of New York. Despite the new-found celebrity of the crime, laws against money laundering have roots as long as those of RICO. This article will trace those origins, after evaluating RICO. The article then will consider whether domestic and international efforts to combat money laundering provide better means than RICO for fighting organized crime. It will demonstrate that anti-money-laundering laws themselves are complex and burdensome, yet of dubious effectiveness. The article will recommend a new crime-fighting balance, one that accords due weight to the privacy and other interests of law-abiding businesses and individuals...|$|R
