50|$|The {{style in}} the {{miniature}} in Folio 76v is markedly different from the style in Folio 53v. In this case, the framed miniature contains two men, perhaps Spanish, with uncovered wavy light brown hair that falls to the jaw line. The men seem young, as the player on the left has no facial hair and his face is unlined. In both folios, both pairs of players are playing backgammon and seem to be well-dressed, {{although there is no}} addition of gold detailing to their robes as seen in the wardrobes of aristocratic players in other miniatures. These players are seated on the ground, leaning on pillows that are placed next to a backgammon board. In this miniature, the figure {{on the left side of}} the board faces the reader, while the figure on the right leans in to the board with his back to the reader. In other words, each player is leaning on his left elbow, using his right hand to reach across his body to play. In the miniatures of this style, the emphasis seems to be more on the posture of the player than the detail of their faces; this crossed, <b>lounging</b> <b>style</b> is only found in the folios of the Libro de tablas, the third section of the Libro de juegos which explicates the game of backgammon, again perhaps indicative of the work of a particular artist.|$|E

5000|$|Stephen Cook {{reviewed}} the album for Allmusic {{and described the}} album as combining [...] "the vibist's Tjader's Latin <b>lounge</b> <b>style</b> with kitschy Asian touches" [...] describing the songs [...] "Sake and Greens," [...] "Cha," [...] and [...] "Shoji" [...] as sounding like [...] "'60s-era James Bond on a wild chase {{through the heart of}} Tokyo". Cook concluded by feeling that [...] "The ultra-smooth Latin jazz sound Tjader favored has always been more infectious than demanding and Breeze from the East's commercialized mod/eastern elements only end up expanding the pop exotica mix".|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the lounge revival {{was in full}} swing and {{included}} such groups as Combustible Edison, Love Jones, The Cocktails, Pink Martini, the High Llamas, Don Tiki, and Nightcaps.

The <b>lounge</b> <b>style</b> was starkly in contrast to the grunge music that dominated the period. These groups wore suits and played music inspired by earlier works of Antônio Carlos Jobim, Juan García Esquivel, Louis Prima and many others.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1999 {{the band}} played at Glastonbury Festival on the Pyramid Stage. Their December 1999 album Mimosa, {{released}} by EMI was a compilation album consisting mostly of laid back <b>lounge</b> <b>style</b> covers and different versions of earlier released tracks. While making reasonable sales, the album was their weakest selling album yet and remained so for some years. It was around this time, in 1999, that Steve Borgovini left the band. He was replaced by Maxwell [...] "Mackie" [...] Jayson. A permanent replacement was found in 2003 {{in the form of}} Mark Reid (aka Frank Benbini) from Leicester, United Kingdom, who had previously worked with the band as Jayson's technician.|$|R
5000|$|Parodists {{with differing}} {{techniques}} have included [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic, who has generally put new lyrics to largely unchanged music, and Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine or The Lounge Kittens keeps the lyrics intact but alters the musical style, performing rap, metal, and rock songs in a <b>lounge</b> <b>style.</b> Country Yossi, a pioneering composer and singer in the Jewish music genre, reworks {{the lyrics of}} country music and other mainstream hits to convey Orthodox Jewish themes. Another example of musical parody is Mac Sabbath, a Black Sabbath tribute band who utilize McDonald's-themed props and costumes with altered lyrics satirizing the fast food industry.|$|R

5000|$|There are an {{increasing}} variety of nursing bras designs, including softcup, underwire, seamless, and <b>lounging</b> <b>styles.</b> Some nursing bras can {{also serve as}} a sports bra, allowing a nursing mother to exercise more easily. Some outerwear like tank tops and T-shirts have nursing bras that are built into the garment, and there are also padded and plus-size nursing bras. Some experts advise against wearing an underwire nursing bra because they can restrict the flow of milk and cause mastitis. [...] Most nursing bras have traditionally been white, but manufacturers now offer {{an increasing}} selection of colors and styles, including brown, teal, floral, and floral animal prints, and some are accessorized with lace and ribbon.|$|R

5000|$|Black Velvet Flag {{was named}} the best {{unsigned}} band of 1994 by Rolling Stones poll of music critics. [...] AllMusic's Jack Rabid called the album [...] "One of the funniest records released this year." [...] In the Washington Post, Mark Jenkins wrote of the band's act of covering punk songs in a <b>lounge</b> <b>style</b> that [...] "...this is a joke that doesn't {{need to be told}} more than once." [...] Trouser Presss David Sprague concluded that the album [...] "...falls somewhere between Dread Zeppelin feebdom and a '90s approximation of Frank Sinatra's late-'60s hipster era, during which Ol' Blue Eyes tried his best to bask in the glow of the summer of love — not that either assessment will keep Black Velvet Flag from the next century's thrift store bargain bins." [...] Chris Norris of New York was also critical of the band's style, writing that their [...] "hardcore-as-lounge gag" [...] was [...] "funny for about twenty seconds and only if you've never seen Repo Man." ...|$|R
50|$|Nevada State Prison (NSP), also in Carson City, {{which was}} the only state penitentiary for many decades, {{underwent}} expansion in the early 1960s. The result was a second facility in Carson City that would become known as Northern Nevada Correctional Center (NNCC). The correctional center was opened in 1964 with three housing units. An interesting {{fact is that the}} Correctional Center was to operate as a treatment center rather than a traditional lockdown facility. Staff members did not wear uniforms, instead wearing casual attire the staff interacted closely with inmates. Inmates addressed staff by their first names. This was an experiment in corrections that had never been done in Nevada. In contrast to Nevadas only other prison, Nevada State Prison, NNCC was created to treat the inmates underlying problems that lead to incarceration. Emphasis was placed on drug and alcohol treatment, education and restoring family ties. This was evident by the <b>lounge</b> <b>style</b> visiting room and dedicated education building, both are still in use today. By 2008, seven additional units were constructed.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Cheese and The Lounge Kittens produce parodies {{not in the}} {{traditional}} sense of someone like Yankovic, but rather derive their humor from exactly the opposite means. While traditional parody puts new lyrics to largely unchanged music, they keep the lyrics intact but alter the musical style, thus altering the intent of the song. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of very familiar lyrics from popular rap, metal, and rock songs (particularly containing profane, violent, or sexually explicit lyrics) with their exceedingly clean, [...] "white bread", campy, <b>lounge</b> <b>style.</b> Me First and the Gimme Gimmes does likewise in a complete opposite manner: they perform hard, sped-up punk renditions of folk songs, soft rock, showtunes, R&B, and other genres not usually associated with punk. Yankovic has also ventured into this practice; all but two of his albums feature medleys of either classic rock or then-current hit songs done as fast polkas. Ray Stevens has had hits of Glenn Miller's [...] "In the Mood" [...] done in the style of clucking chickens, and a honky-tonk or bluegrass version of Michael Jackson's [...] "Bad".|$|R
