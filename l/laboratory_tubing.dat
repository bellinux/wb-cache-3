50|$|Pink algae is {{a growth}} of pink, slimey {{bacterial}} matter which can sometimes occur in pools {{and sometimes in}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>tubings.</b> The title is a misnomer, because, as noted before, pink algae is actually caused by a bacterium, in the genus methylobacterium. The color of the bacterial growth comes from pigments within its cells. The slime formed around the bacteria provides it with a relatively high level of protection from external threats. Like other species in its genus, pink algae is a methane consuming bacterium. It has an affinity for the matrix of PVC plastics, and will attach itself to both the inside and the outside of PVC materials inside of the pool. Pink algae infestation in a pool often occurs alongside an infestation of white water mold.|$|R
40|$|Background: A valveless pump {{generates a}} {{unidirectional}} net flow of fluid around a closed loop of soft viscoelastic tubing that is rhythmically compressed at one point. The tubing must {{have at least}} two sections with two different stiffnesses. When a short segment of the tube is squeezed asymmetrically at certain frequencies, net flow of fluid around the loop can occur without valves. Methods: Partial differential equations for the pressures, volumes, and flows define a simple one-dimensional model of such a pump, based upon elementary physical principles. Numerical computations on a personal computer can predict measured net flows. Results: Net flow varies with the frequency and waveform of compression used to excite the pump, {{as well as with the}} site of compression and the stiffness and viscosity of the tubing. Net flows on the order of 1 ml/sec are obtained in a waterfilled loop including 46 cm of stiffer plastic (Tygon) <b>laboratory</b> <b>tubing</b> and 70 cm of softer latex rubber tubing...|$|E

Conclusions The heretofore mysterious phenomenon of valveless pumping can be described in terms of classical Newtonian physics, in which viscous damping in the walls of the pump is included. Studying valveless pumps in the laboratory and modeling their behavior numerically provides a low-cost, engaging, and instructive exercise for research and teaching in biomedical engineering...|$|E
40|$|Guides for γ-rays can be {{constructed}} by using total external reflection. Radiation incident at grazing angles less than a critical angle θc ≈ λ (Nee 2 /πmec 2) 1 / 2 may be nearly completely reflected depending upon the surface quality and the absorption coefficient. Sample guides have been constructed from long small-diameter glass <b>laboratory</b> <b>tubing</b> of good straightness. Determination of the transmission vs. position, as a source was moved across a diameter, provided a technique that greatly helped adjustment of successive sections to colinearity. Observation of an unbroadened 57 Fe γ-ray resonance between a source and absorber separated by such a γ-ray guide demonstrated that the reflection process is essentially elastic. Computer calculations have analyzed the properties of guides of square cross-section which would be assembled from plates of float glass supported in a vacuum pipe. A large guide constructed in this way could facilitate an improved measurement of the gravitational red-shift. The proportionality to λ 2 of the effective aperture of capture by a guide gives to it the properties of a low-pass filter. A bundle of small capillary tubing placed between a source and a detector resulted in a striking reduction in the intensity of high energy radiation reaching the detector relative to that of low energy. Use of lead glass reduced the direct penetration of the high energy γ-rays through the glass and also increased the aperture for low energy by increasing the critical angles...|$|E
40|$|The use of animal, {{especially}} rat, models, {{is crucial}} for elucidating the biological effects and mechanisms of the widely used hormone 17 β-estradiol. Unfortunately {{there is a lack}} of consensus on optimal means of obtaining and maintaining physiological 17 β-estradiol concentrations in plasma. This may be the reason for varying results in several studies including the disagreement on whether 17 β-estradiol is neuroprotective or not. Very few studies have been devoted to investigating the characteristics and biological relevance of different methods of 17 β-estradiol administration. We therefore ovariectomized 75 Sprague-Dawley rats and, following a 2 weeks wash-out period, administered 17 β-estradiol using three different methods; daily injections (10 µg 17 β-estradiol/kg), slow-release pellets (0. 25 mg 60 day-release pellets, 0. 10 mg 90 day-release pellets) and silastic capsules (with/without wash-out periods) (silastic <b>laboratory</b> <b>tubing,</b> inner/outer diameter: 1. 575 / 3. 175 mm, filled with 20 mm columns of 180 µg 17 β-estradiol/mL sesame oil). Further 45 animals were used as ovariectomized and native controls, studied in different parts of the estrous cycle. Silastic capsules produced concentrations of 17 β-estradiol within the physiological range for 4 - 5 weeks independent of whether a prior wash-out period was included or not. The slow-release pellets, irrespective of dose or release period, resulted in initial concentrations which were an order of magnitude above physiological concentrations during the first two weeks followed by a substantial decrease. Daily injections resulted in increasing 17 β-estradiol concentrations, however within physiological levels. Silastic capsules are conveniently manufactured and used, and are superior to pellets and injections in reliably producing long-term 17 β-estradiol concentrations within the physiological range.

Ström, Elvar Theodorsson and Annette Theodorsson, Order of magnitude differences between methods for maintaining physiological 17 β-estradiol concentrations in ovariectomized rats, 2008, Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation.

40|$|Background/Question/Methods Recent {{studies suggest}} the common forest invader Lonicera maackii {{possesses}} allelopathic potential. However, no research has effectively determined if allelopathic potential of L. maackii {{is a significant}} contributor to its invasiveness relative to its ability to compete for below ground resources. Also, most studies have only focused on single populations of L. maackii in determining any allelopathic effects. We conducted a full factorial multi-population study to isolate the competitive and allelopathic effects L. maackii on the native forest annual Pilea pumila. Individual P. pumila plants were grown in pots in the greenhouse in commercial potting soil containing a transplanted 2 - 3 yr old L. maackii from one of six Ohio populations. Pilea pumila grown alone served as a control. Activated carbon was incorporated into the soil of half the pots from each treatment in order to ameliorate effects of potential allelochemicals and to account for direct effects of carbon treatment. Independent and interactive effects of activated carbon and L. maackii treatments on final total, above, and below ground biomass of P. pumila was examined using ANOVA. Identification of potential allelochemicals was investigated by growing 2 - 3 yr old L. maackii alone in pots containing Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) <b>laboratory</b> <b>tubing.</b> Pots with PDMS tubing without plants served as a control. PDMS tubing was removed and extracts from tubing will be analyzed using HPLC to identify bioactive phenolic compounds. Results/Conclusions The presence of L. maackii decreased the final total biomass of P. pumila overall by 33 %, but populations did not vary in this effect, after accounting for initial size of L. maackii. Activated carbon increased total biomass of P. pumila {{in the absence of}} L. maackii by 44 % but there was no benefit of activated carbon when L. maackii was present. Below ground biomass of P. pumila was more responsive to treatments than above ground biomass. Final biomass of L. maackii was independent of the presence of carbon. We conclude that Ohio populations of L. maackii do not vary in their ability to compete for below ground resources or in their allelopathic potential. The lack of response of L. maackii to activated carbon and its ability to inhibit the positive effects of carbon on P. pumila suggest that L. maackii exerts its effects through a combination of resource competition and allelopathy...|$|E
