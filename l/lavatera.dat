5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (<b>Lavatera</b> arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
60|$|Proofs of Migration {{by way of}} the Himalayas and Southern Asia.--But {{although}} we may thus explain the presence of a considerable portion of the European element in the floras of New Zealand and Australia, we cannot account for the whole of it by this means, because Australia itself contains a host of European and Asiatic genera of which we find no trace in New Zealand or South America, or any other Antarctic land. We find, in fact, in Australia two distinct sets of European plants. First {{we have a number of}} species identical with those of Northern Europe or Asia (of the most characteristic of which--thirty-eight in number--Sir Joseph Hooker gives a list); and in the second place a series of European genera usually of a somewhat more southern character, mostly represented by very distinct species, and all absent from New Zealand; such as Clematis, Papaver, Cleome, Polygala, <b>Lavatera,</b> Ajuga, &c. Now of the first set--the North European species--about three-fourths occur in some parts of America, {524} and about half in South Temperate America or New Zealand; whence we may conclude that most of these, as well as some others, have reached Australia by the route already indicated. The second set of Australo-European genera, however, and many others characteristic of the South European or the Himalayan flora, have probably reached Australia {{by way of the}} mountains of Southern Asia, Borneo, the Moluccas, and New Guinea, at a somewhat remote period when loftier ranges and some intermediate peaks may have existed, sufficient to carry on the migration by the aid of the alternate climatal changes which are known to have occurred. The long belt of Secondary and Palæozoic formations in East Australia from Tasmania to Cape York continued by the lofty ranges of New Guinea, indicates the route of this immigration, and sufficiently explains how it is that these northern types are almost wholly confined to this part of the Australian continent. Some of the earlier immigrants of this class no doubt passed over to New Zealand and now form a portion of the peculiar genera confined to these two countries; but most of them are of later date, and have thus remained in Australia only.|$|E
6000|$|The law of {{reversion}} is {{as powerful}} with hybrids, {{when they are}} sufficiently fertile to breed together, or when they are repeatedly crossed with either pure parent-form, {{as in the case}} of mongrels. It is not necessary to give instances. With plants almost every one who has worked on this subject, from the time of Kolreuter to the present day, has insisted on this tendency. Gartner has recorded some good instances; but no one has given more striking ones than Naudin. (13/19. Kolreuter gives curious cases in his 'Dritte Fortsetzung' 1766 ss. 53, 59; and in his well-known 'Memoirs on <b>Lavatera</b> and Jalapa.' Gartner 'Bastarderzeugung' ss. 437, 441, etc. Naudin in his [...] "Recherches sur l'Hybridite" [...] 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 25.) The tendency differs in degree or strength in different groups, and partly depends, as we shall presently see, on whether the parent-plants have been long cultivated. Although the tendency to reversion is extremely general with nearly all mongrels and hybrids, it cannot be considered as invariably characteristic of them; it may also be mastered by long-continued selection; but these subjects will more properly be discussed in a future chapter on Crossing. From what we see of the power and scope of reversion, both in pure races, and when varieties or species are crossed, we may infer that characters of almost every kind are capable of reappearing after having been lost for a great length of time. But it does not follow from this that in each particular case certain characters will reappear; for instance, this will not occur when a race is crossed with another endowed with prepotency of transmission. Sometimes the power of reversion wholly fails, without our being able to assign any cause for the failure: thus it has been stated that in a French family in which 85 out of above 600 members, during six generations, had been subject to night-blindness, [...] "there has not been a single example of this affection in the children of parents who were themselves free from it." [...] (13/20. Quoted by Mr. Sedgwick in 'Med.-Chirurg. Review' April 1861 page 485. Dr. H. Dobell in 'Med.-Chirurg. Transactions' volume 46 gives an analogous case in which, in a large family, fingers with thickened joints were transmitted to several members during five generations; but when the blemish once disappeared it never reappeared.) ...|$|E

40|$|Eight species {{belonging}} to five true bug families {{were analyzed using}} DAPI/CMA 3 -staining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with telomeric (TTAGG) n and 18 S rDNA probes. Standard chromosomal complements are reported for the first time for Deraeocoris rutilus (Herrich-Schäffer, 1838) (2 n= 30 + 2 m+XY) and D. ruber (Linnaeus, 1758) (2 n= 30 + 2 m+XY) from the family Miridae. Using FISH, the location of a 18 S rDNA cluster was detected in these species and in five more species: Megaloceroea recticornis (Geoffroy, 1785) (2 n= 30 +XY) from the Miridae; Oxycarenus <b>lavaterae</b> (Fabricius, 1787) (2 n= 14 + 2 m+XY) from the Lygaeidae s. l.; Pyrrhocoris apterus (Linnaeus, 1758) (2 n= 22 +X) from the Pyrrhocoridae; Eurydema oleracea (Linnaeus, 1758) (2 n= 12 +XY) and Graphosoma lineatum (Linnaeus, 1758) (2 n= 12 +XY) from the Pentatomidae. The species were found to differ with respect to location of a 18 S rRNA gene cluster which resides on autosomes in O. <b>lavaterae</b> and P. apterus, whereas it locates on sex chromosomes in other five species. The 18 S rDNA location provides the ﬁrst physical landmark of the genomes of the species studied. The insect consensus telomeric pentanucleotide (TTAGG) n was demonstrated to be absent in all the species studied in this respect, D. rutilus, M. recticornis, Cimex lectularius Linnaeus, 1758 (Cimicidae), E. oleracea, and G. lineatum, supporting the hypothesis that this motif was lost in early evolution of the Heteroptera and secondarily replaced with another motif (yet unknown) or the alternative telomerase-independent mechanisms of telomere maintenance. Dot-blot hybridization analysis of the genomic DNA from C. lectularius, Nabis sp. and O. <b>lavaterae</b> with (TTAGG) n and six other telomeric probes likewise provided a negative result...|$|R

40|$|Phytomonas spp. (phytomonads) are {{a diverse}} and {{globally}} distributed group of unicellular eukaryotes that parasitize {{a wide range}} of plants and are transmitted by insect hosts. Here we report the discovery and characterisation of a new species of Phytomonas, named Phytomonas oxycareni n. sp., which was obtained from the salivary glands of the invasive species of true bug Oxycarenus <b>lavaterae</b> (Heteroptera). The new Phytomonas species exhibits a long slender promastigote morphology and can be found both within the lumen of the insect host's salivary glands as well as within the cells of the salivary gland itself. Sampling multiple individuals from the same population post-winter hibernation on two consecutive years revealed that infection was persistent over time. Finally, phylogenetic analyses of small subunit ribosomal RNA genes revealed that this species is sister to other species within the genus Phytomonas, providing new insight into the evolutionary history of the clade...|$|R
