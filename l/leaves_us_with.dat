500|$|There {{are very}} few extant sources of {{information}} on the individual trobairitz. Almost all information which exists about them come from their vidas (biographies) and razós (contextual explanations of the songs), the brief descriptions that were assembled in song collections called chansonniers. The vidas are notoriously unreliable, since they frequently consisted of little more than romanticized extrapolations from the poems of the trobairitz themselves. The names of about twenty female poets from the 12th and 13th centuries survive, with an estimated thirty-two works attributed to the trobairitz. There are about 5 percent as many trobairitz as there are troubadours, and the number of surviving compositions by trobairitz amounts to around 1 percent of those we have by the troubadours. The earliest surviving lyric written by a trobairitz is that of Bels dous amics, written by Tibors around 1150. Only one survives with musical notation intact, [...] "A chantar" [...] by Comtessa de Diá (see below). Some works which are anonymous in the sources are ascribed by certain modern editors to women, as are some works which are attributed to men in the manuscripts. For comparison, of the 460 male troubadours, about 2600 of their poems survive. Of these, about one in 10 survive with musical notation intact. Only two trobairitz have left us with more than one song apiece. Those two women are Comtessa de Dia, who <b>leaves</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> four cansos, and Castelloza, with three cansos and a fourth that is anonymous.|$|E

2500|$|Recall {{that the}} moral law, if it exists, must apply universally and necessarily. Therefore, a moral law could never rest on {{hypothetical}} imperatives, which only apply if one adopts some particular end. Rather, the imperative associated with the moral law must be a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative holds for all rational agents, regardless of whatever varying ends a person may have. If we could find it, the categorical imperative would provide us with the moral law. What would the categorical imperative look like? We know that it could never {{be based on the}} particular ends that people adopt to give themselves rules of action. Kant thinks that this <b>leaves</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> one remaining alternative, namely that the categorical imperative must be based on the notion of a law itself. Laws (or commands), by definition, apply universally. [...] From this observation, Kant derives the categorical imperative, which requires that moral agents act only {{in a way that the}} principle of their will could become a universal law. (4:421) The categorical imperative is a test of proposed maxims; it does not generate a list of duties on its own. [...] The categorical imperative is Kant’s general statement of the supreme principle of morality, but Kant goes on to provide three different formulations of this general statement.|$|E
