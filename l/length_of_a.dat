5|$|Apart from {{a number}} of other books and pamphlets, Wright {{translated}} John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician Richard Norwood, who calculated the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> degree on a great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.|$|E
5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> DNA double helix that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E

5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} which are caused by the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E

5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of {{immunoglobulin}} light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{settlement}} of the village of Skaneateles began, the Seneca Turnpike route which originally bypassed the village to the north was relocated southward {{to go through the}} growing settlement. The Seneca Turnpike Company closed its doors in 1852. Modern NY175 does not follow either the original alignment or the relocated alignment, but rather the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former trolley line that went from Skaneateles to Syracuse via Marcellus and Onondaga. This trolley line parallels the relocated alignment.|$|E

5|$|The Green Wing Special is {{the final}} episode of the British sitcom Green Wing. It was first {{broadcast}} in Australia and Belgium on 29 December 2006. It was aired on 4 January 2007 in the United Kingdom. The episode is sometimes billed as a Christmas special, although the episode contains nothing Christmas related. The special is 90 minutes long, around twice the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> normal episode.|$|E
5|$|The Voyagers found aurora-like {{ultraviolet}} {{emissions of}} hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity {{may lead to}} the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn (the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Greenlandic {{is highly}} synthetic and exclusively suffixing, {{with the exception}} of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is no limit to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.|$|E

5|$|Vowel length. The {{pronunciation}} of {{long and}} short vowels depends on the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. A long vowel has about 208% the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, {{but they are still}} distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit on the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E

5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> helical capsid {{is related to the}} length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres.

5|$|On 5 June 2014, the Geographic Names Committee {{decide to}} rename the roads that connect Forrest Highway to Bunbury – part of Old Coast Road {{as well as}} Australind Bypass – {{as part of the}} highway. The {{renaming}} had been proposed in 2013 due to public confusion over the three names used for the route to Bunbury: Forrest Highway to Lake Clifton, Old Coast Road from there to north of Australind, and then Australind Bypass. Emergency services had difficulty locating incidents due to the confusion. The renaming followed similar changes to Main Roads' internal-use designations in May 2011, which deprecated Perth Bunbury Highway (Highway H2) in favour of Melville Mandurah Highway (Highway H2) for the portion north of Mandurah, Lakeland Lake Clifton Road (Main Road M74) for the Mandurah to Lake Clifton section together with Mandjoogoordap Drive, and an extension of Forrest Highway (Highway H57) for the Lake Clifton to Bunbury portion. Changes to the road signs were expected to be completed by mid-July. The renaming was considered unusual, as it affected a significant <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major road, which was the address of eleven residential properties.|$|E
