Paul Levinson emphasises the ability of photography to capture or reflect [...] "a literal energy configuration from the real world" [...] through a chemical process. <b>Light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion</b> on the photographic negative is transformed by light passing through the lens and diaphragm of a camera.

Both conceptually and technically, Ulay considers the Polaroid to be central to his work: this technique makes possible the “life” transference of bodies, light, dust, identity, desire onto a <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion.</b> All photography experts consider his monumental Polaroid photographs - one of them being the largest ever made, namely a 288 x112 cm Polagram in the Rabobank Collection, Utrecht, The Netherlands- as unique examples of the use of this technique as a conceptual tool.|$|E
40|$|The mesh {{has been}} an {{interference}} factor {{in the making of}} close tolerance high resolution screen printing stencils. Radiation strikes the surface of the threads and is reflected into the <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion</b> causing a deterioration in the sharpness of the stencil edge. This problem has been largely overcome by the introduction of dyed mesh. However, by purposely exploiting the reflective properties of the mesh, a random, or irregular pattern of dots can be produced. This is accomplished by exposing a continuous tone positive to a screen that has been coated with a photosensitive emulsion. Five screens of varying mesh counts were constructed. The test procedure involved experimenting with a number of variables including photosensitive materials, coating thickness and wash-out procedures. Comparisons of the differences in the random dot structure from one screen to another were made and analyzed. Results of this study showed that there is a correlation between thread frequency and the degree of hardening caused by undercut that is produced in the coating around these threads...|$|E
5000|$|In his Crunchtime series {{from the}} later {{part of the}} 2000s, Flomen began to {{physically}} crush the photo-sensitive paper itself to capture various levels of texture and depth in different natural environments. In Flomen's Pharmed series from the 2010s, Flomen exposed original glass plate negatives in situ, directly from nature without using a camera, to use for printing his photographs. The origins and context of this series are described in a folio of his works from the series: [...] "The <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsions</b> were prepared by the artist for exposure in swampy watersheds {{during the height of}} the spring season. At night, at water’s edge, Flomen documents the organic elements that exist in these highly vibrant landscapes. The artist prints from the large format glass plates onto gelatin silver paper.

[...] Emulsions that form LIs in the interior are called internal(ly) <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsions,</b> and those that form LI on the surface are called surface <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The sensitivity type largely reflects the site of very shallow electron traps that form latent images effectively.|$|R
40|$|Aging {{tests for}} several batches of Kodak type 101 {{emulsion}} show that storage conditions significantly influence {{how well the}} film will maintain its sensitometric properties, with sensitivity and density increasing to a maximum during this period. Any further aging may result in higher fog levels and sensitivity loss. It is noted that storage in an environment free of photographically active compounds allows film property optimization, and that film batches with different sensitivities age differently.

40|$|The screen {{printing}} process has been the least understood and studied versus other imaging methods in the graphic arts industry. As equipment configurations improve and a continuous technological development and need for high quality output persists, this fascinating process becomes increasingly popular in several end-use applications. Such as in packaging, labeling, durable graphic films printing and even short run large format halftone graphics. There is a serious need for further deep scientific analysis {{of the process and}} its variables. One of the poorly investigated sides of the four color {{screen printing}} is the effect that ink placement has to the final color appearance of a halftone print. Several known factors can influence the color result of a screen printed image. Limitations inherent to screen printing allow for a smaller color gamut reproduction compared to other methods, but colors are reproduced vividly due to a uniform and high ink film thickness. The screen - equivalent to a printing plate - consists of a stretched porous fabric mounted on a carrier frame that is coated with a <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>emulsion</b> (stencil) and subsequently exposed and hardened at the non image areas. The ink will flow through the screen mesh openings when pressure and hydraulic forces are applied by a squeegee blade system. The ink system can be cured or dried by various methods depending on its chemistry and composition. For the specific system investigated, UV curing units expose the wet ink film to high energy radiation for full polymerization. The different types of equipment configurations in screen printing are designed for various processing speeds, base material formats, ink systems of specific drying and curing characteristics and also for various end use applications. This study utilized a Kammann web screen printer with five color stations and UV curing capability for roll to roll one-pass multi color printing. This type of screen printing press is used for applications such as promotional labelling with high precision type and halftone reproduction. A popular film substrate is the polyolefin construction that delivers printability, water resistance, color strength and good process characteristics through roll to roll printing presses. The polyolefin material used for this study was supplied by Fasson Films and is constructed to give a consistent ink film deposit under the set parameters without any penetration, absorption or permeation of the ink system. The samples printed from the total graphics system were produced under the same conditions using in a period of a full working day the press, screens, ink systems and substrate, but only varying the order of the printed process colors yellow (Y), cyan (C) or process blue, magenta (M) or process red and black (K). The importance of ink sequence is determined by creating these prints under the same arrangement and evaluating the color result {{as it relates to the}} sequence followed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the ink sequence to the final color appearance of fully dried /cured ink film as expressed by its hue and saturation characteristics. The ink sequence is treated as the sole variable and all other parameters remain constant. An image was designed specifically for this process containing solids, tints and an actual halftone icon. Data was collected by a densitometer and a spectrophotometer from the individual color patches. The representative sampling consists of selected prints throughout each ink sequence run and the measured mean values of all color patches are recorded, plotted, graphed and statistically analyzed. The Hexagon GATF diagram was used to show changes from run to run, densitometric data was also graphed for comparison critique and the CIE*L*a*b* color coordinates allowed mapping of the prints for comparison analysis and color difference [delta]E* study. The data is statistically analyzed and validated versus the null hypothesis using a single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe comparisons. The final visual evaluation under standard lighting conditions per ASTM standards helps to support the results and conclusion. Experience from the field supports that the ink sequence affects the final color result assuming that all other system components remain equal. This study shows that the sequences 2 ̆ 7 compared color is different and the ink sequence is a critical factor that should be analyzed further for the screen printing industry in order to help maintain color consistency and control. The hypotheses are supported by the study 2 ̆ 7 s results. The ink sequence influences the color 2 ̆ 7 s hue and saturation in four color halftone screen printing having distinct differences for every sequence that was produced during the printing run. The UV ink systems used, adhere and transfer better to the substrate instead of the ink layers. The placement of black is important for color control and trapping. If black is printed first down then the other inks trap well and a clean image is produced; if black is last, trapping is poor and consequently the color and image appearance. The target guide Nucleus Pattern Sequence Originator was ideal for color measurements and evaluation in screen printing; it is recommended for similar future research work. Densitometry and use of Hexagon diagrams is not very effective in screen printing. The use of colorimetry can show any color changes more accurately. It was also shown that the midtones are influenced the most form the change in ink sequence; especially important for trapping. Finally, two (2) of the ink sequences showed good results as concluded by the final evaluation. The MCYK delivered the best output in data and KMCY printed closest to the original proof...|$|E

5000|$|The {{developer}} selectively reduces {{silver halide}} crystals in the emulsion to metallic silver, but only those having latent image centres created by action of <b>light.</b> The <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> layer or <b>emulsion</b> consists of silver halide crystals in a gelatin base. Two photons of light must be absorbed by one silver halide crystal {{to form a}} stable two atom silver metal crystal. The developer used generally will only reduce silver halide crystals that have an existing silver crystal. Faster exposure or lower light level films usually have larger grains because those images capture less light. Fine grain films, like Kodachrome, require more light to increase the chance that the halide crystal will absorb at least two quanta of light as they have a smaller cross sectional size. Therefore, silver halide crystal size is proportional to film speed. The metallic silver image has dark (black) appearance. Once the desired level of reduction is achieved the development process is halted by washing in a dilute acid and then the undeveloped silver halide is removed by dissolving it in a thiosulfate solution, a process called fixing. Most commercial film developers use a dual solution or [...] "push" [...] (pushes the films speed) development (compensating developer, like Diafine) procedure where the reducing agent e.g. hydroquinone solution soaks into and swells the gelatin then the film is introduced into the alkaline solution which activates (lowers reduction potential) of the developer. The areas with the most light exposure use up the tiny amount of developer in the gelatin and stop making silver crystal before the film at that point is totally opaque. The areas that received the least light continue to develop because they haven't used up their developer. There is less contrast, but time is not critical and films from several customers and different exposures will develop satisfactorily.|$|R
