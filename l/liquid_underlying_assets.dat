40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{analytic}} valuation method for European-type contingent claims with multiple <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> under a stochastic market environment. We employ a twostate Markov regime-switching volatility {{in order to}} reflect the stochastically-changing market environment. The method is developed by exploiting the probability densities of the occupation times for which the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> processes are in a certain regime during a time period. By using the method, we provide closed-form valuation formulas for exchange options with two <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> In addition, in order to exploit the method for valuing contingent claims with more than two <b>underlying</b> <b>assets,</b> we develop an approximation formula which {{can be applied to}} a wide range of financial contingent claims with multiple <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> 2...|$|R

50|$|For example, a {{position}} which is long a 60-strike call and short a 60-strike put will always result in purchasing the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> for 60 at exercise or expiration. If the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> is above 60, the call {{is in the}} money and will be exercised; if the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> is below 60 then the short put position will be assigned, resulting in a (forced) purchase of the underlying at 60.|$|R

This study {{covers the}} period from 1990 to 1997 and investigates the {{relationship}} between the volume and value of index futures trading for the three main share indices and the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> on the JSE. The results of the regression tests indicate significant positive relationships between futures trading activity and the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> for the All Gold Index and the Industrial Index.

50|$|The put buyer/owner {{is short}} on the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> of the put, but {{long on the}} put option itself. That is, the buyer wants {{the value of the}} put option to {{increase}} by a decline in the price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> below the strike price. The writer (seller) of a put is long on the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> and short on the put option itself. That is, the seller wants the option to become worthless by an increase in the price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> above the strike price. Generally, a put option that is purchased is referred to as a long put and a put option that is sold is referred to as a short put.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{writing a}} derivative contract on some <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> {{in such a}} way that the derivative contract and <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> yield the same payo� distribution after one time period. Using the Hardy-Littlewood rearrangement inequality, we obtain an explicit solution for the cheapest measure preserving derivative contract in terms of the payo� distribution and pricing kernel of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset.</b> We develop asymptotic theory for the behavior of an estimated optimal derivative contract formed from estimates of the pricing kernel and underlying measure. Our optimal derivative corresponds to a direct investment in the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> if and only if the pricing kernel is monotone decreasing. When the pricing kernel is not monotone decreasing, an investment of one monetary unit in our optimal derivative yields a payo� distribution that �rst-order stochastically dominates an investment of one monetary unit in the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset.</b> Recent empirical research suggests that the pricing kernel corresponding to a major US market index is not monotone decreasin...|$|R

50|$|From the {{economic}} point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows, that are conditioned stochastically and discounted to present value. The market risk {{inherent in the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> {{is attached to the}} financial derivative through contractual agreements and hence can be traded separately. The <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> {{does not have to be}} acquired. Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows to modify the participation in the performance of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of the underlying can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> can be controlled in almost every situation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop the liquidity-adjusted density of <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> prices from option prices.

We compare the forecasting quality of the liquidity-adjusted density and the non-liquidity-adjusted density for one risk-neutral density and two real-world densities at five forecast horizons.

If the data-generating process is of the stochastic volatility type and if options are correctly priced, the two densities should be identical. Such work has been motivated by the negative results obtained by Aðt-Sahalia, Wang and Yard (1998) {{in the case of}} a simple, complete-markets setting in which the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> price only depended on the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> price. ...|$|R

40|$|In a {{segmented}} {{international capital}} market, the illiquidity {{of a country}} fund in the market in which its shares are traded affects only the share price of the fund (S), while the illiquidity of its <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> in the market in which these are traded affects only the fund net asset value (NAV). In an integrated market, illiquidity in one market can easily spill over to another and affect both the fund share price and its <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> value. It follows that the closed-end country fund premium, P[reverse not equivalent]ln(S) -ln(NAV), is negatively (positively) affected by the fund (<b>underlying</b> <b>asset)</b> illiquidity in segmented capital markets, but has only an ambiguous association with either fund or <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> illiquidity in an integrated market. Empirical evidence for the 8 / 1987 to 12 / 2001 period from U. S. -traded single-country closed-end funds shows that the fund premium has a negative (positive) association with the fund (<b>underlying</b> <b>asset)</b> illiquidity, and the relation is much stronger for funds investing in segmented markets.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} welfare {{properties}} of derivative securities that profit-maximizing issuers offer to investors who have inferior information and neglect the information {{content of the}} offer. To capture the markets for structured securities and exotic exchange-traded funds, we assume that issuers can choose both the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> and {{the form of the}} security. An issuer's optimal security induces investors to bet on unlikely market movements, creating both excess risk taking and undersaving. Giving more information to the issuer leads it to choose an <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> on which its information is more extreme, exacerbating both effects and hence lowering social welfare. Furthermore, providing inferior and noisy additional information to investors also lowers welfare because the security is then written on an <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> about which the information is misleading. If the issuer can base its security on a combination of <b>underlying</b> <b>assets,</b> it optimally creates a "custom-designed" index to maximize its informational advantage and minimize risk, minimizing investor and social welfare.
