2500|$|After graduation, Buchanan {{became a}} {{principal}} {{at a public}} high school, in the Houghton school in Detroit. In 1870, she moved to Chicago {{to pursue a career}} in journalism. Her reception by the Chicago editors was anything but favorable. Her youth and sex, they told her frankly, were against her. It was some time, therefore, before she received a position on any of the Chicago dailies. During the time when she was without regular work, she wrote continuously, sending her stories to the various papers. Her manuscripts, as a rule, were accepted but the acceptances brought her no staff position. The editors refused consistently to take a woman on their papers. The first story which she had accepted was an account of the reception at Sacred Heart Convent, where she boarded during her first years in Chicago. She took the story to the offices of the Chicago Times and <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desk of the managing editor. He picked it up, glanced at it and gave Sullivan US$5. A few days later, as she was walking down Madison Avenue, some one tapped her on the shoulder. It was the editor of the Times. “I am sorry, Miss Buchanan, that I did not read your article before I paid you. It was extremely well written and worth more than five dollars.” At that, he handed her a $10 bill. Margaret Buchanan was 20 {{years old at the time}} and bore a striking resemblance to Rosa Bonheur.|$|E

60|$|Anna {{took the}} baby and <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> {{carefully}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top shelf of the cupboard, then she hastened to bring {{a glass of water}} and a dough-nut, and set it before the half-frozen girl.|$|R

60|$|The coroner {{took the}} {{paper from the}} witness and <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, glancing at it casually. There had been innumerable portraits of the murdered man {{published}} both {{in the morning and}} the evening papers of yesterday.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} Death {{raised his hand}} and <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old man's brow. The hoary head bowed to the summons, and, with a soft sigh, the glad spirit fled to that region where {{suffering}} cannot enter.|$|R
