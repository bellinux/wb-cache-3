Currently, seismic coefficients are not provided in model building codes {{for the design of}} the <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> walls as a lateral force resisting system for seismic forces. Current design practice is to use a response modification coefficient, R, of around 4. 5. Several tests by other researchers on <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> walls showed strong energy dissipation and good lateral strength with stability after high displacements. This behavior of the <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> wall system is evidence that a higher R could possibly be used in design. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish a response modification factor for single story <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> walls based on available shear wall tests using the definition of R provided in ATC- 19. This research did not conduct testing according to the protocol and methodology of ATC- 63. This work contains a history of the development of seismic design provisions in the U. S. and the evolution of the response modification coefficient. Common log construction practices are reviewed, with reference to ICC 400 - Standard on Design and Construction of Log Structures. Using data provided by other researchers from physical testing and computer modeling of various types of <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> walls, an R of 6. 0 is proposed based on the provisions of ATC- 19. Finally, recommendations for further research to fully understand the behavior of the <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> wall system, including possible archetypes required by the methodology set forth in ATC- 63, are provided...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 In recent years, log {{structures}} {{have been}} marketed {{as an alternative}} to conventional light-frame wood structures. Log structures are constructed using round timbers (or manufactured timbers) that are stacked vertically and have interlocking corners. Thru-rods and lag screws are used to provide inter-log connections. This project was conducted to evaluate the lateral force resisting pathways that are developed by anchor bolts, thrurods and friction. An experimental study was used to investigate inter-component friction, force-displacement behavior and yield mode of sill log-foundation details. A family of finite-element models was developed to assess the force-displacement response of <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> walls without the corner connection for a set of construction variables that included foundation connectivity, aspect ratio, wall perforations, and thru-rod hole diameter. The experimental study used test specimens that represented common construction details for sill log-foundation anchorage. One detail had the sill log on the floor diaphragm and the other detail had the sill log in direct contact with the sill plate. A sinusoidal cyclic testing protocol was used to assess friction between the sill log and plywood surfaces. It was shown that a reasonable value for the coefficient of friction is 0. 4. The sill log-foundation details were tested statically and then with a fully reversedcyclic quasi-static test protocol. The force-displacement curves showed an initial stiffness, slip, and post-slip stiffness and capacity. The open shape of the hysteresis diagrams suggests that energy dissipation occurs primarily through friction rather than bolt yielding and material damage. Connection details were shown to have capacities at least 4. 8 times greater than that needed for an upper bound on design base shear as calculated following the Uniform Building Code. A finite-element model using ANSYS 6. 0 was developed for a representative unit <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> wall and a sill log-foundation assembly. The wall model was eight logs high (2438 x 2438 mm) and included foundation anchorage, friction, and thru-rods. Linear springs were used to model loglog normal contact, while nonlinear springs were used to model log-log friction and thru-rod behavior in oversized holes. The wood materials were given linear elastic, planar isotropic properties. The force-displacement behaviors of the wall model and the sill log-foundation model were verified with test data. These models were then used in a parametric study to evaluate the lateral force resistance response of a <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> wall given a range of slip force and design alternatives. It was shown that log-log friction affects the initial wall stiffness and slip force. A 50 percent loss in thru-rod tension decreases the log-log slip force by the same amount. Oversized thru-rod holes can be the source of increased lateral displacement; an increase in hole size of 13 percent can increase the wall displacement at the plate log by 31 percent. Window and door openings are accompanied by additional thru-rods, and the additional thru-rods improve wall forcedisplacement response relative to walls with minimum thru-rod hardware and no openings. This research did not address the three-dimensional system behavior that is expected to develop in a box-like structure with integral corner connections. Further research is needed to assess the role of integral corner connections in three-dimensional response to lateral loading...|$|E
40|$|Tenderness {{is one of}} {{the major}} meat quality factors that affects the intent of {{consumers}} to re-purchase beef. Both genetic and non-genetic factors affect the quantitative trait of tenderness. Among the genetic factors, polymorphisms in key genes, such as the myostatin (MSTN) and calpain 1 (CAPN 1), play important roles on tenderness. However, these genes do not explain all the genetic variation associated with tenderness. The aim of this study was to discover additional genes associated with tenderness to help integrate genetic information into beef cattle breeding programmes and meat quality assurance programmes, such as Meat Standards Australia, and produce high quality tender meat for consumers. Discovery of such genes should also aid in the understanding of mechanisms underlying tenderness. Backcross QTL mapping progeny based on crosses between two extreme Bos Taurus breeds (Limousin and Jersey) were used in the study. There were four new traits created for the QTL mapping and association studies. Two of the traits (wbld_adjusted and wbst_adjusted) were based on Warner-Bratzler (WB) shear force measurements from the M. longissimus dorsi (LD) and M. semitendinosus (ST) muscles and were derived from a multi-variate mixed model in which the environmental effects, myostatin F 94 L genotype effect, ageing day effect and the interaction effects were accounted for. The adjusted shear force traits offered a more accurate prediction for average tenderness. The other new trait was the amount of ageing per 25 days (called “ageing rate” herein) for the two muscles, calculated as the difference between natural <b>log</b> <b>shear</b> force values after 1 and 26 days ageing. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for these traits indicated there were 2 QTL (92 cM on BTA 5 and 52 cM on BTA 29) for adjusted shear force of the LD muscle, 3 QTL (96 cM on BTA 5, 36 cM on BTA 18 and 52 cM on BTA 29) for adjusted shear force of the ST muscle, 2 QTL (40 cM on BTA 4 and 0 cM on BTA 13) for ageing rate of the LD muscle and 2 QTL (48 cM on BTA 1 and 44 cM on BTA 19) for ageing rate of the ST muscle. Twelve candidate genes were selected for further study based on their physiological functions and the QTL mapping results from herein and elsewhere. Twenty DNA variants in these candidate genes were chosen for the association studies. The analyses were conducted with and without three known tenderness related gene variants (MSTN F 94 L, CAPN 1 -SNP 316 and CAPN 1 -SNP 530). Variants in the candidate genes were discovered to be significantly associated with traits related to tenderness, most of which were muscle specific effects. Of note, the effects of CAPN 1 -SNP 316 were muscle specific. The heterozygous genotype (GC) of CAPN 1 -SNP 316 had the opposite effect on LD and ST muscles in that the G allele was dominant for the LD but recessive for the ST. Another variant of large effect, MYO 1 G-SNP 2 (myosin 1 G), showed an effect on ageing rate of the LD muscle but not the ST muscle. Importantly, however, the interactions between gene variants frequently explained more of the genetic variation than the individual variants. For example, the interaction between the candidate gene variant SNIP 1 -SNP 3 (Smad nuclear interacting protein 1) and the CAPN 1 -SNP 316 explained more of the variation in the adjusted shear force of the ST muscle than CAPN 1 -SNP 316 alone (9. 5 % vs. 5. 2 %). The studies also suggest that tenderness is not always affected by the genes that change the muscle weight or collagen content (eg. insulin-like growth factor 1). In fact, the results indicate that the effect of the myostatin gene on tenderness is not caused by the increased muscle mass or collagen changes associated with the myostatin F 94 L variant. Instead, most of the effect of myostatin on tenderness may be explained by a change in the muscle fibre types which affects calpain activity. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Twenty logs taken from different stem heights {{were subjected to}} four-point bending tests. From the bending test records, we calculated stress–strain curves, which accounted for detailed <b>log</b> taper, <b>shear</b> deformation and self weight. From these curves we determined, among other parameters, the modulus of elasticity (MOE), the modulus of rupture (MOR) and the work absorbed in bending (W). No {{significant differences were found}} between species for the wood properties examined. Values of MOE, MOR and W generally decreased with stem height, with MOR in the range of 43 to 59 MPa and MOE ranging from 10. 6 to 15. 6 GPa. These MOE values are twice or more those reported for stems of young Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) trees. Based on the radial growth properties measured in discs from the logs, we calculated predicted values of MOE and MOR for the stem cross section. The predictions of MOE were precise, whereas those of MOR were approximate because of a complex combination of different failure mechanisms. Methods to test and calculate MOE, MOR and W for the stems of living trees are discussed with the aim of improving analyses of tree biomechanics and assessments of forest stability protection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Current {{techniques}} of estimating shallow shear velocities for assessment of earthquake site response are too costly for use at most construction sites. They require large sources {{to be effective}} in noisy urban settings or specialized independent recorders laid out in an extensive array. This work shows that microtremor noise recordings made on 200 -m-long lines of seismic refraction equipment can estimate shear velocity with 20 % accuracy, often to 100 -m depths. The combination of commonly available equipment, simple recording with no source, a wavefield transformation data processing technique, and an interactive Rayleigh-wave dispersion modeling tool exploits the most effective aspects of the microtremor, spectral analysis of surface wave (SASW) and multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) techniques. The slowness-frequency wavefield transformation is particularly effective in allowing accurate picking of Rayleigh-wave phase-velocity dispersion curves despite the presence of waves propagating across the linear array at high apparent velocities, highermode Rayleigh waves, body waves, air waves, and incoherent noise. Two locations illustrate the application of this technique in detail: coincident with a large accelerometer microtremor array in Reno, Nevada; and atop a borehole <b>logged</b> for <b>shear</b> velocity in Newhall, California. Refraction equipment could duplicate microtremor results above 3 Hz but could not estimate velocities deeper than 100 m. Refraction microtremor cannot duplicate the detail in the velocity profile yielded by a suspension logger but can match the average velocity of 10 - to 20 -m depth intervals and suggest structure below the 100 -m logged depth of the hole. Eight additional examples from southern California and New Zealand demonstrate that the refraction microtremor technique quickly produces good results {{from a wide range of}} hard and soft sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{inversion}} technique {{presented in this}} volume (Cheng, 1987) that simultaneously inverts full waveform acoustic <b>logs</b> for <b>shear</b> wave velocity (V[subscript 3]) and compressional wave attenuation (Q[subscript p]) was applied to selected full waveform acoustic logs taken in soft sediments from Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 613. Besides V[subscript 3] and Q[subscript p], {{the sensitivity of the}} inversion to perturbations in the fixed parameters, P-wave velocity (V[subscript p]), fluid velocity (V[[subscript f]), borehole diameter, bulk density (P[subscript b]), and borehole fluid attenuation (Q[subscript f]), were tested. Our study shows that the {{inversion technique}} is most sensitive to the estimate of V[subscript p] because the inversion is based on the P leaky mode energy portion of the spectrum. The Poisson's ratio, however, which primarily controls the amplitude of the waveforms, is rather stable with different estimates in V[subscript p]. The inversion technique is less sensitive to small perturbations in borehole diameter, P[subscript b], V[subscript f], and Q[subscript f] The shear wave velocities inferred from these inversions correlate well with the attendant velocity logs run at Site 613 and the diagenetic changes identified by shipboard stratigraphers. For example, there is an increase in both V[subscript p] and V[subscript 3] at the diagenetic boundary between siliceous nannofossil oozes and porcellanite.

40|$|AbstractGood {{understanding}} of mechanical properties of rock formations is essential {{during the development}} and production phases of a hydrocarbon reservoir. Conventionally, these properties are estimated from the petrophysical logs with compression and shear sonic data being the main input to the correlations. This is while {{in many cases the}} shear sonic data are not acquired during well logging, which may be for cost saving purposes. In this case, shear wave velocity is estimated using available empirical correlations or artificial intelligent methods proposed during the last few decades. In this paper, petrophysical logs corresponding to a well drilled in southern part of Iran were used to estimate the shear wave velocity using empirical correlations as well as two robust artificial intelligence methods knows as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). Although the results obtained by SVR seem to be reliable, the estimated values are not very precise and considering the importance of shear sonic data as the input into different models, this study suggests acquiring shear sonic data during well logging.

We create a linear inversion scheme to estimate shear wave anisotropy using SH, SV, and Stoneley wave velocities logged in one well.

40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} transportation projects to monitor the performance of roadways and bridges and to identify buried structures. The objective of this thesis was {{to evaluate the use}} of GPR for the identification of bridge scour and to estimate the depth of shallow rock for geotechnical site investigations. The ability to understand and predict scour at bridges is a requirement for safe, economical foundation design and is important for the development of feasible scour monitoring systems. Accurate assessment of the depth to rock is essential for designing and constructing foundations for buildings and transportation infrastructure. Misinterpretation of the depth to bedrock can dramatically increase construction costs. GPR surveys were performed at two bridge locations across shallow streams, on land at four shallow rock locations, and at three other test sites in Rhode Island. During the bridge site tests, the GPR was maneuvered in a small pontoon boat across the water surface from one river side to the other while towed from the bridge deck. The acquired two-dimensional data sets from the shallow streams accurately image the channel bottom, demonstrating that the GPR is an effective and safe tool for measuring or monitoring scour. However, infilled scour features could not be identified due to the presence of cobble armoring layers. During the bridge site tests, the GPR was maneuvered in a research vessel across the water surface from one river side to the other while operated from the bridge deck. The acquired two-dimensional data sets from the shallow streams accurately image the channel bottom, demonstrating that the GPR is an effective and safe tool for measuring or monitoring scour. However, infilled scour features could not be identified due to challenging armoring layers, which showed limitations of the GPR. During the tests on land, the GPR was placed on a survey cart and pushed along to create a linear profile. The acquired two-dimensional data sets from the shallow rock locations were compared to boring <b>logs</b> and <b>shear</b> wave velocity profiles taken previously at the sites and showed good agreement between the different estimated depths to rock.

According to the in-situ soil dry density, a given mass of dry soil passing 2  mm sieving was {{used to make a}} cylindrical specimen. In order to get a homogeneous specimen, the dry soil sample was divided into three parts to fill the cylindrical specimen tube with rubber member. After filled the all soil into the specimen tube, the cylindrical surface of each sample was covered by a rubber membrane which is sealed by rubber O-rings on the top and base of the load system. The specimens were then fully saturated. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is slowly supplied {{from the base of the}} tube to gradually replace the air within the specimen. De-aired water is then supplied to replace and absorb the CO 2 and achieve a saturated state. The specimens were confirmed to be fully saturated when the Skempton’s B value, which is called the pore-water pressure coefficient (Skempton 1954), was equal or greater than 0.95 (Head 1998). With the fully saturated specimens, three consolidated-undrained triaxial compression tests were then conducted under three differing confining stresses (50, 75 and 100 kPa). After normal consolidation, the specimens were compressed at an axial strain of 1.0  % per minute under the undrained condition.

40|$|Estimation {{of dynamic}} petrophysical {{properties}} of water-bearing sands invaded with oil-base mud from {{the interpretation of}} multiple borehole geophysical measurements Zoya Heidari 1 and Carlos Torres-Verdín 2 Nonmiscible fluid displacement without salt exchange takes place when oil-base mud (OBM) invades connate water-saturated rocks. This is a favorable condition for the estimation of dynamic petrophysical properties, including saturation-dependent capillary pressure. We developed and successfully tested a new method to estimate porosity, fluid saturation, per-meability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability of water-bearing sands invaded with OBM from multiple borehole geophysical measurements. The estimation method simulates the process of mud-filtrate invasion to calculate the correspond-ing radial distribution of water saturation. Porosity, permeabil-ity, capillary pressure, and relative permeability are iteratively adjusted in the simulation of invasion until density, photoelectric factor, neutron porosity, and apparent resistivity logs are accu-rately reproduced with numerical simulations that honor the postinvasion radial distribution of water saturation. Examples of application include oil- and gas-bearing reservoirs that exhi-bit a complete capillary fluid transition between water at the bot-tom and hydrocarbon at irreducible water saturation at the top. We show that the estimated dynamic petrophysical properties in the water-bearing portion of the reservoir are in agreement with vertical variations of water saturation above the free water-hydrocarbon contact, thereby validating our estimation method.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that pool-riffle bedforms {{play a critical role in}} channel stability and ecosystem health in many natural gravel-bed channels. Although the bedform length is known to scale with channel width, no experimental {{research has}} yet isolated the effect of bedform length on pool-riffle hydrodynamics. To improve the understanding of the hydrodynamics of these bedforms so that they can be better incorporated in restoration practices, flume experiments were conducted testing the flow at seven different bedform lengths. Velocity profiles are measured in a 17 m flume with movable PVC bedforms using ultrasonic velocity profilers (UVPs). Smooth two-dimensional (no sinuosity) bedforms are used in order to isolate the key dynamics in convective acceleration and deceleration. The angle of transition between pool and riffle heights was 7 °, so that permanent flow separation did not occur. Parameters calculated from the velocity and turbulence profiles include the Coles’ wake parameter (a measure of the deviation from the <b>log</b> law), <b>shear</b> stress estimated from the velocity profile, shear stress estimated from the Reynolds shear stress, and vertical velocity. From the individual velocity time series, the integral length scale and the integral time scales are also calculated. Overall, the length of riffles and pools exert a fundamental control on the distribution of flow and turbulence within a channel. In the pool, energy is dissipated both through turbulence and as the flow is redistributed to uniform flow conditions. In the riffle, kinetic energy increases as the flow velocity increases, and as the length increases, the flow moves towards a new uniform flow condition. The results start to explain the reasons behind the persistent scaling relation between width and bedform length. It can be concluded that uniform flow conditions exist at the end of the pool when the bedform length ratio is greater than approximately 1 : 5. 0 when the riffle length is held constant, and that uniform flow conditions are no longer observed at the end of the pool when the bedform length ratio exceeds 1 : 7. 0 when the pool length is held constant. Future research should concentrate on extending the results to include three-dimensional pool-riffle configurations, repeating bedform configurations, internal scaling parameters, and sediment transport. Ultimately, as the hydrodynamics of pool-riffle sequences are better understood, better bedform designs can be implemented in restoration projects...|$|R

The finite difference results agree excellently with the analytic solutions of a point force source in the transversely isotropic medium.

Both monopole and dipole logs agree well. The 3 -D time domain {{finite difference method}} {{is applied to the}} fluid-filled borehole wave propagation problems in the anisotropic formation. The following results are obtained: 1. In a borehole drilled along the Z axis in a phenolite formation, the monopole log shows the P wave travelling with velocity v[subscript zz]. There are no shear-pseudo-Rayleigh wave arrivals. The dipole log is dominated by the single slow flexural mode. 2. In a borehole drilled along the Y axis in a phenolite formation, the monopole log shows the P wave travelling with velocity v[subscript yy]. There are shear-pseudo-Rayleigh wave arrivals shown on the monopole seismograms between the P and Stoneley waves due to the shear wave anisotropy. The anisotropy also causes the shear wave splitting in the dipole <b>log.</b> The two <b>shear</b> wave arrivals correspond to the fast and the slow flexural modes. 3. The disagreement between the shear wave velocity from the Stoneley wave inversion and the direct <b>shear</b> wave <b>log</b> velocity from field data is beyond the errors in the measurements.

This {{study is}} aimed at developing a workflow, and ultimately a model, for quantitative interpretation of sonic and seismic data.

One of such data is the shear wave velocity which in most cases is collected with the compressional wave velocity. The measured <b>shear</b> wave velocity <b>log</b> may contain errors that are due to drilling conditions, mud invasion etc. It may also contain cycle skips and might contain a lot of missing data and information. It is because of the poor quality of this type of log that has often made well log analysis companies and log interpreters neglect the measured <b>shear</b> wave <b>log</b> and subsequently generate or create an estimated <b>shear</b> wave <b>log</b> which they use for interpretation and modelling to check how the amplitudes vary with increasing offsets, among other uses.

40|$|In seismic reservior characterization, it is {{important}} that the measured sonic log used is accurate and consistent. Due to anisotropic effects in the reservoir, which is majorly caused as a results of interbedded sequence of sand and shales, sonic <b>log</b> (compressional and <b>shear</b> wave velocities) acquired in vertical wells are different from those acquired in deviated wells. Rock physics models are created for anisotropic heterogeneous sand-shale sequence. These models are varied as a function of angle, porosity, saturation and net to gross. Variation of Thomsen anisotropic parameters and anelliptic parameters as a function of saturation and net-to-gross are investigated in order to understand the significant of anisotropy on these properties. From the rock physics modelling, anisotropic effect becomes more pronounced at high propagation angle and also the variation of the geologic parameters strongly depends on the propagation angle. Anisotropy effects decreases with increasing net-to-gross and anelliptic parameters are more sensitive to fluid saturation compared to Thomsen anisotropy parameters. A method is proposed for anisotropy correction of deviated wells using core measurement (model rock properties) of sand and shale from the study area, the inclination angle of the well and the net to gross ratio of the reservoir. The anisotropy corrected logs are then used for improved rock physics interpretation using the rock physics templates(RPT) and AVO analysis. The proposed correction is lithology dependent and the correction is significant in regions with low net-to-gross. Discrimination of lithologies and fluid saturation on the rock physics template is enhanced as a result of the anisotropy correction. The rock physics templates are constructed for different net to gross and propagation angles for varying fluid saturation in order to account for anisotropic effects. There is better separation of water sands and gas sand on the horizontal RPT(created at 72 deg) compared to vertical RPT(created at 0 deg). Vertical well, deviated well and anisotropy corrected well log data from the North Sea are superimposed on the rock-physics templates. Poor separation of lithology and saturation is observed on the RPT using the deviated well. It can be observed that the anisotropy corrected deviated well follows similar trends as the vertical well. Anisotropy effect on the reservoir properties that are accounted for using the proposed method are clearly seen on 3 D rock physics templates. AVO inversion is also performed on the horizon attribute data from study area. The inverted rock physics properties are plotted on the created rock physics models for two vertical wells from the study area. The two vertical wells show different AVO class response. The net-to-gross and porosity are different for the two wells and in general, these observations are constrained by local geology...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Nearly 60 % of bridge {{failures}} {{in the country are}} due to scour. The Hawai‘i Department of Transportation (HDOT) has a vested interest in the integrity of bridges and their foundations during heavy floods. It is known that many of the older existing bridges in Hawai‘i were not designed for scour. Therefore, it is critical to have an accurate assessment of their scour potential. In addition, it is also critical to obtain accurate scour predictions when designing new bridges. An underestimate of the scour depth could lead to potential risk of bridge failure while an overestimate can increase the cost of the new bridge construction unnecessarily. In Hawai‘i, scour calculations are traditionally performed based on the Richardson and Davis equation (1995) where the only soil parameter required is the mean particle size, D 50. Using this method for cohesive soils is known to lead to overestimated scour depths since the scour depth is inversely proportional to D 50, and cohesive soils have very small particle size. Inter-particle electrical forces exist in cohesive soils which cause cohesive soils to erode slower than granular soils. The SRICOS (Scour Rate In COhesive Soils) method accounts for the time-dependent nature of scour in silts and clays. It requires erodibility testing on soil samples using an Erosion Function Apparatus (EFA) and will generally result in smaller scour depths that can lead to savings in bridge construction. The main objectives of this research were to: (1) Obtain undisturbed soil samples from 5 water channels on the island of Oahu to perform EFA and soil testing; (2) Propose a method to define the critical shear stress and evaluate factors affecting its magnitude; (3) Develop a model to predict an EFA curve for a cohesive soil in Hawai‘i based on some common soil parameters; and (4) Examine the applicability of the Pocket Erodometer Test (PET) to Hawai‘ian cohesive soils. The main contributions from this research are summarized as follows: A cohesive soil was reconstituted in the laboratory under 4 different consolidation pressures resulting in 4 different water contents, void ratios, unit weights and consolidation stresses and then tested using the EFA. It was found that the critical shear stress increased with decreasing water content, decreasing void ratio, increasing unit weight and increasing consolidation stress. That the soils can be considered normally consolidated also suggests that the critical shear stress increases with undrained shear strength. The mathematical properties of the EFA curves for 33 cohesive soil samples were studied. Based on these curves, it was found that by plotting the <b>log</b> of the <b>shear</b> stress versus the scour rate, the curves approximate a hyperbola very closely. It is also proposed that the critical shear stress be estimated as the intercept of the hyperbola on the shear stress axis with some constraints. A model was developed to predict an EFA curve using common soil parameters and the hyperbolic model. Three parameters are needed to fully define this hyperbola. Four explanatory variables (soil parameters) are required to define the three hyperbolic model parameters. They include water content, liquid limit, plasticity index and activity, all of which are easily measured in the laboratory. Use of this model in the SRICOS EFA method to estimate scour depth can result in less scour and in significant foundation cost savings. Scour depths at five water channel sites were estimated using HEC- 18 and the SRICOS EFA method. It was found that the SRICOS method always resulted in lower scour depths than HEC- 18. The PET was used to derive the erosion categories for 33 cohesive soil samples from the five water channel locations and then compared to those from the EFA. It was found that the current PET erosion criterion that separates the medium and high erodibility categories should be increased from 15 to 28 mm to increase the reliability of the method. With this revised criterion, the reliability of the PET for Hawai‘i soils and for soils that were used to develop this criterion improved. It was also found that Briaud et al. ’s (2012) erodibility criteria based on soil classification is not very reliable...|$|R
40|$|Seismic hazard and microzonation {{of cities}} enable to {{characterize}} the potential seismic areas {{that need to be}} taken into account when designing new structures or retrofitting the existing ones. Study of seismic hazard and preparation of geotechnical microzonation maps will provide an effective solution for city planning and input to earthquake resistant design of structures in an area. Seismic hazard is the study of expected earthquake ground motions at any point on the earth. Microzonation is the process of sub division of region in to number of zones based on the earthquake effects in the local scale. Seismic microzonation is the process of estimating response of soil layers under earthquake excitation and thus the variation of ground motion characteristic on the ground surface. Geotechnical site characterization and assessment of site response during earthquakes is one of the crucial phases of seismic microzonation with respect to ground shaking intensity, attenuation, amplification rating and liquefaction susceptibility. Microzonation mapping of seismic hazards can be expressed in relative or absolute terms, on an urban block-by-block scale, based on local soil conditions (such as soil types) that affect ground shaking levels or vulnerability to soil liquefaction. Such maps would provide general guidelines for integrated planning of cities and in positioning the types of new structures that are most suited to an area, along with information on the relative damage potential of the existing structures in a region. In the present study an attempt has been made {{to characterize the}} site and to study the seismic hazard analysis considering the local site effects and to develop microzonation maps for Bangalore. Seismic hazard analysis and microzonation of Bangalore is addressed in this study in three parts: In the first part, estimation of seismic hazard using seismotectonic and geological information. Second part deals about site characterization using geotechnical and shallow geophysical techniques. An area of 220 sq. km, encompassing Bangalore Municipal Corporation has been chosen as the study area in this part of the investigation. There were over 150 lakes, though most of them are dried up due to erosion and encroachments leaving only 64 at present in an area of 220 sq. km and emphasizing the need to study site effects. In the last part, local site effects are assessed by carrying out one-dimensional (1 -D) ground response analysis (using the program SHAKE 2000) using both borehole SPT data and shear wave velocity survey data within an area of 220 sq. km. Further, field experiments using microtremor studies have also been carried out (jointly with NGRI) for evaluation of predominant frequency of the soil columns. The same has been assessed using 1 -D ground response analysis and compared with microtremor results. Further, Seed and Idriss simplified approach has been adopted to evaluate the liquefaction susceptibility and liquefaction resistance assessment. Microzonation maps have been prepared for Bangalore city covering 220 sq. km area on a scale of 1 : 20000. Deterministic Seismic Hazard Analysis (DSHA) for Bangalore has been carried out by considering the past earthquakes, assumed subsurface fault rupture lengths and point source synthetic ground motion model. The seismic sources for region have been collected by considering seismotectonic atlas map of India and lineaments identified from satellite remote sensing images. Analysis of lineaments and faults help in understanding the regional seismotectonic activity of the area. Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) has been determined by considering the regional seismotectonic activity in about 350 km radius around Bangalore. Earthquake data are collected from United State Geological Survey (USGS), Indian Metrological Department (IMD), New Delhi; Geological Survey of India (GSI) and Amateur Seismic Centre (ASC), National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI),Hyderabad; Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS), Akkulam, Kerala; Gauribindanur (GB) Seismic station and other public domain sites. Source magnitude for each source is chosen from the maximum reported past earthquake close to that source and shortest distance from each source to Bangalore is arrived from the newly prepared seismotectonic map of the area. Using these details, and, attenuation relation developed for southern India by Iyengar and Raghukanth (2004), the peak ground acceleration (PGA) has been estimated. A parametric study has been carried out to find fault subsurface rupture length using past earthquake data and Wells and Coppersmith (1994) relation between the subsurface lengths versus earthquake magnitudes. Further seismological model developed by Boore (1983, 2003) SMSIM program has been used to generate synthetic ground motions from vulnerable sources identified in above two methods. From the above three approaches maximum PGA of 0. 15 g was estimated for Bangalore. This value was obtained for a maximum credible earthquake (MCE) having a moment magnitude of 5. 1 from a source of Mandya-Channapatna-Bangalore lineament. Considering this lineament and MCE, a synthetic ground motion has been generated for 850 borehole locations and they are used to prepare PGA map at rock level. The past seismic data has been collected for almost 200 years from different sources such as IMD, BARC (Gauribidanur array), NGRI, CESS, ASC center, USGS, and other public domain data. The seismic data is seen to be homogenous for the last four decades irrespective of the magnitude. Seismic parameters were then evaluated using the data corresponding to the last four decades and also the mixed data (using Kijko’s analysis) for Bangalore region, which are found to be comparable with the earlier reported seismic parameters for south India. The probabilities of distance, magnitude and peak ground acceleration have been evaluated for the six most vulnerable sources using PSHA (Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis). The mean annual rate of exceedance has been calculated for all the six sources at the rock level. The cumulative probability hazard curves have been generated at the bedrock level for peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration. The spectral acceleration calculation corresponding to a period of 1 sec and 5 % damping are evaluated. For the design of structures, uniform hazard response spectrum (UHRS) at rock level is developed for the 5 % damping corresponding to 10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) values corresponding to 10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years are comparable to the PGA values obtained in deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) and higher than Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) maps of Bhatia et. al (1997) for the Indian shield area. The 3 -D subsurface model with geotechnical data has been generated for site characterization of Bangalore. The base map of Bangalore city (220 sq. km) with several layers of information (such as Outer and Administrative boundaries, Contours, Highways, Major roads, Minor roads, Streets, Rail roads, Water bodies, Drains, Landmarks and Borehole locations) has been generated. GIS database for collating and synthesizing geotechnical data available with different sources and 3 -dimensional view of soil stratum presenting various geotechnical parameters with depth in appropriate format has been developed. In the context of prediction of reduced level of rock (called as “engineering rock depth” corresponding to about Vs > 700 m/sec) in the subsurface of Bangalore and their spatial variability evaluated using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Observed SPT ‘N’ values are corrected by applying necessary corrections, which can be used for engineering studies such as site response and liquefaction analysis. Site characterization has also been carried out using measured shear wave velocity with the help of shear wave velocity survey using MASW. MASW (Multichannel Analysis of Surface Wave) is a geophysical method, which generates a shear-wave velocity (Vs) profile (i. e., Vs versus depth) by analyzing Raleigh-type surface waves on a multichannel record. MASW system consisting of 24 channels Geode seismograph with 24 geophones of 4. 5 Hz capacity were used in this investigation. The shear wave velocity of Bangalore subsurface soil has been measured and correlation has been developed for shear wave velocity (Vs) with the standard penetration tests (SPT) corrected ‘N’ values. About 58 one-dimensional (1 -D) MASW surveys and 20 two-dimensional (2 -D) MASW surveys has been carried out with in 220 sq. km Bangalore urban area. Dispersion curves and shear velocity 1 -D and 2 -D have been evaluated using SurfSeis software. Using 1 -dimensional shear wave velocity, the average shear wave velocity of Bangalore soil has been evaluated for depths of 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 25 m and 30 m (Vs 30) depths. The sub soil classification has been carried out for local site effect evaluation based on average shear wave velocity of 30 m depth (Vs 30) of sites using NEHRP (National Earthquake Hazard Research Programme) and IBC (International Building Code) classification. Bangalore falls into site class D type of soil. Mapping clearly indicates that the depth of soil obtained from MASW is closely matching with the soil layers in the bore <b>logs.</b> The measured <b>shear</b> wave velocity at 38 locations close to SPT boreholes, which are used to generate the correlation between the shear wave velocity and corrected ‘N’ values using a power fit. Also, developed relationship between shear wave velocity and corrected ‘N’ values corresponds well with the published relationships of Japan Road Association. Bangalore city, a fast growing urban center, with low to moderate earthquake history and highly altered soil structure (due to large reclamation of land) is been the focus of this work. There were over 150 lakes, though most of them are dried up due to erosion and encroachments leaving only 64 at present in an area of 220 sq km. In the present study, an attempt has been made to assess the site response using geotechnical, geophysical data and field studies. The subsurface profiles of the study area within 220 sq. km area was represented by 170 geotechnical bore <b>logs</b> and 58 <b>shear</b> wave velocity profiles obtained by MASW survey. The data from these geotechnical and geophysical technique have been used to study the site response. These soil properties and synthetic ground motions for each borehole locations are further used to study the local site effects by conducting one-dimensional ground response analysis using the program SHAKE 2000. The response and amplification spectrum have been evaluated for each layer of borehole location. The natural period of the soil column, peak spectral acceleration and frequency at peak spectral acceleration of each borehole has been evaluated and presented as maps. Predominant frequency obtained from both methods is compared; the correlation between corrected SPT ‘N’ value and low strain shear modulus has been generated. The noise was recorded at 54 different locations in 220 sq. km area of Bangalore city using L 4 - 3 D short period sensors (CMG 3 T) equipped with digital data acquisition system. Predominant frequency obtained from ground response studies and microtremor measurement is comparable. To study the liquefaction hazard in Bangalore, the liquefaction hazard assessment has been carried out using standard penetration test (SPT) data and soil properties. Factor of Safety against liquefaction of soil layer has been evaluated based on the simplified procedure of Seed and Idriss (1971) and subsequent revisions of Seed et al (1983, 1985), Youd et al (2001) and Cetin et al (2004). Cyclic Stress Ratio (CSR) resulting from earthquake loading is calculated by considering moment magnitude of 5. 1 and amplified peak ground acceleration. Cyclic Resistant Ratio (CRR) is arrived using the corrected SPT ‘N’ values and soil properties. Factor of safety against liquefaction is calculated using stress ratios and accounting necessary magnitude scaling factor for maximum credible earthquake. A simple spread sheet was developed to carryout the calculation for each bore log. The factor of safety against liquefaction is grouped together for the purpose of classification of Bangalore (220 sq. km) area for a liquefaction hazards. Using 2 -D base map of Bangalore city, the liquefaction hazard map was prepared using AutoCAD and Arc GIS packages. The results are grouped as four groups for mapping and presented in the form of 2 -dimensional maps. Liquefaction possibilities are also assessed conducting laboratory cyclic triaxial test using undisturbed soil samples collected at few locations...|$|R
