Jagannadh approached Parvati Melton to play the female lead. She declined the offer because, at that time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>teenager</b> {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E

[...] Variety also gave high marks to the film's technical production.
