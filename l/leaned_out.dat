5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> the window to direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.|$|E
25|$|Gallagher married Patsy Kensit on 7 April 1997. However, the {{marriage}} {{got off to}} a rocky start due to various incidents reported in the tabloids. Gallagher made headlines after an incident of road rage. He allegedly <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> of his car window, grabbed a cyclist and threw him off his bike. The cyclist was not injured and Gallagher was given a caution. On 26 March 1998, Lisa Moorish bore Gallagher a daughter, Molly, who was conceived during an affair in Los Angeles in June 1997, {{just a couple of months}} after he and Kensit got married. Gallagher and Kensit's son Lennon was born on 13 September 1999. The couple divorced a year later. Gallagher's second son, Gene Gallagher, was born to Nicole Appleton on 2 July 2001.|$|E
25|$|The rioting largely {{died down}} after a heavy {{thunderstorm}} struck {{the area around}} midnight, and gunfire ended around 1 AM. Joyce Arnett, a 26-year-old African American mother of three, {{was shot in the}} head by an unidentified gunman when she <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> a window. African American man Alton Burks was shot in the hip and African American man Wallace Kelly was shot in the jaw by unidentified gunmen as well. A white man and wife, the Nopwaskis, were hit by rocks while riding a public bus and also suffered minor injuries. Another five civilians were shot (but only lightly injured), and three were injured by rocks or bottles, while 12 policemen were injured (although only slightly). Ten buildings were destroyed by fire, and 53 African Americans—most of them teenagers—were arrested.|$|E

25|$|At 1:08p.m. PDT, {{approximately}} {{seven hours}} after the rapes, Mixon's burgundy 1995 Buick sedan was pulled over by two motorcycle officers, Officer John Hege and Sergeant Mark Dunakin, for a traffic violation, in the 7400 block of MacArthur Boulevard in East Oakland, one block away from Eastmont Town Center and an Oakland Police Department substation. After collecting Mixon's driver's license, Sergeant Dunakin became suspicious that the license was fake and signaled to his partner, Officer Hege, to arrest Mixon. Mixon accessed a semiautomatic pistol, <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> of the vehicle's side window, and opened fire without warning, methodically shooting both officers twice. After the officers collapsed to the ground, {{he got out of}} the vehicle, approached them, and fired execution-style directly into their backs. He then briefly remained standing over the bodies before fleeing on foot. Those who heard the gunshots reported Mixon as having fired six shots. Neither officer was able to return fire. Mixon was last seen fleeing westward into the surrounding neighborhood on 74th Avenue southbound.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 14:30, Air America Bell 205 {{serial number}} [...] "N47004" [...] {{landed on the}} roof of the Pittman Apartment Building at 22 Gia Long Street to collect a senior Vietnamese intelligence source and his family. The Pittman Building was not an approved LZ, but when the agreed pickup point at the Lee Hotel at 6 Chien Si Circle was declared unusable, CIA Station Chief Tom Polgar asked Oren B. Harnage, Deputy Chief of the Embassy's Air Branch to change the pickup to the Pittman Building, which was the home of the Assistant Station Chief and had an elevator shaft believed capable of supporting the weight of a Huey. Harnage boarded an Air America Huey from the Embassy's rooftop heliport and flew the short distance to the Pittman Building. Harnage <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> of the Huey and helped approximately 15 evacuees board the Huey from the narrow helipad. The scene was famously captured on film by Hubert van Es.|$|E
500|$|Lambert's girth {{was then}} enormous; six men of normal size could fit {{together}} inside his waistcoat, {{and each of}} his stockings {{was the size of}} a sack. [...] His £50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. [...] Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert's advice about fighting cocks; Lambert <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> of the window and told the servant to [...] "tell the gentleman that I am a shy cock". On another occasion, he admitted into his house a Nottingham man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was [...] "by Impertinence out of Curiosity".|$|E

2500|$|In 1985 a {{distinctive}} method of exploration was invented. In a dome area [...] above the Big Room floor {{not far from}} the Bottomless Pit, a stalagmite <b>leaned</b> <b>out.</b> Using a balsa wood loop with helium-filled balloons attached, the explorers, (after several tries over several years), floated a lightweight cord up, over the target stalagmite, and back down to the ground. Then they pulled a climbing rope into position, and the explorers ascended into what they named The Spirit World. [...] A similar, smaller room was found in the main entrance corridor, and was named Balloon Ballroom in honor of this technique.|$|E
