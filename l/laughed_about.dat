She later formed her own band, the Trailblazers, which {{included}} her brother Jay Lee Webb. Lynn won a televised talent contest in Tacoma, Washington, hosted by Buck Owens, for which the prize was a wristwatch that broke 24 hours later. (Lynn later <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> it with Owens.) Lynn's performance was seen by Canadian Norm Burley of Zero Records, who co-founded the record company after hearing Loretta sing.|$|E
25|$|Viscera then {{teamed with}} Val Venis to form V–Squared. They teamed {{together}} for nearly nine months, mainly on Heat. They challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on several occasions, but never held the title. When Venis was sidelined with a legitimate injury in April 2006, Viscera returned to singles wrestling. He attempted to reconcile with Garcia, but was interrupted and attacked by Umaga during his proposal. Two weeks later, when Garcia was legitimately and accidentally knocked from the ring apron by Charlie Haas and sprained her wrist, {{the incident was}} worked into a storyline of Haas and Viscera fighting over Garcia. After Lillian declared {{she wanted to be}} just friends, Haas seemingly raked Viscera in the eye, with Viscera feigning to accidentally Samoan slam Lillian. After Viscera gave Lillian the Samoan slam, both men <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> the incident, in the process turning Viscera heel once again. The team split up when Haas reunited with Shelton Benjamin to reform The World's Greatest Tag Team.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Hitler's {{administration}} was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had [...] "demonstrated their loyalty to Germany" [...] by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: [...] "On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from {{you the right to}} teach at the University of Göttingen." [...] Several of Noether's colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked. Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that [...] "Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was {{in the midst of all}} the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace." [...] Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> it later. This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebels.|$|E

But everyone in town noticed how active she was."

2500|$|In July 2011, Osbourne {{and some}} of her fellow The Talk panelists were criticised for their conduct when {{discussing}} the story of Catherine Kieu. Osbourne described Kieu's cutting off of her husband's penis and putting it in a garbage disposal as [...] "quite fabulous", Osbourne also <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> the incident with her fellow panellists and members of the audience. Osbourne's cohost Sara Gilbert offered the counterpoint [...] "Not to be a total buzz kill, but {{it is a little bit}} sexist. If somebody cut a woman's breast off, nobody would be sitting laughing.", Osbourne replied by saying [...] "It's different". Osbourne later apologised for her behaviour, stating [...] "she was sorry she offended people" [...] and that she [...] "did not condone genital mutilation".|$|E

2500|$|Several {{weeks after}} her death, Megan Meier's parents {{were told that}} the mother of one of their daughter's friends—with whom Meier had a falling out—had created the [...] "Josh Evans" [...] account. The parent, Lori Drew, who created the fake account, {{admitted}} that she and her daughter had the password to the account, and characterized the hoax to a reporter as a [...] "joke". Initially, Drew denied knowing about the offensive messages that were sent to Meier. She told the police that the account was aimed at [...] "gaining Megan's confidence and finding out what Megan felt about her daughter and other people". The neighborhood mother who had told the Meiers that Drew had the hoax account said [...] "Lori <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> it", and said she had intended to [...] "mess with Megan".|$|E
2500|$|It is {{described}} that [...] "one month before this leave" [...] from Venezuela came Nicolás Fedreman , captain under Jorge Espira, {{governor of the}} province of Venezuela for the Germans, with news about natives from very rich lands. He brought 150 men with him. During the same period, some fifteen days later, came from Peru Sebastián de Venalcázar, captain under Francisco Pizarro, and brought 100 soldiers and the same news. The three commanders <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> their three years so close to each other. Epítome describes that Jiménez de Quesada took all of the soldiers of De Federman and half of those of De Benalcázar to refresh his troops {{and sent them to}} the settlements of the New Kingdom to populate the area. The other half of De Benalcázar's men he sent (back) to the province between the New Kingdom and Quito, called Popayán, of which De Benalcázar was governor. Federmann and some of his men accompanied De Quesada in his journey along the Magdalena River to the coast and back to Spain. Epítome reports they arrived there in November 1539, when the Spanish King was crossing France to reach Flanders.|$|E
2500|$|Green also interviewed Georgia State Prosecutor Dan Duke, whom he {{reported}} as denying having worked with Kennedy {{as closely as}} the latter had claimed. [...] "Duke agreed that Kennedy 'got inside of some [...] meetings' but openly disputed Kennedy's dramatized account of their relationship. 'None of that happened,' [...] told Green", according to Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt in their New York Times Magazine column of January 8, 2006. Peggy Bulger, on the other hand, stated that when she interviewed Duke, {{he reported}}ly found {{the way it was}} written amusing the way it was written and: [...] " [...] Duke <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> the way The Klan Unmasked was written. But he added that Kennedy 'didn't do it all, but he did plenty,' she said. In the same column, Levitt and Dubner also quote Jim Clark, a professor at the University of Central Florida and co-author of a PBS television documentary based on Green's book, as saying that [...] " [...] built a national reputation on many things that didn't happen". Jim Clark and Ben Green collaborated on the script of Freedom Never Dies: The Story of Harry T. Moore, based on Green's book and partially funded by the Freedom Forum. In a letter to Kennedy dated July 27, 1946, Georgia Governor Ellis Arnall wrote: 'You have my permission to quote me as making the following observation: Documentary evidence uncovered by Stetson Kennedy has facilitated Georgia's prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2011, TobyMac {{stated that}} a reunion tour would {{probably}} happen [...] "sooner or later". He mentioned talking with Michael and Kevin about [...] "when it should be" [...] and [...] "what it could look like." [...] Fans {{hoping for a}} reunion tour {{in the near future}} may be disappointed: [...] "Right now, I think we're really just enjoying the mountain we're climbing, each of us individually. It's never been a completely closed door. We've always sort of <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> it, smiled about it. It's timing, I guess." [...] On May 28 and 29, 2011, at the Big Church Day Out in Wiston, UK, TobyMac joined the Newsboys twice to perform [...] "Jesus Freak", and Michael sang [...] "In the Light" [...] on both days with Toby's band, Diverse City. In June 2011 Toby admitted that he thought about Kevin and Michael for every song that he writes. His song [...] "Wonderin'" [...] is about his past with Kevin and Michael in DC Talk. [...] "It's just a warm look back at DC Talk," [...] says Toby, almost wistfully. [...] "It's reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. I love what I do today, but there are times when I wonder, What if we stayed together? I've got these dreams I'm pursuing now, but are they stealing me from you?"

2500|$|On October 22, 2003, {{during his}} one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown {{traveled}} to Tibet, Daly appointed two {{members to the}} San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence. [...] Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that [...] " [...] were made by {{a person who was}} supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city." [...] Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, [...] "When you conspire and calculate what you intend to do several days before you're designated as the acting mayor, you really are venal, you really are violative of all the protocols. It's like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you <b>laughed</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a [...] "coup." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mexican author Rogelio Villareal {{has noted}} how [...] "the famous image is not venerated by all ... {{it has also}} been aged, <b>laughed</b> <b>about,</b> parodied, insulted, and {{distorted}} around the world." [...] Conservative Mark Falcoff has remarked that Guevara is [...] "a cultural icon" [...] not because of [...] "his example for poor countries" [...] but as a result of [...] "his capacity to provoke empathy among the spoiled youth of the affluent West." [...] Historian Robert Conquest, of the Hoover Institution, has referred to such [...] "empathy" [...] and adulation among the young, as the [...] "unfortunate affliction" [...] of [...] "adolescent revolutionary romanticism." [...] Sean O'Hagan of The Observer contends that the appeal to such empathy is one of superficiality, remarking that [...] "if Che hadn't been born so good-looking, he wouldn't be a mythical revolutionary." [...] In the view of Ana Menéndez, author of the novel Loving Che, the fascination with Che is not with the man, but the photograph. While herself acknowledging him as a [...] "great idealist", Menéndez believes there is a [...] "fallibility of memory", which leads many to [...] "gloss over {{the fact that he was}} also a brutal man, the head of a firing squad in the opening days of the revolution." [...] Menéndez theorizes that such unsavory aspects are glossed over in the way one glosses over someone's flaws when in love. Jazz musician Paquito D'Rivera, himself a Cuban exile who fled the island after a run-in with Guevara, has criticized the positive portrayal of Che by musicians such as Santana, by noting the strict censorship of music at the time deemed [...] "immoral" [...] and [...] "imperialist" [...] by the Cuban government. In deference to such contradictions, Patrick Symmes, author of Chasing Che: A Motorcycle Journey in Search of the Guevara Legend, has hypothesized that [...] "the more time goes by, the chicer and chicer Che gets because the less he stands for anything." [...] Barcelona museum director Ivan de la Nuez, in the 2008 documentary [...] "Chevolution" [...] describes the overall phenomena by observing that [...] "Capitalism devours everything – even its worst enemies." ...|$|E
