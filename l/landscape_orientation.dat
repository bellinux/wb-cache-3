500|$|Overall {{the game}} follows {{the format of}} the original, but it differs in a number of key respects, {{including}} a <b>landscape</b> <b>orientation</b> of the screen, that the wraparound Warp Tunnel is located at the top and bottom as opposed to the sides, the maze layout and overall color scheme. [...] Pac-Man himself features an eye and he only faces left and right, never turning to face up or down when traveling in those directions. The ghosts' eyes constantly cycle through four directions rather than being fixed in their current direction of travel. The maze contains 126 wafers, just shy of half of the arcade's 244 dots. [...] The nest from which the ghosts emerge has its entrance on its right side instead of the top, and the arcade's eight distinct and different-valued bonus items (mostly fruits) are replaced by the nondescript single-value Vitamin.|$|E
500|$|Over 300 {{games were}} {{released}} for the Game Gear, although {{at the time}} of the console's launch, there were only six software titles available. [...] Prices for game cartridges initially ranged from $24.99 to $29.99 each. [...] The casings were molded black plastic with a rounded front to aid in removal. [...] Some titles for the system included Sonic the Hedgehog, The GG Shinobi, Space Harrier, and Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse, which was considered the best game for the system by GamesRadar. [...] Later titles took advantage of the success of the Genesis, Sega's 16-bit video game console, with games released from franchises originally released on the Genesis. [...] A large part of the Game Gear's library consists of Master System ports. [...] Because of the <b>landscape</b> <b>orientation</b> of the Game Gear's screen and the similarities in hardware between the handheld console and the Master System, it was easy for developers to port Master System games to the Game Gear.|$|E

500|$|Developed {{under the}} name [...] "Project Mercury" [...] and {{designed}} based on the Master System's hardware, the Game Gear is a handheld game console.

[...] Originally retailing at JP¥19,800 in Japan, US$149.99 in North America, and GB£99.99 in Europe, the Game Gear was designed {{to compete with the}} Game Boy, which Nintendo had released in 1989. [...] Despite the similarities the Game Gear shared with the Master System, the games of the latter were not directly playable on the handheld, and were only able to be played on the handheld by the use of an accessory called the Master System Converter.

40|$|The {{idea that}} the, earth is a finite {{planet in the}} {{mathematical}} sense is commonly accepted today. In 1972, both the Club of Rome, in its report, (Meadows et al, 1972), and the first Earth summit in Stockholm expressed this idea. This amounts to all its resources including fossil energy being limited. Renewable resources, already partially tapped, will only replace a portion of this energy. This substitution {{will be difficult to}} accomplish since the level of predation of human beings on the planet is causing serious malfunctioning of the biosphere. The building sector does not escape from today’s spotlight on the environmental impacts of human activities. Buildings are major energy consumer during both construction and ‘usage, and also generate large quantities of waste. Built up structures are consumers of 40 % of the global primary energy and generator of 24 % co 2 emission. As such, criticality of buildings and their role in minimizing energy consumption and promoting sustainability of human habitat assumes importance. The options relating to building materials, building technologies, landscaping, heating and cooling system etc have already been explored. It is logical to apply the principles of energy costing to building prospects and look for ways to minimize energy consumption during their entire lifetime. Accordingly, the paper focuses on design strategies for making building highly energy efficient and sustainable in terms of site planning, macro and micro climatic conditions, <b>landscaping,</b> <b>orientation,</b> fenestration and shading and building materials. It discusses two case studies from India incorporating innovative design solutions to achieve energy efficiency...|$|R

Our results indicate that such zones exist in both L and P, and that L is faster to use than P. However, the effects are only visible when the user has not been primed with the target name.

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this project is to design and {{manufacture}} a bicycle handlebar mounted case that will house Apple’s iPhone 5 and a charging system that utilizes a charge from a generator hub in the front wheel of a bicycle. The charging system and software for this project will be developed by an Electrical Engineering Graduate student. The case and charging system must be a self-contained unit that is weather-proof and aesthetically pleasing. It must allow the user to use all {{of the features of}} the iPhone 5 under a wide range of speeds. It must be adjustable between portrait and <b>landscape</b> <b>orientations.</b> The necessary components of the case, a liner, and handlebar mount were developed, designed, sourced and prototyped to create a functioning prototype using a variety of industrial and manufacturing engineering skills. The designed components were 3 D modeled using SolidWorks Computer Aided Design software. These parts were then rapid prototyped using a Stratasys 3 D printer. A liner was made by pouring silicone into a wax mold that was machined on a Hass MiniMill. Documents were produced that would aid in the manufacture of this case as a consumer product. A cost analysis was completed that compare multiple manufacturing options for a case, one an injection molded plastic case and the other a machined aluminum case. The breakeven point for these two processes was found to be 266 units with a cost per unit of $ 73. Many things were learned though the course of this project. Skills that were learned through many courses taken at Cal Poly were applied to a real problem and then used to solve the problem. Through research and with the guidance of peers and professors I was able to take this project from an idea to a functioning prototype. I learned how to look at the bigger picture when developing ideas and products and to explore all avenues for the best solution. In the future I would obtain more feedback from potential users and peers because they often can offer advice and solutions that may have been over looked. I would recommend that this idea and product be further developed into a consumer product...|$|R

40|$|It seems {{reasonable}} to assume that pigeons use visual features in the <b>landscape</b> for <b>orientation</b> when they are homing over familiar terrain. Experimental evidence to prove or disprove this possibility is, however, difficult to obtain. Here, we link the problem with the observation that deflections of initial orientation caused by clock-shift are often smaller than predicted on a pure sun compass basis. We substantiate the hypothesis that consistently reduced deflections and increased angular scatter occur only when pigeons are released in familiar areas where a remembered pattern of landscape features can conflict with the position of the sun. Repeated releases of the same individuals under clock-shift, or elimination of non-visual navigational clues (odours), appear to strengthen the conflicting influence of familiar visual landmarks. Accelerated returns of birds allowed to preview the surrounding familiar scenery before release also support the conclusion that the visual environment is included in the homing system of pigeons. The landscape, however, not only helps home-finding, if it is familiar, but may also have a distracting influence that contributes to the great variability of initial orientation patterns...|$|R
