5|$|Hogg {{was called}} to {{the bar at the}} Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He {{frequently}} visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality proved to be a hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to resent the editors.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald was a {{classical}} <b>liberal</b> <b>in</b> the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill. He believed in individual freedom and responsibility and {{feared that the}} growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, {{the role of the}} state was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission, but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.|$|E
5|$|Though Rutherford {{supported}} Haultain's {{vision of}} non-partisan territorial administration, federally {{he was an}} avowed <b>Liberal.</b> <b>In</b> 1900, he {{was elected president of}} the Strathcona Liberal association, and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party's candidate in Alberta for the 1900 federal election. He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re-election attempt. When the new federal constituency of Strathcona was formed in advance of the 1904 election, Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination, but demurred. Peter Talbot was selected instead and, supported by Rutherford, was elected.|$|E

5|$|Cross ran as a <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> the 1925 federal {{election}} in the riding of Athabaska, and defeated Donald Ferdinand Kellner, the Progressive incumbent from Edmonton East. Stewart, who had also left provincial politics, was elected in the adjacent Edmonton West. The Liberals, under incumbent Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, won fewer seats than the Conservatives, but King decided to remain as Prime Minister anyway. As a result, Cross sat in the Canadian House of Commons throughout the King-Byng Affair. In the ensuing 1926 election, Cross was soundly defeated in a rematch with Kellner. Charles Wilson Cross {{died of a heart}} attack June 2, 1928, in Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Cross was a Liberal, {{and fast}} {{established}} himself {{was one of}} the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> the city after Frank Oliver, the owner of the Edmonton Bulletin and local Member of Parliament. Once {{the decision was made to}} create the province of Alberta, the question emerged of who would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, who was a Conservative in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as Peter Talbot, were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first Premier of Alberta, either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Winston Field {{appointed}} Van der Byl as {{a junior}} government whip, and on 16 March 1964 he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for the Information Service. Although the Van der Byl family were identified as strongly <b>liberal</b> <b>in</b> South African politics, he became identified with {{the right wing of}} the party and helped to depose Field from the premiership in early April 1964, when Field failed to persuade the British government to grant Southern Rhodesia its independence. The new Prime Minister, Ian Smith, appointed him Deputy Minister for Information. At this time, Van der Byl's chief adviser was a South African called Ivor Benson, who also served as press censor. Benson believed that an international communist conspiracy was plotting to overthrow white rule in Rhodesia.|$|E

Long interested in municipal affairs, he entered civic politics with his election to the Edmonton Town Council in 1903. After an aldermanic term that saw the inclusion of Alberta as a province in Canada, in 1905 he was elected as mayor of the newly incorporated city; during his term he would oversee many improvements and advances to the city. Retiring after one term in office and returning to his contracting firm, he would eventually leave Edmonton in 1922 for Vancouver where he would live for 10 years leading up to his death in 1932. An active community man, May also founded and oversaw many local organizations. A <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> politics, he is remembered as a progressive mayor whose policies helped the accelerate development of city of Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Politics in the Bay Area {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most <b>liberal</b> <b>in</b> California and in the United States. Since the late 1960s, the Bay Area cemented its role as the most liberal region in California politics, supporting the center left Democratic Party's candidates for U.S. President and continued to support Democratic candidates more than other regions of the state, even as California trended towards the Democratic Party over time. According to research by the Public Policy Institute of California, the Bay Area and the North Coast counties of Humboldt and Mendocino were the most consistently and strongly liberal areas in California.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{returned}} to Britain, from Quebec, {{with her husband}} on 27 October 1883, and landed at Liverpool. Queen Victoria had prepared apartments at Kensington Palace, and the couple took up official residence there. Louise retained those apartments until her death there 56 years later. Lorne resumed his political career, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885. In 1896, he won the South Manchester seat, entering parliament as a Liberal. Louise, unlike Lorne and his father, was in favour of Irish Home Rule, and disappointed when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists. Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained, and, despite the Queen's attempts to keep them under one roof, they often went their separate ways. Even when he accompanied Louise, he was not always received with favour at court, and the Prince of Wales did not take to him. Out of all the royal family, Lorne {{was the only one}} to be identified closely with a political party, having been a Gladstonian <b>liberal</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons.|$|E
