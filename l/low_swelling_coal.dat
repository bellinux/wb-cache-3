40|$|Excessive {{pressure}} generated during {{heating and}} <b>swelling</b> of <b>coals</b> in coke ovens {{is one of}} the major safety concerns for the coke and steel producers. Large pressures against coke oven walls can seriously damage the ovens and reduce their life span. In the work presented here, a laboratory scale method is used to investigate swelling pressures during slow pyrolysis of thermoplastic coals with an aim in detecting the parameters which most influence this phenomenon. One of the coals chosen for this study had dangerous swelling properties with capabilities of developing excessive pressures. Results showed significant difference in the thermal behaviour of this coal when compared with the <b>low</b> <b>swelling</b> pressure <b>coal</b> in the temperature region of contraction of the semi-coke. Both, the high and <b>low</b> <b>swelling</b> pressure <b>coals,</b> were thermally investigated using series of gas analysis and long distance microscopic techniques. Results showed similarities in the amount of gas release between the two coals, especially for lower molecular weight volatiles; however, the prime difference was in their tar evolution rates and temperatures. For this purpose, the tars were collected for both coals and their blends and further analysed using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI). Furthermore, a long distance microscopic analysis was performed on single particles under pyrolytic heating conditions revealing significant differences in the transient structural changes between both coals, which were caused by viscosity of the plastic phase and their consequent tar content...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM) production and reporting {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions from mines has spotlighted gas diffusion and gas-induced <b>swelling</b> in <b>coals.</b> Although it is generally agreed that carbon dioxide (CO 2) diffuses faster than methane (CH 4) in coal and that diffusion rates decline as the pressure is increased, there is no general agreement on the physical mechanism responsible. In this paper kinetic data for sorption-induced swelling for five Australian bituminous coals have been analysed. Gases investigated included CO 2 and CH 4, Xe and ethane. It was found that swelling rates are influenced by gas type. CH 4 swelled coal more slowly than CO 2 at the same pressures. Other swelling kinetic data showed that, of the gases investigated, xenon was the slowest, followed by ethane. CO 2 swelling {{was found to be}} the fastest overall. The swelling rate was found to depend on maceral composition, with the slower-swelling coals being vitrinite-rich. However, the swelling rate of different coals varied differently with increasing pressure: the slowest <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> showed an increase in swelling rates with an increase in system pressure, whereas the fastest <b>swelling</b> <b>coals</b> showed a decrease in the swelling rates at high pressures.

40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the steel {{industry}} in coming years will be strongly dependent upon coal. Understanding of coal behavior in current or emerging ironmaking processes will require improved understanding of coal transformation during direct injection or after carbonization. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of coke minerals on coke reactivity such that the reactivity was shown to increase with increasing contents of magnetite, pyrrhotite, and metallic iron. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} understand how coal minerals transform during carbonization particularly at higher temperatures and how mineral transformation is influenced by carbonization and heat treatment conditions and, in turn, how the transformed minerals affect reactivity. However, there is limited information available about transformation of coal minerals as a function of coal properties, carbonization and heat treatment conditions. In this study, the effect of coal mineral transformation was investigated, particularly iron-bearing minerals on coke reactivity. Effect of high heating rate on coal mineral transformations was studied in a TGA reactor. Carbonization tests were conducted in a 100 g and a 9 kg coke oven. Coal devolatilization and coke annealing were examined under controlled conditions in a horizontal tube furnace. The mineralogy of coal and coke was analyzed using XRD, QEMSCAN and FESEM/EDS. Implications of minerals transformation on coke reactivity with CO 2 was studied in a fixed bed reactor at 1173 K. The study demonstrated that total volatile yield of lump coals was not influenced by either the tested range of temperature or particle size. The devolatilization rates of coal decreased with increasing size of coal, however for coal lumps above 10 mm there appeared to be little effect of particle size. The swelling tendency of lump coals increased with increasing volatile content, particle size and heating rate. Swelling ratio based on measurements of physical dimensions of individual large coal particle or lump coal did not have any relation to the free swelling index commonly reported by the existing coking tests. The study showed that <b>low</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>coals</b> may be more vulnerable to cracking. The study showed that both the apparent reaction rates of cokes and chars made from the same coals were modified greatly under different carbonization conditions and the differences were much greater than those seen with different coal types. The micropore surface areas and the carbon structure of cokes were also significantly influenced by heating rate, soaking time and temperatures during carbonization and thermal treatment, however the initial apparent reaction rates of cokes and chars was not strongly related to either carbon crystallite height, micropore surface area of cokes and chars or rank and maceral composition of the parent coals as seen in the past for cokes. The study also demonstrated the strong influence of carbonization conditions on the transformation of coal minerals. In particular the magnitude and type of potential catalytic iron minerals mainly iron sulfide, metallic iron and iron oxide were affected by the carbonization conditions. At higher temperatures they transformed to non-catalytic iron minerals mainly silicide. The initial reactivities of cokes and chars with CO 2 increased with increasing amounts of the catalytic iron minerals present and this relationship was found to be independent of carbonization conditions as well as heat treatment temperature at total catalyst levels below 1. 0 wt%. However, at greater catalyst levels CO 2 reaction rate was less sensitive to the total amount of catalytic iron phases. The initial apparent reaction rate of cokes annealed at higher temperature (1773 K) significantly decreased due to decreased levels of catalytic iron minerals as well as increased ordering of the carbon structure. The catalytic impact of minerals on reactivity was also found to decline with progressive gasification. This study suggests that transformation of coal iron minerals to potential catalytic iron-bearing minerals in coke can be optimized by suitable selection of carbonization conditions and hence to control coke quality particularly gasification reactivity. The study demonstrates that understanding of high temperature performance of coal matter, particularly coal mineral matter is important to optimize coke quality for both current and emerging blast furnace operations. The quantitative mineralogical analysis suggests that transformation of iron-bearing minerals in coal to catalytic iron phases in coke may be optimized by controlling the heating rate and temperature during carbonization. Further understanding of the influence of coal mineral grain size and morphology on the distribution as well as the catalytic intensity of iron and calcium species in coke is required on establishing a quantitative relationship with coke quality parameters particularly reactivity...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} new approach for the direct liquefaction of coal to produce an all-distillate product slate at a sizable cost reduction over current technology. The approach integrated coal selection, pretreatment, <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> with catalyst impregnation, liquefaction, product recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. Heterofunctional solvents were the most effective in <b>swelling</b> <b>coals.</b> Also solvent blends such as isopropanol/water were more effective than pure solvents alone. Impregnating slurry catalysts simultaneously during <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> showed that better uptake was achieved with nonswelling solvent and higher impregnation temperature. Some enhancement in initial coal conversion was seen liquefying SO{sub 2 }-treated Black Thunder coal with slurry catalysts, and also when hydrogen donor liquefaction solvents were used.

In most cases, the best results were obtained when the coal was untreated and the slurry catalyst was added directly into the reactor.

In 1 % NaCl, all starches showed substantial increases in all three parameters relative to pasting in water.

40|$|AbstractThe {{permeability}} of {{the coal}} seam is the main petrophysical property controlling {{the performance of the}} ECBM operation, since it affects both the CO 2 injection and CH 4 recovery. In the present paper, <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> of intact <b>coal</b> samples is studied both under unconstrained and constrained conditions. Unconstrained swelling experiments are performed in a view cell under a static high pressure gas atmosphere, whereas gas injection experiments are carried out in a flow cell, where the sample is subjected to a given hydrostatic confinement. Both experiments are performed by using different gases, namely He, CO 2, CH 4 and N 2, and under typical coal seam conditions, i. e. at high pressure and at 45  ∘C. The results of the unconstrained coal sample showed that swelling increases monotonically with pressure up to a few percents for adsorbing gases, with CO 2 <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> more than CH 4 that swells more than N 2, whereas for helium, a non-adsorbing gas, volume changes are negligible. The results of the flow experiments were successfully described using a mathematical model consisting of mass balances accounting for gas flow and adsorption, and mechanical constitutive equations for the description of porosity and permeability changes during injection. Results showed increase in permeability with decreasing effective pressure on the sample. Moreover, when CO 2 is used a permeability reduction was observed compared to Helium, which can be explained by taking into account the effects of swelling on the flow dynamics...|$|R

In this report, <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> experiments using a visualization method in the CO 2 supercritical conditions were conducted on crushed coal samples.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} and laboratory {{studies have shown}} that <b>swelling</b> of <b>coal</b> takes place upon contact with carbon dioxide at underground pressure and temperature conditions. Understanding this swelling behavior is crucial for predicting the performance of future carbon dioxide sequestration operations in unminable coal seams conducted in association with methane production. Swelling is believed to be related to adsorption on the internal coal surface. Whereas it is well established that moisture influences the sorption capacity of coal, the influence of water on <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> is less well-defined. This paper presents the results of laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of moisture on <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> in the presence of carbon dioxide, methane and argon. Strain development of an unconfined sample of about 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm 3 at 40 °C and 8 MPa (and at other pressures) was observed in an optical cell under a microscope as a function of time. Both air dried and moisturized samples were used. Results confirmed different <b>swelling</b> behaviors of <b>coal</b> with different substances: carbon dioxide leads to higher strain than methane, while exposure to argon leads to very little swelling. The experiments on moisturized samples seem to confirm the role of moisture as a competitor to gas molecules for adsorption sites. Adsorption of water could also explain the observed swelling due to water uptake at atmospheric pressure. A re-introduction of carbon dioxide, after intermediate gas release, results in higher strains which indicate a drying effect of the carbon dioxide on the coal. The results of this study show that the role of water cannot be ignored if one wants to understand the fundamental processes that are taking place in enhanced coalbed methane operations. © 2008 Elsevier B.

In this work, the relationship between the nitrogen content and swelling index (water retention) were studied. The effects of nitrogen content and swelling index (water retention) on the tear strength and the dynamic water absorbency were investigatedThe results showed that(1) The swelling index (water retention) has a strong linear relationship with the total nitrogen content in the fabric. The higher nitrogen content, the lower the swelling index (water retention). (2) The fabric tear strength is highly correlated with the total nitrogen content or the swelling index (water retention). High nitrogen content or <b>low</b> <b>swelling</b> index (water retention), which may be resulted from the wrinkle-free treatment, causes low tear strength. (3) High nitrogen content or <b>low</b> <b>swelling</b> index (water retention) reduces the water absorption rate of the fabric and increases the contact angle when the water drop is in initial contact of the fabric. In general, the study showed that swelling index (water retention), a simple test commonly used in the industry, is as good a parameter as the nitrogen content, which is difficult to measure, for evaluating the level of wrinkle-free treatment.

40|$|EPDM (Ethylene {{propylene}} diene monomer) is one {{of synthetic}} rubber that widely used in automotive. It must be vulcanized and added by other materials before used. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of vulcanization system and the addition of carbon black (CB) to the mechanical properties and swelling characteristic of EPDM. This research used three vulcanization system, conventional vulcanization (CV), efficient vulcanization (EV) and semi-efficient vulcanization (SEV) with the variation of carbon black 50, 60, 70 phr (per hundred resin). This research showed that EV system resulted faster vulcanization time and lower delta torque than SEV and CV systems. This system also performed the highest tensile strength, elongation, and tear strength, while SEV system resulted the highest hardness. Furthermore, the conventional vulcanization system resulted the <b>lowest</b> <b>swelling</b> index...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{swelling}} and caking propensity of coals may cause operational {{problems such as}} channelling and excessive pressure build-up in combustion, gasification and specifically in fluidised-bed and fixed-bed operations. As a result, the {{swelling and}} caking characteristics of certain coals make them less suitable for use as feedstock in applications where swelling and/or caking is undesired. Therefore, various {{studies have focused on}} the manipulation of the swelling and/or caking propensity of coals, and have proven the viability of using additives to reduce the swelling and caking of powdered coal (< 500 μm). However, there is still a lack of research specifically focused on large coal particle devolatilisation behaviour, particularly swelling and caking, and the reduction thereof using additives. A comprehensive study was therefore proposed to investigate the swelling and caking behaviour of large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) of typical South African coals, and the influence of the selected additive (potassium carbonate) thereon. Three different South African coals were selected based on their Free Swelling Index (FSI) : coal TSH is a high <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> (FSI 9) from the Limpopo province, GG is a medium <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> (FSI 5. 5 - 6. 5) from the Waterberg region, and TWD is a non-swelling coal (FSI 0) from the Highveld region. Image analysis was used to semi-quantitatively describe the transient swelling and shrinkage behaviour of large coal particles (- 20 + 16 mm) during lowtemperature devolatilisation (700 °C, N 2 atmosphere, 7 K/min). X-ray computed tomography and mercury submersion were used to quantify the degree of swelling of large particles, and were compared to conventional swelling characteristics of powdered <b>coals.</b> The average <b>swelling</b> ratios obtained for TWD, GG, and TSH were respectively 1. 9, 2. 1 and 2. 5 from image analysis and 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 5 from mercury submersion. The results showed that <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> measurements such as FSI, and other conventional techniques used to describe the plastic behaviour of powdered coal, can in general not be used for the prediction of large <b>coal</b> particle <b>swelling.</b> The large <b>coal</b> particles were impregnated for 24 hours, using an excess 5. 0 M K 2 CO 3 impregnation solution. The influence of K 2 CO 3 -addition on the swelling behaviour of different coal particle sizes was compared, and results showed that the addition of K 2 CO 3 resulted in a reduction in <b>swelling</b> for powdered <b>coal</b> (- 212 μm), as well as large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm). For powdered coal, the addition of 10 wt. % K 2 CO 3 decreased the free swelling index of GG and TSH coals from 6. 5 to 0 and from 9. 0 to 4. 5, respectively. The volumetric swelling ratios (SRV) of the 20 mm particles were reduced from 3. 0 to 1. 8 for the GG coal, and from 5. 7 to 1. 4 for TSH. In contrast to the non-swelling (FSI 0) behaviour of the TWD powders, the large particles exhibited average SRV values of 1. 7, and was found not be influenced by K 2 CO 3 -impregnation. It was found that the maximum swelling coefficient, kA, was reduced from 0. 025 to 0. 015 oC- 1 for GG, and from 0. 045 to 0. 027 oC- 1 for TSH, as a results of impregnation. From the results it was concluded that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation reduces the extent of <b>swelling</b> of <b>coals</b> such as GG (medium-swelling) and TSH (high-swelling), which exhibit significant plastic deformation. Results obtained from the caking experiments indicated that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation influenced the physical behaviour of the GG coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) the most. The extent of caking of GG was largely reduced due to impregnation, while the wall thickness and porosity also decreased. The coke from the impregnated GG samples had a less fluid-like appearance compared to coke from the raw coal. Bridging neck size measurements were performed, which quantitatively showed a 25 - 50 % decrease in the caking propensity of GG particles. Coal TWD did not exhibit any caking behaviour. The K 2 CO 3 -impregnation did not influence the surface texture or porosity of the TWD char, but increased the overall brittleness of the devolatilised samples. Both the extent of caking and porosity of TSH coke were not influenced by impregnation. However, impregnation resulted in significantly less and smaller opened pores {{on the surface of the}} devolatilised samples, and also reduced the average wall thickness of the TSH coke. The overall conclusion made from this investigation is that K 2 CO 3 (using solution impregnation) can be used to significantly reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles which exhibits a moderate degree of fluidity, such as GG (Waterberg region). The results obtained during this investigation show the viability of using additive addition to reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles. Together with further development, this may be a suitable method for modifying the swelling and caking behaviour of specific coals for use in fixed-bed and fluidised-bed gasification operations.
