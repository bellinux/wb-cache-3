25|$|Before World War I, Gleizes {{had always}} been {{identified}} as a Cubist avant-garde. And during the twenties he continued to hold a prominent position, but he was no longer identified with the avant-garde since Cubism had been superseded by Dada and Surrealism. Even after historians began their attempts to analyze the vital role played by Cubism, the name of Albert Gleizes was always mentioned because of his early and important participation in the movement. Gleizes had never ceased to call himself a Cubist and theoretically a Cubist he remained. In many ways his theories were close to those developed by Mondrian, though his paintings never submitted to the discipline of primary colors and the right angle; they were not Neo-Plastic (or De Stijl) in character. In fact, his works from the late 1920s through the 1940s looked <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> that was being done, and indeed, they were rarely seen in the art world because Gleizes deliberately distanced himself from extensive participation in the Parisian scene.|$|E

In a four-and-a-half star retrospective review, Jurek said it was innovative in 1968 and still [...] "withstands the test of time better than the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album that allegedly inspired it". Giving it a five-out-of-five score, Tiny Mix Tapes said it sounded engagingly magnificent and diverse, citing it as one of the most dynamic musical fusions and [...] "one of the most unique and thought provoking musical efforts of the last several decades".|$|E

Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name [...] "Frank Black" [...] (inverting his old persona [...] "Black Francis") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in [...] "I Heard Ramona Sing", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, [...] "but {{at the same time}} it is an island, <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> he [...] did." ...|$|E

It sold over a million copies and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it Platinum on March 24, 1993. The song was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1994 Grammy Awards, but lost to Digable Planets' [...] "Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)". Steve Huey of AllMusic named it [...] "the archetypal G-funk single" [...] and added [...] "The sound, style, and performances of [...] "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" [...] were <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> on the early-'90s hip-hop scene."

He noted that the series did have faults, but praised its ambition and Lynch's [...] "gaspingly funny" [...] performance as Sue. Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker ranked the season ninth out of ten, lauding its novelty, while Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that despite its [...] "recipe for disaster" [...] premise, the show's charm and bravado were enough to engage audiences. Variety Brian Lowry was critical of the season's early episodes, highlighting acting and characterization issues, stating that the show's talent was squandered by its uneven tone and deeming Glee a one-hit-wonder. Following the mid-season finale, Lowry wrote that while the series still had problems, its musical performances and cast were enough to keep him watching, and despite its issues, [...] "TV would be poorer without Glee." [...] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail criticized the season's development, writing that while early episodes had been enjoyable, the show's success drew focus away from its characters and plot onto celebrity guest stars. Jean Bentley of MTV found the season uneven, writing that {{it began with a}} promising plot and impressive musical numbers, but became too [...] "cheesy" [...] and excessively sentimental. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal agreed that the season had definite highs and lows, but called the finale a [...] "warm embrace that – let’s face it – you just don't want to let go." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E

This {{study was designed}} to compare the effects of branding, ingredients and nutrition information on consumer liking towards a prototype of the <b>Nothing</b> <b>Else</b> healthier snack bar with the top three brands of New Zealand snack bars, and another product with a good nutrient profiling score. Sixty-four consumers were recruited to evaluate the five snack bars. Participants initially blind-rated on visual analogue scales their liking scores in relation to colour, taste, flavour, texture and overall liking. Packaging for the products was then presented alongside each of the five products and participants rated their liking scores for a second time. Participants also ranked the five products from 1 to 5 for healthiness, taste, naturalness, and purchase intent if prices were the same. In both blind and informed tests, the <b>Nothing</b> <b>Else</b> bar was the least liked snack bar among all the tested samples. However, after the packaging for the products was presented, overall <b>liking</b> of the <b>Nothing</b> <b>Else</b> bar increased by 14 % (p = 0. 023), while overall liking for the four commercial products were unchanged.

New stories had been written and submitted by Buzz Dixon and Peter David. Speculation arose that, despite Marvel clearly labeling the book as a mature readers title, Freddy Krueger's A Nightmare on Elm Street could have caused image problems for the publisher who generally catered to younger readers. In 1990, Steve Gerber told Reading For Pleasure that Marvel had canceled the book in anticipation of pressure from various anti-violence advocate groups that were actively protesting violent media in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
