40|$|Background: Proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> {{deformation}} {{and screw}} fracture is a frequently seen problem for femur interlocking nailing that affects fracture healing. We {{realized that there}} is lack of literature for the right level for the proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw.</b> We investigated the difference of <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> bending resistance between the application of screws on different proximal femoral levels. Materials and Methods: We used a total of 80 proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> for eight groups, 10 screws for each group. Three-point bending tests were performed on four types of screws in two different trochanteric levels (the lesser trochanter and 20 mm proximal). We determined the yield points at three-point bending tests that a permanent deformation started in the <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> using an axial compression testing machine. Results: The mean yield point value of 5 mm threaded <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> applied 20 mm proximal of lesser trochanter was 1022 ± 49 (range 986 – 1057) (mean ± standard deviation, 95 % confidence interval). On the other hand, the mean yield point value of {{the same type of}} <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> applied on the lesser trochanteric level was 2089 ± 249 (range 1911 – 2268).

Conclusion: According to our findings, there is twice as much difference in <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> bending resistance between these two application levels.

Study Design: Ex vivo anatomic study. Sample Population: Canine cadavers (n= 10 Greyhounds). Methods: An anatomic landmark for pin insertion was identified based on three-dimensional reconstructions of previous elbow computed tomography studies and cadaveric dissection of the medial aspect of the humeral condyle. Bilateral distal normograde IM pin and LCP placement were performed and confirmed radiographically and by disarticulation and sagittal sectioning. Results: The anatomic landmark for pin insertion was consistently identified in each specimen using the technique described. Distal normograde insertion of a 3. 5 mm IM pin was possible in Greyhound cadaveric humeri at the described location {{in conjunction with a}} 3. 5 mm LCP with fixed angle, <b>locked</b> <b>screws.</b> A monocortical <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> was required to avoid interference with the IM pin in 28 of 60 of the 3 proximal screw holes.

40|$|Nikhil Nanavati, Marcus Walker Scunthorpe General Hospital, Scunthorpe, North East Lincolnshire, UK Abstract: Locking plates {{can be used}} in a {{bridging}} mode {{to treat}} fractures by means of secondary bone healing. This requires stimulation by interfragmentary micromotion. Recent data suggest that up to 20 % of fractures fixed with locking plates may encounter suboptimal fracture healing. Three main systems have been developed to improve bone healing, thereby reducing the risks of delayed or nonunion: overdrilling the near cortex; far cortical locking (FCL) screw; and dynamic <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> (DLS). Overdrilling the near cortex offers a cheap alternative to screw technology by reducing construct stiffness; overdrilling potentially causes repetitive loading and thus has consequences postoperatively such as failure and fatigue. FCL screws reduce construct stiffness and maintain construct strength but cannot be used in dynamic compression mode and therefore, require adequate fracture reduction. DLS is a new generation of <b>locking</b> <b>screw,</b> amalgamating <b>locking</b> technology with dynamic motion with the aim of improving interfragmentary motion at the near cortex.

It has various combination of holes, the system provides more options for clinicians to use either <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> or non-locking screws. This thesis investigates and determines the best construct with special <b>locking</b> and non-locking <b>screws</b> under both axial and torsion loading. Twenty femur constructs were assembled with 2 cm osteotomy gap between femur shaft and condyle, bridged with 4. 5 mm - 10 holes condyle plates. Femurs were divided in to 4 groups according to screw types and where they were placed. All screws were tightened to 4 Nm torque with a torque meter. Axial loads of - 50 N to - 700 N and ± 5 degree rotation were applied for 50, 000 cycles. Loosening torques of screws, stiffness and displacement of constructs were measured. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on <b>locking</b> plate and <b>screws</b> based on computed tomography images and Solidworks models. Analytical simulations were run under static and limited dynamic conditions were investigated with the experimental results.

40|$|Background: Locking plates {{transmit}} load through fixed-angle <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> instead {{of relying on}} plate-to-bone compression. Therefore, <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> may induce higher stress at the screw-bone interface than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating.

Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis.

A locked plating construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct. Subsequently, the outermost <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> in <b>locked</b> plating constructs was replaced with a conventional screw to reduce stress concentrations at the plate end. Results: Compared with the conventional plating construct, the locked plating construct was 22 % weaker in bending (p = 0. 013), comparably strong in torsion (p = 0. 05), and 15 % stronger in axial compression (p = 0. 017). Substituting the <b>locked</b> end <b>screw</b> with a conventional screw increased the construct strength by 40 % in bending (p = 0. 001) but had no significant effect on construct strength under torsion (p = 0. 22) and compressive loading (p = 0. 53) compared with the locked plating construct.

However, in a 5 -year follow-up series using the same implant with 5.0 -mm peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws,</b> the baseplate failure rate was reduced to 0 % [23].

30|$|Use of a glenosphere implant {{with a more}} {{lateral center}} of {{rotation}} was met with controversy based on historical implant failures seen with earlier generation implants [14 – 21]. The first modern reverse shoulder replacement to revisit a more lateralized center of rotation utilized a central screw baseplate and four peripheral non-locked 3.5 -mm screws. Using all peripheral non-locked screws, the glenoid baseplate failure rate was 11 % [22]. With continued understanding of surgical technique and replacement of the 3.5 -mm peripheral non-locked <b>screws</b> with 5.0 -mm <b>locked</b> <b>screws,</b> the incidence of glenoid baseplate failures was reduced to 0 % in a 5 -year minimum follow-up study [33]. This clinical experience validated the mechanical study reported by Harman et al. [11] which showed how peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws</b> were superior to non-locked screws at maximizing baseplate fixation < 150 µm micromotion threshold. Surgeons have thus gained comfort using a glenoid baseplate with four peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws.</b> There are certainly cases where four peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws</b> are either not possible {{or may not be}} of optimal surgical preference. Included in these scenarios are cases where there is limited bone remaining, such that a screw would capture minimal bone or result in a prominent screw; or cases where a larger <b>locked</b> <b>screw</b> might not be optimal, creating a potential stress riser for an acromion spine fracture [34]. Additionally, there are situations when further glenoid component compression is desirable, which can only be achieved by using a non-locked screw. In these cases, the surgeon may elect to utilize a non-locked <b>screw</b> rather than a <b>locked</b> <b>screw.</b> This concept of hybrid fixation is now commonplace in fracture management using locked plates, but prior to this study had not been tested for applicability in the reverse shoulder replacement glenoid component.|$|R

An 11 -mm tibial nail with two distal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> was used. Stiffness was measured in axial and torsional loading. An analysis of variance was performed to compare results of the screw configurations for each testing mode. Results: Compressing two screws to the nail produced 22 % to 39 % greater (P # 0. 01) axial and 16 % to 29 % greater (P # 0. 03) torsional stiffness than securing neither or only one of the screws.

One proposal was to improve implant anchorage in the femoral head {{by the use of}} a helical blade. The shape of the blade leads to improved rotational stability of the femoral head and neck fragment, which is vital for reducing the risk of cut-out, and may contribute to fewer delayed unions or varus angulation in unstable pertrochanteric fractures [14, 15]. The tip of the blade allows for compaction of the bone when it is inserted, which is thought responsible for improving anchorage in femoral head [16, 17]. Another study reported that the DHS with fixed angle <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> (<b>locking</b> side plate) would reduce the risk of DHS failure and would be particularly useful in patients with osteoporotic bone or for patients with less stable fracture configurations [9]. The dynamic hip helical system (DHHS), designed by AO/ASIF, merges the concept of locking side plate, helical blade and dynamic hip screw. Several biomechanical studies have shown that helical blade has the potential to decrease the cut-out rate [14, 15], but few clinical studies have been reported.
