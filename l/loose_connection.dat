5|$|From the mid-1920s {{until his}} {{retirement}} in 1952, Crawford worked for the importers Elders and Fyffes. He played cricket and hockey for the firm until the Second World War, but kept a far lower profile than in his earlier cricketing life. He married his second wife, Hilda May Beman, in December 1925, but he never had children. He maintained a <b>loose</b> <b>connection</b> with cricket; he appeared at a birthday dinner for Pelham Warner, at a centenary celebration for the Free Foresters Cricket Club and in a radio broadcast for Jack Hobbs's 80th birthday. Crawford had a stroke in early 1962 and remained ill {{for the rest of the}} year; he died, aged 76, in a Surrey hospital on 2 May 1963.|$|E

Gilmore)—the son she gave up for adoption ten years previous—and takes him back to his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine—a place where nothing is what it seems.|$|E

25|$|The {{series has}} a <b>loose</b> <b>connection</b> with the {{continuity}} of the comic strip, though during the final year of the strip McGruder made a point to try to synchronize both. He introduced Uncle Ruckus into the strip, and the comic-strip version of Riley's hair was braided into cornrows to match the character's design in the series. During Season 1, McGruder put the strip on a 6-month hiatus beginning in March 2006. He did not return to the strip the following November, and the strip's syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate, announced that it had been cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} non-interdigitating sutures in the skull of some reptilian groups, including Dilophosaurus, has been interpreted as indicating {{the presence of a}} system of levers, driven by jaw muscles, as an aid to predation. Welles (1984) rejected this hypothesis and interpreted the potential mobility in the skull of Dilophosaurus as a sign of weakness, and argued that the <b>loose</b> <b>connection</b> of the premaxilla precluded the capture and subduing of prey. This led to the early hypothesis that Dilophosaurus scavenged off carrion, because its teeth were too weak to bring down large prey. Recently, some researchers have argued that Dilophosaurus may have been piscivorous, due to the presence of Eubrontes-sized swim tracks at some localities, as well as anatomical similarities with spinosaurids.|$|E
25|$|Although victims'-family groups {{agreed that}} names would be grouped by {{workplace}} or other affiliation, NYPD cadet Mohammad Salman Hamdani {{was not included}} with the other first responders or the other victims whose remains {{were found in the}} wreckage of the North Tower. His name appears on the memorial's panel 66 for World Trade Center victims (next to a blank space along the South Tower perimeter), with those who did not fit into the groups created by the memorial committee or who had a <b>loose</b> <b>connection</b> to the World Trade Center. Hamdani's mother, Talat, has campaigned for the Memorial to acknowledge her son as a police cadet and first responder. Hamdani received a full police-department funeral after his body was found (months after the attacks), and the street on which he lived was renamed in his honor.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{coordinating}} {{drug trafficking}} shipments, Inzunza Inzunza {{was responsible for}} stopping incursions and fighting off rival drug trafficking organizations in Sonora. In particular, the drug lord commanded his forces against the Beltrán Leyva Cartel, which was undergoing a gradual resurgence. In early 2011, Inzunza Inzunza fled the area of Mexicali and relocated in Baja California after Manuel Torres Félix (alias [...] "The Crazy One") wanted him dead for the [...] "unapproved" [...] murder of Paulo Osorio Payán (alias [...] "El Pablo"), one of his associates. From his safe house in Tijuana, Baja California, the drug lord gave orders in Mexicali. When Torres Félix {{was killed in a}} gunfight with the Mexican Army in Sinaloa on October 2012, Inzunza Inzunza returned to Mexicali to help his business partner [...] "El Checo". Inzunza Inzunza's tenure in Mexicali was disrupted in 2012 by a group known as [...] "Los Garibay", which was controlled by José Manuel Garibay Félix (alias [...] "El Manuelón" [...] and/or [...] "El Gordo"), a drug trafficker from the Sinaloa Cartel who joined forces with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) while serving prison time in Jalisco. The infighting resulted in multiple killings in Mexicali and the surrounding areas that year. On 23 February 2013, however, Mexican authorities discovered the corpse of Garibay Félix on a highway near Guadalajara, Jalisco. His body bore signs of torture and a bullet hole in the head, usual signs to distinguish common murders from killings committed by organized crime. His death caused the CJNG to break away from its <b>loose</b> <b>connection</b> with the Sinaloa Cartel and operate independently in Jalisco in efforts to fight the Sinaloans for the control of the drug market in the state.|$|E
