50|$|The most {{accurate}} power analysis tools {{are available for}} the circuit level but unfortunately, even with switch- rather than device-level modelling, tools at the circuit level have disadvantages like they are either too slow or require too much memory thus inhibiting large chip handling.

Due to these disadvantages, gate-level power estimation tools have begun to gain some acceptance where faster, probabilistic techniques have begun to gain a foothold.

50|$|Active pickups {{utilize the}} same type of {{reluctance}} sensor as a passive pickup (although features such as coil wire size and number of windings may vary from those used in a passive pickup). Active pickups require an electrical source of energy (usually one or two 9V batteries) to operate and include an electronic preamp very similar to the preamp or buffer found in most amplifiers and effects circuits. The circuitry my be as simple as a single Transistor, up to several Operational Amplifiers configured as active filters, active EQ and other sound-shaping features. The most common circuitry incorporates JFET transistor technology, with common parts such as 2N5749 and J102 transistors, and TL061 and TL071 Op Amps. These circuits can be designed to give a large range of gain for a large range of possible output power. The circuitry is virtually identical to any preamplifier or buffer found in amplifiers and effects circuits. Unlike the preamp of an amplifier circuit, the Op Amps used need to be of a <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>design</b> to optimize battery life and they are unable to utilize a Rail to Rail input power configuration due to the low battery power. This limits the dynamic range of the circuit when compared to a Rail to Rail Op Amp preamp circuit as found in most amplifiers. By adding an additional preamplifier/buffer active pickups are able to filter attenuate or boost the signal from the pickup. Any extra voltage gain added to the output signal will increase clipping and distortion in any subsequent part of the amplification chain. This additional distortion makes active pickups popular among metal and rock guitarists.|$|E
