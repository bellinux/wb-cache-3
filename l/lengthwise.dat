5|$|The Fool's Gold Loaf {{begins with}} a loaf of French white bread that is covered in two tablespoons of {{margarine}} and baked in the oven at 350F/180C until brown. One pound of sliced bacon is fried in oil until crispy and drained. The loaf is sliced <b>lengthwise,</b> hollowed out, and filled with peanut butter, grape jelly and bacon.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} {{sometimes}} grown as ornamentals. Dead stems decay {{to leave a}} hollow wooden tube with a pattern of <b>lengthwise</b> slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{consisted}} of Østgaard of Norway, Jilek of Czechoslovakia and Straumann of Switzerland. Because of {{ice on the}} in-run, a reduced speed was used during the first round. Andersen jumped 60.0meters, by far the longest jump. <b>Lengthwise,</b> Ruud and Vuilleumier were in joint second place with 57.5meters, while Burket was in fourth with 57.0meters. Thams, Kleppen and Poland's Bronisław Czech all jumped 56.5meters, but both Kleppen and Czech fell. In terms of points, the three Norwegians Andersen, Ruud and Thams were in the lead, ahead of Burket and Vuilleumier.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs <b>lengthwise</b> through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
5|$|The molars are low-crowned (brachydont), with {{relatively}} rounded (bunodont) cusps running <b>lengthwise</b> (selenodont), {{resulting in a}} condition known as bunoselenodonty. The upper molars also lack a distinctive cusp (hypocone). Gheerbrant et al. noted these features and some others are shared with the pantodonts Haplolambda and Leptolambda, but due to many differences between the two, including number of teeth, the similarities {{are thought to be}} the result of convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance <b>lengthwise</b> and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie <b>lengthwise</b> with their heads pointing {{the same direction as}} their mother. Most information known about the night shark's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil, and may not hold true {{in other parts of the}} species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins as a prelude to copulation.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided <b>lengthwise</b> into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E
5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} New World monkeys in appearance, {{although it was}} larger—possibly {{the size of a}} gibbon. Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running <b>lengthwise</b> down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental viviparity, in which the developing embryos are nourished initially by yolk, which is later supplemented by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses; the inner lining of the uterus bears a series of parallel <b>lengthwise</b> folds. The reproductive cycle for females is probably biennial, while males are capable of mating every year. Mating occurs from November to January, and the young are born the following year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The litter size ranges from 3 to 32, increasing {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved <b>lengthwise.</b> Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Elena was an {{unpredictable}} and damaging tropical cyclone that affected {{eastern and central}} portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba, and after traveling <b>lengthwise</b> across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50mi (80km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4.|$|E
5|$|The goblin shark has a distinctively {{long and}} flat snout, {{resembling}} a sword blade. The proportional {{length of the}} snout decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost {{to the end of}} the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved <b>lengthwise.</b> The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.|$|E

25|$|Fold {{the lower}} half of the stripe section <b>lengthwise</b> over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.|$|E
25|$|The entire Cape {{is roughly}} {{bisected}} <b>lengthwise</b> by U.S. Route 6, locally {{known as the}} Mid-Cape Highway and officially as the Grand Army of the Republic Highway.|$|E
25|$|The {{numbers are}} {{almost the same}} as the Roman, Etruscan, and Chuvash numerals. Numbers of {{livestock}} were carved on tally sticks and the sticks were then cut in two <b>lengthwise</b> to avoid later disputes.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{mechanical}} shrinking (sometimes {{referred to}} as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or <b>lengthwise,</b> creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal.|$|E
25|$|Further north {{the fault}} passes under the <b>lengthwise</b> midline of the {{football}} field of California Memorial Stadium at the University of California, Berkeley. Fault creep since 1923 offset the original walls at {{the north and south}} ends 13inches (33cm).|$|E
25|$|Fertilized flowers mature {{to form a}} 3–4nbsp&mm by 2.5–4nbsp&mm egg shaped, two-parted seed capsules. As {{the seed}} capsule dries out it cracks open (dehisces), {{dropping}} the seed {{on the ground or}} water surface (see the gravity and water dispersal). The black, 1-1.3nbsp&mm. long seeds are grooved <b>lengthwise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Among other lakes {{well known}} for their regular seiches is New Zealand's Lake Wakatipu, which varies its surface height at Queenstown by 20 {{centimetres}} in a 27-minute cycle. Seiches can also form in semi-enclosed seas; the North Sea often experiences a <b>lengthwise</b> seiche with {{a period of about}} 36 hours.|$|E
25|$|Chicken Kiev is {{made from}} a boned and skinned breast which is cut <b>lengthwise,</b> pounded and stuffed with butter. Western recipes usually call for garlic butter, while in Russian ones regular butter is used. Herbs (parsley and dill) {{can be added to}} the butter. In some American recipes butter is {{replaced}} by blue cheese.|$|E
25|$|Snails need hiding places, {{especially}} during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local garden center can be split in two <b>lengthwise,</b> and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.|$|E
25|$|The {{coloring}} of {{an adult}} T. domestica is typically dark orange to brown or beige (maybe even grayish), with a common characteristic of striped legs and two dull, black, longitudinal stripes on the cephalothorax. The abdomen is mottled in brown, beige, and grey and has a pattern of chevrons running <b>lengthwise</b> across the top (similar to an argyle pattern).|$|E
25|$|Greater rheas have a fluffy, tattered-looking plumage, that is gray or brown, {{with high}} {{individual}} variation, The head, neck, rump, and thighs are feathered. In general, males are darker than females. Even in the wildparticularly in Argentinaleucistic individuals (with white body plumage and blue eyes) {{as well as}} albinos occur. Hatchling greater rheas are grey with dark <b>lengthwise</b> stripes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lengthwise</b> {{partition}} {{that divides}} {{most of the}} cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third duct. This central column is called the cochlear duct. Its fluid, endolymph, also contains electrolytes and proteins, but is chemically quite different from perilymph. Whereas the perilymph is rich in sodium ions, the endolymph is rich in potassium ions, which produces an ionic, electrical potential.|$|E
25|$|The split balcony {{enables the}} conductor(s) walking {{along on the}} lower level to easily reach up and punch or {{validate}} tickets of the passengers seated on the mezzanine level. Passengers can place their tickets in clips along a <b>lengthwise</b> panel, located slightly above the conductor's head and within easy reach. The conductor can then quickly check tickets {{and move to the}} next car.|$|E
25|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a socketed tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft <b>lengthwise,</b> inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire.|$|E
25|$|With the English Reformation, the Church of England {{directed}} {{that the}} sacrament of the Holy Eucharist be celebrated at a communion table placed <b>lengthwise</b> in the chancel, with the priest standing {{on the north side}} of the table and so facing south. Turning to the east continued to be observed at certain points of the Anglican liturgy, including the praying of the Gloria Patri, Gloria in Excelsis and ecumenical creeds in that direction.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to using traditional bars or coiled wires of all-metal solder and manually applying flux {{to the parts}} being joined, much hand soldering since the mid-20th century has used flux-core solder. This is manufactured as a coiled wire of solder, {{with one or more}} continuous bodies of inorganic acid or rosin flux embedded <b>lengthwise</b> inside it. As the solder melts onto the joint, it frees the flux and releases that on it as well.|$|E
25|$|In Russia {{the first}} planned city was St. Petersburg founded in 1703 by Peter I. Being {{aware of the}} modern European {{construction}} experience which he examined in the years of his Grand Embassy to Europe, czar ordered Domenico Trezzini to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for Vasilyevsky Island was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in Amsterdam), with three <b>lengthwise</b> thoroughfares , rectangularly crossed with about 30 crosswise streets.|$|E
25|$|Splitboard: A {{snowboard}} which splits in half <b>lengthwise,</b> {{and allows}} the bindings to be quickly connected to hinges aligning them longitudinally on the board, allowing the halves of the boards to function as cross country skis. Used with removable skins {{on the base of}} the board, which easily slide forward on snow but not backwards, they allow a snowboard to easily travel into the backcountry. Once the rider is ready to descend, the board halves can simply be joined back together.|$|E
25|$|Lateral earth {{pressures}} are zero {{at the top}} of the wall and – in homogenous ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes hydrostatic pressure on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for <b>lengthwise</b> stretches of uniform height.|$|E
25|$|The insect's {{digestive}} {{system is a}} closed system, with one long enclosed coiled tube called the alimentary canal which runs <b>lengthwise</b> through the body. The alimentary canal only allows food to enter the mouth, and then gets processed as it travels toward the anus. The alimentary canal has specific sections for grinding and food storage, enzyme production, and nutrient absorption. Sphincters control the food and fluid movement between three regions. The three regions include the foregut (stomatodeum)(27,) the midgut (mesenteron)(13), and the hindgut (proctodeum)(16).|$|E
25|$|Group Q5-2 {{features}} a large block of cut limestone {{that may have}} functioned as the base for a stela. The group is also notable for a small cave underneath the principal structure. Near the cave entrance was found a large shell that had {{been cut in half}} <b>lengthwise</b> in order to serve as a scribe's inkwell, as illustrated in Maya art. Because of this inkwell, the excavators have interpreted this group as the residence of a scribe. The group has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|The main {{structure}} consists of thirteen transverse buttress-walls, pierced by three superimposed brick arches, which create twelve compartments, each 9–13 m wide. The two <b>lengthwise</b> walls are not parallel, but steadily move apart {{as they go}} north. The eastern wall features a pair of superposed corridors on its upper two levels, built inside the wall's body and lit by loopholes in the wall's façades. The basement-level compartments have no windows, but the upper levels are lit through small openings in the western wall. A spiral stairway tower connects the {{main structure}} with the two towers.|$|E
