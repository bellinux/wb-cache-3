This is {{achieved}} by <b>laminating</b> a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat {{for a period of}} time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers.|$|E

The notched strength of (0 /+ or - 45 / 90) ns and (0 / 90) ns <b>laminates</b> decreased toward asymptotic values with increasing <b>laminate</b> thickness, while that of the (0 /+ or - 45) ns <b>laminate</b> increased toward an asymptotic value with increasing <b>laminate</b> thickness. For all three <b>laminate</b> types, the notched strength decreased with increasing notch size, regardless of thickness. The fracture of the thick <b>laminates</b> was essentially uniform and self-similar with the notch. The 'universal' value of the general toughness parameter developed by Poe (1981) successfully predicts the notched strength of the thick <b>laminates...</b>|$|R
25|$|Compound cone crusher(VSC series cone crusher) can crush {{materials}} of over medium hardness. It is mainly used in mining, chemical industry, road and bridge construction, building, etc. As for VSC series cone crusher, {{there are four}} crushing cavities (coarse, medium, fine and superfine) to choose. Compared with the same type, VSC series cone crusher, whose combination of crushing frequency and eccentricity is the best, can make materials have higher comminution degree and higher yield. In addition, VSC series cone crusher’s enhanced <b>laminating</b> crushing effect on material particles makes the cubic shape of crushed materials better, which increases the selling point.|$|E
25|$|The {{shielding}} material used – wire gauze, fabric or foam – {{is designed}} {{to have a significant}} acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or <b>laminating</b> with coarser structural elements.|$|E

The distribution of these stresses in the various <b>laminates</b> {{is a function of}} the stacking sequence and ply orientation. This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the effects of hygrothermal residual stresses on the optimum design of <b>laminated</b> composites. Angle-ply <b>laminates,</b> cross-ply <b>laminates</b> and quasi-isotropic <b>laminates</b> have been considered and these <b>laminates</b> are subjected to different mechanical, thermal and hygroscopic loading conditions. Optimum <b>laminate</b> congurations have been determined by using non-linear optimization algorithms offered by the program OPTICOM. Residual stresses and strains in different layers of <b>laminates</b> are calculated using classical <b>laminate</b> theory and <b>laminate</b> strength ratios are determined by using the Tsai–Wu failure criterion. Hygrothermal effects on minimum thickness and in-plane strength of the <b>laminates</b> are then demonstrated. Analysis of the results indicates that the prediction and measurement of residual stresses are important in relation to production, design and performance of composite structures...|$|R

Fiber Metal <b>laminates,</b> FML, is a {{combination}} of metal with fiber/resin <b>laminates</b> and it is a well-known application in composite <b>laminates</b> due to its dimension stability and properties consistency. Generally, the strength of these <b>laminates</b> systems is much depends on the mechanical interlocking mechanism between the metal surface and the composite <b>laminates.</b> Therefore, surface treatment is needed to enhance the <b>laminates</b> strength. In this research, aluminum plates with different surface roughness were <b>laminated</b> with carbon-fiber/epoxy <b>laminates.</b> The strength of these hybrid systems was then characterized to study the effect of surface roughness on the interfacial strength. It shows that the higher surface roughness will result in better interfacial interaction between the metal surface and the fiber <b>laminates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>laminate</b> {{thickness}} on the interlaminar stresses in rectangular quasi-isotropic <b>laminates</b> under unifor. r. axial strain was studied. <b>Laminates</b> from 8 -ply to infinitely thick wer, analyzed. Thick <b>laminates</b> were synthesized by stacking (45 / 0 /- 45 / 90) ply groups, rather than grouping like plies. <b>Laminates</b> {{with and without}} delaminations were studied. in <b>laminates</b> without delaminations, the free-edge interlaminar normal stress distribution in the outer ply groups was insensitive to total <b>laminate</b> thickness.

Therefore, delaminations can be expected to grow more easily near the surfaces of a <b>laminate</b> than in the interior. This is consistent with experimental results reported in the literature. Also, near surface delaminations in thin <b>laminates</b> tend to have larger strain-energy release rates than corresponding near surface delaminations in thick <b>laminates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{microcracking}} {{process in}} <b>laminates</b> which have outer-ply 90 # plies (e. g. [90 m/ 0 n] s) has some important di#erences from the microcracking process in <b>laminates</b> which lack outer-ply 90 # plies (e. g. [0 n / 90 m] s). Foremost among the di#erences is the characteristic damage state. [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates</b> form antisymmetric or staggered microcracks while [0 n / 90 m] s <b>laminates</b> form symmetric microcracks. To explain observed di#erences, {{this paper presents}} a variational mechanics analysis of the stresses and the energy release rate in a [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminate</b> having staggered microcracks.

A given level of microcracking damage causes a greater amount of degradation in mechanical properties in [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates</b> than in the corresponding [0 n / 90 m] s <b>laminates.</b> 2. Although [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates</b> will initiate microcracks at lower loads, the corresponding [0 n / 90 m] s <b>laminates</b> will develop more microcracks after continued loading. 3.

40|$|A {{design system}} of {{composite}} <b>laminates</b> has been developed. The system {{is capable of}} finding solutions to commonly faced design problems of continuous <b>laminates.</b> The target <b>laminate</b> is defined with a design specification consisting of constraints and objectives that can be set for important design attributes of <b>laminates.</b> The objectives are accompanied by weighting factors that specify their importance with respect to each other. Two tools are provided for problem solving: one for <b>laminate</b> evaluation, the other for <b>laminate</b> creation. The tools are called, respectively, the <b>laminate</b> evaluation tool and the <b>laminate</b> creation tool. A design specification, a set of candidate <b>laminates,</b> and analysis option settings define a <b>laminate</b> evaluation problem. The problem is solved in two steps. Feasible <b>laminates</b> satisfying all constraints are first sought. The multiobjective design technique is then applied to determine how well these <b>laminates</b> meet the objectives. A design specification, one or several candidate plies, and analysis option settings define a <b>laminate</b> creation problem. The creation process {{is divided into two}} phases. Feasible plies are first sought and ranked by creating and evaluating a set of <b>laminates</b> representing ply performance. The design space is constrained and approximate failure analysis techniques are used to obtain a solution in decent time. As a result of the phase, the <b>laminate</b> with the best performance is initially identified for each feasible ply. An attempt to improve the <b>laminate</b> can further be made in an extended design space and with generally accepted failure analysis techniques. The thesis describes the structure of the design system and the theories used in problem solving. Two sets of <b>laminates</b> are evaluated against typical design specifications to demonstrate the performance of the <b>laminate</b> evaluation tool. The performance of the <b>laminate</b> creation tool is demonstrated by solving typical design problems. The results indicate that the developed tools are capable of finding optimal solutions in the specified design space. reviewe...|$|R

30|$|Intralaminar damage {{behavior}} {{and its effects}} on the mechanical properties of several angle-ply FRP <b>laminates</b> were investigated. CFRP and GFRP <b>laminates</b> with fiber configuration of [θ_m/σ_n]s were used in this study. In order to study the damage {{behavior and}} its effects, the <b>laminates</b> were loaded monotonically and cyclically and cracks observations were carried out. In some angle-ply <b>laminates,</b> artificial cracks method were used before the <b>laminates</b> were monotonically loaded, so that higher crack densities could be attained. From monotonic tensile tests, it can be understood that as the middle off-axis ply becomes thicker, the Young’s modulus and maximum tensile stress of the <b>laminates</b> decreases. On the other hand, the differences in off-axis orientations have marginal effects on the stiffness and strength of a <b>laminate.</b> From the cyclic loading results, for CFRP <b>laminates</b> of the same thickness, changes in the off-axis angle from 90 o to 45 o, earlier cracking initiation and observed nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves were recorded. Changes in the transverse strain, which reflect the effective Poisson’s ratio of the <b>laminate,</b> were larger in <b>laminates</b> with off-axis angle 45 o than in <b>laminates</b> with off-axis angle 90 o. For CFRP <b>laminates,</b> it can be observed that first cracks mostly formed and accumulated at free edges. Crack propagation rates in the width direction were dependent on the thickness of the middle ply. In contrast to CFRP <b>laminates,</b> cracks in GFRP <b>laminates</b> formed instantaneously propagating in the width direction. Stiffness in <b>laminates</b> with the thicker off-axis plies reduced more. The experimental data and predictions of the variational analysis are found in good agreement for the Young’s modulus of the cracked <b>laminate.</b> Based on these results, we hope that in future work, we can study <b>laminates</b> of higher practical imprtance. The comparison of both experimental result and analytical result demonstrated the ability of the approaches to accurately predict the effect of transverse cracking on the stiffness of the <b>laminates,</b> independently on their layups. Systematic analysis of residual strains due to increasing crack density will be addressed in future publications.|$|R
