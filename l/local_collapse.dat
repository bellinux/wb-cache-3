40|$|Distribution {{systems are}} {{experiencing}} outages {{due to a}} phenomenon known as <b>local</b> voltage <b>collapse.</b> <b>Local</b> voltage <b>collapse</b> is occurring in part because modern air conditioner compressor motors are much more susceptible to stalling during a voltage dip than older motors. These motors can stall in less than 3 cycles (. 05 s) when a fault, such as on the sub-transmission system, causes voltage to sag to 70 to 60 %. The reasons for this susceptibility {{are discussed in the}} report. During the <b>local</b> voltage <b>collapse,</b> voltages are depressed for a period of perhaps one or two minutes. There is a concern that these local events are interacting together over larger areas and may present a challenge to system reliability. An effective method of preventing <b>local</b> voltage <b>collapse</b> is the use of voltage regulation from Distributed Energy Resources (DER) that can supply or absorb reactive power. DER, when properly controlled, can provide a rapid correction to voltage dips and prevent motor stall. This report discusses the phenomenon and causes of <b>local</b> voltage <b>collapse</b> as well as the control methodology we have developed to counter voltage sag. The problem is growing because of the use of low inertia, high efficiency air conditioner (A/C) compressor motors and because the use of electric A/C is growing in use and becoming a larger percentage of system load. A method for local dynamic voltage regulation is discussed which uses reactive power injection or absorption from local DER. This method is independent, rapid, and will not interfere with conventional utility system voltage control. The results of simulations of this method are provided. The method has also been tested at the ORNL s Distributed Energy Communications and Control (DECC) Laboratory using our research inverter and synchronous condenser. These systems at the DECC Lab are interconnected to an actual distribution system, the ORNL distribution system, which is fed from TVA s 161 kV sub-transmission backbone. The test results are also provided and discussed. The simulations and testing show that local voltage control from DER can prevent <b>local</b> voltage <b>collapse.</b> The results also show that the control can be provided so quickly, within 0. 5 seconds, that is does not interfere with conventional utility methods...|$|R

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{supersonic}} turbulence {{can only}} prevent local gravitational collapse if the turbulence is driven on scales {{smaller than the}} local Jeans lengths in the densest regions, a very severe requirement (Paper I). Magnetic fields have been suggested to support molecular clouds either magnetostatically or via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Whereas the first mechanism would form sheet-like clouds, the second mechanism not only could exert a pressure onto the gas counteracting the gravitational forces, but {{could lead to a}} transfer of turbulent kinetic energy down to smaller spatial scales via MHD wave interactions. This turbulent magnetic cascade might provide sufficient energy at small scales to halt <b>local</b> <b>collapse.</b> We test this hypothesis with MHD simulations at resolutions up to 256 ^ 3 zones, done with ZEUS- 3 D. We first derive a resolution criterion for self-gravitating, magnetized gas: in order to prevent collapse of magnetostatically supported regions due to numerical diffusion, the minimum Jeans length must be resolved by four zones. Resolution of MHD waves increases this requirement to roughly six zones. We then find that magnetic fields cannot prevent <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> unless they provide magnetostatic support. Weaker magnetic fields do somewhat delay collapse and cause it to occur more uniformly across the supported region in comparison to the hydrodynamical case. However, they still cannot prevent <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> for much longer than a global free-fall time. Comment: 32 pages, 14 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the collapse of}} a trapped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. This is performed by numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the novel application of the Thomas-Fermi hydrodynamic equations to collapse. We observe regimes of both global collapse, where the system evolves to a highly elongated or flattened state depending on the sign of the dipolar interaction, and <b>local</b> <b>collapse,</b> which arises due to dynamically unstable phonon modes and leads to a periodic arrangement of density shells, disks or stripes. In the adiabatic regime, where ground states are followed, collapse can occur globally or locally, while in the non-adiabatic regime, where collapse is initiated suddenly, <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> commonly occurs. We analyse the dependence on the dipolar interactions and trap geometry, the length and time scales for collapse, and relate our findings to recent experiments.

40|$|Abstract. Contrary {{to other}} {{structural}} types, unreinforced masonry buildings display <b>local</b> <b>collapses</b> during strong earthquakes, {{especially in the}} case of large-hall constructions. This is also what has happened in the Oratory of San Giuseppe dei Minimi, located in the historical centre of L'Aquila (central Italy) and affected by the 2009 earthquake. The church suffered the out-of-plane response of its façade and parapet belfry. These mechanisms are studied recurring to non-linear dynamic models, calibrated with experimental data. The outcome of such analyses is in reasonable agreement with observed damages. Hence, it is possible to recommend this approach for the seismic assessment of similar buildings...|$|R

40|$|A {{piecewise}} Tolman-Bondi-Lemaitre (TBL) cell-model for {{the universe}} incorporating <b>local</b> <b>collapsing</b> and expanding inhomogeneities is presented here. The cell-model {{is made up}} of TBL underdense and overdense spherical regions surrounded by an intermediate region of TBL shells embedded in an expanding universe. The cell-model generalizes the Friedmann as well as Einstein-Straus swiss-cheese models and presents a number of advantages over other models, and in particular the time evolution of the cosmological inhomogeneities is now incorporated within the scheme. Important problem of gravitational collapse of a massive dust cloud, such as a cluster of galaxies or even a massive star, in such a cosmological background is examined. It is shown that the <b>collapsing</b> <b>local</b> inhomogeneities in an expanding universe could result in either a black hole, or a naked singularity, depending {{on the nature of the}} set of initial data which consists of the matter distribution and the velocities of the collapsing shells in the cloud at the initial epoch from which the collapse commences. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{analytically}} {{investigate the}} modes of gravity-induced star formation possible in idealized finite molecular clouds where global collapse competes against both local Jeans instabilities and discontinuous edge instabilities. We examine these timescales for collapse in spheres, discs, and cylinders, with emphasis on the structure, size, and degree of internal perturbations required in order for <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> to occur before global collapse. We find that internal, <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> is more effective for the lower dimensional objects. Spheres and discs, if unsupported against global collapse, must either contain strong perturbations or must be unrealistically large in order for small density perturbations to collapse significantly faster than the entire cloud. We find, on the other hand, that filamentary geometry is the most favorable situation for the smallest perturbations to grow before global collapse overwhelms them and that filaments containing only a few Jeans masses and weak density perturbations can readily fragment. These idealized solutions are compared with simulations of star-forming regions {{in an attempt to}} delineate the role of global, local, and edge instabilities in determining the fragmentation properties of molecular clouds. The combined results are also discussed in the context of recent observations of Galactic molecular clouds. Comment: 42 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted by Ap...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of giant dense cloud complexes and of stars within them by means of SPH numerical simulations of the collision of gas streams (“inflows”) in the warm neutral medium (WNM) at moderately supersonic velocities. The collisions cause compression, cooling and turbulence generation in the gas, forming a cloud that then becomes self-gravitating and begins to collapse globally. Simultaneously, the turbulent, nonlinear density fluctuations induce fast, <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> events. The simulations show that: a) The clouds {{are not in a}} state of equilibrium. Instead, they undergo secular evolution. During {{the early stages of the}} evolution, their mass and gravitational energy Eg increase steadily, while the turbulent energy Ek reaches a plateau. b) When Eg becomes comparable to Ek, global collapse begins, causing a simultaneous increase in |Eg | and Ek that maintains a near-equipartition condition |Eg | ∼ 2 Ek. c) Longer inflow durations delay the onset of global and <b>local</b> <b>collapse,</b> by maintaining a higher turbulent velocity dispersion in the cloud over longer times. d) The star formation rate is large from the beginning, without any period of slow and accelerating star formation. e) The column densities of the local star-forming clumps are very similar to reported values of the column density required for molecule formation, suggesting that locally molecular ga...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} exact {{solution}} of the anisotropies of cosmic background radiation (CBR) from a <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> described by a spherical over-dense region embedded in a flat universe, {{with the emphasis on}} the relationship between the dipole (∆T/T) d and the quadrupole (∆T/T) q anisotropy. This result has been used to examine the kinematic quadrupole correction (∆T/T) q = (∆T/T) 2 d / 2, which is usually applied to remove the contamination of the quadrupole produced by local density inhomogeneities when finding the cosmic amplitude of the quadrupole at the surface of last scattering. We have found that the quadrupole of <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> origin cannot always be approximately described by the kinematic quadrupole. Our numerical result shows that the difference between the kinematic and local quadrupoles depends on the size and matter density in the peculiar field, and the position of the observer. For a given dipole, the local quadrupole can be different from the kinematic quadrupole by a factor as large as 3. Therefore, the kinematic quadrupole correction remains an uncertain factor in the determination of the amplitude of a cosmic quadrupole. Nevertheless, a preliminary analysis shows that this uncertainty might not dramatically change the cosmological origin of the COBE-DMR’s quadrupole, unless a huge peculiar gravitational field is assumed.

40|$|Observed {{molecular}} clouds {{often appear}} to have very low star formation efficiencies and lifetimes {{an order of magnitude}} longer than their free-fall times. Their support is attributed to the random supersonic motions observed in them. We study the support of molecular clouds against gravitational collapse by supersonic, gas dynamical turbulence using direct numerical simulation. Computations with two different algorithms are compared: a particle-based, Lagrangian method (SPH), and a grid-based, Eulerian, second-order method (ZEUS). The effects of both algorithm and resolution can be studied with this method. We find that, under typical molecular cloud conditions, global collapse can indeed be prevented, but density enhancements caused by strong shocks nevertheless become gravitationally unstable and collapse into dense cores and, presumably, stars. The occurance and efficiency of <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> decreases as the driving wave length decreases and the driving strength increases. It appears that <b>local</b> <b>collapse</b> can only be prevented entirely with unrealistically short wave length driving, but observed core formation rates can be reproduced with more realistic driving. At high collapse rates, cores are formed on short time scales in coherent structures with high efficiency, while at low collapse rates they are scattered randomly throughout the region and exhibit considerable age spread. We suggest that this naturally explains the observed distinction between isolated and clustered star formation.
