40|$|Discovering {{semantic}} {{relations between}} entities (entity linking) {{is one of}} the most important activity for both semantic web and linked data areas. Either we need <b>link</b> <b>sets</b> of instances or concepts we can rely on automatic systems only to a certain extent. As a result, an automatic linking is accompanied with a user interaction which enables to increase the quality of resulted <b>link</b> <b>sets.</b> Often, in order to reach as much quality of <b>link</b> <b>set</b> as possible the user should be a domain expert for an area of linking task. This user specifics should be considered by designers of interactive entity linking tools.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a centro-based characterization of singularities in planar multi-DOF mechanisms with arbitrary kinematic structure. A multi-DOF mechanism {{is treated as}} an assembly of several single DOF <b>link</b> <b>sets</b> and hence the terms like affected <b>link</b> <b>set,</b> active <b>link</b> <b>set</b> and active centro have been defined. Criteria for end-effector dependent and end-effector independent singularities of a closed-loop manipulator with given output link have been established in the paper in terms of centroes. Based on the relative disposition of the centroes, the singularities have been classified into five types and their physical implications have been explained. End-effector dependent singularities are shown to lie on the coupler curve of ab larger single DOF mechanism. A simple linkage transformation has been proposed {{for the study of}} manipulators with physical limits on joint motion under the general framework of close-loop manipulators. Several examples have been worked out to demonstrate the centro-based method of singularity analysi...|$|R

In this research, the physical transportation network is expanded into two coupled high-dimensional space–time networks, for passengers and vehicles.

30|$|Let us {{indicate}} {{with the}} symbol A the adjacency matrix {{of the observed}} network and with the symbol E the corresponding set of observed links: as a consequence, upon indicating with U the set of all nodes pairs, U∖E will {{be referred to as}} to the <b>set</b> of non-existent <b>links.</b> In order to fully control a given recipe for link-prediction, the <b>link</b> <b>set</b> is usually partitioned into a training set, ET, and a probe set, EP=E∖ET. The former is used in the “calibration” phase of a given prediction algorithm, while the latter is used for testing it: links belonging to EP are, in fact, removed, thus constituting the actual “prediction target”. We denote with |EP|≡Lmiss the cardinality of the probe set, corresponding to the number of missing links. Naturally, the adjacency matrix is partitioned as well: the portion of it corresponding to the training set will be indicated with the symbol AT. The union of the missing <b>links</b> <b>set</b> and the non-existent <b>links</b> <b>set</b> EN=EP∪ U∖E≡U∖ET will be referred to as to the <b>set</b> of non-observed <b>links.</b>|$|R
