The N and P retention in pigs decreased the longer they were kept <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> The contents of soil inorganic N and exchangeable K were significantly raised compared to the soil outside the enclosures but with no differences between treatments.

Grass cover, as determined by spectral reflectance, was not related to the experimental treatments but only to time of year. During spring and summer, grass was present in parts of the paddocks, whereas during autumn and winter the pigs kept grass cover below 10 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} associations among final weight (FW), {{average daily gain}} (ADG), scrotal circumference (SC), and visual score (VS) of beef cattle in performance tests <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> or in feedlots. Genetic parameters for FW, ADG, SC, and VS of young Nellore bulls performance-tested <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> or in feedlots were evaluated by mixed model. The performance test and final age were considered as fixed effects and additive genetic and residual effects were considered as random effects. Additive genetic and residual variances for final weight and average daily gain were smaller <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> than in feedlots. There {{was no difference between}} genetic and residual variances and heritability for scrotal circumference <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> or in feedlots. Genetic variance and heritability for visual score <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> were smaller than those in feedlots. The posterior means (and highest posterior density intervals with 90 % of samples (HPD 90) in parentheses) for heritability were 0. 46 (0. 42; 0. 50) and 0. 49 (0. 41; 0. 55) for FW, 0. 25 (0. 22; 0. 29) and 0. 25 (0. 19; 0. 30) for ADG, 0. 56 (0. 51; 0. 61) and 0. 60 (0. 51; 0. 68) for SC, and 0. 31 (0. 27; 0. 34) and 0. 42 (0. 36; 0. 48) for VS <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> or in feedlots, respectively.

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{field study}} {{was carried out}} at Badgery's Creek, New South Wales, Australia to investigate {{the ecology of the}} free-living stages of Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Results included weekly {{estimates of the number of}} infective larvae <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> arising from single applications of contaminated faeces. These were used to construct a mathematical model to predict larval availability <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> from standard meteorological measurements. The model has three components predicted from meteorological variables—p, the probability that an egg develops to infective larval stage and migrates to the herbage, E(X 1), the average time that the egg takes to develop to infective larval stage and migrate to the herbage, and E(X 2), the average lifetime of an infective larva on the herbage. The meteorological variables used to predict p were evaporation and rainfall in the first 2 days after the eggs were deposited <b>on</b> <b>pasture,</b> and the length of time until an effective fall of rain. E(X 1) was described by a function of the average temperature in the first week after eggs were deposited <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and the length of time until an effective fall of rain. E(X 2) was predicted by the rainfall and average temperature in weeks 7 – 10 after the eggs were deposited <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> A value of R 2 = 0. 39 was obtained over a set of 39 plots. The optimal value for this set of data is R 2 = 0. 76.
