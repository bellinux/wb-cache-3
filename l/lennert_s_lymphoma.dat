40|$|Background: Hodkin <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} lymphoma in western world. Despite an overall good prognosis some patients suffer relapsing tumors which are difficult to cure. Over a long period Vitamin D has been shown to be a potential treatment for cancer. Vitamin D acts via the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor, acting as an inducible transcription factor. We aimed to investigate the expression of vitamin D receptor as potential therapeutic target structure in Hodgkin <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> as well as in non Hodgkin <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Methods: We used a panel of 193 formalin fixed tissues of lymphoma cases consisting of 55 cases of Hodgkin <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and 138 cases on several non Hodgkin <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> entities. Results: Vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in Hodgkin <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> regardless of the subentity with an overall positivity of 80...|$|R
40|$|Non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is etiologically {{related to}} {{suppressed}} immune status, and certain nutrients found in {{fruits and vegetables}} {{have been associated with}} increased immune responses.

We thus examined these associations among 88, 410 women in the Nurses 2 ̆ 7 Health Study cohort who were aged 34 - 60 years in 1980 and provided dietary information in 1980. During 14 years of follow-up, we documented 199 incident cases of non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk of non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (P for trend = 0. 02); the multivariate relative risk (RR) was 0. 62 [95...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{now well}} {{established}} that Hodgkin cells are clonal B cells with a CD 30 and CD 15 phenotype. However, on immunohistochemistry, {{in our experience}} {{and the experience of}} others, CD 20 positivity in an otherwise typical classical Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Lymphoma</b> is not uncommon and if associated with CD 15 negativity poses a potential diagnostic trap and is likely to be called B-NHL. Objective:To assess the frequency of B-cell related antigens CD 20 and CD 79 a in classical Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Lymphoma.</b> Materials And Methods: A total of 91 consecutive cases of classical Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Lymphoma</b> were analyzed for co-expression of CD 20 and CD 79 a.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of nodular sclerosis variant of Hodgkin 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (NSHL) and to analyze cytologic features that could help in subtyping a case of Hodgkin 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> into this variant.

In this retrospective analysis it was possible to revise the diagnosis in the remaining 4 cases. Of the various cytologic features analyzed, presence of numerous lacunar-type cells along with fibroblasts and collagenous material were useful pointers toward a diagnosis of nodular sclerosis variant.

40|$|Background:Fascin is an actin {{cross-linking}} protein, {{which is}} part of the cytoskeleton and involved in cell motility in several cell types. The differentiation of epithelial cells is greatly influenced by cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, which play an important role in the normal organisation and stabilisation of epithelial cells and maintain the cells in a non-migratory state. The malignant conversion of epithelial cells results from a phenotypic switch to a migratory state, which allows tumour invasion beyond the basement membrane, as well as metastasis. Such a switch requires complex rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and is governed by multiple actin-binding proteins including fascin. In non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue, fascin expression is highly selective and is predominantly localised in dendritic cells, while lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc are uniformly non-reactive. However, all or nearly all Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants in all types of Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> express fascin and are strongly immunoreactive for fascin. Conclusion: Lymphomas (Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s and non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s) are among the commonest malignancies seen in our practice. The Section of Histopathology at the Aga Khan University, Karachi is the largest centre for histopathology in Pakistan, a densely populated country with an estimated population of 170 million. The authors wanted to test the utility of Fascin in distinguishing between Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and morphologically closely related forms of non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> such as diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and anaplastic large cell lymphoma in difficult cases. If found useful, this antibody could help us in reaching a correct diagnosis in difficult cases and allow appropriate Patient management...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that curcumin, a natural compound isolated from rhizomes of plant Curcuma longa, induces apoptosis in several Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines expressing Bax protein (AS 283 A, KK 124, and Pa 682 PB), whereas it has no effects in cell lines with no Bax expression (BML 895 and CA 46). Our data show that curcumin treatment results in down-regulation of constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via generation of reactive oxygen species where it causes conformational changes in Bax protein leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. This leads to activation of caspase- 9, caspase- 3, and poly(ADP) -ribose polymerase cleavage leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, curcumin treatment of Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines also causes up-regulation of DR 5; however, this up-regulation does not result in apoptosis. Importantly, cotreatment with curcumin and TRAIL induces apoptosis in Bax-deficient cell lines. Taken together, {{our findings suggest that}} curcumin is able to induce apoptosis in Bax-positive cell lines, whereas combinations with TRAIL result in apoptosis in Bax-negative cell lines. These findings also raise the possibility that incorporation of curcumin in treatment regimens may provide a novel approach for the treatment of Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and provide the molecular basis for such future translational efforts...|$|R

The {{mechanisms}} of systemic immunosuppression in B-cell non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (NHL) are poorly characterized. Lin and colleagues collected blood from 40 NHL patients prior to therapy. Monocytes from NHL patients suppressed T-cell proliferation, were unresponsive to Toll-like receptor stimulation by CpG and resistant to maturing into CD 83 (+) dendritic cells. This suppression was mediated {{in part through}} arginine metabolism, as exogenous arginine supplementation reversed this, and NHL patients had elevated arginase I in their plasma. These cells had decreased HLA-DR and TNF-alpha receptor II (CD 120 b) expression compared with controls. Patients with increased ratios of CD 14 (+) HLA-DRlow/- monocytes had more advanced disease and suppressed immune functions, indicating that CD 14 (+) HLA-DRlow/- monocytes are a pivotal and profoundly effective contributor to systemic immunosuppression in NHL...|$|R
