40|$|Abstract. The <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> optical {{configuration}} of high brightness LED headlamp is designed in this paper. When we design <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>light,</b> three same optical units are overlapped to achieve sufficient luminous flux. LED optical source is arranged and packaged into a LED by using multi-chip in linear array. Each unit uses multi-ellipsoid reflector to converge light issued by multi-chip high-power LED light source, which covers partial light to form by light-dark blocking {{some of the}} light baffle to form an cut-line, the light is converged through optical lens to obtain the light-type that <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> requires.

25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall amount of <b>light</b> within the <b>low</b> <b>beam,</b> since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the}} same time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different <b>low</b> and high <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the <b>low</b> <b>beam,</b> shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the <b>low</b> <b>beam.</b> However, <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both <b>low</b> and high <b>beams.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractAdaptive driving beams (ADB) avoid glare for {{approaching}} or leading drivers {{but otherwise}} provide high <b>beam</b> <b>lighting.</b> Audi's implementation uses {{a matrix of}} LED units to deactivate individual LEDs when it detects leading or approaching vehicles. A test track study measured perceived discomfort glare by having 20 participants view and rate headlight configurations from five roadway approaches. The headlight conditions included an Audi A 8 with ADB, the A 8 with ADB deactivated (resulting in an LED <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> pattern that met European specifications), a 2013 Mazda 3 with <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> adaptive curve HID headlights, and a 2014 Dodge Durango SUV with <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> HID headlights. Five approaches included left and right gradual and sharp curves and a straight approach. Participants rated glare comfort {{on a scale from}} 1 to 9, with higher ratings indicating more acceptable glare. Glare from the Durango was rated as less comfortable (M = 6. 15) than the other three systems. The Mazda 3 (M = 6. 82) received more acceptable glare ratings than the Durango. The A 8 ADB (M = 7. 25) received more acceptable glare ratings than the Durango and the Mazda 3 but was not rated differently from the A 8 <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> LED condition (M = 7. 36). Mean and maximum illuminance measures for the approach vehicles corresponded well with subjective ratings. These findings demonstrate the promise for adaptive driving beam headlight systems, and the tested adaptive driving beam system is presently available for use in the European market. However, FMVSS 108 requires discrete high and <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> settings, which does not allow adaptive driving beam systems in the United States.

The first, more general {{objective was to}} provide background information about the maximum rise time that should be allowed for highintensity discharge headlamps. The second, more specific objective was to evaluate whether SAE’s current, rather stringent, recommendations should be relaxed or retained. To achieve these objectives, we considered several scenarios in which having early illumination is potentially of consequence. The scenarios included turning on the headlamps when starting to drive, turning on the headlamps when entering a dark tunnel, and switching between beams. New empirical data collected for this study included actual delays between turning on headlamps at night and starting to drive, and rise and falloff functions of tungsten-halogen <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> and high beams.
