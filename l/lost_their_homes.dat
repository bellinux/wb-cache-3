5|$|Following {{the storm}} in South Africa, workers {{restored}} the original {{course of the}} Umfolozi River after it had moved. Officials later purchased a new dredge to remove sediment from Lake St. Lucia, and the canal connecting the lake to the Umfolozi River was later finished. Local governments coordinated relief efforts in the country, including delivering food and providing shelter for those who <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The South African Red Cross provided food to storm victims, {{many of whom were}} beneficiaries of the food program during the extended drought. The South African government declared KwaZulu Natal as a disaster areas. The country's military provided 25helicopters to rescue flood victims and donated 3,000tents. The government later authorized $85million to fund repairing damaged rails and roads. The American government donated $100,000 to the country, mostly to purchase supplies. West Germany also donated about $231,000, mostly for the feeding program.|$|E
5|$|Locally heavy {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Tuxpan. Streets were inundated and power outages occurred, while more than 500people <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The Tuxpan River overflowed its banks at Álamo. A local Red Cross official stated {{that most of the}} town was submerged in only a few minutes. About 5,000homes were flooded by September3, forcing approximately 30,000people to flee. Additional flooding in the town resulted in about 8,000people being left homeless. In Poza Rica, downed tree trunks and trash caused water runoffs to be blocked. Mud and rocks blocked roads and dozens were rescued from house and car flooding. A number of homes built along the gullies were washed away. The Cazones River overflowed, rendering a highway connecting Tampico to Veracruz impassable. The Cotaxtla River exceeded its bank in Cotaxtla, rupturing nine oil and natural gas lines. Pemex works quickly closed the pipelines. In Mexico City, about 600people fled for shelter as rivers in the area began to swell. Ramón Aguirre Velázquez, the Head of Government of Mexico City, described the rainfall as the heaviest in 20years.|$|E

5|$|By {{about two}} days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans.|$|E
5|$|Much of the city's {{housing stock}} was damaged during the war. The {{wreckage}} was cleared {{in an attempt}} {{to improve the quality of}} dwellings after the war, though before permanent accommodation could be built, Portsmouth City Council built prefabs for those who had <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> Between 1945 and 1947, more than 700 prefab houses were constructed– some were erected over bomb sites. The first permanent houses were built away from the city centre to new developments such as Paulsgrove and Leigh Park, with construction of council estates in Paulsgrove being completed in 1953. In Leigh Park, the first housing estates were completed in 1949, though building work in the area continued until 1974. Developers still occasionally find unexploded bombs in the area, such as on the site of the destroyed Hippodrome theatre in 1984. Despite improvements made by the city council to build new accommodation, a survey made in 1955 concluded that 7000 houses in Portsmouth were unfit for human habitation. Following a controversial decision, a whole section of central Portsmouth, including Landport, Somerstown and Buckland, was demolished and replaced by council housing during the 1960s and early 1970s. The success of the project and the quality of the 70s homes are debatable.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Agnes was {{the final}} {{of a series of}} {{tropical}} cyclones to affect the Philippines that season, following June, Ike, and Warren. Agnes brought widespread damage to several provinces across the central section of the archipelago. In the Iloilo province, 230 people were killed and four others were injured. Provincewide, a total of 21homes were flattened, resulting in 1,326homeless people. Damage in the province amounted to at least $5 million. Approximately 20% of the rice crop was destroyed in Iloilo. In the Capiz province, 265people died and property damage amounted $25 million (1984 USD). Around 80% of houses in Roxas, located in Capiz, were damaged and 100people were killed. Throughout Panay Island, four hundred forty-eight fatalities were reported, at least eight people were injured, five bridges were destroyed, and thirty-five schools were demolished. A total of 4,014homes were destroyed; consequently, over 24,000people <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> Across the Philippines, 895people lost their lives due to Agnes, with 272 people listed missing and 2,526others wounded. A total of 491,968people were evacuated to shelter in 27provinces. More than 200,000homes were destroyed while 163,056other dwellings were damaged. Damage in the country totaled $90.7million, with $19.1million from crops and $56.9million from public infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, damaged {{buildings}} polluted {{rivers in}} South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000soldiers {{to assist in}} cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies {{were sent to the}} affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49million in donations (₩58billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680meals to 16,919families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60million (₩72.1billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September13, the South Korean government declared 203cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for {{a small portion of the}} overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74billion in damage and 117deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} cost {{to clean up}} debris from the two killer tornadoes was estimated at $500,000. The governor of Wilson County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance. In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads {{to make way for}} aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church. During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts. A fund was set up for the 11-year-old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado. By November17, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization out of debt were $38million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor of Wilson County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross. The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross. On November21, low-interest loans were approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2million. On November24, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of non-perishable food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S. Waters School in Goldston without notice.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{distributed}} about 4,100tons of {{food and}} 200,000litres of milk to the affected victims, by both land and air. In Veracruz, only 9helicopters were utilized to distribute food and water to isolated areas. About 948tons of medicine was also distributed. Helicopters assisted in transporting people to shelters. In Veracruz alone, 34people were rescued by boat and 1,131 by aircraft. In Puebla and Veracruz, 9,551troops were stationed to assist in relief work, utilizing 48helicopters, 4Hercules planes, and 10boats. Between Veracruz and Hidalgo, the Department of Social Development distributed about 18,500mattresses and other relief items. Workers quickly made repairs to highways, and by October19, all of the 28damaged federal highways were provisionally reopened; some of the reopened highways had to undergo additional construction work. The military worked to reopen other roads. In Veracruz, the Director of the Federal Electricity Commission noted that repairs to electrical systems were difficult {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the floods. Planes flew generators into Gutiérrez Zamora, Veracruz, mainly for hospitals, and by October20, 90% of the affected areas had their power restored. President Zedillo announced on October11 that the government would begin building new houses, part of the Emergency Housing Program initiative. In Puebla, the initial stages of the program would involve rebuilding 1,200houses and moving 500houses to safer lands. The Mexican government estimated that the housing program would help 37,000families. Mexico's agricultural ministry provided assistance for farmers to replant lost crops. Through the Temporary Employment Program, the federal government temporarily hired about 1million people who <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> or farms. Students gradually returned to school after repairs were made, and by October28, over 800,000students who were affected were able to return to school, including all of Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The area in Teziutlán, Puebla affected by the mudslide was never rebuilt, due to being labeled a high-risk area.|$|E
