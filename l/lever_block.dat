40|$|The {{study of}} tirfor and <b>lever</b> <b>block</b> {{effectiveness}} in teak felling {{was conducted at}} the Perum Perhutani (The Forest State Corporation) Unit I Central Java on June 1982 and July 1983. Both felling equipments were used cut the press down to the desired directions. The {{purpose of the study}} is to find out the effects of tirfor and <b>lever</b> <b>block</b> on log damager in felling actives. The study was carried out in a three locations with different slopes i. e. 0 - 10 % and 11 – 30 %. The result indicates that on the 11 - 30 % slope, the tirfor reduces 5. 25 % log damages compared with that of the <b>lever</b> <b>block.</b> It is concluded that in sloped areas tirfor is more efective then <b>lever</b> <b>block...</b>|$|E
50|$|The Zastava Master FLG is gas {{operated}} submachine gun based on M70 design, but also incorporates some design features found on MP5. Special {{attention has been}} given to safety and ergonomic details and to prevent accidental firing when the gun is dropped or bumped. Weapon fires from a closed, fully locked rotating bolt. An internal <b>lever</b> <b>blocks</b> the triggering mechanism if the bolt is not fully closed.|$|R
50|$|The {{detachable}} barrel {{is locked}} in place with a dowel at the receiver and a nut at the magazine tube. The barrel and chamber are chrome-coated for increased durability and corrosion protection. The chamber is sealed by rotating the sealing wedge, which locks into the port in the shank of the barrel. Its trigger mechanism is located on a detachable mounting plate. Cartridges are fed from a tubular magazine under the barrel, and shells are ejected {{from the side of}} the receiver. The forearm is located on the magazine, and is connected to the slide frame by two action bars. A <b>blocking</b> <b>lever</b> <b>blocks</b> the forearm when the hammer is cocked. A cross-bolt trigger safety prevents an accidental pull of the trigger from firing the gun.|$|R
50|$|The Walther Volkssturmgewehr VG 1 is a {{manually}} operated bolt-action rifle. It uses a simple rotating bolt, with locking {{provided by the}} two frontal lugs; the crude bolt handle engages {{a cut in the}} cast steel receiver to provide additional safety. The feed is from detachable 10-round box magazines, originally developed for the Gewehr 43 rifle. The manual safety is also very crude, and consist of a stamped steel lever pinned to the trigger guard just behind the trigger. When engaged, the safety <b>lever</b> <b>blocks</b> trigger movement. To disengage the safety the user must turn it sideways with a finger. The stock is crudely made from wood, and non-adjustable iron sights are provided for close-range shooting only. It was meant to be produced by Zbrojovka Brno in the current-day Czech Republic.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of the lock is fixed in the breech block, which consists of the ordinary main-spring acting upon a tumbler by a swivel. The tumbler and striker are made in one piece; the scear and trigger are also in one piece [...] By depressing the <b>lever</b> the breech <b>block</b> is brought down, the cartridge-case extracted and the rifle is cocked. A fresh cartridge being inserted, and the lever returned, the rifle is ready for firing.|$|R
2500|$|The pinned and riveted {{sheet metal}} {{receiver}} of the Bizon {{is derived from}} the AKS-74 and has been modified at the front end, since the gas system was omitted. The handguard is a sheet metal stamping with three rectangular ventilation slots on each side. The magazine serves as the lower handguard and the current models of the magazine are ribbed to enhance grip. The Bizon also shares the same trigger and safety mechanisms of the AK-74 rifle. The selector lever is placed {{on the right side of}} the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and in this position the <b>lever</b> physically <b>blocks</b> the bolt's integral retracting handle; the middle position (marked [...] "АВ") enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position ("ОД") will activate the semi-automatic function of the trigger. An original five-piece anti-bounce device is built into the trigger unit and this functions as a rate reducer, delaying firing until the bolt has settled entirely into battery.|$|R
40|$|New {{technique}} to measure film thickness in tribological experiments {{is presented in}} the current study. The technique is based on strain gauges circuit fixed on a <b>lever</b> of the <b>block</b> on ring (BOR) machine. Conversion of strain gauge readings was made to determine the film thickness values. For testing purposes, experiments were conducted using the new machine to investigate the wear performance of glass/polyester composites. The tests were performed against aluminium counterface at different applied loads (0. 5 N to 3 N) for 10 minutes sliding time under wet contact conditions. From the results, the new technique highly assisted to analysis the tribological results. The SEM showed different damage features...|$|R
5000|$|The Snider-Enfield used a {{new type}} of metal-cased {{cartridge}} called a Boxer cartridge after its designer. The breech block housed a diagonally downward sloping firing pin struck with a front-action lock mounted hammer. To operate the weapon, the rifleman cocked the hammer, flipped the block out of the receiver to the right by grasping the left mounted breech <b>block</b> <b>lever,</b> and then pulled the block back to extract the spent case. There was no ejector, so the firer lifted the case out or, more usually, turned the rifle upside-down to allow the case to drop out. (Perhaps even more usually, the firer then shook the weapon vigorously to dislodge hot cartridges or those fouled by dust or grime.) ...|$|R
50|$|The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech {{design with}} {{improved}} Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up {{is similar to}} the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs {{on the top of the}} barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking <b>lever,</b> firing pin <b>block,</b> and hammer safety. The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it {{is similar to the}} SIG P22X series of pistols. The double-action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low.|$|R
50|$|The Snider-Enfield Infantry rifle was {{particularly}} long at over 54 in. The breech block housed a diagonally downward-sloping firing pin which was struck with a front-action side-mounted hammer. The firer cocked the hammer, flipped the block {{out of the}} receiver with a breech <b>block</b> <b>lever,</b> and then pulled the block back to extract the spent case. There was no ejector, the case had to be pulled out, or more usually, the rifle rolled onto its back to allow the case to fall out. The Snider saw service throughout the British Empire, until it was gradually phased out of front line service in favour of the Martini-Henry, in the mid-1870s. The design continued in use with colonial troops into the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|The S&W 4006 {{features}} {{a stainless steel}} frame and slide, double action/single action handgun with 4-inch barrel, slide-mounted de-cock/safety and an 11-round staggered-column magazine. It {{was one of the}} new 3rd-generation S&W semi-autos, designed with input from famed gunsmith Wayne Novak of Parkersburg, WV. The 4006 introduced the new [...]40 S&W cartridge and featured a wraparound one-piece grip made of Xenoy versus the earlier standard 2-piece grip panels, as well as low-profile 3-dot Novak sights. A lightweight aluminum alloy-framed S&W 4003/4043 was produced that weighed 800 grams (29 ounces) and was more comfortable to carry. The 4046 model was a DAO (double-action-only) pistol in all stainless steel. The first 2 digits in the model number indicate caliber. The last digit, either a 3 or 6, indicates aluminum or stainless steel frame, respectively. Various safety features include a safety <b>lever</b> (which <b>blocked</b> the firing pin from the hammer) as well as a magazine safety (which kept the pistol from firing when no magazine was inserted). While a true double-action pistol, the firearm shares this magazine disconnect feature with Browning Hi-Power pistols: it cannot be fired without the magazine in place. This feature was developed {{to meet the needs of}} various law enforcement agencies interested in providing another level of safety for their officers.|$|R
40|$|Dominant-negative {{inhibition}} is {{a powerful}} genetic tool for the characterization of gene function in vivo, based on the specific impairment of a gene product by the coexpression of a mutant {{version of the same}} gene product. We describe the detailed characterization of two myosin constructs containing either point mutations F 487 A or F 506 G in the relay region. Dictyostelium cells transformed with F 487 A or F 506 G myosin are unable to undergo processes that require myosin II function, including fruiting-body formation, normal cytokinesis and growth in suspension. Our results show that the dominant-negative inhibition of myosin function is caused by disruption of the communication between active site and <b>lever</b> arm, which <b>blocks</b> motor activity completely, and perturbation of the communication between active site and actin-binding site, leading to an ∼ 100 -fold increase in the mutants' affinity for actin in the presence of ATP...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to wide-spread perception, {{disruptive}} innovation {{is not only}} about “stealth attacks ” on incumbent industry leaders. In fact, disruption has consistently demonstrated its potential for triggering total market growth in those industries that have been changed by it. Opportunities for capturing the benefits of disruption exist for incumbents {{as well as for}} upstarts. Disruption introduces new rules in a new playing field. It demands new sets of knowledge and appropriate organizational structures, processes and culture. Moreover, it challenges the very mindset of incumbents that have been successful in the past, but are now in danger of succumbing to that legacy. How can firms capture opportunity from disruption? The authors explore this question by examining the role of the firm’s strategic capabilities and the enabling organization (structure, processes and culture) around these in capturing opportunity from {{disruptive innovation}}. They identify appropriate <b>levers</b> and stumbling <b>blocks,</b> and derive and discuss implications for management...|$|R
25|$|Tiên Sơn cave {{is located}} in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. The cave was {{discovered}} by a local inhabitant by accident in 1935. It {{is located in}} Sơn Trach Commune in Bố Trạch. The entry mouth of Tiên Sơn is 1km from Phong Nha cave, {{at an altitude of}} 200 m. This cave is 980 m in length. A 10 m deep hole is situated 400 m from the entry mouth, then a 500 m long underground cave, dangerous for tourists and open to professional expeditionists only. Like Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years ago when a water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was <b>levered</b> or lowered, <b>blocking</b> the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a [beta]-type Stirling {{engine was}} {{designed}} and manufactured which works at relatively lower temperatures. To increase the heat transfer area, the inner surface of the displacer cylinder was augmented by means of growing spanwise slots. To perform a better approach to the theoretical Stirling cycle, the motion of displacer was governed by a <b>lever.</b> The engine <b>block</b> was used as pressurized working fluid reservoir. The escape of working fluid, through the end-pin bearing of crankshaft, was prevented by means of adapting an oil pool around the end-pin. Experimental results {{presented in this paper}} were obtained by testing the engine with air as working fluid. The hot end of the displacer cylinder was heated with a LPG flame and kept about 200 Â Â°C constant temperature throughout the testing period. The other end of the displacer cylinder was cooled with a water circulation having 27 Â Â°C temperature. Starting from ambient pressure, the engine was tested at several charge pressures up to 4. 6 bars. Maximum power output was obtained at 2. 8 bars charge pressure as 51. 93 Â W at 453 Â rpm engine speed. The maximum torque was obtained as 1. 17 Nm at 2. 8 bars charge pressure. By comparing experimental work with theoretical work calculated by nodal analysis, the convective heat transfer coefficient at working fluid side of the displacer cylinder was predicted as 447 Â W/m 2 Â K for air. At maximum shaft power, the internal thermal efficiency of the engine was predicted as 15 %. Beta type Stirling engine Hot-air engine Engine performance...|$|R
