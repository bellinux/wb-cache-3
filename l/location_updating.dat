40|$|Mobile {{commerce}} and location based services (LBS) {{are some of}} the fastest growing IT industries in the last five years. <b>Location</b> <b>update</b> of mobile clients is a fundamental capability in mobile {{commerce and}} all types of LBS. Higher update frequency leads to higher accuracy, but incurs unacceptably high cost of location management at the location servers. We propose ROADTRACK – a roadnetwork based, query-aware <b>location</b> <b>update</b> framework with two unique features. First, we introduce the concept of precincts to control the granularity of <b>location</b> <b>update</b> resolution for mobile clients that are not of interest to any active location query services. Second, we define query encounter points for mobile objects that are targets of active location query services, and utilize these encounter points to define the adequate <b>location</b> <b>update</b> schedule for each mobile. The ROADTRACK framework offers three unique advantages. First, encounter points as a fundamental query awareness mechanism enable us to control and differentiate <b>location</b> <b>update</b> strategies for mobile clients in the vicinity of active location queries, while meeting the needs of location query evaluation. Second, we employ system-defined precincts to manage the desired spatial resolution of <b>location</b> <b>updates</b> for different mobile clients and to control the scope of query awareness to be capitalized by a <b>location</b> <b>update</b> strategy. Third, our road-network based check-free interval optimization further enhances the effectiveness of the ROAD-TRACK query-aware <b>location</b> <b>update</b> scheduling algorithm. This optimization provides significant cost reduction for <b>location</b> <b>update</b> management at both mobile clients and location servers. We evaluate the ROADTRACK <b>location</b> <b>update</b> approach using a real world road-network based mobility simulator. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ROADTRACK query aware <b>location</b> <b>update</b> approach outperforms existing representative <b>location</b> <b>update</b> strategies in terms of both client energy efficiency and server processing load. 1...|$|R

30|$|Guided by the peer-tree {{indexing}} structure, the <b>location</b> <b>updates</b> and <b>location</b> queries can be propagated in {{an organized}} manner. Namely, <b>location</b> <b>updates</b> are propagated to {{a small number of}} other hosts, while location queries are forwarded to the hosts where the queries are likely answered. A <b>location</b> <b>update</b> and a <b>location</b> query are always forwarded to the closer friends of the host whose <b>location</b> is being <b>updated</b> and under query, respectively. The process of forwarding a <b>location</b> <b>update</b> or a <b>location</b> query can be imagined as traversing a path in the complete binary tree beginning at the root and moving toward the leaf level. Forwarding a <b>location</b> <b>update</b> or a <b>location</b> query is gradually forwarded to its closer friends, and the number of times a <b>location</b> <b>update</b> or a <b>location</b> query can be forwarded is restricted by the height of the peer-tree. An actual forwarding path is jointly determined by the peer-tree and the temporary connectivity in a network.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop and}} analyze a {{hash-based}} paging and <b>location</b> <b>update</b> technique {{that reduces the}} paging cost in cellular systems. By applying a Bloom filter, the terminal identifier field of a paging message is coded to page a number of terminals concurrently. A small number of terminals may wake up and send what we call “false <b>location</b> <b>updates</b> ” although {{they are not being}} paged. We compare the total number of paging and false <b>location</b> <b>update</b> messages with the cost of the standard paging procedure. Fortunately, the false <b>location</b> <b>update</b> probabilities can be made very small, and important bandwidth gains can be expected. The larger the size of the terminal identifier, the less probable are false <b>location</b> <b>updates.</b> Therefore, hash-based paging especially shows promise for IP paging in mobile IPv 6 networks with 128 -bit mobile host addresses...|$|R
