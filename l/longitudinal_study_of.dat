In a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> women with breast cancer, for women who perceived their social environments to be receptive, emotional expression predicted improved quality of life. Coping through emotional expression among women with breast cancer has also been found to predict an increase in post-traumatic growth.

Women in particular experience positive identity transformation, build friendships and find a sense of community in GROW groups.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{adequate}} folate may produce {{a form of}} dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted {{in an increase in}} folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of sensorimotor speed were observed, which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance.|$|E

25|$|Limited {{research}} suggests that genetic factors may also be important. Some scholars recently argued {{that the decision to}} vote in the United States has very strong heritability, using twin studies of validated turnout in Los Angeles and self-reported turnout in the National <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> Adolescent Health to establish that. They suggest that genetics could help to explain why parental turnout is such a strong predictor of voting in young people, and also why voting appears to be habitual. Further, they suggest, if there is an innate predisposition to vote or abstain, this would explain why past voting behavior is such a good predictor of future voter reaction.|$|E

At the end of the study, regular viewers outperformed the non-viewers, solving problems more successfully and systematically.

500|$|Francis Galton (1822–1911) was {{a pioneer}} in {{investigating}} both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book Hereditary Genius, writing before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose near' genius or genius" [...] as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford–Binet test. By 1926, Terman began publishing about a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called Genetic Studies of Genius, which he conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses, published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds, Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius. By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford–Binet test, Terman no longer used the term [...] "genius" [...] as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test. In 1939, Wechsler specifically commented that [...] "we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score." ...|$|E
