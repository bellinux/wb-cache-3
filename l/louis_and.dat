5|$|Initially, the {{governor}} of the Indiana Territory governed the Louisiana District (which included St. <b>Louis),</b> <b>and</b> the district's organizational law forbade the foreign slave trade and reduced the influence of St. Louis in the region. Wealthy St. Louisans petitioned Congress to review the system, and in July 1805, Congress reorganized the Louisiana District as the Louisiana Territory, with its territorial capital at St. <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> its own territorial governor. From the division of the Louisiana Territory in 1812 to Missouri statehood in 1821, St. Louis was the capital of the Missouri Territory.|$|E

5|$|With both of {{the leading}} {{candidates}} now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of Hesse, a minor German royal, the nephew of the Grand Duke of Hesse. Princess Victoria {{had gone to the}} court of Hesse to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they could watch the Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law. The Queen admired both <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> Henry, but noted how well <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> Alice got along together. When the Hessian family departed, Louis requested Alice's photograph, and Alice made it clear that she was attracted to him.|$|E
5|$|After his {{baseball}} career, Bordagaray owned restaurants and clubs in St. <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> Kansas City and developed land as cemeteries in the Midwestern United States.

5|$|American {{and other}} {{immigrant}} families began arriving in St. <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> opening new businesses, including printing and banking, {{starting in the}} 1810s. Among the printers was Joseph Charless, who published the first newspaper west of the Mississippi, the Missouri Gazette, on July 12, 1808. In 1816 and 1817, groups of merchants formed the first banks in the town, but mismanagement and the Panic of 1819 led to their closure.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of trust that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment options {{increased}} {{during the}} pre–Civil War period; in early 1819, the first theatre production in St. Louis opened, including a musical accompaniment.

5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the tapestries seem to {{have been}} made to celebrate a marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515). The royal arms of <b>Louis</b> <b>and</b> Anne would have once decorated the sky in most of the tapestries.|$|E
