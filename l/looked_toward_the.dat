5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever {{in the care of}} Sejanus and <b>looked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E
25|$|The {{investors in}} the Lowell textile {{companies}} decided {{they needed to do}} something about their transportation situation. They <b>looked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> railroads budding in England, and now in America, for inspiration and took operations on the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad and the construction ongoing on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Baltimore & Ohio {{and a handful of other}} ventures as omens and inspiration. A railroad could run year round, was expandable with as many tracks as they might need, and could use the new locomotives that were being highly praised in England at the heart of recent news stories. By 1829 the B was testing a locally produced steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, and opened for passenger operations in May 1830. With well-publicized and ambitious plans to scale one of the gaps of the Allegheny and cross the Ohio River, and New York and Pennsylvania's canal mania sprinkled with railroads, Massachusetts and New England investors were looking at bold plans everywhere.|$|E
25|$|Angelo Correr had promised, {{when he was}} a {{cardinal}} in the Conclave of November 1406, along with all the other cardinals who signed the Electoral Capitulations, that, if elected Pope, he would not create new cardinals except to keep the college of the Roman Obedience {{on a par with the}} Avignon Obedience. When he was elected Gregory XII, he signed and ratified those capitulations. But in May 1408, without need, he insisted on creating four new cardinals, two of whom were his nephews. The current cardinals objected loudly, citing the Electoral Capitulations, and they actually refused to attend the Consistory to elevate the four new cardinals. On May 11 one of the cardinals, Jean Gilles, left Lucca, where Pope Gregory was staying at the time, and withdrew to Pisa. The Pope's nephew Paolo Correr (Corrario) was sent with troops to fetch him back by force. The papal action was so shocking that seven more cardinals deserted the same evening, and another who had just arrived in Lucca followed along without delay. On 29 June 1408, thirteen cardinals (who held the proxies of two additional cardinals) met in the port city of Livorno, where they prepared a manifesto which <b>looked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> holding of a general council to bring the schism to an end. Four more cardinals joined in the agreement in writing on 30 August, another on 14 September, another on 5 October, and yet another on 11 October.|$|E

2500|$|It can {{be noted}} that the {{doubling}} is a stock situation of Elizabethan comedy. On the fusion between Elizabethan and Plautine techniques, T. W. Baldwin writes, [...] "...Errors does not have the miniature unity of Menaechmi, which is characteristic of classic structure for comedy". Baldwin notes that Shakespeare covers a much greater area {{in the structure of the}} play than Plautus does. Shakespeare was writing for an audience whose minds weren't restricted to house and home, but <b>looked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> greater world beyond and the role that they might play in that world.|$|E
