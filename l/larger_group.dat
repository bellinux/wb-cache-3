5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} <b>larger</b> <b>group</b> of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control.

40|$|Emergence {{of a group}} {{analytic}} {{perspective on}} the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> Group analysts tend to agree that in <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> we learn about primitive defence mechanisms, the fear of psychotic fragmentation, the fragility of communication and the socially divisive and destructive potential in the foundation matrix of each culture. The focus of attention in the literature {{has been on the}} decivilising and not on the civilising processes within the interactions between social actors in the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> setting (Elias 1976). Despite their differences, Foulkesian and Kleinian thinkers agree that the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> repeatedly fails to learn from experience and almost always regresses into a psychotic state of mind. This negative dialectic between <b>large</b> <b>group,</b> individual member and conductor is so unquestioned that it is the first thing that deserves rethinking. Foulkes, in his refusal to integrate his work with that of Bion, shaped the understanding of small and <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> in three generations of group analytic practitioners.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> there are two omissions which need to be confronted: one is theoretical, the other empirical.

The “blank pages ” are no accident, they have a dynamic meaning within the social foundation matrix of the group analytic movement. (1) The omissions mirror Foulkes’s ambivalence towards the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> and are reflected in the different approaches adopted by the group analytic heirs of the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> which pay more homage to Bion than to Foulkes.

5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{described}} his finds in two 1878 {{issues of the}} American Naturalist, and assigned them to the new genus Amphicoelias. He placed it in a unique family, Amphicoeliidae, though this is now considered a nomen oblitum (forgotten name). The genus is usually assigned to the family Diplodocidae, though some modern analyses have found it {{at the base of}} the <b>larger</b> <b>group</b> Diplodocoidea or as a diplodocid incertae sedis (uncertain placement). The first named species in the genus, Amphicoelias altus (holotype specimen AMHD 5764), was discovered by Cope in 1877. But while it is only represented by a partial skeleton, there are enough diagnostic characteristics to provisionally define the genus. A. altus is known from better remains, but is smaller than A. fragillimus. Cope also named a second species in 1878: Amphicoelias latus.|$|E

5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the <b>larger</b> <b>group</b> Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment. The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and some large species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|It {{was soon}} {{established}} {{that some of}} the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a <b>larger</b> <b>group</b> which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.|$|E

From six preschool teachers perspective we also wanted to find out the <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of children positive and negative sides. The reason behind our choice of purposes is both our own experiences of mostly negative opinions of <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of children among preschool teachers, as well as the news reports about the negative consequences that <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers may cause. The study draws on a approach of the term constructionism in the understanding of the teachers’ perceptions of <b>larger</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers. We applied a qualitative method based on interviews with six preschool teachers working on two different preschools. The result of our study shows that the interviewed preschool teachers sees mostly advantages rather than disadvantages with <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers. The preschool teachers describe that to be able to work with <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers there has to be a good structure and organization guaranteeing that the pedagogues have the right competence and that the preschools environment is well designed.

Instead the preschool teachers in our study sees more positive than negative aspects of <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers, as long as there is a good structure and organization...|$|R
