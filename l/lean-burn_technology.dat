40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Currently there is unprecedented social and political pressure to minimise anthropogenic environmental change. It {{is a result of}} the paradoxical nature of emissions reduction that <b>lean-burn</b> <b>technology</b> has become the most likely agent by which future emission targets may be met. However, the inclusion of <b>lean-burn</b> <b>technology</b> requires that the flametube depth is increased, to maintain an acceptable level of pressure drop and sufficient residence time. The injector too must increase in diameter as the admission of air via the fuel nozzle is increased. Maintaining traditional dump style architecture and employing these changes creates a number of additional problems. Most notable is the increased non-uniformity which is inherited by the injector flow as a result of the mismatch between the injector and upstream feed. Injector non-uniformity is a parameter symbiotic with emissions performance and it is therefore imperative to minimise the degree of injector non-uniformity if the ambition of the lean-burn system is to be realised.

40|$|There is {{a global}} effort to expand the use of {{alternative}} fuels due to their several benefits such as improving air quality with reducing some criteria emissions, reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. This dissertation is focused on investigating the impact of two popular alternative fuels, biodiesel and natural gas (NG), on emissions from heavy-duty engines. Biodiesel {{is one of the}} most popular renewable fuels with diesel applications. Although biodiesel blends are reported to reduce particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and total hydrocarbon emissions; there is uncertainty on their impact on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. This dissertation evaluated the effect of biodiesel feedstock, biodiesel blend level, engine technology, and driving conditions on NOx emissions. The results showed that NOx emissions increase with 20 % and higher biodiesel blends. Also, in this study some strategies were proposed and some fuel formulations were found for mitigating NOx emissions increases with biodiesel. The impact of 5 % biodiesel on criteria emissions specifically NOx was also fully studied in this thesis. As a part of the results of this study, 5 % animal-based biodiesel was certified for use in California based on California Air Resources Board emissions equivalent procedure. NG {{is one of the most}} prominent alternative fuels with larger reserves compared to crude oil. However, the quality of NG depends on both its source and the degree to which it is processed. The current study explored the impact of various NG fuels, ranging from low methane/high energy gases to high methane/low energy gases, on criteria and toxic emissions from NG engines with different combustion and aftertreatment technologies. The results showed stronger fuel effects for the <b>lean-burn</b> <b>technology</b> bus. Finally, this thesis investigated the impact of changing diesel fuel composition on the criteria emissions from a variety of heavy-duty engine technologies. Emissions from an average diesel fuel used throughout the U. S. were compared with a 10 % aromatic, ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel used in California with more stringent air quality regulations. The results showed that the emerging aftertreatment technologies eventually eliminate the benefits of the lower aromatic content/higher cetane number diesel fuels...|$|E

In 1992 Solar Turbines introduced the SoLoNOx system. The SoLoNOx system uses <b>lean-burn</b> <b>technologies</b> to reduce NOx emissions. the SoLoNOx system has been retrofitted to over 2,000 turbines and all of Solar Turbine's more recent designs can be equipped with SoLoNOx as a feature. In 1997 Solar Turbines introduced a ceramic hot-section design for the Centaur 50 and introduced a recuperator for the Mercury 50, in experiments conducted with the US Department of Energy.|$|R

40|$|The further {{development}} of <b>lean-burn</b> <b>technology</b> for aero-engine applications requires an improved understanding {{of the interaction between}} wall cooling and the combustion processes. Wall cooling leads to combustion extinction and plays {{a significant role in the}} production of pollutants. Experimental investigation of the coupling between aerodynamics and combustion chemistry in the confines of pressurized combustion chamber is achieved by means of a dedicated burner, which burns very close to the wall, and an effusion cooled wall. While particle image velocimetry (PIV) lends itself for the measurement of the flow field, both the flame front as well as the temperature distribution can be estimated by quantitative concentration measurement of the OH radical using planar laser induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF). In this context PLIF on carbon monoxide (CO-PLIF) holds the potential of locating and quantifying areas of flame extinction and is the subject of the present feasibility study. In a first step the two-photon excitation of CO molecules at 230 nm was investigated from the spectroscopic view, in particular with respect to excitation and emission. From the respective excitation/emission spectra obtained in the flame of a calibrated matrix burner, the wavelengths can be detected at which CO is excited. Spectral analysis both reveal interference with other molecules (e. g. C 2) and provide reliable information for a simulation that also includes the influence of the quasi-resonant (2 + 1) ionization of the CO molecule. In a second step planar measurements were performed on this matrix burner using a fuel-rich methane/air flame (phi = 1. 45) as a reference flame with respect to which all other flames (phi = 0. 8 – 1. 3) are calibrated. This allows the influence of the position-dependent differences in the laser light sheet to be adequately considered and resulted in an even CO distribution for the different flames. The respective mean values of the CO concentration show good agreement with the results of equilibrium calculations. The present setup allows planar measurements of mean CO concentrations at a range of about 200 ppm while single pulse measurements are limited to roughly 1000 ppm. As the next step, the CO-PLIF measurement technique is to be applied on a pressurized single-sector combustion chamber...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{and clean}} {{production}} of electrical energy and mechanical (shaft) energy {{for use in}} industrial and domestic applications, surface- and ground transportation and aero-propulsion is currently of significant general concern. Fossil fuels are mainly used for transportation and aero-propulsion, but also for power generation. Combustion of fossil fuels typically give rise to undesired emissions such as unburned hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, soot and nitrogen oxides. The most widespread approach to minimize these is to apply various <b>lean-burn</b> <b>technologies,</b> and sometimes also dilute the fuel with hydrogen. Although efficient in reducing emissions, lean-burn often results in combustion instabilities and igniteon issues, and thus become challenging itself. Another desired aspect of today’s engines {{is to increase the}} fuel flexibility. One possible technique that may be useful for circumventing these issues is plasma-assisted combustion, i. e. to supply a small amount of electric energy to the flame to stimulate the chemical kinetics. Although not new, this approach has not yet been fully explored, partly because of it’s complexity, and partly because of apparent sufficiency. Recently, however, several research studies of this area have emerged. This paper attempts to provide a brief summary of microwave-assisted combustion, in which microwaves are utilized to supply the electrical energy to the flame, and to demonstrate that this method is useful to enhance flame stabilization, delay lean blow-off, and to increase combustion efficiency. The main effect of microwaves (or electrical energy) is to enhance the chemical kinetics, resulting in increased reactivity and laminar and turbulent flame speeds. Here we will demonstrate that this will improve the performance of gas turbine combustors...|$|R

Conventional turbofan designs, however, that reduce CO 2 emissions—such as increased overall pressure ratio designs—can increase the production of NOx emissions. In the present work, funded by the European Framework 6 collaborative project NEW Aero engine Core concepts (NEWAC), an aero-engine multidisciplinary design tool, Techno-economic, Environmental, and Risk Assessment for 2020 (TERA 2020), has been utilized to study the potential benefits from introducing heat-exchanged cores in future turbofan engine designs. The tool comprises of various modules covering a wide range of disciplines: engine performance, engine aerodynamic and mechanical design, aircraft design and performance, emissions prediction and environmental impact, engine and airframe noise, as well as production, maintenance and direct operating costs. Fundamental performance differences between heat-exchanged cores and a conventional core are discussed and quantified. Cycle limitations imposed by mechanical considerations, operational limitations and emissions legislation are also discussed. The research work presented in this paper concludes with a full assessment at aircraft system level that reveals the significant potential performance benefits for the intercooled and intercooled recuperated cycles. An intercooled core can be designed for a significantly higher overall pressure ratio and with reduced cooling air requirements, providing a higher thermal efficiency than could otherwise be practically achieved with a conventional core.

40|$|Lean-burn engines {{offer the}} {{potential}} for significant fuel economy improvements in cars and trucks, perhaps the next great breakthrough in automotive technology that will enable greater savings in imported petroleum. The development of lean-burn engines, however, has been an elusive goal among automakers because of the emissions challenges associated with lead-burn engine technology. Presently, cars operate with sophisticated emissions control systems that require the engine's air-fuel ratio to be carefully controlled around the stoichiometric point (chemically correct mixture). Catalysts in these systems are called "three-way" catalysts because they can reduce hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions simultaneously, but {{only because of the}} tight control of the air-fuel ratio. The purpose of this cooperative effort is to develop advanced catalyst systems, materials, and necessary engine control algorithms for reducing NOX emissions in oxygen-rich automotive exhaust (as with <b>lean-burn</b> engine <b>technology)</b> to meet current and near-future mandated Clean Air Act standards. These developments will represent a breakthrough in both emission control technology and automobile efficiency. The total project is a joint effort among five national laboratories, together with US CAR. The role of Lockheed-Martin Energy Systems in the total project is two fold: characterization of catalyst performance through laboratory evaluations from bench-scale flow reactor tests to engine laboratory tests of full-scale prototype catalysts, and microstructural characterization of catalyst material before and after test stand and/or engine testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} scarce {{resources}} has advanced {{the development of}} more efficient <b>lean-burn</b> engine <b>technology</b> for power generation and transportation. Thus, the issue of NOx production and the need to monitor that production becomes increasingly important. To better understand NOx sensing, the potentiometric couple of La 2 CuO 4 and platinum across a yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrate was studied. Temperature programmed reaction and desorption studies were performed on powder samples to determine desorption strength and catalysis of NOx on La 2 CuO 4. A mass spectrometer with one part per billion resolution collected spectra for the experiments. NO gas proved non-reactive in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean conditions. NO 2 gas desorbed in multiple gas-phase products, and its reaction was catalytically activated by La 2 CuO 4. Adsorption of NOx was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflection configuration. Results indicated the presence of ionic nitrate and nitrite complexes providing substantial electronic charge separation in large quantities. Photoelectron peak splitting of the O 1 s oxygen orbital verified NO caused oxygen deprivation and increased resistivity, while NO 2 adsorption resulted in creation of electron holes and an overall decrease in resistivity. Oxygen isotope exchange was performed to determine the adsorption mechanism of NOx. Temperature programmed experiments using 18 O 2 gas over La 2 Cu 16 O 4 and La 2 Cu 18 O 4 identified bonding behavior and adsorption/desorption sequence of NOx. Formation surface complexes were found to occur exclusively with solid phase oxygen, but substitution of the primary oxygen in the complex was dependent on available thermal energy. It could be concluded that the oxygen exchange is a very important component of the overall sensor response, and that the adsorptive component plays a large role in the establishment of the potential between the electrodes. To adjust the adsorption equilibrium and modify sensor response, desorption experiments under external electric field bias were performed on a La 2 CuO 4 pellet. Initial bias, aging effects and increases in field strength were shown to change the desorption profile of NO and NO 2 gases {{from the surface of the}} La 2 CuO 4 pellet. A sensor utilizing a La 2 CuO 4 pellet with similar field generating structures was also constructed. It displayed sensitivity changes to NOx gases with changes in field voltage and bias...|$|R
40|$|PCI has {{developed}} and demonstrated its Rich Catalytic <b>Lean-burn</b> (RCLÂ®) <b>technology</b> for industrial and utility gas turbines to meet DOEâs goals of low single digit emissions. The technology offers stable combustion with extended turndown allowing ultra-low emissions without {{the cost of}} exhaust after-treatment and further increasing overall efficiency (avoidance of after-treatment losses). The objective of the work was to develop and demonstrate emission benefits of the catalytic technology to meet strict emissions regulations. Two different applications of the RCLÂ® concept were demonstrated: RCLÂ® catalytic pilot and Full RCLÂ®. The RCLÂ® catalytic pilot was designed to replace the existing pilot (a typical source of high NOx production) in the existing Dry Low NOx (DLN) injector, providing benefit of catalytic combustion while minimizing engine modification. This report discusses the development and single injector and engine testing {{of a set of}} T 70 injectors equipped with RCLÂ® pilots for natural gas applications. The overall (catalytic pilot plus main injector) program NOx target of less than 5 ppm (corrected to 15 % oxygen) was achieved in the T 70 engine for the complete set of conditions with engine CO emissions less than 10 ppm. Combustor acoustics were low (at or below 0. 1 psi RMS) during testing. The RCLÂ® catalytic pilot supported engine startup and shutdown process without major modification of existing engine controls. During high pressure testing, the catalytic pilot showed no incidence of flashback or autoignition while operating over a wide range of flame temperatures. In applications where lower NOx production is required (i. e. less than 3 ppm), in parallel, a Full RCLÂ® combustor was developed that replaces the existing DLN injector providing potential for maximum emissions reduction. This concept was tested at industrial gas turbine conditions in a Solar Turbines, Incorporated high-pressure (17 atm.) combustion rig and in a modified Solar Turbines, Incorporated Saturn engine rig. High pressure single-injector rig and modified engine rig tests demonstrated NOx less than 2 ppm and CO less than 10 ppm over a wide flame temperature operating regime with low combustion noise (5000 hours) at simulated engine conditions (P= 15 atm, Tin= 400 C/ 750 F.). Cyclic tests simulating engine trips was also demonstrated for catalyst reliability. In addition to catalyst tests, substrate oxidation testing was also performed for downselected substrate candidates for over 25, 000 hours. At the end of the program, an RCLÂ® catalytic pilot system has been developed and demonstrated to produce NOx emissions of less than 3 ppm (corrected to 15 % O 2) for 100 % and 50 % load operation in a production engine operating on natural gas. In addition, a Full RCLÂ® combustor has been designed and demonstrated less than 2 ppm NOx (with potential to achieve 1 ppm) in single injector and modified engine testing. The catalyst/substrate combination {{has been shown to be}} stable up to 5500 hrs in simulated engine conditions...|$|R
