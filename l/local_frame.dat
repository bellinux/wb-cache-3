40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{cooperative}} localization problem of sensor networks using local angle-of-arrival measurements in two scenarios. (i) The angle-of-arrival {{information can be}} mutually measured by pairs of sensors in their <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> which do not share the same orientation; (ii) The angle-of-arrival information can not be mutually measured by pairs of sensors but their <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> share the same orientation. For scenario (i), a distributed localization scheme is proposed based on a simultaneous orientation consensus law. This localization scheme not only provides the true coordinates of all sensor nodes, but also offers the true orientations of <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> on the sensor nodes as a byproduct. For scenario (ii), a similar distributed localization scheme with diagonal scaling is developed without estimating the true orientations of <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> on the sensor nodes. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate our results...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a rigid motion invariant mesh representation based on discrete forms defined on the mesh. The reconstruction of mesh geometry from this representation requires solving two sparse linear systems {{that arise from}} the discrete forms: the first system defines the relationship between <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> on the mesh, and the second encodes {{the position of the}} vertices via the <b>local</b> <b>frames.</b> The reconstructed geometry is unique up to a rigid transformation of the mesh. We define surface editing operations by placing user-defined constraints on the <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> and the vertex positions. These constraints are incorporated in the two linear reconstruction systems, and their solution produces a deformed surface geometry that preserves the local differential properties in the least-squares sense. Linear combination of shapes expressed with our representation enables linear shape interpolation that correctly handles rotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new representation with various detail-preserving editing operators and shape morphing...|$|R
30|$|Secondly, a {{strategy}} for consumers’ perceived social value is required. Consumers are highly aware of the social value of eco-labels. They perceive social value as higher than private value. However, this does not effectively induce consumers’ attitude and purchasing intention. <b>Local</b> <b>framing</b> message strategy could be a solution. Research on message framing strategy suggests that locally framed messages encourage consumers’ purchasing behavior (Grinstein and Riefler 2015; Scannell and Gifford 2013).

In this paper we study how to eciently derive three dimensional molecular conformations from the values of torsional angles. This case is of broad interest as torsional angles greatly aect molecular shape and are always taken into account during simulations. We rst review two widely-used methods for deriving molecular conformations, the simple rotations scheme and the Denavit-Hartenberg <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> method. We discuss their disadvantages which include extensive bookkeeping, accumulation of numerical errors and redundancies in the <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> used. Then we introduce a new, fast and accurate method called the atomgroup <b>local</b> <b>frames</b> method. This new method not only eliminates the disadvantages of earlier approaches, but also provides lazy evaluation of atom positions and reduces the computational cost. Our method is especially useful in applications where many conformations are generated or updated such as in energy minimization and conformational search. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{power of}} locally framed {{messages}} is reported in multiple studies. Scannell and Gifford (2013) analyzed {{the effectiveness of}} global and locally framed messages and found that there is greater engagement in climate change when the message delivered is about the impact on local areas. Grinstein and Riefler (2015) analyzed the effectiveness of global and <b>local</b> <b>framing</b> messages in Israel, and categorized consumers into three groups; high-, middle- and low-cosmopolitan consumers. High-cosmopolitan consumers are interested in global issues and willingly join the global movement. Global framing message is more effective on high-cosmopolitan consumers than low-cosmopolitan consumers. On low-cosmopolitan consumers, namely general consumers, <b>local</b> <b>framing</b> messages are effective because consumers can easily evaluate {{the impact of their}} purchasing behavior (Grinstein and Riefler 2015).|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{representation}} of local image structure and a matching scheme that are insensitive {{to a wide}} range of appearance changes. The representation is a collection of <b>local</b> affine <b>frames</b> that are constructed on outer boundaries of maximally stable extremal regions (MSERS) in an affine-covariant way. Each <b>local</b> affine <b>frame</b> is described by a relative location of other <b>local</b> affine <b>frames</b> in its neighborhood. The image is thus represented by quantities that depend only on the location of the boundaries of MSERs. Inter-image correspondences between <b>local</b> affine <b>frames</b> are formed in constant time by geometric hashing. Direct detection of <b>local</b> afine <b>frames</b> removes the requirement of a point-based hashing to establish reference frames in a combinatorial way, which has in the case of affine transform complexily that is cubic in the number of points. <b>Local</b> affine <b>frames,</b> which are also the quantities represented in the hash table, occupy a 6 0 space and hence data collisions are less likely compared with 2 0 point hashing. Experimentally, the robustness of the method and its insensitiviq to photometric changes is demonstrated on images from different spectral bands of satellite sensor; on images of a transparent object and on images of an object taken during day and night...|$|R
