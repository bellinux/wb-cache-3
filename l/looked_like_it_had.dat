25|$|February {{featured}} three Premier League encounters. Derby County were in {{real trouble}} in the Premier League, occupying 20th position, with 19th-place Fulham well {{out of reach for}} the East Midlands club. Their visit to St Andrew's also saw the return of Robbie Savage who left the Blues back in 2005. A Larsson goal <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> secured a valuable three points for the Blues before an 89th-minute Emanuel Villa goal secured a point for Derby. A trip to West Ham was next up for the Blues. Fredrik Ljungberg scored in the opening encounters for the Hammers, but a penalty from new signing McFadden made sure that the Blues would at least leave with a point. The last game of the month was a home match between the Blues and Arsenal. A 28th-minute free kick from McFadden opened the scoring, before two Theo Walcott goals within five minutes looked to have given the points to Arsenal, before an injury time McFadden penalty stole a point for the Blues. The game became highly controversial as within minutes of the kick off, a badly timed challenge by centre-back Martin Taylor broke the leg of Arsenal striker Eduardo. No one could complain about the automatic red card that referee Mike Dean showed Taylor, but comments after the game by Arsène Wenger campaigned for a much longer ban than the traditional three-match ban. Although Wenger later retracted his comments, his idea gained support with Sepp Blatter in particular, who campaigned for Taylor to be punished with a season-long ban. The defender also received death threats from supporters of the Croatia national team, as Eduardo would miss Euro 2008 in the summer.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television sources and critics. Alex Rocha of TV Guide {{called it a}} [...] "pretty dull episode, but with some bright humorous spots [...] The episode <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> potential, but definitely did not perform to its best." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN called it [...] "far from perfect" [...] but [...] "definitely {{a lot better than}} the terrible O.J. Simpson episode from last week." [...] He called the Handi-Quacks scenes [...] "fantastic" [...] and called the episode overall [...] "definitely {{a step in the right}} direction." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic said: [...] "More purpose in the plot and more jokes related to the story than usual" [...] and gave the episode 40 out of 100. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "tonight's Family Guy was the best it's been in a looooong time". He stated that in both plotlines [...] "the game is established early [...] and the show escalates nicely", and graded the episode a B.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics upon its release. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan called Sneakers [...] " [...] caper movie with a most pleasant sense of humor," [...] a [...] "twisting plot," [...] and a [...] "witty, hang-loose tone." [...] Turan {{went on to}} praise the ensemble cast and director Robinson, who is [...] "surprisingly adept at creating tension at appropriate moments" [...] and [...] "makes good use of the script's air of clever cheerfulness". Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, was less impressed, giving the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it [...] "a sometimes entertaining movie, but thin." [...] He went on to point out numerous cliches and tired plot devices recycled in the film. Vincent Canby, in a negative review for The New York Times, said the film <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> [...] "just surfaced after being buried alive for 20 years," [...] calling it [...] "an atrophied version {{of a kind of}} caper movie that was so beloved in the early 1970's". He singled out Redford and Poitier as looking and acting too old to be in this kind of film now. He calls the plot [...] "feeble," [...] resulting in a film that is [...] "jokey without being funny, breathless without creating suspense". He calls the ensemble an [...] "all star gang," [...] but says the [...] "performances are generally quite bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|Octavio López {{started out}} as a body builder, {{developing}} the physique that would later on become one of his strong points. He began training for a professional wrestling career in the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) Gym under Karloff Lagarde and Ray Mendoza as well as training with Ojo de Tigre and Ebano Ruiz. He made his professional wrestling debut in 1992 under the ring name Urko and later worked as Espiritu Negro for a brief period of time. After wrestling for a few months he decided to dedicate himself to developing his physique and receive further training in the UWA wrestling school. In June, 1994 he made his re-debut for the UWA, this time working under a new ring character, Cibernético, (meaning [...] "cybernetic" [...] or Cyborg), complete with a colorful mask that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> printed circuitry on it to enhance the [...] "Cyborg" [...] character. On July 31, 1994 Cibernétcio wrestled on his first Toreo de Cuatro Caminos show, UWA's biggest venue. On the night he teamed up with veterans El Canek and Dos Caras, taking on Los Villanos, Villano III, Villano IV and Villano V. While he made his debut as a tecnico (fan favorite) he soon turned against El Canek, turning rudo (villain), setting up a feud with the UWA's top tecnico in the hopes of using Cibernético to replace some of the UWA headliners that had left the promotion. The attempt to create new headliners was too late and by January 1995 the UWA closed down.|$|E
60|$|I wish Orion {{were going}} on this voyage, for I believe {{he could not help}} but be cheerful and jolly. I often wonder if his law {{business}} is going satisfactorily to him, but knowing that the dull season is setting in now (it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> already set in before) I have felt as if I could almost answer the question myself--which is to say in plain words, I was afraid to ask. I wish I had gone to Washington in the winter instead of going West. I could have gouged an office out of Bill Stewart for him, and that would atone for the loss of my home visit. But I am so worthless that it seems to me I never do anything or accomplish anything that lingers in my mind as a pleasant memory. My mind is stored full of unworthy conduct toward Orion and towards you all, and an accusing conscience gives me peace only in excitement and restless moving from place to place. If I could say I had done one thing for any of you that entitled me to your good opinion, (I say nothing of your love, for I am sure of that, no matter how unworthy of it I may make myself, from Orion down you have always given me that, all the days of my life, when God Almighty knows I seldom deserve it,) I believe I could go home and stay there and I know I would care little for the world's praise or blame. There is no satisfaction in the world's praise anyhow, and it has no worth to me save in the way of business. I tried to gather up its compliments to send to you, but the work was distasteful and I dropped it.|$|E

5000|$|Minni ritchi {{is a type}} of reddish brown bark that {{continuously}} peels {{in small}} curly flakes, leaving the tree <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a coat of red curly hair.

50|$|De Mestral {{obtained}} patents in {{many countries}} right after inventing the fasteners, as he expected an immediate high demand. Partly due to its cosmetic appearance, though, hook and loop's integration into the textile industry took time. At the time, the fasteners <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been made from leftover bits of cheap fabric, and thus was not sewn into clothing or used widely when it debuted in the early 1960s. It was also viewed as impractical.|$|E
5000|$|The {{incorporation}} of such traditional elements typifies F+A's overall historicist design style.

The construction adheres to the original Tokugawa design. The symbol of a hollyhock, the crest of the Tokugawa family, can be seen on the ridge-end tiles. The turret has been designated an Important Cultural Asset.|$|R
50|$|The key design goal is {{readability}} - {{that the}} language be readable as-is, without <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions. To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.|$|R

Hook and loop in the early 1960s <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been made from left-over bits of cheap fabric, an unappealing aspect for clothiers. The first notable use for Velcro® brand hook and loop came in the aerospace industry, where it helped astronauts maneuver {{in and out of}} bulky space suits.

The Jayhawks scored early on, were matched by the Cornhuskers, and then scored again. It looked like the one touchdown lead might hold, but as the minutes ticked to the final gun, Nebraska put together an 80-yard march down the field to tie the game again and deny either team the win. Kansas had the moral victory, but still was without a win over Nebraska in fourteen straight tries, and was far back in their shared series at 9-32-3. Due to the tie, the Cornhuskers stumbled to #11 in the AP Poll.|$|E
