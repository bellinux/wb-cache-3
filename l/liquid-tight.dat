25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a <b>liquid-tight</b> housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|E

50|$|In the {{manufacture}} of precision parts and assemblies, especially where parts {{will be required to}} be connected across a surface area in an air-tight or <b>liquid-tight</b> manner, flatness is a critical quality of {{the manufacture}}d surfaces. Such surfaces are usually machined or ground to achieve the required degree of flatness. High-definition metrology, such as digital holographic interferometry, of such a surface to confirm and ensure that the required degree of flatness has been achieved is a key step in such manufacturing processes. Flatness may be defined in terms of least squares fit to a plane ("statistical flatness"), worst-case or overall flatness (the distance between the two closest parallel planes within).|$|E

50|$|Type A Independent Tanks are {{prismatic}} {{and supported}} on insulation-bearing blocks typically consisting of wooden chocks and located by anti-roll chocks {{located at the}} top of the tank inside the void space and anti-flotation chocks located inside the void space usually just above the double bottom tanks. The tanks are normally divided by a centreline <b>liquid-tight</b> bulkhead; by this feature, together with the chamfered upperpart of the tank, the free liquid surface effect is reduced and thus the virtual rise of the Centre of gravity and the stability is increased. When these cargo tanks are designed to carry LPG (at −50 °C), the tank is constructed of fine-grained low-carbon manganese steel or even stainless steel as seen in the Maersk J class Ships. The hold space (void space) in this design is normally filled with dry inert gas or Nitrogen but may be ventilated with air during a ballast or gas free passage. The Conch design has been developed for carriage of LNG (at-163oC). The material for these cargo tanks has to be either 9% nickel steel or aluminium. The maximum allowable relief vapour setting (MARVS) is < 0. 7 bar.|$|E
5000|$|CAC, under Sir Lawrence Wackett, {{began work}} on its own design, hoping to out-perform the Beaufort by {{building}} a machine {{that could serve as}} both a torpedo bomber and dive bomber. To keep down weight, Wackett dispensed with traditional self-sealing fuel tanks and opted to make the wing cavities <b>liquid-tight,</b> and thus serve as fuel storage. The Australian Government was initially uninterested in the CAC design. However, in mid-1940, cut off from the supply of British-made components for the Beaufort program (thanks to a British embargo on the export of aviation products, due to the need to maximise British production during the Battle of Britain), the Australian Government ordered a prototype of the CAC design, even before the Royal Australian Air Force had expressed a view about the machine. [...] This prototype CA-4 took to the air on 19 September 1941. The CA-4 was a low-wing, twin-engined, multi-role bomber with a crew of three. It was armed with four nose-mounted [...]303 calibre machine guns and two remote-controlled twin machine-gun barbettes mounted {{at the rear of the}} engine nacelles. It could carry either 500 lb bombs, 250 lb bombs or two torpedoes. It was originally powered by two Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp R-1830-S3C3-G radials. Unfortunately, the novel fuel tanks never proved reliable, and in January 1943 the CA-4 prototype was completely destroyed in a mid-air explosion, probably due to a fuel leak.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an integrity evaluation of Tanks W- 8 and W- 9, part of the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT), in the South Tank Farm at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), together with a plan for monitoring those tanks for potential releases during the GAAT CERCLA treatability study and waste removal activities. This work was done in support of an ORNL plan to use W- 8 and W- 9 as consolidation tanks during remediation of the other tanks in the North and South Tank Farms. The analysis portion of the report draws upon both tank-internal measurements of liquid volume change and tank-external measurements of the change in electrical conductivity of the groundwater in the dry wells adjacent to each tank. The results of the analysis show that both W- 8 and W- 9 are <b>liquid-tight</b> and are suitable for use as consolidation tanks. The recommended monitoring plan will utilize the dry well conductivity monitoring method as the primary release detection tool during the CERCLA activities. This method is expected to be able to detect releases of less than 0. 5 gal/h with a 95 % probability of detection, most of the time. The results described here validate three prior independent efforts: a liquid integrity assessment made in 1995, a structural integrity assessment made in 1995 by experts in the field of gunite tanks, and a structural integrity assessment made in 1994 using a three-dimensional, finite-element computer model. This work, along with the three prior efforts, shows that Tanks W- 8 and W- 9 are structurally sound and <b>liquid-tight.</b> Based upon this work it is concluded that these tanks are suitable for use as consolidation tanks during the GAAT CERCLA treatability study and waste removal actions and it is recommended that the tanks be monitored for potential releases during this period using the methods described in this report...|$|E

40|$|Overheating in the joining {{process to}} create Li-ion battery cells {{can lead to}} {{degradation}} of the cells an has to be avoided; moreover temperatures lower than 0 °C can lower the energy output of the cells.

40|$|Fire {{environments that}} occur on cargo ships differ {{significantly}} from the fire environments found in land transport. Cargo ships typically carry {{a large amount of}} flammable fuel for propulsion and shipboard power, and may transport large quantities of flammable cargo. As a result, sea mode transport accident records contain instances of long lasting and intense fires. Since Irradiated Nuclear Fuel (INF) casks are not carried on tankers with large flammable cargoes, most of these dramatic, long burning fires are not relevant threats, and transport studies must concentrate on those fires that are most likely to occur. By regulation, INF casks must be separated from flammable cargoes by a fire-resistant, <b>liquid-tight</b> partition. This makes a fire in an adjacent ship hold the most likely fire threat. The large size of a cargo ship relative to any spent nuclear fuel casks on board, however, may permit a severe, long lasting fire to occur with little or no thermal impact on the casks. Although some flammable materials such as shipping boxes or container floors may exist in the same hold with the cask, the amount of fuel available may not provide a significant threat to the massive transport casks used for radioactive materials. This shipboard fire situation differs significantly from the regulatory conditions specified in 10 CFR 71 for a fully engulfing pool fire. To learn more about the differences, a series of simple thermal analyses has been completed to estimate cask behavior in likely marine and land thermal accident situations. While the calculations are based on several conservative assumptions, and are only preliminary, they illustrate that casks are likely to heat much more slowly in shipboard hold fires than in an open pool fire. The calculations also reinforce the basic regulatory concept that for radioactive materials, the shipping cask, not the ship, is the primary protection barrier to consider...|$|E
40|$|Background: Liquid solder laser-assisted {{vascular}} welding using biocompatible polymeric scaffolds (ssLAVW) {{is a novel}} {{technique for}} vascular anastomoses. Although ssLAVW has pronounced advantages over conventional suturing, drawbacks include low welding strength and extensive thermal damage. Aim: To determine optimal ssLAVW parameters for maximum welding strength and minimal thermal damage. Methods: Substudy 1 compared breaking strength (BS) of aortic strips welded with electrospun poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold, 670 -nm laser, 50 -s single-spot continuous lasing (SSCL), and semi-solid solder (48 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) / 0. 5 % methylene blue (MB) / 3 % hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC)). Substudy 2 compared the semi-solid solder to 48 % BSA/ 0. 5 % MB/ 0. 38 % genipin and 48 % BSA/ 0. 5 % MB/ 3 % HPMC/ 0. 38 % genipin solder. Substudy 3 compared SSCL to single-spot pulsed lasing (SSPL). Results: PCL-ssLAVW yielded an acute BS of 248. 0 ± 54. 0 N/cm 2 and remained stable up to 7 d of hydration. PLGA-ssLAVW obtained higher acute BS (408. 6 ± 78. 8 N/cm 2) but revealed structural defects and a BS of 109. 4 ± 42. 6 N/cm 2 after 14 d of hydration. The addition of HPMC and genipin improved the 14 -d BS of PLGA-ssLAVW (223. 9 ± 19. 1 N/cm 2). Thermal damage was reduced with SSPL compared with SSCL. Conclusions: PCL-ssLAVW yielded lower but more stable welds than PLGA-ssLAVW. The addition of HPMC and genipin to the solder increased the post-hydration BS of PLGA-ssLAVW. SSPL regimen reduced thermal damage. PLGA-ssLAVW using 48 % BSA/ 0. 5 % MB/ 3 % HPMC/ 0. 38 % genipin solder and SSPL constitutes the most optimal welding modality. Relevance for patients: Surgical patients requiring vascular anastomoses may benefit from the advantages that ssLAVW potentially offers over conventional (gold standard) sutures. These include no needle trauma and remnant suture materials in the patient, reduction of foreign body reaction, immediate <b>liquid-tight</b> sealing, {{and the possibility of}} a faster and easier procedure for minimally invasive and endoscopic anastomotic techniques...|$|E
