40|$|In the 1990 s, {{emerging}} economies {{all over}} the world deregulated, privatized and liberalized their domestic markets. These regulatory punctuations caused radical institutional changes for emerging market firms (EMFs). We argue that, for EMFs, regulatory punctuations created a <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> localness, parallel to the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness that firms face when they go abroad. Whereas <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness comes from the differences caused by changing one's geographic place from 'here' to 'there'; <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> localness comes from changing one's point in time from 'then' (pre-exogenous regulatory shock) to 'now' (post-exogenous regulatory shock).

It has been proved that <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness is a concept where newcomers are especially vulnerable and sensitive to the market. This means that <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness is an obstacle during the early phase of a real estate agents career. Some of the important qualifications to master the barrier <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness are networking, personal branding and communications. Problem: What is the meaning of networks, personal brand and communication of a newly graduated real estate agent in mastering the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness? Purpose: The purpose of the study is to create a conceptual framework of newly graduated real estate brokers to understand how networks, personal brand and communication impact the mastery <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness. This framework is developed to get {{a better understanding of how}} a newly graduated real estate broker can master the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness during the first five years. The theoretical framework: The theoretical framework of our study is about the concept <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> newness. Where we immerse ourselves in networking, personal branding and communication is one of the success factors during the first five years. Method: We have been using a qualitative and intense study for this essay.

40|$|Entering {{host country}} {{networks}} of knowledge flows (new competencies, innovative technologies, and lead-market knowledge) {{is a major}} rationale of multinational firms for investing abroad. Foreign firms {{find it difficult to}} overcome cultural and social barriers which make their foreign engagements more strenuous and error prone (<b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness). In our analysis we break down the complex mechanisms behind knowledge spillovers and identify conceptual links with <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness. We hypothesise that <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness acts as a filter for foreign firms, restricting their access to host country knowledge. We use a broad sample of roughly 1, 000 firms in Germany to empirically test the existence <b>of</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> foreignness in leveraging knowledge spillovers. Our particular setting allows us to distinguish between upstream (suppliers, academia) and downstream (customers) <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> foreignness. We find that multinational firms can compete on an equal footing with host country rivals when it comes to generating impulses for innovations from suppliers and academia. They are significantly challenged by <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> foreignness, though, where customers are involved. We suggest that the frictional losses from a lack of social and cultural embeddedness (<b>liability</b> <b>of</b> foreignness) in the host country are especially relevant when promising lead customers have to be identified and their tacit and often unarticulated impulses have to be transferred, understood and prioritised. ...|$|R
