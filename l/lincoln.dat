Willie <b>Lincoln,</b> Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of typhoid on February 20, 1862. Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President Lyndon B.

5|$|Abraham <b>Lincoln</b> {{was born}} February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas and Nancy Hanks <b>Lincoln,</b> in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was a {{descendant}} of Samuel <b>Lincoln,</b> an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake of Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's western migration, which passed through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham <b>Lincoln,</b> moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky, in the 1780s. Captain <b>Lincoln</b> {{was killed in an}} Indian raid in 1786. His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, the future president's father, witnessed the attack. After his father's murder, Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier, working at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee, before settling with members of his family in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, <b>Lincoln</b> {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to put down the rebellion. <b>Lincoln</b> encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. <b>Lincoln</b> was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, <b>Lincoln</b> had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E

There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, <b>Lincoln</b> still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E
50|$|The Contingent left Bermuda for England in June 1915, {{travelling}} to Canada, then {{crossing the}} Atlantic in {{company with a}} much larger Canadian draft. It had been hoped that the Contingent could {{be attached to the}} Second Battalion of The Lincolnshire Regiment (2 <b>Lincolns),</b> which had been on Garrison in Bermuda when the War began. When the Contingent arrived at the <b>Lincolns</b> depot in Grimsby, the 2nd Battalion was already in France and it was attached to 3 <b>Lincolns</b> instead (at least one Bermudian, though not from the BVRC, Corporal G.C. Wailes, did serve with the 2nd <b>Lincolns).</b> Although commanders at the Regimental Depot had wanted to break the Contingent apart, re-enlist its members as <b>Lincolns,</b> and distribute them as replacements, a letter from the War Office ensured that they remained together as a unit, under their own badge. The contingent was attached to 1 <b>Lincolns</b> (although its men remained on the strength of 3 <b>Lincolns)</b> as an extra company, and arrived in France in July 1915, the first colonial volunteer unit to reach the Front. The contingent remained as such until the following summer, by when its strength had been too reduced by casualties to compose a full company, having lost 50 percent of its remaining strength at Gueudecourt on 25 September 1916.|$|R

5|$|An astute {{politician}} {{deeply involved}} with power issues in each state, <b>Lincoln</b> {{reached out to}} the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election. Anticipating the war's conclusion, <b>Lincoln</b> pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, <b>Lincoln</b> was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth and died the next day. <b>Lincoln</b> has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Seward {{comes to}} respect and {{collaborate}} with <b>Lincoln.</b> Chase, on the other hand, schemes against <b>Lincoln</b> from within the cabinet, hoping to replace him as the Republican nominee in the 1864 presidential election. <b>Lincoln</b> nonetheless keeps Chase in the cabinet until 1864 for his skill at financing the war effort, and his efforts to undermine the president are ultimately unsuccessful. <b>Lincoln</b> also recruits Chase ally Edwin M. Stanton to replace Pennsylvania political boss Simon Cameron as Secretary of War; like Seward, Stanton comes {{to respect and}} support <b>Lincoln.</b> While managing the disparate personalities of his cabinet, <b>Lincoln</b> also struggles to manage a series of generals including George B. McClellan, Henry Halleck, and George Meade. The president finally finds success in 1864 by promoting Ulysses S. Grant to commander of the Union armies. <b>Lincoln</b> oversees {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolishes slavery, and sees the war to its successful conclusion. He also appoints Chase as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, believing him the best man to secure the rights of newly freed black citizens.|$|E
5|$|Foliot was a {{canon of}} <b>Lincoln</b> Cathedral by 1147, and an {{official}} of Alexander of <b>Lincoln,</b> the Bishop of <b>Lincoln,</b> who secured Foliot's early promotions in the church.
