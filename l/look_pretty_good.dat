40|$|Ever {{wonder where}} the term “populist” came from? It came from “Populism,” a nineteenth/early twentieth-century American {{political}} movement.

All this and more I learned from Charles Postel and his award-winning book The Populist Vision (Oxford, 2007). The Populists have a bad name (as does Populism, for that matter). It seems that historians erroneously branded them “backward-looking” because most of them were, well, farmers, and farmers are always “backward-looking” don’t you know. Charles does a terrific job of correcting this libel. The Populists were the farthest thing from “backward-looking. ” By almost any contemporary measure, they were forward-looking. They favored market rationalization, labor organization, welfare, education, and even the emancipation of women. They also hated the Gold Standard, which is progressive in my book. There were some warts–the Populists generally favored racial segregation, which they viewed as progressive (so did a lot of other folks at the time).

40|$|The term {{poisoned}} chalice wasn’t coined for nothing, writes PETER BRENT IF winning elections was {{all about}} ability, energy and determination, the Coalition would be the strong favourite to take government in 2010. If the just-minted Malcolm Turnbull isn’t the most centred, talented individual ever to occupy the position of federal opposition leader, he must come close. But winning elections is not mainly about those things. Timing is more important. If a government is ready to lose, a competent opposition will beat it. Otherwise, forget about it. And while the continuing bad news from Wall Street makes it just possible this will happen in 2010, Turnbull is unlikely to still be Liberal leader. Assuming a three-year term, the next election is twenty-six months away. No federal opposition leader has lasted that long since Kim Beazley stood down in 2001. And, Gough Whitlam aside, all successful federal opposition leaders in living memory were installed only months out from their winning election. (John Howard’s 1995 - 96 tenure, at fourteen months, was the longest.) This is partly because an election on the horizon keeps the troops focused and the job secure. It’s also because electors get quickly tired of whinging Opposition leaders (and {{there is no other}} kind). This is why Tuesday’s Liberal party-room vote has very likely dealt a mortal blow to Turnbull’s prime ministerial ambitions. The most likely course of events sees him being toppled some time in the next two years, his political brand trashed. Just imagine the tight leadership vote last December had gone the other way. Today it would be Turnbull who had just been chewed up and spat out by the worst job in politics. And Brendan Nelson, rather than having to recover from ten months of horror, would instead be the heir apparent. Journalists would hang off his every word. It’s in the timing. Nelson wasn’t a bad opposition leader. His schmaltzy brave-heart earnestness and populist instincts could have worked well against an old and vulnerable government, particularly one led by a clinical control freak. He was just {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time. Now Turnbull is there. The Liberal Party hopes the tumultuous days are now over, but the term poisoned chalice wasn’t coined for nothing. The position determines the person more than vice versa. Perhaps after a decent honeymoon, opinion polls are likely to fall back into line, once again regularly showing the opposition lagging behind the government. If not at first, then eventually. Several dozen Newpolls doing their fortnightly work, chip-chipping at his leadership. Two years is too long. It is a mundane fact that new governments can usually expect at least two terms, which means that the first opposition leader rarely wins. It’s not lack of talent; on the contrary, they are often the best and brightest. But no first-off opposition leader has become prime minister since 1914. Instead, they have capped off an otherwise much-admired public life with disappointment and, indeed, personal sadness. Clever Peter Costello for avoiding that fate. The former treasurer 2 ̆ 7 s decision not to run last December shows he understands the cyclical dynamics. He could still take the leadership any time, but continues to reject it, while not quite ruling it out for the future. Vanity - the need for attention - probably plays a part, as do those publishing requirements. But it surely also indicates he doesn’t think the time is yet right. If he took the job now, he would be unlikely to last until the election. Even if he did last, he probably wouldn’t win. Instead, the position would ruin him. If Costello remains in parliament beyond the new year, we can reasonably infer he still covets the leadership but is waiting in the hope that it becomes something worth having. In which case, he may be the big winner out of yesterday’s vote. There is one condition that would create a real chance of a Coalition victory in 2010, and that’s a flattened economy. The odds of that happening <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> at the moment, and better with every piece of news from the United States. The last one-term Australian federal government came to office in a landslide in 1929. A week later, Wall Street crashed, and the consequent Depression buried it, as it did governments around the world. So there is a small chance the Rudd government will lose the next election. Unfortunately for Turnbull, if this gift does come, the lap it falls into is unlikely to be his. Yes, a recession would give the Coalition a real chance of victory. But only an early election could deliver this result to Turnbull. Otherwise it would pass to his successor. Which may just be Costello. • Peter Brent is the publisher of mumble. com. au and a member of the Democratic Audit of Australia. This article first appeared in the Australian.

40|$|As amply {{demonstrated}} by the chapters in this volume, computer applications have pervaded all aspects of psychological practice. Although thought {{by some to be}} relatively new (Nolen 2 ̆ 6 Spencer, 1986), semiautomatic scoring of the Strong Vocational Interest Blank was accomplished more than 50 years ago (Campbell, 1968) and systems of computer-based test interpretation have been operational for 25 years (Fowler, 1985). DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION PROGRAMS Early automated programs typically focused upon the scoring or interpretation of a single psychological test. Most frequently, that test was the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Fowler, 1985) but the Rorschach was interpreted as well (Piotrowski, 1964). In addition to automated interpretation, there were attempts to administer existing psychological tests directly by computer. The MMPI was again the test of choice (Lushene, O 2 ̆ 7 Neil, 2 ̆ 6 Dunn, 1974) although the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Elwood, 1972), Slosson Intelligence Test (Hedl, O 2 ̆ 7 Neil, 2 ̆ 6 Hansen, 1973), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Klinge 2 ̆ 6 Rodziewicz, 1976), and the California Psychological Inventory (Scissons, 1976) were also administered by computer. Efforts to equate the conventional MMPI with computer-administered versions have continued unabated. White, Clements, and Fowler (1985) administered the full-length MMPI via microcomputer and standard booklet to 150 volunteer undergraduates. The two MMPI versions were generally equivalent in terms of mean scale scores, test- retest correlations, and stability of high-point codes. There was, however, a greater tendency for the computerized version to result in larger numbers of 2 ̆ 2 cannot say 2 ̆ 2 responses. Rozensky, Honor, Rasinski, Tovian, 2 ̆ 6 Herz (1986) investigated the attitudes of psychiatric patients to computerized vs. conventional MMPI administrations. The computer group found the testing experience to be more interesting, more positive, and less anxiety-provoking than did the paper-and-pencil group. The equivalency of other conventional personality (Katz 2 ̆ 6 Dalby, 1981; Lukin, Dowd, Plake, 2 ̆ 6 Kraft, 1985; Skinner 2 ̆ 6 Allen, 1983; Wilson, Genco, 2 ̆ 6 Yager, 1986), neuropsychological (DeMita, Johnson, 2 ̆ 6 Hansen, 1981), cognitive ability (Beaumont, 1981; Eller, Kaufman, 2 ̆ 6 McLean, 1986), and academic (Andolina, 1982; Wise 2 ̆ 6 Wise, 1987) tests to their computerized versions are also being widely explored. The promise of parallel automated test forms has provoked investigations of the differences between computerized and conventional item presentations and their possible impact upon test reliability and validity (Hofer 2 ̆ 6 Green, 1985). Jackson (1985) reviewed the evidence regarding equivalence of conventional and computerized tests and posited four methodological differences: (1) modifications in the method of presenting stimulus material; (2) differences in the task required of the examinee; (3) differences in the format for recording responses; and (4) differences in the method of interpretation. Despite these threats to equivalence, Moreland (1985) opined that 2 ̆ 2 the bulk of the evidence on computer adaptions of paper-and-pencil questionnaires points to the tentative conclusion that non-equivalence is typically small enough to be of no practical consequence, if present at all 2 ̆ 2 (p. 224). A more cautious note was sounded by Hofer and Green (1985). They suggested that for most computer-presented tests, 2 ̆ 2 practitioners will have to use good judgment in interpreting computer-obtained scores, based on the available but inconclusive evidence 2 ̆ 2 (p. 831). This conservative opinion seems well founded if automated testing is to influence the critical classification, placement, and treatment decisions made by psychologists. Computer-interpreted Tests Computerized interpretation of the MMPI has remained a major line of inquiry. Honaker, Hector, and Harrell (1986) asked psychology graduate students and practicing psychologists to rate the accuracy of interpretative reports for the MMPI that wee labeled as generated by either a computer or licensed psychologist. Their results demonstrated similar accuracy ratings for computer-generated and clinician-generated reports and did not support the claim that computergenerated reports are assigned more credibility than is warranted. Butcher (1987) reviewed early MMPI systems, summarized desirable attributes of automated systems, and described the development and use of the Minnesota Clinical Interpretive Report (University of Minnesota Press, 1982) computerized MMPI interpretive system. Limited attention has been given to automated interpretations of other personality tests (Exner, 1987; Greene, Martin, Bennett, 2 ̆ 6 Shaw, 1981; Harris, Niedner, Feldman, Fink, 2 ̆ 6 Johnston, 1981; Lachar, 1984), neuropsychological measures (Adams 2 ̆ 6 Heaton, 1985; Adams, Kvale, 2 ̆ 6 Keegan, 1984), and ability and achievement instruments (Brantley, 1986; Hasselbring 2 ̆ 6 Crossland, 1981; Johnson, Willis, 2 ̆ 6 Danley, 1982; Oosterhof 2 ̆ 6 Salisbury, 1985; Webb, Herman, 2 ̆ 6 Cabello, 1986). As noted by Moreland (1985), investigations of the accuracy of computerbased clinical interpretations of personality tests have been limited almost exclusively to the MMPI. A thorough review of the types of MMPI validity studies, computer interpretation systems, and outcomes are presented by Moreland (1987). He summarized these findings by concluding: Things <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> for computer-based MMPI interpretations. Consumers give them high marks, and the results of properly controlled studies indicate that this high acceptance rate is not the result of generalized reports that are equally applicable to most clients. (p. 43) In contrast, Matarazzo (1985) noted that currently available automated interpretation systems are erected upon rather tenuous empirical bases and involve varying degrees of clinical and actuarial data accumulation and interpretation which have considerable potential for harm if used in isolation. These disparate views can be reconciled by Butcher 2 ̆ 7 s (1987) assertion that the computerized report should be used 2 ̆ 2 only in conjunction with clinical information obtained from other sources 2 ̆ 2 (p. 167) ...|$|E
