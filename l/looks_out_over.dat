South of Sauls' Mound, a boardwalk <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the South Fork of the Forked Deer River and its wetlands. The park is also the site of Archaeofest, an event held every September that celebrates the site's prehistoric builders.|$|E

Trees tend to grow around houses in this region, such {{that when one}} <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> eastern Massachusetts {{from the top of}} a high hill, one sees a vista of treetops, punctuated only occasionally by a church steeple, smokestack, or radio tower.|$|E

The entryway, which resembles a Roman triumphal arch, is decorated with the initials of Gilles Berthelot and his wife, while the pediments overhanging each window bay are carved with the salamander and ermine of Francis I and his wife, Claude of France, in honour to the monarch of the time.|$|E

The panelled dining room, [...] long and [...] wide, has a wall-top Italian Grisaille frieze and a Khorassan carpet, as well as chairs containing the needlework of the 5th Duke's wife. The drawing room, made from two previous rooms by Lorimer during his restoration of the castle, <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the gardens and sea, and contains large Canalettos and 18th-century tapestries, as well as portraits by Hoppner and Reynolds. Housing over 10,000 books, the library features a painting by Philip de László of Duchess Eileen, {{as well as a}} mahogany Chippendale table.|$|E

500|$|Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} while he enjoyed the song, he was unsure about the video. He commented that while the video was an {{improvement}} since Cyrus's video for [...] "7 Things" [...] (2008), the settings in [...] "The Climb" [...] music video looked {{as though they had}} been painted by Thomas Kinkade and Cyrus's dancing appeared off-beat. Travis of MTV described the video as [...] "beautifully shot (although heavily digitized)". Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music remarked that the summit setting was {{similar to that of the}} music video for Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". Parker also felt the scene in which Cyrus <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the cliff, shot using large sweeps with an aerial camera, had been [...] "lifted straight out of an '80s Bon Jovi video". In 2009, the video received a MuchMusic Video nomination for Best International Artist Video, but lost to Lady Gaga's music video for [...] "Poker Face".|$|E
2500|$|INAH {{completed}} a {{restoration of the}} building in 2007. It is relatively short, only [...] high, and is [...] in length and [...] wide. The long, western-facing façade has seven doorways. The eastern façade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase {{that leads to the}} roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> what is today a steep, dry, cenote.|$|E
2500|$|The main façade <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> lawns with {{magnificent}} specimen trees, then across undulating meadows {{which give}} {{glimpses of the}} follies and water features, and finally upwards over the rising forest until the view is cut off at the horizon created by {{the top of the}} ridge. No buildings are visible from this direction. (The planned railway line - see below - will run parallel to this façade at a distance of some 250m.) ...|$|E

When the husband sees Hester's shame, he asks {{a man in the}} crowd about her and is told the story of his wife's adultery. He angrily exclaims that the child's father, the partner in the adulterous act, should also be punished and vows to find the man. He chooses a new name [...] Roger Chillingworth [...] to aid him in his plan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{implantation}} of {{the building}} observes an approximate sorthwest-southeast orientation in profound articulation with the garden. From the garden which circulates around the Villa from behind, visitors can observe the extensive facade, which <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the Rua de Serralves. The main entrance is formed by a semicircular widening of the exterior wall, framed beneath a glass canopy. There is also a side entrance via a patio encased between the main building and the chapel. From the street, the building has a relatively sober and closed appearance to the exterior. By contrast the facade overlooking the garden includes wide or long rectangular windows that accompany {{the rhythm of the}} sober lines of geometry that define the building’s overall form and volumetry. Viewed as a whole, the Villa is a testimony to art deco style, which came into vogue with the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris. In the words of Eurico Cabral, the nephew of the Count of Vizela: “ In 1925 he visited the famous decorative arts exhibition in Paris. There he began to establish contact with various leading French artists, including Jacques Gréber - the landscape architect.” ...|$|E

60|$|After lecturing I {{went to the}} Club that night, {{and that}} was a {{comfortable}} place. It is loftily situated, and <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> a vast spread of scenery; from it you can see where the boundaries of three countries come together, some thirty miles away; Thibet is one of them, Nepaul another, and I think Herzegovina was the other. Apparently, in every town and city in India the gentlemen of the British civil and military service have a club; sometimes it is a palatial one, always it is pleasant and homelike. The hotels are not always as good as they might be, and the stranger who has access to the Club is grateful for his privilege and knows how to value it.|$|E

Round Exton, and Normanton, {{and that other}} Burley on the Hill; on through those Morkery woods, which still retain the name of Hereward's ill-fated nephew; north by Irnham and Corby; on to Belton and Syston (par nobile), and southwest again to those still wooded heights, whence all-but-royal Belvoir <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the rich green vale below, did Hereward and his men range far and wide, harrying the Frenchman, and hunting the dun deer.

The Palace is not a [...] "show place," [...] and, consequently, the Englishman did not see much of the interior. But he passed through open gardens with tanks and pavilions, very cool and restful, till he came suddenly upon the Pichola lake, and forgot altogether about the Palace. He found a sheet of steel-blue water, set in purple and grey hills, bound in, on one side, by marble bunds, the fair white walls of the Palace, and the grey, time-worn ones of the city; and, on the other, fading away through the white of shallow water, and the soft green of weed, marsh, and rank-pastured river-field, into the land.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny {{was delighted}} {{when the news}} reached her. It would of course be proper {{that one of his}} sisters should live with Mark under their present circumstances, and she was happy to think that that quiet little bright-eyed {{creature}} was to come and nestle with her under the same roof. The children should so love her--only not quite so much as they loved mamma; and the snug little room that <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the porch, in which the chimney never smokes, should be made ready for her; and she should be allowed her share of driving the pony--which was a great sacrifice of self on the part of Mrs. Robarts--and Lady Lufton's best good-will should be bespoken. In fact, Lucy was not unfortunate in the destination that was laid out for her. Lady Lufton had of course heard of the doctor's death, and had sent all manner of kind messages to Mark, advising him not to hurry home by any means until everything was settled at Exeter. And then she was told of the new-comer that was expected in the parish. When she heard that it was Lucy, the younger, she also was satisfied; for Blanche's charms, though indisputable, had not been altogether to her taste. If a second Blanche were to arrive there what danger might there not be for young Lord Lufton! [...] "Quite right," [...] said her ladyship, [...] "just what he ought to do. I think I remember the young lady; rather small, is she not, and very retiring?" ...|$|E
