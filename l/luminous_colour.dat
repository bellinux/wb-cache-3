2500|$|The {{introduction}} of oil painting {{changed the way}} colours looked {{and how they were}} used. [...] Ultramarine pigment, for instance, was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in tempera painting, in frescoes. [...] To balance their colours, Renaissance artists like Raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine. [...] The sombre dark blue robe of the Virgin Mary became a brilliant sky blue. Titian created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through, which made a complex and <b>luminous</b> <b>colour,</b> like stained glass. He also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine, which gave subtle variations to the blue.|$|E
60|$|The spacious amphitheatre {{was open}} to the sky, and all its tiers of stone benches packed with excited humanity, for half the {{inhabitants}} of the island had apparently gathered to enjoy the sanguinary spectacle. Black is the colour affected by men who can afford it on a Spanish holiday, but the white cotton the bare-legged hillmen wore, and the pink and chrome of their wives' and daughters' dresses, flecked with <b>luminous</b> <b>colour</b> the sombre ranks of the close-packed multitude. Blazing sunlight beat down upon them, for it is only the richer citizens who sit in the shadow, and the topmost row was projected, a filagree of black and motley, against the hard glaring blue. Below, the arena shone dazzlingly yellow, and the smell of blood and fresh sawdust came up from it through the many-toned murmur of the crowd. When this sank a little one could hear the deep boom of the Atlantic swell crumbling on the lava beach.|$|E

5000|$|Born in Rodez, Aveyron, in 1919, Soulages is {{also known}} as [...] "the painter of black," [...] owing to his {{interest}} in the colour [...] "both as a colour and a non-colour. When light is reflected on black, it transforms and transmutes it. It opens a mental field all its own." [...] He sees light as a work material; striations of the black surface of his paintings enable him to reflect light, allowing the black to come out of darkness and into brightness, thus becoming a <b>luminous</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E

Bolt's paintings shimmered with washes of <b>luminous</b> <b>colour</b> that shifted and dissolved to draw in the viewer. They pulsated with vibrating visual effects that unsettled vision. They fused fields of electric colour that overwhelmed the viewer, {{and it is in}} these ways that they generated what the artist called an "affecting presence"...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} Flemish Primitives, a {{group of}} 15 th-century painters from the Southern Netherlands, acquired their name in the 19 th century. Among them were the world-famous artists such as Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling, the brothers Van Eyck, and Hugo van der Goes. Their masterpieces, oil paintings minutely detailed in <b>luminous</b> <b>colour,</b> are a high point of Western European art, which, together with the Italian Renaissance paintings, laid foundations for the modern art. This scholarly in-depth analysis focuses on the artistic, religious an social significance of their art, {{as well as how}} the paintings themselves were collected, evaluated and studied over the centuries...|$|E

In 1929 he enrolled at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. His paintings remained purely academic until he discovered, during his stay in London from 1935 to 1937, the abstract art and <b>luminous</b> <b>colours</b> of the Egyptian sarcophagi. It was a little afterwards that he met Wassily Kandinsky, Sonia and Robert Delaunay, and Otto Freundlich.|$|R

In these works I explore how First Nations subjectivity can inhabit painting as an index of my presence inscribed through repetitive vertical lines I call “opens,” “pops,” and “riffs. ” For me, vertical lines, repeating gesture and <b>luminous</b> <b>colour</b> contrasts indicate First Nations presence, memory and connections to the greater social world...|$|E
25|$|Raphael was a {{carefree}} {{character who}} unashamedly {{drew on the}} skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and <b>luminous</b> <b>colours</b> of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling, a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which the School of Athens is uniquely significant.|$|R
50|$|In 1573 Veronese {{completed}} the commission for The Feast in the House of Levi, a last-supper painting for the rear {{wall of the}} refectory at the Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Castello, Venice. Originally titled The Last Supper, the painting was to replace a Titian painting burnt in a fire; Veronese's oversized (5.55m x 12.80m) replacement depicted a Last Supper banquet scene that included German soldiers, dwarves, and animals — the human and animal exotica usual to Veronese's representational narratives. Artistically, The Feast in the House of Levi indicates Veronese's technical development in using intense and <b>luminous</b> <b>colours</b> for texture, attention to narrative coherence, the acute representation of human emotion, and the psychologically subtle interplay occurring among the characters who crowd the scene.|$|R

Eric Bourdon bends kind monsters into shape who glide gracefully among a faun of individuals whose silhouettes are of the most amazing, plump or lanky, always infinitly sympathetic and delighted to come to stimulate our dormant child souls." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of the Belle Heures occurred before the Renaissance of the late 15th and early 16th century when it moved from Italy to other European states. Millard Meiss describes the Belles Heures, and the Très Riches Heures that followed it, are the most impressive group of paintings produced in Europe {{in the early part}} of the 15th century. The bright colours predate the similar style to emerge from Italy closer to the middle of the 15th century. <b>Luminous</b> <b>colours</b> used in the Belle Heures entered the mainstream of 15th-century paintings. Not long after its creation, colour began to fade in importance and dark hues and shadowing began to emerge in the late 15th century. Thus, the Belle Heures was one of the last few manuscripts to be coloured in this manner.|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the <b>colour</b> (<b>luminous</b> reflectance) of a material can greatly influence the measurement of reflection haze. As colour and haze are both components of scattered light (diffuse reflectance) they must be separated so that only the haze value is quantified; this is also true for metallics or coatings containing metallic pigments where a higher scattering exists.|$|R
50|$|With Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael's name {{is synonymous}} with the High Renaissance, {{although}} he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30. It cannot be said of him that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work {{was the culmination of}} all the developments of the High Renaissance.Raphael had the good luck to be born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the Umbrian workshop of Perugino, an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the Betrothal of the Virgin, which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's Christ giving the Keys to Peter.Raphael was a carefree character who unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and <b>luminous</b> <b>colours</b> of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael.

60|$|The whole descent {{is like a}} {{dream to}} me, so rapidly was it accomplished. I had {{scarcely}} left the summit ere the valley had closed round my path, and the sun beat upon me, walking in a stagnant lowland atmosphere. The track became a road, and {{went up and down}} in easy undulations. I passed cabin after cabin, but all seemed deserted; and I saw not a human creature, nor heard any sound except that of the stream. I was, however, in a different country from the day before. The stony skeleton of the world was here vigorously displayed to sun and air. The slopes were steep and changeful. Oak-trees clung along the hills, well grown, wealthy in leaf, and touched by the autumn with strong and <b>luminous</b> <b>colours.</b> Here and there another stream would fall in from the right or the left, down a gorge of snow-white and tumultuary boulders. The river in the bottom (for it was rapidly growing a river, collecting on all hands as it trotted on its way) here foamed a while in desperate rapids, and there lay in pools of the most enchanting sea-green shot with watery browns. As far as I have gone, I have never seen a river of so changeful and delicate a hue; crystal was not more clear, the meadows were not by half so green; and at every pool I saw I felt a thrill of longing to be out of these hot, dusty, and material garments, and bathe my naked body in the mountain air and water. All the time as I went on I never forgot it was the Sabbath; the stillness was a perpetual reminder; and I heard in spirit the church-bells clamouring all over Europe, and the psalms of a thousand churches.|$|R
50|$|THE WHITE GONELLA OR WHITE DRESS A <b>luminous</b> white <b>colour,</b> {{consisting}} of the same garments as the gonella (underskirts, jerkin, apron, shawl and scarf), but with some particularities. A hat is never worn. The bride layered on underskirts until their width no longer allowed her {{to pass through the}} door of her bedroom. The jewels are made from gold. This was generally the dowry that her family contributed to the wedding. The cross, la joia, hung with eighteen spans of golden braid (6 or 7 times over the chest) and two or three necklaces. The sleeves were adorned with gold buttons. The rings could be in different shapes - the family seal, the heart and key to the house, etc. These were gifts from her fiancee, with a total of twenty-four rings.|$|R
