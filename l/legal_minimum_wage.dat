30|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{compliance with}} monthly <b>legal</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> we present evidence that few workers {{are likely to}} see their total <b>wages</b> change when <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> increase. This is because the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is below the market wage for {{almost all of the}} Chinese workers in our sample. Workers in formal sector firms in China are paid a “basic wage” plus supplements for transportation, risk, etc., plus a bonus related to productivity. All workers with the same position in the same firm (who do the same job) receive the same basic wage, which is determined prior to performing the work. Bonuses, on the other hand, depend on performance, may differ between workers in the same position in the firm, and are not determined until after the work is performed. <b>Minimum</b> <b>wages</b> appear to be taken into consideration by many firms when setting the basic wage. We find that basic wages are set at exactly the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> for a relatively large fraction of workers. However, once bonuses and supplements are taken into account, almost all workers earn more than the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b> We also find that there is a positive correlation between the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> and the basic wage. On the other hand, we find that there is a negative correlation between the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> and the bonus. For most workers, the higher basic wage and lower bonus cancel each other out and the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is not significantly correlated with the total wage. Only for workers in the most labor-intensive firms and low profit/revenue firms are higher <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> significantly correlated with higher total wages. These firms, where workers {{are most likely to be}} affected by <b>legal</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> are disproportionately export-oriented firms located in the more developed eastern Chinese provinces such as Guangdong.|$|R
