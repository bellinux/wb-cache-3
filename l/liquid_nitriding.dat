40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} the need for Surface Hardening in Crankshafts and establishing Induction Hardening as the most practically viable process for the same. Crankshaft is one of the largest components in the internal combustion engine that has a complex geometry consisting of cylinders as bearings and plates as the crank webs. Geometry section changes in the crankshaft cause stress concentration at fillet areas where bearings are connected to the crank webs. In addition, this component experiences both torsional and bending load during its service life. The crankshaft must be capable of withstanding the intermittent variable loads impressed on it. The principal purpose of Surface Hardening is to increase the hardness, wear resistance and endurance limit of the surfaces of metal components. The core remains tough and can withstand impact loads. Prior to the advent of Induction Hardening methods such as furnace hardening, flame hardening and <b>liquid</b> <b>nitriding</b> were used. However each of these processes presented problems such as inadequate or non-uniform hardening and distortion. Induction Hardening overcomes many of these problems through rotation of the part during heat-treating and selection of frequency and power to obtain adequate case depth and uniform hardness...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} “Failure Analysis of Internal splines in Torsion Shaft” of “TPE 331 - 5 - 252 D - GARRET ENGINE” {{which is used}} in Dornier aircraft. Garret Engine {{is a type of}} air {{breathing}} engine. It comes under the category of Turboprop engines of Gas turbine engine. As separate shafts are used for propeller and turbine, this aids them to rotate at different RPM. A torsion shaft is used to transmit the torque from main shaft to propeller shaft. Torsion shaft is used to give a deflection which is also used to measure the torque of the engine. This torsion shaft is internally connected with the main power transmission shaft and its other end is coupled to a coupler shaft with engagement of its internal splines to the external splines of coupler shaft. Further this coupler connects to the gearing system and transmits power to the propeller shaft. Due to Continues variable load over internal splines, it is subjected to high rate of wear and tear. This problem can be rectified by Failure Mode Analysis Method, in which heat treatment process of torsion shaft is being carried out. Two test pieces are heat treated separately at different temperatures of 5800 C and 5400 C at variable time durations. Tuffriding which is a <b>Liquid</b> <b>nitriding</b> process is done with this two test pieces and results are analyzed. The hardness of the material is increased to desired values and its life time is also increased which overcomes the problem...|$|E

40|$|We present liquid-cell {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (liquid-cell TEM) imaging of fixed and non-fixed prostate cancer cells (PC 3 and LNCaP) with high resolution in a custom developed silicon <b>nitride</b> <b>liquid</b> cell. Fixed PC 3 cells were imaged for 90 – 120 min without any discernable damage. High contrast on the cellular structures was obtained even at low electron doses (~ 2. 5 e - /nm 2 per image). The images show distinct structures of cell compartments (nuclei and nucleoli) and cell boundaries without any further sample embedding, dehydration, or staining. Furthermore, we observed dynamics of vesicles trafficking from the cell membrane in consecutive still frames in a non-fixed cell. Our findings show that liquid-cell TEM, operated at low electron dose, is an excellent tool to investigate dynamic events in non-fixed cells with enough spatial resolution (few nm) and natural amplitude contrast to follow key intracellular processes...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} dataset for the Al 2 O 3 -Al 4 C 3 -AlN {{system was}} reassessed {{and that of}} the Al 4 C 3 -AlN-SiC system was developed in present study for the first time based on available literature data using the CALPHAD approach. In the Al 2 O 3 -Al 4 C 3 -AlN system and its subsystems the liquid was described as single phase using the partially ionic liquid model {Mathematical expression}, which covers compositions from the metallic liquid to the oxide, carbide and <b>nitride</b> <b>liquids.</b> The compound energy formalism was used for modeling of the solid phases in both studied systems. Ternary phases gamma and beta of the Al 4 C 3 -AlN-SiC system were treated as stoichiometric compounds. A four sublattice model was proposed in order to describe the alpha-solid solution forming between the isostructural Al 5 C 3 N and Al 4 SiC 4 binary phases. Using the derived datasets the isothermal sections at 1600, 2273 and 2373 K for the Al 2 O 3 -Al 4 C 3 -AlN system and at 2133 K for the Al 4 C 3 -AlN-SiC system were constructed. The calculated phase diagrams of both ternary systems were compared with the available experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of Y-alpha-SiAlON ceramics by controlling microstructure and tailoring grain boundary composition. Three properties of importance for engineering applications were targeted: strength retention and oxidation resistance at high temperature, fracture toughness at room temperature, and machinability. As {{a result of this}} work, several ceramics with {{one or more of the}} above properties optimized have been developed. ^ The performance of Si 3 N 4 /SiAlON-based ceramics at high (3 ̆e 1000 degree C) temperature is generally limited by the softening of grain-boundary glass. Refractory alpha-SiAlONs was obtained by three methods: reducing residual <b>liquid</b> by minimizing <b>nitride</b> powder oxidation during processing, promoting liquid/SiAlON conversion by adding excess AlN, and improving refractoriness by incorporating La 2 O 3 into glass. Ceramics thus, obtained featured excellent room-temperature strength (1050 MPa) and high-temperature strength (650 MPa at 1300 degree C), as well as good oxidation resistance. In all cases grain growth was inhibited, which resulted in a relatively low toughness (5 – 7 MPa x m 1 / 2). ^ In-situ toughened Y-alpha-SiAlON (9 MPa x m 1 / 2) was obtained through growth of large elongated grains with low debonding strength. This was achieved by introducing seed crystals to the starting powder mixtures, in addition to using sintering aids and dopants. Additives modified the properties of grain boundary glass, while dopants lowered the strength of glass/grain interface. Through the use of nanosized turbostratic BN precursor obtained via pyrolysis of melamine borate salt, which yielded finely dispersed hexagonal BN particles in alpha-SiAlON, high-strength (800 MPa) Y-alpha-SiAlON/BN composites, machinable using WC/Co tools, were also fabricated. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, and fuel {{performance}} aspects of using nitride fuel {{in place of}} oxides in Pu-based high conversion light water reactor designs. Using the higher density nitride fuel hardens the neutron energy spectrum and results in higher breeding ratios. The state-of-the-art high conversion light water reactor, the Resource-renewable Boiling Water Reactor (RBWR), served as the template core upon which comparative studies between nitride and oxide fuels were performed. A 1 / 3 core reactor physics model was developed for the RBWR using the stochastic transport code MCNP. The code was coupled with a lumped channel thermal-hydraulics 5 -channel model for steady-state analyses. The depletion code MCODE, which links MCNP with ORIGEN, was used for all burnup calculations. Select physics parameters were calculated and {{with the exception of}} the void coefficients, agreed with reported data. The void coefficients of the coupled core were calculated to be slightly positive using two different methods (10 % power increase and 5 % flow reduction). The standard RBWR assembly designs, which use tight lattice hexagonal fuel rod arrays, with oxide fuel were then replaced with various nitride fuel assembly designs to determine the potential increase in breeding ratio, the potential to breed with pressurized water, and the potential to improve the critical power ratio with a wider pin pitch. Without changing the assembly geometry or discharge burnup, using nitride fuel resulted in a breeding ratio of 1. 14. Using single-phase <b>liquid</b> water, the <b>nitride</b> fuel RBWR assembly resulted in a conversion ratio of 1. 00. Another nitride fuel assembly design with boiling water maintained a 1. 04 breeding ratio while increasing the pitch-to-diameter ratio from 1. 13 to 1. 20. This modification increased the hot assembly critical power ratio from 1. 22 to 1. 36, as calculated using the Liu- 2007 correlation. A high-porosity nitride fuel is recommended for high burnup conditions, to accommodate the nitride fuel’s higher swelling and less favorable mechanical properties compared to the oxide fuel. The high porosity allows additional volume for pressure-induced densification, alleviating swelling and subsequent cladding strain. To predict the performance of high-porosity nitride fuel, fission gas and fuel behavior mechanistic models were developed for high burnup and low-temperature conditions. These models were validated with reported irradiation data and implemented, along with fuel material properties, into the steady-state fuel behavior code FRAPCON-EP. Under simulated RBWR conditions, a fuel density no more than 85 % of theoretical density is recommended to maintain satisfactory fuel performance.
