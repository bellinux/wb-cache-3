Accounting profits and tax liability arising from the lease are determined in different ways: different lease structures could result in similar accounting profits, but different tax liability. A lease's accounting profits may be preestimated with relative certainty, but it's difficult to pre-estimate its tax liability. It's especially difficult with long-term leases that stretch {{over a number of}} accounting periods and tax years. There isn't a specific framework with which tax liability arising from the <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> property may be determined and minimised. This study focuses on determining and minimising income tax liability within the context <b>of</b> the <b>leasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>immovable</b> property in South Africa. The workings of the factors that give rise to the tax liability are distinguished. Different types oflease agreements, reflecting the commercial objectives, are identified. A framework is then constructed from these factors to simplizy determination of the tax liability, and to structure the lease so that tax liability may be reduced. The different types <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> agreements are imposed on the framework to subordinate the reduction of tax liability to the parties' commercial objectives...|$|R
