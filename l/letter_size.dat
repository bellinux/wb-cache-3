40|$|Mobile devices like {{smartphones}} facilitate parallel {{activities of}} IT-interaction and other tasks. Especially smartphone usage during walking {{can often be}} observed. This can lead to distracted walking which frequently results in serious consequences for the user and others. As people will probably go on using mobile devices in this way, e. g., for navigation, we have to provide interaction interfaces which are adapted to {{the special needs of}} secondary usage while walking. One way to adapt apps to walking is to reduce time for content perception. A substantial part of content is given in written language, and therefore, reading is of high importance. Based on this, we pursued the reduction of reading time on a mobile device during walking. We conducted a study which provides information about the minimum acceptable <b>letter</b> <b>sizes</b> for reading single words while walking. We carried out an experiment in which we combined short presentation times of commonly used words with different <b>letter</b> <b>sizes</b> and analyzed the outcome by means of psychometric functions. We administered these functions for the independent variables presentation time, walking speed vs. standing and length of words (number of letters) and analyzed the outcome statistically in respect to the minimal visual angle. We found highly significant influences of all three conditions on the legibility of the words. We recommend the adaptation of applications for walking according to our findings...|$|R
5000|$|The precise {{origins of}} the {{dimensions}} of US <b>letter</b> <b>size</b> paper (8.5 × 11 in) are not known.

The <b>letter</b> <b>size</b> falls within the range of the historical quarto size, which since pre-modern times refers to page sizes of 8 to 9 in wide and 10 to 11 in high, and it is indeed almost exactly one quarter of the old Imperial (British) paper size known as Demy 4to (17½"×22½"), allowing ½" [...] for trimming.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A video {{aircraft}} identification algorithm, {{based on the}} tail number recognition, is proposed {{as a part of}} a global airport surveillance video system. The recognition procedure searches and detects the presence of the tail number in the image and then recognises the tail number using pattern matching techniques. The identification system has been designed to deal with airport real images, taking into account <b>letter</b> <b>sizes</b> differences and potential deformations. Finally, the {{aircraft identification}} system calculates the joint probability of each tail number in the airport database. The tail number maximising the joint probability is selected. Results show that the identification procedure achieves a robust identification using the database...|$|R
