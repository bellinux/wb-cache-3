5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them for a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before asking them to participate.|$|E

30|$|Vigilance is {{the ability}} to sustain {{attention}} over <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (Chun, Golomb, & Turk-Browne, 2011). Given that low prevalence search tasks require observers to maintain the attentional goal of detecting the target over <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> a task that can quickly assess vigilance may be a useful and valid predictor of low prevalence search.|$|R
5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} high risk, {{early detection and}} treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics over a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed for a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} a meal is always present. In some individuals, the regurgitation is small, occurring over a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must be expelled.|$|E

5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility {{is the same as}} the price charged.|$|E
5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|As a star's core shrinks, the {{intensity}} of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object {{about the size of}} Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} <b>of</b> weather over <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> It {{is measured by}} assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|R

5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was all but forgotten for a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection over a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|Gifu's {{first major}} {{industry}} was textiles. For a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> it rivaled Tokyo and Osaka {{as a leader}} of the Japanese fashion industry. The area just north of JR Gifu Station contains a variety of small clothing stores catering to many types of consumers. Furthermore, the city's main downtown covered shopping arcade, Yanagase, features many clothing, shoe, and accessory shops that carry both domestic and overseas goods. Over the past decade, though, as Gifu's fashion industry has declined steeply, the city has begun developing other industries to support the local economy.|$|E

5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting over a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that the majority survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.|$|E
