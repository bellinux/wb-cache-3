Three magnetic equilibria with analytically controlled flux expansion are built, representing respectively a positive, a null and a negative Shafranov shift. Turbulent E × B <b>fluxes</b> across <b>flux</b> <b>surfaces</b> show similar amplitudes and poloidal distributions in all cases. The ballooning nature of the interchange instability is recovered, with an enhancement of turbulence {{in the vicinity of}} the limiter, probably due to a Kelvin-Helmoltz instability.

Moreover, the configuration with a lower magnetic shear at the Low Field Side (LFS) midplane 1 shows a more unstable behaviour.

40|$|Gloss is an {{attribute}} of visual appearance that originates from the geometrical {{distribution of the}} light reflected by the surface. We used the maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS) procedure (L. T. Maloney & J. N. Yang, 2003) to estimate gloss scales over an extended range.

The results showed a nonlinear relation between gloss percept and instrumental specular gloss values. Sensitivity is higher at extreme scale values than in the middle. In binocular vision, the sensitivity to gloss is higher than in monocular vision exclusively for high gloss levels. Lastly, we found that gloss difference scales, when expressed in terms of the samples rather than the photometric characteristics, vary little with the direction of illumination. Gloss scaling thus seems to be independent of the geometrical variations of the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> at the <b>surface</b> of the sample.

40|$|Aims: We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} protoplanetary discs (PPDs hereafter) with magnetically driven disc winds and viscous heating. Methods: We consider an initially massive disc with ~ 0. 1 Msun to track the evolution from the early stage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of <b>surface</b> <b>density</b> and temperature by taking into account viscous heating {{and the loss of}} the mass and the angular momentum by the disc winds within the framework of a standard alpha model for accretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, disc wind mass loss, and disc wind torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical simulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational accretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results: Although there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical magnetic <b>flux</b> remaining, <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> show a large variety, depending on the combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different from the <b>surface</b> <b>density</b> expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in a "wind-driven accretion" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the radial dependence of the <b>surface</b> <b>density</b> can be positive in the inner region < 1 - 10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in the very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial slope of the <b>surface</b> <b>density</b> gives a great impact on planet formation because (i) it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of pebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I migration of proto-planets slower or even reversed.

40|$|The {{extended}} Schmidt law (ESL) is {{a variant}} of the Schmidt law which relates the <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> of gas and star formation, with the <b>surface</b> <b>density</b> of stellar mass added as an extra parameter. We empirically investigate for the first time whether low metallicity faint dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs) follow the ESL. Here we consider the `global' law where <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> are averaged over the galactic discs. dIrrs are unique not only because they are at the lowest end of mass and star formation scales for galaxies, but also because they are metal-poor compared to the general population of galaxies. Our sample is drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) which is the largest survey of atomic hydrogen in such galaxies. The gas <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> are determined using their atomic hydrogen content. The star formation rates are calculated using GALEX far ultraviolet fluxes after correcting for dust extinction, whereas the stellar <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> are calculated using Spitzer 3. 6 μm <b>fluxes.</b> All <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> are calculated over stellar discs defined by the 3. 6 μm images. We find dIrrs indeed follow the extended Schmidt law. The mean deviation of the FIGGS galaxies from the relation is 0. 01 dex, with a scatter around the relation of less than half that seen in the original relation. In comparison, we also show that the FIGGS galaxies are much more deviant when compared to the `canonical' Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our results help strengthen the universality of the extended Schmidt law, especially for galaxies with low metallicities. We suggest that models of star formation in which feedback from previous generations of stars set the pressure in the ISM, are promising candidates for explaining the ESL. We also confirm that ESL is an independent relation and not a form of a relation between star formation efficiency and metallicity. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

The {{observations}} were {{performed with the}} newly commissioned LUCIFER 1 near-infrared instrument mounted on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We fit lens models to the rest-frame optical images and find the galaxy has an intrinsic effective radius of 7. 4 kpc with a lens magnification factor of about 5 for the A and B components. We also discovered a new arc belonging to another lensed high-z source galaxy, which makes this lens system a potential double Einstein ring system. Using the high S/N rest-frame optical spectra covering H+K band, we detected Hbeta, OIII, Halpha, NII and SII emission lines. Detailed physical properties of this high-z galaxy were derived. The extinction towards the ionized HII regions (E_g(B-V)) is computed from the flux ratio of Halpha and Hbeta {{and appears to be}} much higher than that towards stellar continuum (E_s(B-V)), derived from the optical and NIR broad band photometry fitting. The metallicity was estimated using N 2 and O 3 N 2 indices. It is in the range of 1 / 5 - 1 / 3 solar abundance, which is much lower than the typical z 2 star-forming galaxies. From the flux ratio of SII 6717 and 6732, we found that the electron number density of the HII regions in the high-z galaxy were > 1000 cm^- 3, consistent with other z 2 galaxies but much higher than that in local HII regions. The star-formation rate was estimated via the Halpha luminosity, after correction for the lens magnification, to be about 365 ± 69 Msun/yr. Combining the FWHM of Halpha emission lines and the half-light radius, we found the dynamical mass of the lensed galaxy is 5. 8 ± 0. 9 x 10 ^ 10 Msun.

40|$|Dust grains are a minor {{component}} by {{mass of the}} interstellar medium of a galaxy. Yet they can be the dominant source of luminosity. At z ∼ 1, the luminosity density of the Universe in the IR is ∼ 10 times higher than it is at z ∼ 0; common high-redshift galaxies have IR luminosities and dust masses that surpass those of even rare low-redshift galaxies. Dusty galaxies must transition to dust-poor galaxies. In this thesis, we attempt to understand the When? and Where? of this transition. We examine the redshift distribution of the cosmic millimeter background and the spatial distributions of dust in high-redshift galaxies. The cosmic millimeter background is the <b>flux</b> <b>surface</b> <b>density,</b> across the entire sky, from dust emission from all galaxies in the Universe. We stack the 1. 16 mm flux densities of a sample of dusty galaxies to determine the evolution of their contribution to the background. We resolve ∼ 35 % of the background at 1. 16 mm and ∼ 50 % of the background at 850 μm. We make two unique predictions for the redshift origins of the total 1. 16 mm background. Dust is responsible for more than the IR emission from a galaxy. The existence of dust is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the attenuation of a galaxy's intrinsic UV emission; the IR- and emergent UV-emitting regions must be spatially coincident. We establish a relation between the ratio of infrared to UV luminosity and β for dusty galaxies at z ∼ 2, which implies that their regions are coincident. We also argue that the dust is spread on galactic scales. In dust-poor galaxies at low redshift, the amount of dust attenuating the emission from ionizing stars {{is greater than the}} amount attenuating the emission from massive but nonionizing stars. For dusty galaxies at z ∼ 1. 3, the amounts may be unequal [...] though this result is subject to the assumption that high-redshift dusty galaxies have the same spatial and grain size distributions as low-redshift dust-poor galaxies.
