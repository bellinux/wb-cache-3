5|$|One popular {{hypothesis}} {{suggested that}} pinnipeds are diphyletic (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears and phocids sharing one with Musteloidea. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin. Nevertheless, {{there is some}} dispute as to whether pinnipeds are {{more closely related to}} bears or musteloids, as some studies support the former theory and others the latter. Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago (mya) during the Eocene. Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, Puijila had a long tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. However, its limbs and shoulders were more robust and Puijila likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer–retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds. The researchers who found Puijila placed it in a clade with Potamotherium (traditionally considered a mustelid) and Enaliarctos. Of the three, Puijila was the least specialized for aquatic life. The discovery of Puijila in a <b>lake</b> <b>deposit</b> suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase.|$|E

25|$|The Cold Lake {{oil sands}} are {{northeast}} of Alberta's capital, Edmonton, {{near the border}} with Saskatchewan. A {{small portion of the}} Cold <b>Lake</b> <b>deposit</b> lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca oil sands, the Cold Lake oil sands are important because some of the oil is fluid enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more alkanes and less asphaltenes than the other major Alberta oil sands and the oil is more fluid. As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of Altenglanerpeton in a <b>lake</b> <b>deposit</b> {{suggests that it}} was aquatic.

Although it is not preserved in the holotype specimen, the tail may have had an elongated tadpole-like fin. In contrast, the robust skull and lack of lateral line grooves in Altenglanerpeton suggest that it was primarily terrestrial. While most aquatic amphibians have large, forward-facing eyes and three-dimensional vision for capturing prey underwater, Altenglanerpeton has small, laterally-directed eyes that would have been more suitable for burrowing, as in living caecilians. With its elongated body, Altenglanerpeton may have undulated through soil and leaf litter.|$|E
