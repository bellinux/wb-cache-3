50|$|The {{two ways}} to measure road {{slipperiness}} are surface friction testing and stopping distance testing. Friction testing can use surface <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> or portable <b>friction</b> <b>testers,</b> and involves allowing a freely moving object, usually a wheel, to move against the surface. By measuring the resistance experienced by the wheel, the friction between {{the ground and the}} wheel can be found.|$|R
5|$|The surface <b>friction</b> <b>tester</b> {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} {{attached}} to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface <b>friction</b> <b>tester</b> works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Jacob Boone, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Mechanical Engineering, {{presented}} on 10 / 28 / 2010, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND EVALUTAION OF UNIVERSAL <b>FRICTION</b> <b>TESTER</b> MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Peter Filip Many {{different types of}} <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> are currently available for testing specific frictional applications. Of these machines very few have versatility, and {{of the ones that}} do, the amount of versatility is limited. Since friction is a property specific to each system, all operating parameters need to match the specific application as closely as possible in order to obtain accurate data. This requires many research facilities to have several specific <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> in order to provide the necessary testing capabilities. The goal of this project was to design a Universal <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester</b> (UFT) with enough versatility to reproduce most types of sliding friction situations. This was accomplished by providing a wide range of testing capabilities through the use of interchangeable system components. Results show that the UFT provides quality data over its entire operating range. It was shown that normal pressure, sliding speed, temperature and system stiffness all have drastic effects on frictional performance. By using a borosilicate glass disc, the friction surface was viewed in-situ during testing. This allowed insights into true surface temperature and contact area. In conclusion, the UFT can successfully take the place of several <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> and thus provide many friction research capabilities while requiring fewer resources. The wide range of testing capabilities will allow the UFT {{to be used as a}} research tool for many types of advanced friction studies. Some of these may include true surface temperatures, true contact area, influence of conditions on stick-slip phenomenon, and thermo-elastic instabilities...|$|R
40|$|As {{the latest}} results of {{research}} demonstrate, the dynamic friction coefficient depends {{not only on}} friction combination, but also on velocity, temperature and normal force. <b>Friction</b> <b>testers,</b> as they are readily available on the market, do not allow {{the determination of the}} friction coefficient under real process conditions. As part of a research project carried out by the SGE Spezialgeräteentwicklung GmbH, in cooperation with Fraunhofer IW Dresden, a <b>friction</b> <b>tester</b> has been developed, which realizes a velocity of up to 120 m/min, a temperature of up to 100 °C and a normal force of up to 100 N.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new contribution to model tire/road friction. It proposes a calculation of hysteretic {{component of the}} rubber friction based on a simplified viscoelastic-rough contact model. The mechanical behavior of rubber elements is represented through "Kelvin-Voigt" model. The hysteretic friction force is calculated from the dissymmetry of the contact pressure due to the rubber viscoelastic behavior in given operating conditions (load, slip velocity [...] .). To validate the model, a series of texture and friction data are measured using two machines respectively the Circular Track Meter and the Dynamic <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester,</b> through various test surfaces and compared to model results. The Circular Track Meter is a complementary measurement device to the Dynamic <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester</b> as texture measurements can {{be done on the}} exact same physical surface tracks where the Dynamic <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester</b> measuring pads have been in contact with the test surface. The obtained results show a very encouraging correlation between the model predictions to the experiment results, thus opening a promising and attractive way to predict tire-road friction. Some indications are given at the end to improve the modelling and to extend to it to a whole type/road friction model...|$|R

In the present study, we have manufactured a prototype of rotary <b>friction</b> <b>tester</b> and examined the performances of the tester. The frictional characteristics of metals in the room air was measured using the <b>friction</b> <b>tester,</b> and the results obtained are as follows. A drifting friction force for a constant time and a friction force during the idling were 98 mN and 225 mN, respectively. These values were sufficiently small as compared to pressing load (9. 8 - 57. 8 N) used in the friction test. In a friction force measurement of stainless steel, dynamic friction force obeyed Amontons' law which indicated that dynamic friction force is not depend on either pressing load and sliding speed. The measured dynamic friction force of metals tended to decrease as the increasing hardness value of them, and it was maximum in aluminium.
