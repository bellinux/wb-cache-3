40|$|Ablative liner quantifies <b>local-heating</b> {{effects in}} {{combustion}} chambers and other applications. By identifying hotspots {{and helping to}} map heat-flux patterns, liner is useful tool for research in engine design. Liner permanently records heat flux at each point by depth of ablation due to local heating. Technique determines best locations for thermocouples for more extensive testing...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} {{method for}} realizing intense terahertz (THz) emission from intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) by utilizing external <b>local-heating</b> is proposed and demonstrated theoretically. An artificial temperature distribution induced by local heating strongly excites Josephson plasma waves inside IJJs. Accordingly, the emission {{power of the}} THz wave is enhanced drastically, and it can reach the order of mW. Our result indicates {{that the use of}} local heat control is a powerful method to realize practical solid-state THz-emitters based on IJJs.

40|$|Measurements of the {{location}} of boundary-layer transition and the local heat transfer have been made on 2 -inch-diameter hemispheres in the Langley gas dynamics laboratory at a Mach number of 4. 95, a Reynolds number per foot of 73. 2 x 10 (exp 6), and a stagnation temperature of approximately 400 F. The transient-heating thin-skin calorimeter technique was used, and the initial values of the wall-to-stream stagnation- temperature ratios were 0. 16 (cold-model tests) and 0. 65 (hot-model test). During {{two of the four}} cold tests, the boundary-layer flow changed from turbulent to laminar over large regions of the hemisphere as the model heated. On the basis of a detailed consideration of the magnitude of roughness possibly present during these two cold tests, it appears that this destabilizing effect of low wall temperatures (cooling) was not caused by roughness as a dominant influence. This idea of a decrease in boundary-layer stability with cooling has been previously suggested. (See, for example, NASA Memorandum 10 - 8 - 58 E.) For the laminar data obtained during {{the early part of the}} hot test, the correlation of the <b>local-heating</b> data with laminar theory was excellent...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} fitness (_V O 2 max) on the age-related decline in skin-microvessel vasodilator function {{has not been}} fully established and the inter-relationships among different measures of microvascular vasodilator function are unknown. We used laser Doppler flowmetry to assess relative changes in forearm skin blood flow to various stimuli in three groups of adults: young (n = 15; 27 ± 2 years), older sedentary (n = 14; 65 ± 6 years) and older fit (n = 15; 61 ± 5 years). <b>Local-heating</b> induced and post-occlusive hyperaemia responses {{were higher in the}} young and older fit groups compared to the older sedentary group (P. 05) and were moderately correlated with _V O 2 max in the pooled cohort of older adults (r = 0. 49 – 0. 58; P. 05). Peak hyperaemia responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were higher in young compared to older sedentary adults (P. 05) and were not associated with V O 2 max in older adults (P[0. 05). Associations among different measures of microvascular vasodilator function were generally moderate at best. In summary, the local heating and reactive hyperaemia data indicate that the age-related decline in skin-microvessel vasodilator function can be ameliorated through regular aerobic exercise training. As this is not supported by the iontophoresis data, we recommend that, when assessing microvascular function, the use of a single physiological or pharmacological stimulation coupled to laser Doppler flowmetry should be avoided. Finally, the moderate correlations between outcomes probably reflect the distinct mediators that are responsible for the vasodilator response to each test...|$|E
