Then lumbar drainage was thus performed. The opening pressure upon lumbar puncture was not measured as it was very low. As a result of continous CSF leakage, dural repair was performed.

In a {{first part of the}} paper, we aim to survey a number of well known intuitions related to physical security and to connect them with more formal results in this area. For this purpose, we study the definition of leakage function introduced by Micali and Reyzin in 2004 and its relation to practical power consumption traces. Then, we discuss the non equivalence between the unpredictability and indistinguishability of pseudorandom generators in physically observable cryptography. Eventually, we examine the assumption of bounded leakage per iteration that has been used recently to prove the security of different constructions against side-channel attacks. We show that approximated leakage bounds can be obtained using the framework for the analysis of side-channel key recovery attacks published at Eurocrypt 2009.

40|$|Abstract: According to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) literature, several {{mechanisms}} within rich economies, including increased {{willingness to}} conduct abatement policies, contribute to reduce environmental problems. Unilateral environmental policies in open economies may affect other countries negatively through trade inter-linkages. A relocation of dirty production and environmental pressure to economies with laxer abatement regimes {{can be one}} of many explanations to the apparent EKCs for rich countries. Further, the economic costs of national abatement policies may to some extent be shared with foreigners, both through lower demand for imports and through market share losses for foreign competitors producing cleaner products. In this paper, we quantify the effects of endogenous carbon tax policy in a rich and open economy, Norway, by means of a CGE model. We find that the environmental benefits fall and the economic costs rise when a global rather than a national perspective is employed.

40|$|Eight {{years after}} the {{introduction}} of laparoscopic cholecystectomy a decrease of the incidence of bile duct injuries is reported in the literature. The incidence of a bile duct injury after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now slightly higher than after open cholecystectomy. A minority of these injuries are detected during surgery. Most patients have a delayed identification of the bile duct injury, even after discharge from the hospital. An early diagnostic work-up with ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is mandatory in every patient with persisting symptoms (more than 48 hours) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Still, one-third of the patients are subjected to a 'diagnostic' exploratory laparotomy without preoperative visualization of the biliary tract by ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.

40|$|SUMMARY Purpose: Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{has become}} the standard method {{in the management of}} cholelithiasis. Subhepatic bile collection or biloma is a relatively uncommon complication, which is highlighted in this paper. Methods-Results: Over the past two-year period the same surgeon performed 180 laparoscopic cholecystectomies without any intra-operative event. All patients but three had an uneventful postoperative course (morbidity 1. 6 %). In 3 cases (women, 72 - 74 - 88 years-old) the US-scanning revealed a sub-hepatic biloma manifested by persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, abdominal distention, fever and leukocytosis. In one case there was co-existent gastric outlet obstruction two weeks after the operation and mild obstructive jaundice in another one. All were managed successfully by drainage under ultrasound guidance and antibiotics, prolonging the hospitalization.

METHODS: We prospectively evaluated episodes of recurrent bacterial meningitis in a nationwide cohort study in The Netherlands. RESULTS: Thirty-four episodes of recurrent bacterial meningitis were identified among 31 patients; 3 patients experienced 2 episodes during the study period. The mean age was 43 years, and 25 (74 %) of 34 episodes occurred in men. Predisposing conditions were involved in 26 (77 %) of 34 episodes; the most common predisposing conditions were remote head injury (17 [53 %] of 32 episodes) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage (9 [32 %] of 28 episodes). Lumbar puncture revealed an individual CSF indicator of bacterial meningitis for almost all episodes (88 %). The outcome was death for 5 (15 %) of 34 episodes; 1 additional patient had a suboptimal score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale.

Ultraviolet light exposure of SorbPC-containing liposomes forms poly-SorbPC, which phase separates from the remaining monomeric lipids, If the nonpdymerizable lipids are PE’s, then the photoinduced polymerization destabilizes the liposome with loss of aqueous contents. The permeability of the control dioleoylPC/SorbPC membranes was not affected by photopolymerization of SorbPC. The photodestabilization of dioleoylPE/SorbPC (3 : 1) liposomes required the presence of oligolamellar liposomes.

Following the chilling stress period, plants were located in the room temperature (25 ± 5 ºC). Results showed that seedlings sprayed with GB concentrations of 10 - 100 mM were visually in a better status and more tolerant to chilling injuries. Moreover, chlorophyll content and root and shoot dry weight of seedlings sprayed with this range of GB were significantly higher than those sprayed with distilled water. In addition, electrolyte leakage was effectively declined by spraying the seedlings with GB in the range of 10 - 50 and further increase in GB concentration significantly enhanced electrolyte leakage.

However, (KW) 5 showed undesirable cytotoxicity against RBC cells. In order to identify the mechanisms behind the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of (KW) 5, we measured the ability of these peptides to induce aggregation of liposomes. In addition, their binding and permeation activities were assessed by Trp fluorescence, calcein leakage and circular dichrorism using artificial phospholipids that mimic eukaryotic liposomes, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC/sphingomyelin (SM) (2 : 1, w/w) and PC/cholesterol (CH) (2 : 1, w/w). Experiments confirmed that only (KW) 5 induced aggregation of all liposomes; it formed much larger aggregates with PC:CH (2 : 1, w/w) than with PC or PC:SM (2 : 1, w/w). Longer peptide (KW) 5, but not (KW) 3 or (KW) 4, strongly bound and partially inserted into PC:CH compared to PC or PC:SM (2 : 1, w/w). Calcein release experiments showed that (KW) 5 induced calcein leakage from the eukaryotic membrane. Greater calcein leakage was induced by (KW) 5 from PC:CH than from PC:SM (2 : 1, w/w) or PC, whereas (KW) 4 did not induce calcein <b>leakag...</b>|$|E
40|$|Anastomotic leakage is {{a serious}} {{complication}} after colorectal surgery. Pre- and intraoperative factors may contribute to failure of colorectal anastomosis. In this study {{we have tried to}} determine risk factors for anastomotic leakage, with special emphasis on intraoperative blood pressure changes. During a 24 -month period, patients receiving a colorectal anastomosis were prospectively evaluated. For each patient preoperative characteristics, intraoperative adverse events and surgical outcome data were collected. Blood pressure changes were calculated as a relative decrease (> 25 % and > 40 %) from preoperative baseline values. During the study period, 285 patients underwent colorectal surgery with an anastomosis. Fifteen patients developed an anastomotic leakage (5. 3 %). All patients who developed a leakage had a left-sided procedure (P 40 % decrease in diastolic blood pressure (P = 0. 049) ] were identified as univariate risk factors for anastomotic leakage. The development of an anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery is related to surgical, patient and anaesthetic risk factors. A high preoperative diastolic blood pressure and profound intraoperative hypotension combined with complex surgery, marked by a blood loss of a parts per thousand yen 250 mL and the occurrence of intraoperative adverse events, is associated with an increased risk of developing anastomotic <b>leakag...</b>|$|E
