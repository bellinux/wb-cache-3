500|$|The main {{inspiration}} for the designin which the forts are blasted into the mountains rather than constructed on top of themcame from Vaberget Fortress near Karlsborg Fortress. Vaberget Fortress {{was built in the}} 1890s and its southern fort was the first fort in the world that fully used the protection provided by the bedrock itself by having all of its functions embedded in the mountain. Vaberget Fortress served as a prototype for Boden Fortress and many more future fortifications in Sweden, including the late 20th century fixed army and coastal artillery batteries that gave the Swedish Fortifications Agency world renown. Preparatory work was started in 1900 and consisted of a diverse number of tasks, ranging from purchase of beds for the construction workers, construction of a new <b>loading</b> <b>site</b> for the railway, building roads to the various construction sites and clearing the land of those sites. The plan for the Fortifications at Boden (...) which was the term used until the First World War when the present name Boden Fortress came into widespread usewas largely based on the proposal laid forward by the Fortification Committee of 1897, with only minor modifications.|$|E
2500|$|Operation Ranch Hand was {{the name}} of the aerial {{application}} of defoliants in Southeast Asia, aimed at stripping away the dense jungle that hid enemy activities. The center for US testing of the herbicides used in Ranch Hand was Eglin AFB, primarily on Range C-52A. For ten years, 1961 to 1971, 222,530 liters of herbicides (Agents Purple, Orange, White and Blue) were sprayed at a test grid on the base reservation. These herbicides were estimated to contain at least 3.1kg of dioxin. Soil sampling at the test site conducted in 1970–1987 confirmed that there was TCDD contamination, though only about 1 percent remained. [...] "Researchers theorized that much of the dioxin was broken down in the hot Florida sun or relocated due to wind or water erosion. At the storage and <b>loading</b> <b>site</b> west of the airstrip, residual dioxin was also found. [...] Mitigation efforts were conducted, including the construction of a concrete drainage ditch and the building of a sediment pond to keep the dioxin from migrating into the nearby ravine and water bodies that lead to the city of Fort Walton Beach water supply. In 2001, the area around Hardstand 7 was capped with concrete and remediation activities concluded." ...|$|E

At least three sRNAs, DsrA, RprA and OxyS, regulate the translation of RpoS.

50|$|Rho-dependent {{transcription}} terminators {{require a}} protein called Rho factor, which exhibits RNA helicase activity, {{to disrupt the}} mRNA-DNA-RNA polymerase transcriptional complex. Rho-dependent terminators are found in bacteria and phage. The Rho-dependent terminator occurs downstream of translational stop codons and consists of an unstructured, cytosine-rich sequence on the mRNA known as a Rho utilization site (rut) for which a consensus sequence has not been identified, and a downstream transcription stop point (tsp). The rut serves as a mRNA <b>loading</b> <b>site</b> and as an activator for Rho; activation enables Rho to efficiently hydrolyze ATP and translocate down the mRNA while it maintains contact with the rut site. Rho is able {{to catch up with}} the RNA polymerase, which is stalled at the downstream tsp sites.

50|$|As Glacier Northwest {{claims that}} the usage of barges is not {{detrimental}} to the environment, those against the mine expansion, especially those from Preserve Our Island, disagree. They claim that the physical effects of the barge itself, and the side-effects of its loading procedures, can be detrimental to the near shore environment. It is estimated that the velocity of the prop wash from these barges can re-suspend about 90% of the ambient bed material in the shallow waters. This effect, contrary to Glacier Northwest's attempt at mitigation, would not be avoided even if the dock and <b>loading</b> <b>site</b> were extended into deeper waters as planned because of the likely possibility of aggregate falling {{over the side of}} the barge into the sound. The effect of this spillage could then raise the ambient bed as it is collected on the ocean floor, exposing it to the dangers of the barge's prop-wash. These effects would pose a more significant effect during low tides, as outlined in the continuing section on the remaining eelgrass beds. By using barge ships as their main form of transport, Glacier Northwest is also putting South Maury Island’s fragile habitat at an extremely high risk for oil spills. An oil spill would demolish the near shore habitat, which would affect the fish, birds, and sea mammals living throughout the Puget Sound.|$|E
50|$|New Deal was {{originally}} known as Monroe, named for Monroe G. Abernathy, a local landowner. The town {{was originally}} {{developed as a}} train station <b>loading</b> <b>site.</b> People began to settle there {{and that is why}} the town was built alongside the railroad tracks and highway. The train identification name for the township still reads Monroe alongside the railroad tracks.

Because there was already a town in Texas with the name Monroe City, the U.S. postal department changed the name of the town to New Deal after Franklin D. Roosevelt's programs and {{to go along with the}} consolidated school system's name. This information was all developed when the school system had to write a history when applying for a federal grant. In 1970, the township was incorporated by the vote of its citizens. The city of Lubbock, Texas, was planning some annexation of surrounding lands and the people of the New Deal area decided to incorporate rather than be annexed to the city of Lubbock. A local farmer, Billy Fortenberry, was the first mayor. In 1970, Ray Edell West, a city councilman for three years, became the mayor.

40|$|Eukaryotic {{chromosomes}} {{reach their}} stable rod-shaped appearance in mitosis in a reaction {{dependent on the}} evolutionarily conserved condensin complex. It is currently unknown how and where condensin associates with chromosomes. Here, we analyse condensin binding to budding yeast chromosomes by immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization on high resolution oligonucleotide tiling arrays. We observe that condensin binding sites coincide {{with those of the}} RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC and the loading factor Scc 2 / 4 of the related cohesin complex. Both Tf 3 c and Scc 2 / 4 facilitate condensin loading onto chromosomes. An isolated ectopic B box motif is sufficient to prime formation of a condensin binding site. While cohesin translocates away from these <b>loading</b> <b>sites,</b> condensin persists there. This defines the <b>loading</b> <b>sites</b> of cohesin and condensin and explains how an alternating pattern of these complexes along chromosomes is established. The findings have important implications for the fields of chromosome segregegation and nuclear structure in interphase and mitosis. The identification of SMC <b>loading</b> <b>sites</b> will allow targeted probing of eukaryotic chromosomes. Beside condensation, mitotic chromosome segregation also depends on the chromosomal condensin complex. Without condensin, sister chromatids fail to resolve causing anaphase bridges and chromosome breakage. How condensin promotes sister chromatid resolution is unknown. We have used the budding yeast rDNA as a model locus, whose segregation depends on condensin activity during anaphase. We show that anaphase bridges in a condensin mutant are resolved by ectopic expression of a foreign (Chlorella virus) but not endogenous yeast topoisomerase II (topo II). This suggests that catenation prevents sister rDNA segregation, and that yeast topo II is ineffective in decatenating the rDNA in the absence of condensin. We furthermore find that expression of Chlorella virus topo II in wild type cells advances the normally late segregation timing of the rDNA locus. This suggests catenation is a means for the cell to provide rDNA cohesion up to late anaphase, when condensin promotes decatenation. This provides the first direct evidence of condensin's role in the disengagement of topologically connected sister chromatids. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Combining {{exercise}} with calcium supplementation may produce additive or multiplicative effects at loaded sites; thus, {{we conducted a}} single blind, prospective, randomized controlled study in pre- and early-pubertal girls to test the following hypotheses. (1) At the <b>loaded</b> <b>sites,</b> exercise and calcium will produce greater benefits than exercise or calcium alone. (2) At non-loaded sites, exercise will have no benefit, whereas calcium with or without exercise will increase bone mass over that in exercise alone or no intervention. Sixty-six girls aged 8. 8 ± 0. 1 years {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four study groups: moderate-impact {{exercise with}} or without calcium or low-impact exercise with or without calcium. All participants exercised for 20 minutes, three times a week and received Ca-fortified (434 ± 19 mg/day) or non-fortified foods for 8. 5 months. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine interaction and main effects for exercise and calcium on bone mass after adjusting for baseline bone mineral content and growth in limb lengths. An exercise-calcium interaction was detected at the femur (7. 1 %, p < 0. 05). In contrast, there was no exercise-calcium interaction detected at the tibia-fibula; however, there was a main effect of exercise: bone mineral content increased 3 % more in the exercise than non-exercise groups (p < 0. 05). Bone mineral content increased 2 - 4 % more in the calcium-supplemented groups than the non-supplemented groups at the humerus (12. 0 % vs. 9. 8 %, respectively, p < 0. 09) and radius-ulna (12. 6 % vs. 8. 6 %, respectively, p < 0. 01). In conclusion, greater gains in bone mass at <b>loaded</b> <b>sites</b> may be achieved when short bouts of moderate exercise are combined with increased dietary calcium, the former conferring region-specific effects and the latter producing generalized effects. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Condensins load onto DNA to {{organize}} chromosomes. Smc-ScpAB clearly loads onto the parS sites bound by Spo 0 J, but other loading site(s) must operate independently of parS. In this study, we asked {{where and how}} Smc-ScpAB normally selects its <b>loading</b> <b>site.</b> Our results suggest that rDNA is also a <b>loading</b> <b>site.</b> A pull-down assay revealed that Smc-ScpAB preferentially loads onto rDNA in the wild-type cell and even in a Îspo 0 J mutant {{but not in a}} Îsmc mutant. Moreover, we showed that deletion mutants of rDNAs cause a defect in nucleoid separation, and at least two rDNAs near oriC are essential for separation. Full-length rDNA, including promoters, is required for loading and nucleoid separation. A synthetic defect by deletions of both rDNA and spo 0 J resulted in more aberrant nucleoid separation. We propose that a single-stranded segment of DNA that is exposed at highly transcribed rRNA operons would become a target for Smc-ScpAB loading. : Where and how bacterial condensin normally selects its <b>loading</b> <b>site</b> is not known. Yano and Niki show that Smc-ScpAB preferentially loads onto rDNA near the replication origin to compact newly replicated chromosomal DNA. This suggests that two loading pathways for Smc-ScpAB cooperatively function to manifest the physical separation of nucleoids.
