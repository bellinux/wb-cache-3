5|$|Locking {{multiple}} variables using non-atomic locks {{introduces the}} possibility of program deadlock. An atomic lock locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> same two variables using non-atomic locks, {{it is possible that}} one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.|$|E
5|$|From about 1192 to 1230, Adam <b>Lock,</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} architect at Wells {{for whom}} a name is known, continued the transept and nave {{in the same}} manner as his predecessor. Lock was also the builder of the north porch, to his own design.|$|E
5|$|Young birds {{indulge in}} play fighting, and one bird will often <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> neck of another under its chin.

50|$|It {{features}} an integral accessory rail for mounting lasers and flashlights on Hi-Point rings. The safety {{is a combination}} lever for <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> slide and blocking the sear movement. The immediate drawback of this system is that the weapon cannot be cocked while the safety is on; <b>the</b> safety <b>locks</b> <b>the</b> trigger/sear, but the common misconception is that it only <b>locks</b> <b>the</b> slide.|$|R
5|$|A {{flat-bottomed}} design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> keel, floors and frames in place.|$|E
5|$|All of Uranus's moons {{are named}} after {{characters}} from {{the works of}} William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the <b>Lock.</b> <b>The</b> names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 {{at the request of}} Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in The Rape of the Lock. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The moon is also designated UranusI.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} {{of almost all}} <b>locks</b> on <b>the</b> Thames involved one or more artificial <b>lock</b> islands separating <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> from <b>the</b> weirs. These may have been created by building an artificial island in the river or by digging an artificial canal to contain <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and turning <b>the</b> land between that and the river into an island. In many cases <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> island contains <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> keeper's house and can be accessed across <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> gates. Such lock islands are only listed above {{if they have a}} specific name of their own: all Thames locks are listed in <b>Locks</b> on <b>the</b> River Thames.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most ancient Chinese {{padlocks}} are key-operated locks with splitting springs, {{and partially}} keyless letter-combination locks. They can be character-ized based on <b>the</b> types of <b>locks,</b> <b>the</b> shapes of <b>locks,</b> <b>the</b> engravings of <b>locks,</b> <b>the</b> materials of <b>locks,</b> and <b>the</b> mechanisms of <b>locks.</b> Some locks and keys {{are not only}} very beautiful and artistic colorful, but also with various designs. As a result, a splitting spring padlock is an asymmetric key cryptosystem, and a combination padlock is a symmetric key cryptosystem. ...|$|R
5000|$|O-locks {{provide a}} limited degree of security, like all <b>locks.</b> [...] <b>The</b> {{greatest}} security requires using multiple types of locks together. In Copenhagen and Japan, the O-lock is generally used alone; the bikes are insured against theft {{and the owner}} must show {{that they have the}} key, to demonstrate that <b>the</b> bike was <b>locked.</b> <b>The</b> key can only be removed by <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> In other locations, the O-lock is used along with <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> frame to a secure object, or the O-lock is used alone when the owner is very close by, to prevent ride-off theft.|$|R
5|$|Cunningham {{moved to}} Auckland in 1902, and played his club rugby for City, before joining Ponsonby the {{following}} season. He had been displaced {{from the national}} team by this time, with Cantabrian Bernard Fanning preferred at <b>lock.</b> <b>The</b> New Zealanders used a different scrum formation than seen today, and only one lock was ever required.|$|E
5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> strands in {{a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday junctions. These junctions also later found use as basic structural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology, where multiple Holliday junctions can be combined into specific designed geometries that provide molecules {{with a high degree of}} structural rigidity.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Woolhampton and the canal {{settlement}} of Aldermaston Wharf {{are the only}} significant settlements until the river enters the built-up area of Reading at Sheffield Lock in Theale. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide floodplain surrounding the river. In this stretch is Garston <b>Lock,</b> <b>the</b> other turf-sided lock on the navigation.|$|E
50|$|It is an {{established}} fact that Chacha never <b>locks</b> <b>the</b> {{door of his}} house when he steps out. However, Bini Chachi is seen <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> house {{on a couple of}} occasions in the comic series.|$|R

[...] After <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> was shut down, a large log drifting down the river floated over the top of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> striking <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> machinery, effectively putting <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> permanently out of operation.|$|R

5|$|Francis, {{having heard}} Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas confuses Francis for Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious. He straps {{him to a}} stone slab located {{directly}} beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum {{is attached to a}} clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of an inch after each swing, ever closer to Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the servants. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis is removed from the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They slam and <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for reference {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E
50|$|The reverse {{direction}} of the path going upstream on the non-tidal part is obtainable by following <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> up from Teddington Lock. Between Teddington <b>Lock</b> and Lechlade <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> divide <b>the</b> river into reaches and {{a description of the}} reach above each <b>lock</b> includes <b>the</b> route of the Thames Path going upstream. Locks are listed under <b>Locks</b> on <b>the</b> River Thames.|$|R
50|$|Lever tumbler locks can {{be picked}} with a tool called a curtain pick which is {{inserted}} into the keyway of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and a {{force is applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>locking</b> bolt. <b>The</b> pick is then used to lift each lever inside <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> to <b>the</b> correct height so that <b>the</b> <b>locking</b> bolt can pass.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County <b>Lock</b> <b>the</b> river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of poor visibility {{and the difficulty of}} boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|Sora, Donald and Goofy battle Ansem {{outside the}} door to Kingdom Hearts, which Ansem {{believes}} {{to be the ultimate}} reservoir of darkness. Upon opening the door, however, it reveals its light, overwhelming and destroying Ansem. Beyond the door are King Mickey and Riku, and they help Sora and the others close the door, as there are many Heartless beyond it. Mickey and Sora use their Keyblades to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> door. The worlds lost to the Heartless reconstruct themselves; as the Destiny Islands reform, Kairi returns there while Sora is forced to part with her. The game concludes as Sora, Donald, and Goofy resolve to find Riku and Mickey.|$|E
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> gear in place.|$|E
50|$|Smart <b>locks,</b> like <b>the</b> {{traditional}} <b>locks,</b> {{need two}} main parts to work. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> and <b>the</b> key. In {{the case of}} these electronic <b>locks,</b> <b>the</b> key is not a physical key but a smartphone or a special key fob configured explicitly for this purpose which wirelessly will perform the authentication needed to automatically unlock the door.|$|R

The sub foundation consisted of a timber grillage placed on 700 round piles, driven 30 to 50 ft feet deep. 8000 cubic yards of concrete were used for <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and foundation. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> had a lift of 16 ft.|$|R
5|$|The navigations often form a {{short cut}} for boaters between the River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode <b>Lock.</b> <b>The</b> {{suggested}} route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old {{course of the}} River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the new course of the River Nene. The final stretch to Salters Lode lock is along Well Creek, passing {{over the top of}} the Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{political}} consideration. The Lucky Dragon incident had {{touched off a}} storm of protest, and there were calls from trade unions and the Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing, resulting in a stormy debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new Eisenhower administration in the United States looked favourably on the idea, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; {{but it would also}} <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.|$|E
