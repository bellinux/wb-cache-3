50|$|During the {{official}} <b>launch,</b> <b>PIPE</b> Network's CEO Bevan Slattery {{said the new}} cable would now deliver speeds at an even greater capacity than originally planned, 2.56 terabits per second in total.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} years of the site’s <b>launch,</b> <b>Pipe</b> also had a day job as a {{warehouse}} and office manager for a local software company. [...] At this time, Pipe also worked on several amateur scripts, the most hugely popular being “Guilty Pleasures,” which Pipe failed to receive credit for in the final cut. By 2002, Pipe began including sex toy and website reviews, enticing outside free-lance reviewers to contribute, the most prolific of which is midwestern college co-ed Savana Switzer.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the first}} week of its <b>launch</b> <b>Pipes</b> found itself all over the web, {{including}} inside Gizmodo’s top apps of the month.|$|R
2500|$|... 5 June 1999: LVF members <b>launched</b> <b>pipe</b> bomb {{attacks on}} two {{houses in the}} Corcrain area of Portadown. One of them killed Protestant {{civilian}} Elizabeth O'Neill (59), who {{was married to a}} Catholic man.|$|R

50|$|Pipes did a {{compelling}} update {{in the first}} week of October where it <b>launched</b> summary. <b>Pipes</b> is one of the few apps that summarises articles without the use of editors. TechCrunch gave Pipes another feature on the 2nd of October, where it spoke about Pipes’ summary feature and custom push notifications in grave detail.|$|R
50|$|Drano Foamer {{first started}} out a powder similar to Crystal Drano in which water {{had to be}} added. This was the first-ever foaming pipe snake product. This caused Liquid-Plumr to <b>launch</b> Liquid-Plumr: Foaming <b>Pipe</b> Snake, which is a 2-in-1 liquid.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, <b>Pipe</b> <b>launched</b> Rog Reviews in 1998, {{intending}} only {{to showcase}} his reviews, {{a decision made}} partially in retaliation against the Adult Video News Awards, {{for which he had}} briefly worked for. The experience left Pipe jaded against the more mainstream avenues, but has since worked out to be “very beneficial.” Pipe has said in interviews that the same individual who dismissed him (Mark Kulkis) has ensured Pipe’s accessibility to every major film premiere for the companies he represents, suggesting that while {{the way in which they}} parted was not ideal, there was still a level of respect for Pipe's work.|$|R
50|$|The USS Hamlin (CVE-15) {{was one of}} a {{large group}} of escort {{aircraft}} carriers built on Maritime Commission C-3 hulls and transferred to the Royal Navy under lend-lease during World War II. <b>Launched</b> by Western <b>Pipe</b> and Steel Company, San Francisco, California, 5 March 1942, as AVG-15, aircraft escort vessel, she was sponsored by Mrs. William H. Shea. Her designation was changed to ACV-15, auxiliary aircraft carrier, 20 August 1942, and she was acquired and simultaneously transferred to the United Kingdom 21 December 1942. Hamlins designation was changed to CVE-15, escort aircraft carrier, 15 July 1943.|$|R
50|$|As Jerry {{makes fun of}} Tom's predicament, {{the gray}} mouse notices a bow and arrow on the ground. This time, they set Tom inside the bow as he is asleep. After Jerry signals the grey mouse to pull him back up, Tom {{stretches}}, which stretches the bow and causes it to launch him through the hallway, crashing through a vent in the wall, down a pipe, into the furnace, getting Tom <b>launched</b> through another <b>pipe</b> and then out the stove pipe chimney on the roof. The two mice watch Tom as he flies {{in the air and}} down the chimney they are standing on. Then they look down the chimney to see the aftermath of their latest prank, but then they are ambushed by Tom pointing the gun straight at them.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to measure the effects of pulsed radiation loads {{on the front of}} small tubular structures, using as an energy source the X-ray fluence produced by a Z-pinch at the Sandia National Laboratories Z Facility. The project had two major goals: to establish the feasibility of using the Z machine to study the phenomenology associated with debris generation and propagation down tubular structures with partitions; and to use the resultant experimental data to validate numerical hydrocodes (shock physics codes) so that we have confidence in their use in analyzing these types of situations. Two tubular aluminum structures (5 and 10 cm long and 1 cm inside diameter) were prepared, with aluminum partitions located at the front, halfway down the pipe, and at the rear. Interferometry (VISARS) provided multiple velocity histories for all of the partitions. In both experiments, the first barrier, which was exposed directly to the x-ray fluence, was <b>launched</b> into the <b>pipe</b> at a velocity of {approximately} 2 km/s, accelerating to give a mean velocity of approximately 2. 6 km/s. Loss of plate integrity is inferred from the dispersed launch of the second partition at approx. 1 km/s. Wall shocks propagating at 4. 5 km/s were inferred, although strain gage measurements did not succeed. Post-test metallography showed evidence of melting and partial vaporization of the plates, and turbulent mixing with material from the walls. Calculations qualitatively agree with the observed results, but slightly overpredict debris velocity, possibly due to overestimates of total energy fluence. An application for this work is the study of techniques for line-of-sight shock and debris mitigation on high-power pulse-power facilities such as Z and its follow-on machines...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{reports on}} a {{technique}} the authors have developed to produce and analyze, at very low cost, good quality strobe-like photographs like the one shown in Fig. 1. While the concept {{is similar to the}} one described by Graney and DiNotto 1, the strategy here described benefits from recent advances in the fields of digital photography and related software to significantly reduce the costs, simplify the production process, and enhance the final quality of photographs of this type, as well as to obtain greater accuracy in measurements made with them. Fig 1. a) Outdoor strobe-like photograph of the mid-air movements of a heavy, rotating metal <b>pipe</b> <b>launched</b> at an angle above the horizontal, obtained by blending nine frames of a video clip into a single composite image. To avoid excessive overlapping of the sequential images of the pipe, we only kept every third frame. Note the plumb-line and the 1. 5 -m metric tape on the left, to be used as references in the digitization of the pipe center-of-mass coordinates; b) the digitized x- and y-coordinates of the pipe’s C. M. (solid circles), and the least-squares parabola (solid line). Over the last and a half decade, some important articles on the use of digitized video for motion analysis have been published in this journal. David Wagner 2 {{was one of the first}} to “using a computer to track objects and measure their motion using a real-time base”, in this case the one provided by the time sequence of the frames in a video clip; in addition, he and his collaborators developed a system t...|$|R
