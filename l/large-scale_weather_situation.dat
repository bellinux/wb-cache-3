40|$|A statistical-dynamical {{downscaling}} {{procedure for}} global climate simulations is described. The procedure {{is based on}} the assumption that any regional climate is associated with a specific frequency distribution of classified large-scale weather situations. The frequency distributions are derived from multi-year episodes of low resolution global climate simulations. Highly resolved regional distributions of wind and temperature are calculated with a regional model for each class of <b>large-scale</b> <b>weather</b> <b>situation.</b> They are statistically evaluated by weighting them with the according climate-specific frequency. The procedure is exemplarily applied to the Alpine region for a global climate simulation of the present climate. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new Copula-based method for further downscaling regional climate simulations. It is developed, applied and evaluated for selected {{stations in the}} alpine region of Germany. Apart from the common way to use Copulas to model the extreme values, a strategy is proposed which allows to model continous time series. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} positive pairs of observed and modelled (RCM) precipitation. As the concept of Copulas requires independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables, meteorological fields are transformed using an ARMA-GARCH time series model. The dependence structures between modelled and observed precipitation are conditioned on the prevailing <b>large-scale</b> <b>weather</b> <b>situation.</b> The impact of the altitude of the stations and their distance to the surrounding modelled grid cells is analyzed. Based on the derived theoretical Copula models, stochastic rainfall simulations are performed, finally allowing for bias corrected and locally refined RCM simulations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Although the Mesoscale Community Compressible (MC 2) model {{successfully}} reproduces {{the wind}} climate (for wind energy development purposes) of the Gaspé region, equivalent simulations for the steep moun-tainous southern Yukon have been unsatisfactory. An {{important part of}} the problem lies in the provision of suit-able boundary conditions in the lower troposphere. This paper will describe an alternative provision of boundary conditions to the MC 2 model based partly on standard National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis statistics, however, with modified lower tropos-pheric conditions based on local radiosonde measurements. The MC 2 model is part of the AnemoScope wind energy simulation toolkit which applies statistical-dynamical downscaling of basic <b>large-scale</b> <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> (i. e., the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis) to simulate the steady-state wind climate of a complex region. A case study summarized here imposes a typical mean winter tempera-ture inversion on the boundary conditions to reduce downward momentum transfer in the MC 2 model over the Whitehorse region. In conjunction with this step, the geostrophic wind at the boundaries is held constant (with height) in speed and direction, based on the (observed) dominant southwesterly winds above the mountaintops. The resulting simulation produces wind directions within the modelled domain that are in much better agreement with the available measurements. However, despite the imposed atmospheric stability, downward transfer of hor...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{estimation}} of the seasonal distribution of strong wind and storm <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> in an ECHAM 3 /T 42 climate model simulation in relation to observed conditions. Observational data of the German Eight and the southern Baltic Sea are taken to compare observations and climate model simulation. The {{results of the study}} show significant differences in the seasonal Frequency of occurrence for strong wind and storm <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> between simulation and observations. A new objective classification routine for detecting single strong wind and storm <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> (Bft 7 and more) in coarse resolution models is used to validate the large-scale parameters of those events in the climate simulation. The objective classification routine is able to detect strong wind and storm <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> of two flow regimes in the German Eight in winter. The routine is applied to the ECMWF Re-Analysis (T 42 resolution) and to a climate simulation of the northern Hemisphere, which was performed with the ECHAM 3 /T 42.

40|$|Aircraft {{flying through}} cold ice-supersaturated air produce {{persistent}} contrails which {{contribute to the}} climate impact of aviation. Here, we demonstrate {{the importance of the}} <b>weather</b> <b>situation,</b> together with the route and altitude of the aircraft through this, on estimating contrail coverage. The results have implications for determining the climate impact of contrails as well as potential mitigation strategies. Twenty-one years of re-analysis data are used to produce a climatological assessment of conditions favorable for persistent contrail formation between 200 and 300 hPa over the north Atlantic in winter. The seasonal-mean frequency of cold ice-supersaturated regions is highest near 300 hPa, and decreases with altitude. The frequency of occurrence of ice-supersaturated regions varies with <b>large-scale</b> <b>weather</b> pattern; the most common locations are over Greenland, on the southern side of the jet stream and around the northern edge of high pressure ridges. Assuming aircraft take a great circle route, as opposed to a more realistic time-optimal route, is likely to lead to an error in the estimated contrail coverage, which can exceed 50 % for westbound north Atlantic flights. The probability of contrail formation can increase or decrease with height, depending on the weather pattern, indicating that the generic suggestion that flying higher leads to fewer contrails is not robust...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} an attempt to {{contribute}} to the research of historical climatology of Central Europe. The representation and working out of the spatial and temporal differentiation of the secular variations in temperature occurring in Central Europe in the last one hundred or two hundred years were to the fore of the study. By means of the Gaussian low-pass filtering method the mean air temperatures for months, years and seasons have been calculated and graphically represented for 42 stations. The analysis of the climatic eiement showed extensive variations. The variations in climate which have occurred are primarily caused, as has been proved, by changes in the general <b>weather</b> <b>Situation</b> of Central Europe. Frequency counts of the general <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> for seasons and years in the period from 1881 to 1982 conveyed a very differentiated picture of the variations of the circulation structure above Europe during this Observation period. Furthermore the study was to clarify the question to what degree the observed circulation variations would explain the secular march of temperature. First it was necessary to relate frequencies of the general <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> and general <b>weather</b> types to the annual and seasonal temperatures and thus to make clear the regional effects of the different <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> on the temperature circumstances. Thus the main tendencies in the secular march of temperature could be connected with the frequency variations of certain general <b>weather</b> <b>situations</b> and general <b>weather</b> types respectively, and the variations in climate could be explained by changed circulation conditions...|$|R

Using this approach we receive weather objects out of complete data fields which should be avoided by UAVs. All information on the NoGo-Areas, like precise spatial coordinates and time signatures, are stored within a newly developed XML-format.
