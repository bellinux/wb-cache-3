5|$|Harvey {{started the}} tour well and was highly {{productive}} in seven first-class matches <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tests. He scored 100 and 145 not out against North Eastern Transvaal and Orange Free State. There were two matches against a South African XI that were effectively dress rehearsals for the Tests.

He had scored 480 runs at 60.00 in the matches leading up to the Tests.|$|E

Also, the areas <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying {{was carried}} out in the castle grounds during the 18th century, and the {{gatehouse}} <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer bailey was demolished to build a track for the stones to be removed from the site. In 1840 the castle was purchased by John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache, at that time the largest landowner in Cheshire, {{as part of a larger}} estate. In the mid-19th century the castle was the site of an annual two-day fete, raising money for local widows and orphans and attracting more than 3000 visitors a day.|$|E
5|$|The altos and tenors {{are joined}} after seven bars by the fugue {{subject in the}} soprano voice. After a further seven bars the basses sing the last {{statement}} of the subject, accompanied by the full orchestra playing colla parte except for the two alto recorders, bringing the first fugato section to a close. The alto recorders play fragmented quaver figures in unison {{some of which are}} derived from the angular three-note continuo motif, <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first seven bar homophonic choral passage.|$|E
5|$|This {{institutionalized}} neglect further {{hurt the}} standing of the brand, in turn causing significant financial damage to Burger King's franchisees. By {{the time of}} the sale, Burger King's revenues and market share had declined significantly, and the company had fallen to a near tie for second place with rival Wendy's in the US market for hamburger chain restaurants. For many years <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> early 2000s, Burger King and its various owners plus many of its larger franchisees closed many under-performing stores. Several of its largest franchisees entered bankruptcy due to the issues surrounding the performance of the brand.|$|E

5|$|Varroa {{destructor}} is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on {{honey bees}} by consuming their hemolymph. Varroa mites parasitize {{all types of}} honey bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) depending on their life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads {{to an increase in}} mite fecundity (# of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on all types of honey bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.|$|E
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, {{in particular the}} Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, <b>leading</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph of the hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
