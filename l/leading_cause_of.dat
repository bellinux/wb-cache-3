5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death in the United States, and it is currently the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E

5|$|TBI is a <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{death and}} {{disability}} {{around the globe}} and presents a major worldwide social, economic, and health problem. It {{is the number one}} cause of coma, it plays the leading role in disability due to trauma, and is the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> brain damage in children and young adults. In Europe it is responsible for more years of disability than any other cause. It also plays a significant role in half of trauma deaths.|$|E
5|$|A {{hospital}} was established at Fort Russell for U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel. In August 1840, the Army surgeon {{at the hospital}} treated 103 patients, including 23 for fever and 26 for dysentery. Dysentery was the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death at the fort, followed by malaria, tuberculosis, gunshot wounds and alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death (30%) amongst {{women in the}} United States, and the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women {{under the age of}} 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
50|$|HCV {{is among}} the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> liver disease around the world.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This is {{an increase}} in the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, {{and the fifth}} commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) {{by the time they}} are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E

25|$|All <b>of</b> the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> {{morbidity}} from 1992–1997 were communicable diseases, {{and showed}} {{a reduction in}} rates for every 1,000,000 population, except for pneumonia (836.30 to 1,200.23), diarrhea (1,059.40 to 1,133.11), influenza (655.36 to 926.74), and malaria (216.80 to 366.5). With regards to the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> mortality, lifestyle-related diseases like cardiovascular diseases and cancer top the list, replacing the communicable diseases.|$|R
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{cervical}} cancer was the third-most common cancer in women worldwide, with rates varying geographically {{from less than}} one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. It is a <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> cancer-related death in poor countries, where delayed diagnosis leading to poor outcomes is common. The introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) {{cervical cancer}}, however this has mainly taken place in developed countries. Most developing countries have limited or no screening, and 85% of the global burden occurring there.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in Jordan {{is around}} 74.6 years. The <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death is cardiovascular diseases, followed by cancer.

From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have car accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through its Fatality Analysis Reporting System stated that auto fatalities continue to be the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death for young adults.|$|E

Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest.
