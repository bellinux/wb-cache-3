50|$|Many {{trucks are}} {{supported}} by <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions.</b> <b>Leaf</b> <b>springs</b> offer exceptional articulation, a large payload and can take {{a substantial amount of}} abuse. With the correct methods they can be modified to help a vehicle carry more weight, have better articulation or to fit large oversized tires. Some vehicles may be equipped with front and rear leaf springs or just rear leaf springs with independent front suspension.|$|R

50|$|The chassis was understandably substantial, with a {{conventional}} semi-elliptic <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> arrangement at the front. At the rear the forward-facing Bugatti quarter-elliptics were supplemented {{by a second}} set facing to the rear.|$|R
50|$|All models had <b>leaf</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>suspension.</b> The SD33 {{vehicles}} feature 24-volt electronics. Different trim {{options and}} colors were available, with options including vinyl or carpet floors and blue or brown interior trim. Air conditioning and power steering were available on deluxe models.|$|R
50|$|In June 1965, the Renault Super Goélette SG2 {{replaced}} the Goélette with new features: wide curved windscreen, {{replacement of the}} sheet metal dashboard, steering wheel shifter, front independent, variable flexibility <b>suspension</b> with coil <b>springs</b> (rear <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> in 1967), telescopic shock absorbers and high ground clearance. However, the gasoline engine was a Étendard type.|$|R
50|$|The {{steerable}} front {{truck was}} fitted with twin duplex wheels (four tyres), the inner wheels equipped with pneumatic drum brakes. The duplex wheels rode on swinging wishbone axles with transverse semi-elliptical <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> A steering lock was included for use during rear towing.|$|R
50|$|The gun {{had split}} trail {{carriage}} {{adapted from the}} 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20). The carriage was fitted with <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and metal wheels with pneumatic tires. The carriage also featured equlibrator. The shield gave the crew some protection from small arms and shell fragments.|$|R
5000|$|To meet {{demands for}} a faster part-load goods service, the {{high-speed}} [...] "Gs Oppeln" [...] class vans were built from 1937 in series. By designing it with a wheelbase of 6,000 mm, outer longitudinal beams and 7 <b>leaf,</b> 1,400-mm-long <b>suspension</b> <b>springs</b> the van {{was able to be}} rated for a top speed of 90 km/h. The wagons had no handbrake, a length over buffers of 9,100 mm, a loading volume of 45 m³, a payload of 15 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 17.5 tonnes. They had a pointed underframe (spitz zulaufendes Sprengwerk) and were fitted with a Hildebrandt-Knorr air brake.|$|R
50|$|Harry C. Stutz, {{who later}} formed a company bearing his name, {{designed}} {{the first car}} for the new enterprise. However, Stutz quickly left and Fred L. Tone took over as chief engineer in 1906. Tone re-designed the chassis (frame) below the axles and the semi-elliptic <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> system mounted above.|$|R
50|$|All {{vehicles}} were built with space frames made from welded aircraft grade aluminum tube and ABS plastic bodies. They all had solid axles with <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> front and rear. Top speeds were about 30 mi/h km/h - 50 mi/h km/h, and range {{was up to}} 40 mi per charge.|$|R
50|$|M1910/34 {{combined}} {{a barrel}} of the M1910/30 with a carriage of the 122-mm gun M1931. The barrel was of built-up construction; it was equipped with interrupted screw breechblock and recoil system consisting of hydraulic buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. The split-trail carriage had <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and wheels with solid rubber tires.|$|R

50|$|A further {{development}} of the Panzer IV series also by Krupp. It used <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> the HL 116 engine and the motor compartment of the VK 20.01(III). Maximum speed was to be 42 km/h, {{same as it was}} on the Panzer IV Ausf. C. This was later redesignated as the VK 20.01(BW) and then as the B.W.40.|$|R
50|$|King Kong and Bear Foot each {{followed}} Bigfoot to 66 in tires, {{and soon}} other monster trucks, such as King Krunch, Maddog, and Virginia Giant were being constructed. These early trucks were built off of stock chassis which were heavily reinforced, used <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> a stock body, and heavy military axles {{to support the}} tires.|$|R
5000|$|The first vehicle {{built by}} the {{automotive}} division of Fuji Heavy Industries was called the Subaru 1500, with the development code-name of P1. The prototype used a monocoque body structure and adopting the [...] "ponton" [...] style appearance, with an independent front wishbone suspension and a rear <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> with three plates and a live rear axle.|$|R
50|$|Rough terrain {{capacity}} {{was somewhat}} limited however: though all four road wheels were actuated, the <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> confined the off-road speed to 42 km/h and {{the possession of}} just four wheels allowed for a wading and a trench crossing capacity of only sixty centimetres; it could overcome a thirty cm vertical obstacle, assisted by two small bottom wheels in the front hull.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} later {{variation}} of the Blomberg M found on the GP60 and F59PH models. The main spotting features of this version are <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> (as opposed to rubber pads) and exposed roller bearing ends, along with damper shocks between the trucks and locomotive carbody to reduce sway. Similar looking trucks can be found under modern MPI MPXpress locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} with World War I-era guns, the M1931 had split trail carriage, allowing for much wider traverse angle. The carriage was fitted with <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and ten-spoke metal wheels with solid rubber tires. Some late production pieces had ML-20-type wheels with pneumatic tires. The carriage also featured spring-type equlibrator. The shield gave the crew some protection from small arms and shell fragments.|$|R
50|$|The B360 was {{a pickup}} truck bodystyle based on parts of the R360 coupé. It used the same 356 cc engine, but mounted it in front with rear wheel drive. Like most pickups, it used a rigid rear axle and <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> The engine was {{replaced}} with the Carol's 358 cc I4 in 1964, and the B360 {{was replaced by the}} Mazda E360 in 1967.|$|R
50|$|The Rock Island Arsenal {{produced}} a small tank for the cavalry which used vertical volute <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> instead of <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> Standardized as the M1 Combat Car, it entered service with the US Army in 1937. The design {{was used in}} the M2 light tank and subsequent Stuart tank series. Design features of the Stuart were scaled up for use in the first M2 medium tanks which would evolve into the more successful M3 Lee and M4 Sherman, all using the VVSS.|$|R
50|$|Shinjin RC420TP, {{the express}} bus class was {{introduced}} on February 1971. The body was used from Hino RC300P series, but used the longer Hino RC320P chassis. This series were equip with the Hino's DK20-T turbo-diesel engine. The last one was produced on June 1972. Only 67 units were made before GM Korea took over. Other version, the RC420 sub series were also made with <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|The 1935 Ford was a {{thorough}} refresh {{on the popular}} V8-powered Ford. The four-cylinder Model A engine was no longer offered, leaving just the 221 CID (3.6 L) V8 to power every Ford car and truck. The transverse <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> remained, but the front spring was relocated ahead of the axle to allow more interior volume. The body was lowered and new [...] "Center-Poise" [...] seating improved comfort.|$|R
50|$|The DB design {{resembled the}} T-34 in its hull and turret {{and was also}} to be powered by a diesel engine. It was also driven from the rear drive {{sprocket}} with the turret situated forward. The incorporation of a diesel engine promised increased operational range, reduced flammability and allowed for more efficient use of petroleum reserves. Hitler himself considered a diesel engine imperative for the new tank. DB's proposal used an external <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> {{in contrast to the}} MAN proposal of twin torsion bars. Wa Pruef 6's opinion was that the <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> was a disadvantage and that using torsion bars would allow greater internal hull width. It also opposed the rear drive because of the potential for track fouling. Daimler Benz still preferred the leaf springs over a torsion bar suspension as it resulted in a silhouette about 200 mm shorter and rendered complex shock absorbers unnecessary. The employment of a rear drive provided additional crew space and also allowed for a better slope on the front hull, which was considered important in preventing penetration by armour-piercing shells.|$|R
25|$|The Toronado was GM's first {{subframe}} automobile, {{which means}} it was partly unitized, and used a subframe that ended at the forward end of the rear <b>suspension</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> serving as an attachment point for the springs. It carried the powertrain, front suspension and floorpan, allowing greater isolation of road and engine harshness (the design was conceptually similar to the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird that would debut for 1967).|$|R
30|$|The chassis is a force-path subsystem. By {{comparing}} different classic automotive {{structures for}} technical feasibility and cost, a chassis frame is designed using swing arm and <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{as shown in}} Figure  6 (c). The combination of the steering subsystem with the chassis is shown as Figure  6 (d) and 6 (e). The chassis links the steering system using interface E. The rotation is performed by the steering shaft and bearings.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 the Minicab {{underwent}} {{its first}} model change, with the Minicab EL offering a new interior and a longer cargo bed. Called the T130 {{it was only}} available in truck form, with the old LT30 van soldiering on until the third generation was introduced in 1976. Ride quality was improved with {{the adoption of a}} front wishbone and rear <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> The EL received all new bodywork with tiny rectangular headlamps.|$|R
50|$|The newest models, the Superformance MKII Slab Side and FIA are {{designed}} to emulate the great Cobra 289 street cars from the golden era of racing in the 1960s. Unlike most competitors, these Supeformance replicas of the Slab Side and FIA are built on the successful Tojeiro-styled round tube chassis and features an authentic transverse <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> The MKII Slab Side and FIA are the latest licensed Shelby product in the Superformance lineup.|$|R
50|$|The first Beacon was {{equipped}} with an air cooled JAP V-twin engine which had a displacement of 1248 cc. The 7 feet 6 inch (2286 mm) wheelbase, 3 feet 10 inch (1150 mm) track chassis was a conventional one with half elliptic <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> front and rear but the bodywork could be specified made from cane basketwork. Drive was to the rear axle through a variable ratio friction drive and chains.|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} (M) {{version of}} the truck called the Blomberg M was used starting with the four-axle Dash 2 series locomotives. Hydraulic snubbers (shocks) were used on diagonally opposite (front right and rear left) journals, and the <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> was replaced with rubber pads. This version had only one brake actuating cylinder per side and revised brake rigging using threaded adjusters, {{reducing the number of}} brake shoes to 4 versus 8 on the earlier B model.|$|R
5000|$|The S9, a model {{based on}} the 840 JL truck range cab, is powered by the F 646 Fulgur engine, a 6.8-litre six-cylinder diesel {{delivering}} [...] at 1,500 rpm and a torque of 422 Nm at 1,650 rpm. The truck has a six-speed [...] "synchromesh" [...] manual gearbox. As the other S models, the S9 has a <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and a gammer worm and roller steering. Its wheelbases are between 3000 mm and 4600 mm.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the vibration absorption effect for the agricultural product transportation-trailer equipped with vibration absorbable connecting hitch, <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> and shock absorber simultaneously (HLS), comparing with the trailer equipped with vibration absorbable connecting hitch only(H), trailer equipped with connecting hitch and <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> (HL), and existing trailer with no vibration absorption device (E). Methods: Vertical accelerations were measured at driver seat and front, middle, rear parts of trailer bottom with no load for 4 types of transportation-trailer, and analyzed using FFT analyzer. Results: The magnitude of average vibration accelerations occurred up to 20 Hz, at this low frequencies the severe damage for agricultural products could be represented, was lower (maximum 6 times) for HLS trailer compared with H trailer. And vibration absorption effect for HLS trailer was also higher up to 40 - 80 Hz and 80 - 100 Hz, but the difference was less. At driver seat, the vibration absorption effect was high severely for HL and HLS trailer, and the magnitude of vibration acceleration was showed less difference in comparing at trailer bottom. Conclusions: From the test results, it could be recommended that the agricultural products transportation trailer should b...|$|R
