5|$|Former guitarist Scott Danough {{has said}} that he is {{influenced}} by metal and hardcore bands, <b>like</b> <b>At</b> <b>The</b> Gates, Slayer, Cradle of Filth, Integrity and Earth Crisis. Vocalist Brandan Schieppati has also mentioned American thrash metal bands as an influence on Bleeding Through, e.g. Testament or Exodus. In an interview, guitarist Brian Leppke added Cro-Mags, Entombed, Crowbar and Pantera as well to the list of influences. Lastly, keyboardist Marta Peterson is the one who brings industrial, symphonic black metal, and goth inspirations to the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|The single {{received}} a mixed reception from music critics who highlighted her genre combinations but downplayed the lyrics. A music video was not {{created for the}} single, but the singer performed it live on several occasions, <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Heaven nightclub in London in February 2012. The performance was compared to ones by both Rihanna and Robyn.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look <b>like.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{influenced}} by works that Chahi <b>liked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. The art and atmosphere were influenced by science fiction books such as Dune, artists such as Michael Whelan, and comic illustrators such as Richard Corben. Manga such as Dragon Ball influenced the way it suggests a lot with very little, character blurring effects, and charging power attacks.|$|R

25|$|The state {{includes}} two natural {{regions of the}} United States: the Central Lowlands and the Interior Low Plateaus. The till plains make up the northern and central regions of Indiana. Much of its appearance {{is a result of}} elements left behind by glaciers. Central Indiana is mainly flat with some low rolling hills (except where rivers cut deep valleys through the plain, <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Wabash River and Sugar Creek) and soil composed of glacial sands, gravel and clay, which results in exceptional farmland. Northern Indiana is similar, except for the presence of higher and hillier terminal moraines and hundreds of kettle lakes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, the most {{prominent}} noblemen established themselves on the upper Sablon and on rue aux Laines. The Egmonts, the Culemborgs, the Brederodes and the Mansfelds were the first, and the De Lannoys, the De Lalaings, the Thurn und Taxis, and the Solres joined them. The result was that by the seventeenth century, the Sablon area had grown {{to become the most}} aristocratic and prosperous area in the city. The Egmont Palace on the Petit Sablon is still standing, and gives the best indication of what the area was <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> height of its splendour; the grandiose houses of the Lannoys and the Mérode-Westerloo family still stand in rue aux Laines. In 1566 the Culemborg mansion on rue des Petits Carmes/Karmelietenstraat was the site of the drafting of the Compromise of Nobles which ultimately led to the Dutch Revolt. To eliminate any trace of this seditious act against the king, the Duke of Alba razed the mansion to the ground in 1568.|$|E
25|$|The {{introductory}} {{rolling stock}} was single-coach, <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, in other Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kanpur), {{because the new}} mode of transport was experimental. Since it gained popularity quickly, another coach was attached some years later (as in Mumbai), which is now standard. Double decker trams (like Mumbai's) were never used in Kolkata. Triple-coach trams were unsuccessfully tried. Single-coach trams were used on the Shibpur line until its closure in 1970. Later stock was of the SLT type. It was double-coach with three doors, four wheels under each coach and no wheels between coaches. SLT trams had no front iron net, but had a front-coach trolley pole. The both-end type had a front iron net and a rear-coach trolley pole. SLTs were the first double-coach trams, introduced only on the Kolkata side of the Hooghly River (not on the Howrah side). These were gradually replaced by articulated trams on all routes. The SLC type was introduced much later on the Bandhaghat line, and continued until its closure in 1971; after that, SLC trams began running on the G/H and T/G lines on the Kolkata side. Articulated trams were in use until 1989.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, a small figure dated {{at around}} 800 AD was {{discovered}} in Hårby, Denmark by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top. Over {{the top of her}} dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding.

500|$|Join Hands {{was written}} {{over a period}} of six months. In 1979, the band watched news reports from Iran, {{including}} scenes of repression and curfews; {{it was one of the}} first times they had seen images of people being shot and killed on television. In England, the political situation was also unstable, with rubbish piling up in the streets of London. Siouxsie Sioux saw it as [...] "a real time, everything in flocks and uncertain but also festering underneath, and because this stuff from the past that was just left there rotting there and it needed to be acknowledged and then cleaned up, not just swept away still rotting". The band were inspired by these events. The theme of war emerged through the songs: rather than a pro-military message, the lyrics were meant to capture the spirit of what things were <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Miranda Sawyer stated that Join Hands took [...] "the very un-rock'n'roll topic of World War I as its inspiration".|$|E
500|$|The Japanese and American carrier forces {{discovered}} {{each other}} in the early morning of 26 October and each side launched air strikes. Shōkaku was badly damaged by six hits from 's dive bombers; Zuikaku was not spotted or attacked as she was hidden by the overcast conditions, just <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Coral Sea. In exchange, the Japanese crippled Hornet with two torpedoes and three bombs. In addition, two aircraft crashed into the American carrier and inflicted serious damage. Enterprise was also damaged by two bomb hits and a near miss and a destroyer was damaged when it was struck by a B5N. Attacks later in the day further damaged Hornet, which was abandoned and later sunk by Japanese destroyers [...] and [...] The Japanese lost nearly half their aircraft that participated in the battle, together with their irreplaceable experienced aircrew. On 2 November, the First Carrier Division was ordered home for repairs and training.|$|E
500|$|Silicate volcanism, {{involving}} basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic (magnesium-rich) compositions, {{was confirmed}} by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s and 2000s from temperature measurements of Io's numerous hot spots, locations where thermal emission is detected, and from spectral measurements of Io's dark material. Temperature measurements from Galileos Solid-State Imager (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) revealed numerous hot spots with high-temperature components ranging from at least [...] {{to a maximum of}} , <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Pillan Patera eruption in 1997. Initial estimates {{during the course of the}} Galileo mission suggesting eruption temperatures approaching [...] have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to calculate the temperatures. Spectral observations of Io's dark material suggested the presence of orthopyroxenes, such as enstatite, magnesium-rich silicate minerals common in mafic and ultramafic basalt. This dark material is seen in volcanic pits, fresh lava flows, and pyroclastic deposits surrounding recent, explosive volcanic eruptions. Based on the measured temperature of the lava and the spectral measurements, some of the lava may be analogous to terrestrial komatiites. Compressional superheating, which could increase the temperature of magma during ascent to the surface during an eruption, may also be a factor in some of the higher temperature eruptions.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Cave Story earned widespread critical acclaim. 1UP.com {{described it}} as [...] "so massive that it rivals modern [...] Castlevania and Metroid games in terms of scope and play time". Matt Miller of Game Informer observed that Cave Story combines elements of Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, The Legend of Zelda, and Castlevania into an [...] "engrossing, challenging, and quite lengthy" [...] whole. Inside Mac Games ascribed the game's popularity to its [...] "polished feel, engaging storyline, and compelling artwork". Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that [...] "the burgeoning Western indie game scene owes a tremendous debt to Japanese pioneers like Studio Pixel, whose freeware hit Cave Story proved that with sufficient vision, skill, and passion, a single developer can still craft a deep, compelling action game". Jonathan Holmes of Destructoid called Cave Story an [...] "important game", observing its influence on artistic indie games like Braid, {{as well as the}} continued relevance of 2D game design (cf. Capcom's Mega Man 9). He also compares the game design to that of Shigeru Miyamoto in its ability to teach without tutorials, <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of Super Mario Bros. In July 2006, Cave Story earned 1st place in Super PLAYs list of the 50 best freeware games of all time. In July 2015, the game placed 14th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.|$|E
500|$|McGovern was {{assigned}} to Liberal Army Airfield in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with. McGovern recalled later: [...] "Learning how to fly the B‑24 was {{the toughest part of}} the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because {{in the early part of}} the war, they didn't have hydraulic controls. If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that's about what it was <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> controls. It was the biggest bomber we had at the time." [...] Eleanor was constantly afraid of her husband's suffering an accident while training, which claimed a huge toll of airmen over the course of the war. This schooling was followed by a stint at Lincoln Army Airfield in Nebraska, where McGovern met his B-24 crew. Traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds proved to be a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation. The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others due to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe. Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child, and Eleanor became pregnant. In June 1944, McGovern's crew received final training at Mountain Home Army Air Field in Idaho. They then shipped out via Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia, where McGovern found history books with which to fill downtime, especially during the trip overseas on a slow troopship.|$|E
500|$|The {{alpha test}} for A Realm Reborn began {{shortly after the}} {{original}} release's finale and ended in late December 2012. During this period, Wada admitted {{that the development of}} A Realm Reborn was a cause of delay for many Square Enix titles at the time. Yoshida published an updated roadmap for the beta test through launch, indicating four phases of beta beginning in mid-February 2013. He claimed that the team is [...] "adamant the game not be released until it is ready" [...] and that launching too early [...] "would be <b>like</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> level of destroying the company". In May 2013, Square Enix announced the release date for the game, along with details about pre-order bonuses and the collector's edition, which includes an art book, a bonus disc with a recap of the original release story, a soundtrack sampler, and several cosmetic in-game items. In June 2013, the company revealed a PlayStation 4 version was in development and due for release in 2014. Early access began on August 24, 2013, with players able to play continuously through to the August 27 launch. Players throughout this period noted continued server issues. Due to an [...] "overwhelmingly positive response", the servers could not handle the number of concurrent players, prompting Square Enix to temporarily suspend digital sales of the game. In light of these issues, Yoshida issued an apology to fans for the game's [...] "rocky" [...] launch and reassured them that fixes were in progress and new servers would be created. A week after launch, the game received a ten-hour maintenance and fresh patches, and all players were compensated with a week of free play time.|$|E
