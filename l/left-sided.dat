5|$|The RLN may be {{compressed}} by tumors. Studies {{have shown}} that 218% of lung cancer patients develop hoarseness because of recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, usually <b>left-sided.</b> This is associated with worse outcomes, and when found as a presenting symptom, often indicates inoperable tumors. The nerve may be severed intentionally during lung cancer surgery in order to fully remove a tumor.|$|E
5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the <b>left-sided</b> arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
5|$|Raymond Kennedy (born 28 July 1951) is an English former footballer who {{won every}} {{domestic}} honour {{in the game}} with Arsenal and Liverpool in the 1970s and early 1980s. Kennedy played as a forward for Arsenal, and then played as a <b>left-sided</b> midfielder for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the Football League and also won 17 caps for England between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals.|$|E
5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a <b>left-sided,</b> offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} crossing ability with his left foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E
5|$|After eleven players {{left the}} club in 2014, Adams rebuilt for the 2014–15 {{campaign}} by signing <b>left-sided</b> player Colin Daniel, Northern Ireland internationals Ryan McGivern and Michael O'Connor, pacey winger Mark Marshall, Crewe Alexandra attacker Byron Moore, veteran midfielder Michael Brown, and midfielder Steve Jennings, and also took in three loanees in Swiss full-back Freddie Veseli, highly rated striker Jordan Slew and French target man Achille Campion. Defeat to local rivals Crewe Alexandra marked the club's fifth consecutive loss, and after the game Adams accepted that his position would be under threat if results did not turn around quickly. Following six straight defeats Adams resigned as manager on 18 September after lengthy discussions with the chairman.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in former pit village Seaton Delaval, he spent a year at Port Vale as a schoolboy, before {{returning}} to Northumberland {{to work in a}} sweet factory after he was released at the age of 16. He was then spotted playing for New Hartley Juniors by Arsenal, and went on to turn professional at the club in November 1968. He made his first team debut ten months later, and {{went on to win the}} Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970, the First Division and FA Cup Double in 1970–71, and then play on the losing side in the 1972 FA Cup Final. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record £200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that Bill Shankly resigned as manager. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager Bob Paisley converted him to a <b>left-sided</b> midfielder he went on to help Liverpool to become the dominant club of English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, and 1981–82), the FA Charity Shield four times (1976, 1977, 1979 and 1980), the European Cup three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the UEFA Cup (1976), UEFA Super Cup (1977), and League Cup (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1981), and World Club Championship (1981) and won the Match of the Days Goal of the Season award in 1977–78.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, Messi {{plays in}} a free attacking role; a {{versatile}} player, {{he is capable of}} attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or <b>left-sided</b> forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence {{into the middle of the}} pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career, while also being deployed in a deeper, free role. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, or in a deeper, creative role as a classic number 10 or attacking midfielder.|$|E

25|$|Colonoscopy reduces {{cancer rates}} by {{detecting}} some colon polyps and cancers {{on the left}} side of the colon early enough that they may be treated, and a smaller number on the right side; many of these <b>left-sided</b> growths would likewise have been detected by a safer sigmoidoscopy procedure.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be a result of tensing of the chordae tendineae during rapid filling and {{expansion}} of the ventricle. In other words, an S3 heart sound indicates increased volume of blood within the ventricle. An S3 heart sound is best heard with the bell-side of the stethoscope (used for lower frequency sounds). A <b>left-sided</b> S3 is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position and at the apex of the heart, which is normally located in the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. A right-sided S3 is best heard at the lower-left sternal border. The way to distinguish between a left and right-sided S3 is to observe whether it increases in intensity with inhalation or exhalation. A right-sided S3 will increase on inhalation, while a <b>left-sided</b> S3 will increase on exhalation.|$|E
25|$|Deep {{inspiration}} breath-hold (DIBH) is {{a method}} of delivering radiotherapy while limiting radiation exposure to the heart and lungs. It is used primarily for treating <b>left-sided</b> breast cancer. The technique involves a patient holding their breath during treatment. There are two basic methods of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold and spirometry-monitored deep inspiration breath hold.|$|E
25|$|The Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) uses {{continuous}} wave Doppler {{to measure the}} Doppler flow profile VTI. It uses anthropometry to calculate aortic and pulmonary valve diameters and CSAs, allowing right-sided and <b>left-sided</b> Q measurements. In comparison to the echocardiographic method, USCOM significantly improves reproducibility and increases sensitivity of the detection of changes in flow. Real-time, automatic tracing of the Doppler flow profile allows beat-to-beat right-sided and <b>left-sided</b> Q measurements, simplifying operation and reducing the time of acquisition compared to conventional echocardiography. USCOM has been validated from 0.12 l/min to 18.7 l/min in new-born babies, children and adults. The method can be applied with equal accuracy to patients of all ages {{for the development of}} physiologically rational haemodynamic protocols. USCOM is the only method of cardiac output measurement to have achieved equivalent accuracy to the implantable flow probe. This accuracy has ensured high levels of clinical use in conditions including sepsis, heart failure and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|In {{principle}} {{confidence intervals}} can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (<b>left-sided</b> interval or right sided interval), {{but it can}} also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.|$|E
25|$|If {{you need}} {{stability}} then the ROC must contain the unit circle. If {{you need a}} causal system then the ROC must contain infinity and the system function will be a right-sided sequence. If you need an anticausal system then the ROC must contain the origin and the system function will be a <b>left-sided</b> sequence. If you need both, stability and causality, all the poles of the system function must be inside the unit circle.|$|E

25|$|Speed {{began his}} career with Leeds United as a trainee when he left school in June 1988, and was Peter Swan's boot boy, before he signed a {{professional}} contract on 13 June 1988. Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson first noticed Speed in a youth team game while the player was playing in a left back position. Under Wilkinson, {{he made his first}} team debut aged 19 in a goalless draw against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Second Division. He would go on to play in nine out of the ten outfield positions, although he was predominantly a <b>left-sided</b> player.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular malformations (typically {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, {{and some}} other <b>left-sided</b> cardiac malformations) and hypertension predispose to aortic dilatation and dissection in the general population. Indeed, these same risk factors are found in more than 90% of patients with Turner syndrome who develop aortic dilatation. Only {{a small number of}} patients (around 10%) have no apparent predisposing risk factors. The risk of hypertension is increased three-fold in patients with Turner syndrome. Because of its relation to aortic dissection, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and hypertension should be treated aggressively with an aim to keep blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg. As with the other cardiovascular malformations, complications of aortic dilatation is commonly associated with 45,X karyotype.|$|E
25|$|Ledley's first call-up to the Wales under-21 squad came {{midway through}} the 2004–05 season.

His manager at Cardiff Lennie Lawrence said that he {{expected}} Ledley to be getting a full Wales call-up very shortly. In May, Wales manager John Toshack, when talking about the impact of captain Ryan Giggs retiring, said that he was hopeful for the future because Ledley along with other <b>left-sided</b> youngsters Gareth Bale and Lewin Nyatanga were all very talented players who could play for the national team for years to come.|$|E
25|$|England {{kicked off}} their Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} campaign with two wins, 4–0 against Bulgaria and 3–1 away against Switzerland, yet could only draw 0–0 against group leaders Montenegro at Wembley. Capello made some changes afterwards, with Ferdinand and Gerrard {{out of the}} picture. John Terry was reinstated as captain to much criticism. The traditional 4–4–2 was transformed to 4–3–3, with Darren Bent as centre forward and Rooney as a <b>left-sided</b> forward. The result was successful, as England beat Wales 2–0 at the Millennium Stadium on 26 March 2011. England's next game was at Wembley against Switzerland on 4 June 2011, which they recovered from a 0–2 deficit to draw 2–2 with goals from Frank Lampard and Ashley Young.|$|E
25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, congenital heart defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) disease, or pericardial effusion. Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. <b>Left-sided</b> heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E
25|$|Sigursteinn Davíð Gíslason (25 June 1968 – 16 January 2012) was an Icelandic {{football}} player and manager.

During the 1999–2000 season, Sigursteinn joined English club Stoke City and played eight matches in the Football League. Following his retirement from playing, he became a coach at his former club KR and went on to spend three years as the club's assistant manager. In 2008, Sigursteinn was appointed as manager of Leiknir Reykjavík, a position he held for more than two seasons before being forced to retire through illness.|$|E
25|$|After the {{appointment}} of manager Harry Redknapp, Modrić was given a more familiar role as a central- or <b>left-sided</b> midfielder, allowing him to have more influence on the team and use his footballing talent more productively, for example in a 4–4 draw with arch-rivals Arsenal on 29 October. Since this performance, his form improved considerably, coinciding with his club's improved performance in the league. Redknapp recognised Modrić's value to his side, planning to shape his new team around the Croatian playmaker. Modrić scored his first competitive goal at Tottenham in a 2–2 draw against Spartak Moscow during the UEFA Cup group stages on 18 December 2008. He scored his first Premier League goals against Newcastle United in an away defeat on 21 December, a home win {{in the third round}} of the FA Cup against Wigan on 2 January 2009, and in an away defeat against Manchester United on 25 April 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{technique}} essential for creating designs that utilize an assortment of materials, the artist must first practice standardized styles. The classic standard Banmi Shofu Ryu designs are Moribana, Nageire, Chabana, Oseika and Gendaika. Ric Bansho also introduced a modern designed called Hashibana which comes in three expressions. These expressions are Maru (Global or spherical), Uate (tall and narrow) and Saba (low and narrow). Technical points that an artist needs to focus on when creating a design are: {{the length of the}} stems, degrees of slant, intentional space to be used, number of sections in the container, and whether the arrangement will be right or <b>left-sided.</b> Moribana, Nageire Keishatai, Oseika, and Banmi Shofu Chabana are only a few of such designs. Each design has its own characteristics, using particular flowers and specific arrangements styles, which may be appropriate for a certain environment such as a tearoom. The balance of the plants and flowers, combined with the appropriate container and spirit of the materials, creates a beautiful composition, which incorporates the naturalness of each design.|$|E
25|$|Cesare Prandelli was {{announced}} {{as the new}} man-in-charge of the Emilian side in May 2002. However, once more the winning players from the previous season were sold to raise money: Fabio Cannavaro went to Internazionale when he was club captain, Marco Di Vaio to Juventus and Johan Micoud to Werder Bremen and Parma slipped to an early season defeat in Tripoli to Juventus in the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana, but the depleted squad managed to finish above expectations in fifth place with the goals supplied by Adrian Mutu and Adriano in an attacking 4–3–3 formation, making up for the departure of Marco Di Vaio, and defensive solidity provided by Daniele Bonera and Matteo Ferrari. The following season, The sale of <b>left-sided</b> captain-to-be Mutu to Chelsea, injury to star striker Adriano, the culmination of Parmalat's financial meltdown - {{which resulted in the}} arrest of president Calisto Tanzi for embezzlement of money from parent company Parmalat and the re-formation of the club under a new name, Parma Football Club - and the threat of the club's continuing existence made life difficult for Parma, but they again finished fifth, in no small part due to the prolific Alberto Gilardino, who netted 23 league goals, a club record. On 28 April 2004, however, the club was declared insolvent. Calisto Tanzi's resignation came in January 2004.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{have often}} been stereotyped as a {{defensive}} and [...] "boring" [...] side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s; many comedians, such as Eric Morecambe, made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film The Full Monty, in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's offside trap, {{in an attempt to}} co-ordinate their striptease routine. Another film reference to the club's defence comes in the film Plunkett & Macleane, in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal's long-serving full backs– the right-sided Lee Dixon and the <b>left-sided</b> Nigel Winterburn.|$|E
500|$|Nutter {{predominantly}} {{played as}} a <b>left-sided</b> full-back, {{although he did}} play on the left wing {{in the early stages}} of his career. He was left-footed. Gillingham manager Mark Stimson [...] described him as [...] "an attacking full-back with plenty of technical ability", and stated that Nutter would [...] "offer plenty of width down the left hand side", in-turn being [...] "a constant attacking threat". He expressed a passion to pass the ball along the floor, and always prefers to pass the ball out as opposed to hitting it long. Talking about his time at Stevenage, Nutter [...] stated he would like to be remembered as a player [...] "who tried to play football the right way, passing the ball, technically good to watch and an honest player".|$|E

However he {{was never able to}} establish himself as England's <b>left-sided</b> midfielder of choice due to the form of Trevor Brooking. He played in British Home Championship games against Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, before he was dropped for the next seven games. He travelled with the squad for the 1977 tour of South America, and also that year claimed two more international goals in qualifying games against Luxembourg. He then dropped out of the England picture under new manager Ron Greenwood. He was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 1980 in Italy, playing against Belgium and Italy before he was dropped for England's final group game against Spain. He retired from international football on 17 caps in March 1981, citing dissatisfaction with the England hierarchy. Liverpool manager Bob Paisley wrote in his autobiography that [...] "for England he [...] was played quite wrongly in a defensive role, being asked to pick people up. Ray closes people down by positional skill and does not need to chase around the pitch". Kennedy stated that [...] "I feel more pride in the red jersey of Liverpool than the white shirt of England" [...] and that [...] "I am resigning here and now as Greenwood's bridesmaid".|$|E
