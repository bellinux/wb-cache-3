In 2015, a documentary entitled Diverted: TWA 514 was released.|$|R
50|$|Ito {{presided over}} the 1995 murder trial of O.J. Simpson, at which Simpson was acquitted. His {{decision}} to allow television coverage of the trial was controversial, and Ito faced criticism for seeming to enjoy the press and for allowing too many sidebars, recesses, etc. In his book Outrage, Vincent Bugliosi faults Ito for allowing {{the issue of race}} to enter the trial by permitting F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey's</b> cross-examination of Mark Fuhrman with respect to his use of racial epithets.|$|R

Douglas and Shawn Holley. Two attorneys specializing in DNA evidence, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, were hired to attempt to discredit the prosecution's DNA evidence. They argued that Simpson {{was the victim of}} police fraud and what they termed as sloppy internal procedures, which had contaminated the DNA evidence.|$|E
25|$|Hearst's {{attorney}} F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey</b> {{used the}} Stockholm Syndrome argument {{as part of}} the defense at trial. During Hearst's subsequent trial, her lawyer claimed that she had been confined in a closet barely large enough for her to lie down in; that her {{contact with the outside world}} was regulated by her captors; and that she was regularly threatened with execution. Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial. The SLA claimed to be holding Hearst according to the conditions of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E

San Francisco if either Belli or attorney F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey</b> were present on air. The police contacted Belli and Dunbar to arrange this {{in the hopes of}} capturing the individual. As promised, the suspect called, spoke a few words, and then hung up, repeating this activity 54 times over the next two hours. Belli received a letter from the Zodiac that same year.|$|E
25|$|PFC Michael Bernhardt â€“ Rifleman; {{he dropped}} out of the University of Miami to {{volunteer}} for the Army. Bernhardt refused to kill civilians in My Lai. Later, Captain Ernest Medina threatened Bernhardt, trying to deter him from exposing the massacre. As a result, Bernhardt was given more dangerous assignments such as point duty on patrol. He would later be afflicted with a form of trench foot as a direct result. Bernhardt told Ronald Ridenhour, who was not present in My Lai during the massacre, about the events, thus pushing him to continue his investigation. Later he would help expose and detail the massacre in numerous interviews with the press, and he served as a prosecution witness in the trial of Medina, where he was subjected to intense cross examination by defense counsel F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey</b> backed by a team of attorneys including Gary Myers. Michael Bernhardt is a recipient of the New York Society for Ethical Culture's 1970 Ethical Humanist Award.|$|E
25|$|In {{producing}} the special, the only existing master 16mm prints {{of the original}} series kinescope films were removed from storage and brought to a Manhattan editing facility that Goodson-Todman Productions rented. There, company employees Gil Fates, Bob Bach, Pamela Usdan and Bill Egan worked round-the-clock for three days to compile the 90-minute special under deadline pressure from ABC network official Bob Shanks. In the process of viewing and editing the films for the special, they accidentally damaged or destroyed several kinescope films which spanned the entire run of the original series, including a few that {{did not make the}} final cut of the retrospective. In addition, some unspooled film remained on the floor after the group's rented time at the facility ran out. An April 1967 episode featuring Candice Bergen as the mystery guest was lost in its entirety, as was a June 1967 episode featuring both Betty Grable and F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey.</b> Other episodes sustained only partial damage, such as a 1965 episode that is mainly damaged during the mystery guest appearance of Marian Anderson.|$|E
50|$|Tellem {{was born}} in Danville, California, the {{daughter}} of an anesthesiologist mother and surgeon father. Tellem got hooked on TV as a child through fan magazines that the networks used to mail out during the summer to promote new shows. As an undergraduate at the University of California Berkeley, she interned one summer for Congressman Ron Dellums (D-Calif.) on Capitol Hill and met her future husband, Arn Tellem. After earning a JD from the University of California Hastings College of the Law, she practiced law for four years in Los Angeles. Among her first jobs was chasing down people who claimed to be heirs to Howard Hughes's estate. Tellem then jumped to entertainment, working initially as the legal expert on famed lawyer F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey's</b> short-lived 1982 show Lie Detector. Eventually she would end up working for Merv Griffin on his Wheel of Fortune show before moving to Lorimar Television, where she was in the legal affairs department.|$|R

500|$|Seltzer and the Press later {{received}} harsh {{criticism for}} their {{handling of the}} case. Federal district judge Carl A. Weinmann, in his 1964 ruling that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial, partially blamed the media, particularly the Press: [...] "If {{ever there was a}} trial by newspaper, this is a perfect example. And the most insidious example was the Cleveland Press. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury". The United States Supreme Court ruled on June 6, 1966 in Sheppard v. Maxwell that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial because of the negative publicity he received in the press. F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> one of Sheppard's lawyers, later wrote that [...] "Seltzer used his newspaper like a club, ordering politicians around like minions and intimidating everyone who disagreed with him. If Seltzer was roused, he would spread a personally penned editorial across eight columns of his newspaper, seeking to grind some unfortunate dissident under his heel".|$|E
2500|$|E. Ronald Mallu, Esq. (Eugene Roche)â€”High priced {{attorney}} who defends Jessica in her murder trial.

Mallu is a thinly veiled caricature of the defense attorney F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The mid-1960s media {{focused their}} {{attention}} on the Schmid case and trial. [...] Life and Playboy magazines sent reporters to Schmid's trial. Time did features on contemporary life in Tucson and the murders of the young women.

50|$|Breuker left ICP in 1974 to {{concentrate}} on his group, the Willem Breuker Collective, {{and went on to}} found his own record label, BVHaast. Mengelberg and Bennink intensified their collaboration and, widening their own musical project as the Instant Composers Pool Tentet with saxophonist Peter BrÃ¶tzmann and cellist Tristan Honsinger. Throughout the 1970s, the ICP label continued to release records, many as co-productions with other European independent labels, including albums by Jeanne <b>Lee,</b> Derek <b>Bailey,</b> Dudu Pukwana, Steve Lacy, Paul Rutherford, Evan Parker, Maarten Altena and Peter BrÃ¶tzmann. Most of these releases were of limited (and sometimes even numbered) edition and featured a distinctive idiosyncratic graphic design by Bennink.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, <b>Lee</b> and <b>Bailey,</b> had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|R
50|$|The Young Messiah is a 2016 American biblical drama film {{directed}} by Cyrus Nowrasteh and co-written by Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh and Nowrasteh, {{based on the}} novel Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt by Anne Rice.

2500|$|That same year, fellow defense {{attorney}} Robert Shapiro also {{published a book}} about the trial, entitled The Search for Justice. He criticized F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey</b> as a [...] "loose cannon" [...] and Johnnie Cochran for bringing race into the trial. In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD for racial reasons, but believed the verdict was correct due to reasonable doubt.|$|E
2500|$|A {{television}} programme was broadcast on WOR in New York on 30 November 1969, hosted by celebrity lawyer F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> in which Bailey cross-examined LaBour and other [...] "witnesses" [...] about the rumour, {{but he left}} it to the viewer to determine conclusions. Before the recording, LaBour told Bailey that his article had been intended as a joke, and Bailey sighed and replied: [...] "Well, we have an hour of television to do; you're {{going to have to}} go along with this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediate {{reaction}} to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the [...] "not guilty" [...] verdict, {{while the majority of}} whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not. O. J. Simpson's integrated defense counsel included Johnnie Cochran, Robert Kardashian, Robert Shapiro, and F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey.</b> Marcia Clark was the lead prosecutor for the State of California.|$|E
50|$|After Falkenberg aired her 2010 {{column about}} former {{principal}} Paul Castro leaving the school after three months, she received messages from school alumni who {{stated that they}} intended to help Lee. 1965 <b>Lee</b> graduate Martin <b>Bailey</b> requested for volunteers to assist the school. Two alumni, Tom Behrman, and John Carloss, began discussing possibilities of charitable activity with the school administration, including donating to the Lee NEXT STEP Fund, a nonprofit fund that places Lee students in career and university preparatory programs; mentoring; and holding speaking events.|$|R
50|$|Lock is {{well known}} for his {{appearances}} on television and radio. He has written material for such comics as Bill <b>Bailey,</b> <b>Lee</b> Evans and Mark Lamarr and was voted the 55th greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups in 2007 and again in the updated 2010 list as the 19th greatest stand-up comic. He is possibly best known for his role as a team captain on Channel 4 comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats since it began in 2005 up to 2015. His comedy frequently features deadpan delivery.|$|R
50|$|He was {{presented}} with Guitar Player magazine's Certified Legend Award on January 21, 2012.

2500|$|The {{day after}} Burr's death, American Bar Association {{president}} R. William Ide III released a statement: [...] "Raymond Burr's portrayals of Perry Mason represented lawyers {{in a professional}} and dignified manner. â€¦ Mr. Burr strove for such authenticity in his courtroom characterizations that we regard his passing as though we lost one of our own." [...] The New York Times reported that Perry Mason had been named secondâ€”after F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> and before Abraham Lincoln, Thurgood Marshall, Janet Reno, Ben Matlock and Hillary Clintonâ€”in a recent National Law Journal poll that asked Americans to name the attorney, fictional or not, they most admired.|$|E
2500|$|Despite an {{aggressive}} cross-examination by F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> Fuhrman denied {{on the stand}} that he was racist or had used the word [...] "nigger" [...] to describe black people in the 10 years prior to his testimony. But a few months later, the defense played audio tapes of Fuhrman repeatedly using the word â€“ 41 times, in total. The tapes had been made between 1985 and 1994 by a young North Carolina screenwriter named Laura McKinney. She had interviewed Fuhrman at length for a screenplay she was writing on police officers. The Fuhrman tapes {{became one of the}} cornerstones of the defense's case that Fuhrman's testimony lacked credibility.|$|E
2500|$|Attorney F. <b>Lee</b> <b>Bailey,</b> who {{was working}} on a habeas corpus {{petition}} for his client Sheppard, attended the Overseas Press Club event, heard what Kilgallen told the crowd, and then asked her privately if she would help him. [...] "Some days later," [...] as Bailey wrote in his memoir The Defense Never Rests, [...] "we obtained a deposition from Dorothy that was inserted into the petition submitted to" [...] Carl Andrew Weinman, judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Bailey also included in the habeas corpus petition a statement from Edward Murray, who had worked in 1954 as a court clerk at the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Similar to Kilgallen's statement, Murray's statement indicated that the original Sheppard judge, Edward J. Blythin, had declared Sheppard guilty even before the grand jury's August 17, 1954, indictment of Sheppard.|$|E
5000|$|Bailey {{made his}} Barnsley debut, playing as a right-midfield, in a 1-0 loss against Crawley Town {{in the opening}} game of the season. However, Bailey didn't make a perfect start when Bailey {{sustained}} a groin injury and then sent-off after a second bookable offense, in a 2-1 loss against Peterborough United on 18 October 2014. Bailey was them dropped {{out in the first}} team for nearly two months. Bailey's performance against Colchester United on 6 April 2015 was praised by Manager <b>Lee</b> Johnson. However, <b>Bailey</b> was dropped from the first team {{for the rest of the}} season, with Manager Johnson quoting: [...] "His range of passing is very good. But the tactical, physical and mental sides need to be improved." [...] In his first season at Barnsley, Bailey made twenty-nine appearance in all competitions.|$|R
2500|$|... "Twenty Years on the Sufferbus" [...] was the {{original}} title of what eventually became the album's title track, originally composed by Dawayne Bailey as a demo song without lyrics during Chicago's 1989 tour. According to <b>Bailey,</b> <b>Lee</b> Loughnane {{would go on to}} receive cowriting credits on the song for having promoted Bailey's demo amongst the other band members. With the key word [...] "sufferbus" [...] already having been recently used on the 1992 album Sunrise on the Sufferbus by Masters of Reality, and rejecting the lyrical draft of [...] "I'm gonna send my love to the universe", the search for a similar-sounding word ultimately also yielded an accompanying ancient mythos. Robert Lamm's early suggestion was to title the album as Resolve, in order to depart once again from the band's standard numerical nomenclature of Chicago XXII due to the band's collective idea of this album's significance.|$|R
