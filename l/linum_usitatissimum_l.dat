40|$|<b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> <b>L.</b> (flax or linseed) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{economically}} important crops used in biotechnology as a source for bioactive compounds. Flax fiber and seed have industrial significance as a source of cellulosic fiber for textile and paper industry and seed oil for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry. The elaboration of new effective techniques for in vitro regeneration of <b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> <b>L.</b> is very actual problem today. The influence of low molecular weight five and sixmembered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds on organogenesis of <b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> <b>L.</b> cultivar heavenly in vitro has been studied. It was found that heterocyclic compounds derivatives pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazole and isoflavones revealed high stimulating effect on direct shoot organogenesis of <b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> <b>L.</b> in vitro. The maximal shoot regeneration frequency was obtained on the MS media containing heterocyclic compounds at the concentration 10 - 8 M/l as compared to lower regeneration frequency obtained on the control MS medium containing 1 mg/l BAP and 0. 05 mg/l NAA. The maximal index of explants with regeneration (in %) that exceeded almost twice the same index in control MS medium was obtained on the MS medium containing heterocyclic compound derivative of isoflavones. At the same time, the index of explants with regeneration (in %) that exceeded one and a half times the same index in control MS medium and the maximal index of shoots elongated more than 1 cm (in %) that exceeded almost twice the same index in control MS medium were obtained on the MS media containing heterocyclic compounds derivatives of pyridine, pyrimidine and pyrazole. The current study confirms perspective of using of low molecular weight five and six-membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds at the concentration 10 - 8 М/l of the MS medium as new effective substitutes of traditional growth regulators auxin NAA and cytokinin BAP for regeneration of <b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> <b>L.</b> cultivar heavenly in vitro...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> (flax) <b>L</b> gene alleles, which encode {{nucleotide}} binding site–Leu rich repeat class intracellular receptor proteins, confer {{resistance against}} the Melampsora lini (flax rust) fungus. At least 11 different L resistance specificities are known, {{and the corresponding}} avirulence genes in M. lini map to eight independent loci, {{some of which are}} complex and encode multiple specificities. We identified an M. lini cDNA marker that cosegregates in an F 2 rust family with a complex locus determining avirulence on the L 5, L 6, and L 7 resistance genes. Two related avirulence gene candidates, designated AvrL 567 -A and AvrL 567 -B, were identified in a genomic DNA contig from the avirulence allele, whereas the corresponding virulence allele contained a single copy of a related gene, AvrL 567 -C. Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transient expression of the mature AvrL 567 -A or AvrL 567 -B (but not AvrL 567 -C) proteins as intracellular products in <b>L.</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> and Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) induced a hypersensitive response–like necrosis that was dependent on coexpression of the L 5, L 6, or L 7 resistance gene. An F 1 seedling lethal or stunted growth phenotype also was observed when transgenic <b>L.</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> plants expressing AvrL 567 -A or AvrL 567 -B (but not AvrL 567 -C) were crossed to resistant lines containing L 5, L 6, or L 7. The AvrL 567 genes are expressed in rust haustoria and encode 127 amino acid secreted proteins. Intracellular recognition of these rust avirulence proteins implies that they are delivered into host cells across the plant membrane. Differences in the three AvrL 567 protein sequences result from diversifying selection, which is consistent with a coevolutionary arms race...|$|R

40|$|Selection of {{reference}} genes for quantitative gene expression normalization in flax (<b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> <b>L.)</b> Rudy Huis, Simon Hawkins and Godfrey Neutelings* Background: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) {{is currently the}} most accurate method for detecting differential gene expression. Such an approach depends on the identification of uniformly expressed 'housekeeping genes' (HKGs). Extensive transcriptomic data mining and experimental validation in different model plants {{have shown that the}} reliability of these endogenous controls can be influenced by the plant species, growth conditions and organs/ tissues examined. It is therefore important to identify the best reference genes to use in each biological system before using qRT-PCR to investigate differential gene expression. In this paper we evaluate different candidate HKGs for developmental transcriptomic studies in the economically-important flax fiber- and oil-crop (<b>Linum</b> <b>usitatissimum</b> <b>L).</b> Results: Specific primers were designed in order to quantify the expression levels of 20 different potential housekeeping genes in flax roots, internal- and external-stem tissues, leaves and flowers at different developmental stages.
