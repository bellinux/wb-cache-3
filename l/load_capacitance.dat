50|$|The dynamic power {{dissipated}} by {{an electronic}} circuit is {{directly proportional to}} the activity factor and the <b>load</b> <b>capacitance</b> as seen by {{the output of the}} logic gate. In case of a bus, the <b>load</b> <b>capacitance</b> is usually high since bus needs to be connected to multiple modules and routed longer and the activity factor is also high. Due to higher value of <b>load</b> <b>capacitance</b> and activity factor, in a typical system, bus power consumption can contribute up to 50% of the total power consumption. Bus encoding aims to reduce this power by reducing the amount of activity (number of toggles) in the bus lines. While the kind of bus encoding to be used for a particular system can be best determined when the target application and environmental constraints about the system are known apriori, described below are some bus encoding techniques which can help reduce bus power for most systems. Hence bus encoding is important for any electronic system design.|$|E

In one complete cycle of CMOS logic, current flows from VDD to the <b>load</b> <b>capacitance</b> to charge {{it and then}} flows from the charged <b>load</b> <b>capacitance</b> (CL) to ground during discharge.

5000|$|Propagation delay {{increases}} with operating temperature, as resistance of conductive materials tends to increase with temperature. Marginal increases in supply voltage can increase propagation delay since the upper switching threshold voltage, VIH (often {{expressed as a}} percentage of the high-voltage supply rail), naturally increases proportionately. [...] Increases in output <b>load</b> <b>capacitance,</b> often from placing increased fan-out loads on a wire, will also increase propagation delay. All of these factors influence each other through an RC time constant: any increase in <b>load</b> <b>capacitance</b> increases C, heat-induced resistance the R factor, and supply threshold voltage increases will affect whether more than one time constants are required to reach the threshold. If the output of a logic gate is connected to a long trace or used to drive many other gates (high fanout) the propagation delay increases substantially.|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{traditional}} ASIC technologies, the geometrical {{structures of}} clock trees in an FPGA are usually xed and cannot be changed for di erent circuit designs. Moreover, the clock pins {{are connected to}} the clock trees via programmable switches. As a result, the <b>load</b> <b>capacitances</b> of a clock tree may bechanged, depending on the utilization and distribution of logic modules in an FPGA. It is possible to minimize clock skew by distributing the <b>load</b> <b>capacitances,</b> or equivalently the logic modules used by the circuit design, carefully according to the circuit design. In this paper we present an algorithm for selecting logic modules used for circuit placement such that the clock skew is minimized. The algorithm can be applied to a variety of clock tree architectures, including those used in major commercial FPGAs. Furthermore, the algorithm can be extended to handle bu ered clock trees and multi-phase clock trees. Experimental results show that the algorithm can reduce clock skews signi cantly as compared with the traditional placement algorithms which do not consider clock skew minimization. ...|$|R

50|$|Also, {{when both}} A and B are high, {{so that the}} output is low, the circuit will pump one capacitor-load of charge from Vdd to ground for each clock cycle, by first {{charging}} and then discharging the capacitor in each clock cycle. This makes the circuit (with its output connected to a high impedance) less efficient than the static version (which theoretically should not allow any current to flow except through the output), and when the A and B inputs are constant and both high, the dynamic NAND gate uses power {{in proportion to the}} clock rate, as long as it functions correctly. The power dissipation can be minimized by keeping the <b>load</b> <b>capacitance</b> low, but this in turn reduces the maximum cycle time, requiring a higher minimum clock frequency; the higher frequency then increases power consumption by the relation just mentioned. Therefore, it is impossible to reduce the idle power consumption (when both inputs are high) below a certain limit which derives from an equilibrium between clock speed and <b>load</b> <b>capacitance.</b>|$|E
