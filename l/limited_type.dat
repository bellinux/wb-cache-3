5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very <b>limited</b> <b>type</b> of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E

Mammals in general have color vision of a <b>limited</b> <b>type,</b> and usually have red-green color blindness, with only two types of cones. Humans, some primates, and some marsupials see an extended range of colors, but only by comparison with other mammals. Most non-mammalian vertebrate species distinguish different colors at least as well as humans, and many species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, and some invertebrates, have more than three cone types and probably superior color vision to humans.|$|E
