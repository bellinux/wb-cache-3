50|$|Clathrin {{heavy chain}} is often {{described}} as a leg, with subdomains, representing the foot (the N-terminal domain), followed by the ankle, distal leg, knee, proximal leg, and trimerization domains. The N-terminal domain consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. The other domains form a super-helix of short alpha helices. This was originally determined from the structure of the proximal leg domain that identified and is composed of a smaller structural module referred to as clathrin heavy chain repeat motifs. The light chains bind primarily to the proximal <b>leg</b> <b>portion</b> of the heavy chain with some interaction near the trimerization domain. The β-propeller at the 'foot' of clathrin contains multiple binding sites for interaction with other proteins.|$|E

Results revealed that, the dressing percentage on live weight or empty body weight basis and lean, bone and fat per cent was not significantly (P> 0. 05) different among the seven rations. <b>Leg</b> <b>portion</b> was significantly (P < 0. 01) higher in ration R-IV and lowest in R-I ration. The weight of edible organs were significantly (P < 0. 05) different among the animals in seven experimental rations and the protein, fat and ash contents in the meat of ram lambs were comparable among the different maize silage based rations in comparison to SSB based ration. Based on the results, it is concluded that, feeding of maize silage supplemented with concentrate or legume hay did not affected the carcass parameters barring <b>leg</b> <b>portion</b> and edible organ’s weight in Nellore ram lambs.

Recent work discusses how isolating the head and <b>leg</b> <b>portion</b> of the template increase the performance of a gait recognition system making it robust against covariates like clothing and carrying conditions. However, most involve a manual definition of the boundaries. The method we propose, the genetic template segmentation (GTS), employs the genetic algorithm to automate the boundary selection process.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} was to determine fatty acid composition of skinless chicken breast and <b>leg</b> meat <b>portions</b> and chicken burgers and nuggets from the economy price range, standard price range (both conventional intensive rearing) and the organic range from four leading supermarkets.

No significant differences in fatty acid concentrations of economy and standard chicken burgers were found, whereas economy chicken nuggets had higher C 16 : 1, C 18 : 1 cis, C 18 : 1 trans and C 18 : 3 n- 3 concentrations than had standard ones. Overall, processed chicken products had much higher fat contents and SFA than had whole meat.

40|$|In Drosophila leg development, the extradenticle (exd) gene is {{expressed}} ubiquitously and its co-factor homothorax (hth) {{is restricted to}} the proximal <b>leg</b> <b>portion.</b> This condition is conserved in other insect species but is reversed in chelicerates and myriapods. As the region of co-expression does not differ {{in the two groups}} and transcripts from both are necessary for function, this difference in expression is likely to be functionally neutral. Here, we report the expression patterns of exd and hth in a crustacean, the amphipod shrimp Parhyale hawaiensis. The patterns in P. hawaiensis are similar to the insect patterns, supporting the close relationship between crustaceans and insects in the taxon Tetraconata. However, mRNA expression of exd in P. hawaiensis is weak in the distal leg parts, thus being intermediate between the complete lack of distal exd expression in chelicerates and myriapods and the strong distal exd expression in insects. Our data suggest that the reversal of the gene expression regulation of hth and exd occurred in the pancrustacean lineage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{badminton}} shuttlecock has {{the smallest}} ballistic coefficient and exhibits the largest in-flight deceleration of any airborne sporting implement. In the present study, measurements of aerodynamic forces are performed at high Reynolds numbers, {{and the effect}} of shuttlecock deformation on aerodynamic properties was also investigated. A shuttlecock skirt has an array of diverging stems, whose ends are at the convergent end of the skirt, joined together in an end-ring. Furthermore, the shuttlecock rotates about shuttlecock's major axis in actual flight, and the experiments are performed by the shuttlecocks with and without rotation (spin). The effect of the flow passing through the gap between slots (stiffeners) located at <b>leg</b> <b>portion</b> of the shuttlecock skirt on aerodynamic characteristics is also demonstrated by using no-gap shuttlecock model, which is completely covered with cellophane tape. The free rotation rate of a shuttlecock increases with increasing Reynolds number, and the drag coefficient gradually decreases over Re= 86000 for the shuttlecock with no rotation. On the other hand, the drag coefficient for the shuttlecock with rotation is almost constant over the whole range of Reynolds number in the present study because the deformation of shuttlecock skirt for the shuttlecock with rotation becomes smaller than that for the shuttlecock with no rotation. However, there is no significant difference in drag coefficient between the shuttlecocks with and without rotation in contrast to the difference in drag coefficient between the shuttlecocks with and without gap. The drag coefficient for the shuttlecock with no gap is significantly smaller than that for the ordinary shuttlecock (with gap). For an ordinary shuttlecock, the air flows through the gap in the shuttlecock skirt, and this flow is related to high aerodynamic drag...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} find out the nutritive value and microbial status of different wholesale cuts of goat carcass. The meat sample (4 cuts from each animal × 3 different age groups × 3 animals in each group = 36 samples) was obtained from 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year aged goats. The whole sale cuts were shoulder, rack, loin and leg of each goat carcass. To assess the quality of meat sample, the general appearance, color, smell, juiciness, proximate composition, pH, total bacteria, coliform bacteria, and yeast were studied. The mean pH value of different cuts ranges from 5. 65 - 5. 69 didn’t differ significantly, but due to age differences the pH values (5. 59 - 5. 74) differed significantly (p < 0. 01). The values of juiciness in different ages ranged from 32. 24 - 42. 10 % which differed signifi-cantly (p < 0. 01). The marbling of the cuts of rack portion was more pronounced than that of other cuts. The ranges of crude protein (CP) content of goat carcass (20. 78 - 27. 71 %) differed significantly (p < 0. 01) and <b>leg</b> <b>portion</b> contained higher CP than other portion. Fat contents of different cuts ranged from 2. 66 - 11. 47 % differed significantly (P < 0. 01). The moisture content of the carcass differed significantly which ranged from 69. 20 - 73. 31 %. The ash content of the cuts of 1 -year aged groups (0. 99 ± 0. 13 %) was higher than that of other age groups and differed significantly (P < 0. 01). The calcium (Ca) content did not differ significantly. The phosphorus (P) content was higher in one year old goat (0. 15 ± 0. 03 %) than that of the goats of other ages.
