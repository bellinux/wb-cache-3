5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E
60|$|Jim's {{mind was}} awoken to the {{perception}} of three facts--namely, {{that he had made}} himself <b>late</b> <b>for</b> dinner; <b>that</b> he would be the means of detaining his party; and that he had lost himself.|$|R
60|$|They {{were soon}} {{on their way}} back to the shore where they had left the Snowbird. The short winter day was drawing to a close, and it was getting colder. They walked briskly, for they feared the wind would be against them on the return to Oak Hall, and they did not wish to be <b>late</b> <b>for</b> supper, <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> at the very least, would mean a lecture from Job Haskers.|$|R

500|$|During filming, {{there were}} reports of {{disputes}} on set. The Daily Mail reported that Spottiswoode and Feirstein were no longer on speaking terms and that crew members had threatened to resign, with one saying [...] "All the happiness and teamwork which is the hallmark of Bond has disappeared completely." [...] This was denied by Brosnan who claimed [...] "It was nothing more than good old creative argy-bargy", with Spottiswoode saying [...] "It has all been made up...Nothing important really went wrong." [...] Spottiswoode did not return to direct the next film; he said the producers asked him, but he was too tired. Apparently, Brosnan and Hatcher feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late onto the set one day. The matter was quickly resolved though and Brosnan apologised to Hatcher after realising she was pregnant and was <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reason.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach a lesson that if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. But I do not think the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the highest}} level of Fire Style jutsu {{exclusive}} to Itachi and Sasuke's Mangekyō Sharingan, said to be the [...] It is the antipode of Tsukuyomi. Amaterasu produces black flames at {{the focal point of the}} user's vision. Once created, it can continue burning for seven days and seven nights. The flames cannot be extinguished with water or any other normal method; only the user can put the flames out. Said to be [...] "the fires from hell" [...] and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Amaterasu burns virtually any material, including other flames, until nothing but ash remains. However, the flames cannot burn through chakra or materials infused with chakra, as they fail to burn into Naruto's Kurama chakra cloak or through Gaara's chakra-infused sand. This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person. Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks. For more advanced users, they can shape Amaterasu into more specialized configurations. Use of Amaterasu puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. For all its lethal potential, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> remove the burning body parts before it spreads. Other defensive options are pushing the flames away, absorbing them, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the host of the Ten Tails.|$|E

The Bishop refused to give one. Norris, whose temper never had a chance of reaching its accustomed tranquillity until he had consumed some breakfast--he hated early morning chapel--raved. The Bishop was worried, but firm.|$|R
