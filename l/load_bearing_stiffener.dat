40|$|Generally, {{the main}} {{objective}} of this thesis has been completed {{for the improvement of}} previous master thesis work. The preparation and background review are accomplished quite sufficient and reflects a good understanding of ice-structure interaction. The nonlinear simulation based on ABAQUS takes a long time, with efforts in model error checking, including material property setting, boundary conditions and tremendous amount of data extract and analysis. The six chosen models could be referred to Chapter 8 about optimization analysis, which gives different strength capacities due to slightly different local scantlings. The comparison indicates it is effective to consider the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> with <b>stiffener</b> shear and plate membrane forces as the governing parameters under small/moderate stiffener deflections. In the strength design process, it is recommended to strengthen the stiffener&# 146;s plastic bending capacity by increasing its shear capacity before the plate membrane tensile stress grows greatly. Design guidelines have been developed for preliminary estimation of strength capacity with regards to plastic analysis. The comparison with NLFEA reflects that the hand calculations may roughly offer an efficient way for capacity design. But overestimation shall be dismissed in certain degree by introducing a safety factor. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many filed {{inspections}} and steel bridge surveys report that steel plate girder bridges {{are more susceptible}} to corrode at the end due to the accumulation of the water at bearing region. This water pools at the bearing is the result of rain shower and water leakage from the construction joints, which cause the corrosion of <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> and nearby web. The statistical data shows that only in Japan in more than 70 % corroded steel bridges, corrosion was found near the girder ends, which is primarily due to very aggressive environmental and severe topographical conditions of Japan (Chapter 2). Corrosion at plate girder ends damages the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> and nearby web locally and in most of the cases rest of the girder part remains intact. Bearing stiffeners have a very important role in resisting the compressive load. Moreover, besides resisting the compressive <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffeners</b> are also designed as anchor to balance the horizontal component of tension field action developed in the exterior web and resist the moment transferred by the in plane bending. Thus, any significant damage on <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> and nearby web may cause the buckling/crushing near the bearing and may also cause a significant loss in the bearing and shear capacity. Further, some field inspection data regarding the steel bridge damages was also collected from the Pakistan (Chapter 3) to assess the feasibility of required action to deal with these steel bridges. The inspection data also depicts the similar plate girder ends damages as reported in Japan. As number old of steel brides are increasing day by day in Japan and all around the world and {{it is very difficult to}} replace the all old brides at the same time along with the construction of the new bridges due to many constraints, i. e. economy of the country, traffic switching problem, lack of expertise and resources, manpower and machinery etc. Moreover, many bridges may have the adequate capacity to be used (Chapter 1). Therefore, all the corroded and old bridges demand the proper evaluation to assess their current performance level e. g. residual bearing and shear capacity so that suitable measure regarding the repair, retrofitting or replacement of these steel bridges can be adopted. The present study focusesiion the experimental and analytical evaluation of bearing and shear capacity of corroded bridges affected by the end panel corrosion. The chapter 4 discusses the experimental program conducted on the large scale plate girder ends specimens, simulated with local corrosion damage on the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener.</b> In all, total five plate girder end specimens were used. On one specimen no damage is considered and regarded as the healthy specimen and on the rest of two pair, 50 % thickness of the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> is reduced within the damage height “Dh” of 20 mm and 60 mm uniformly and non-uniformly starting from the top face of the bottom flange near the weld seam. The study reported that 20 mm damage height does not change either the ultimate capacity or buckling failure mode. However, a relatively large damage of 60 mm shift the buckling of the stiffener within the damage zones along with the normal buckling within the normal web buckling. The chapter 5 deals with the extension of study to evaluate the bearing capacity of the plate girder ends analytically. For this purpose the test results obtained through the experimental program (conducted and mention in chapter 4) are modeled in a powerful finite element (FE) software ABAQUS. The comparison of the experimental and analytical results are made in term of the load-displacement relationships and deformed buckling modes and analytical results show the good agreement. Four various damage groups, Stiffener damage only, stiffener damage plus the free web end damage, stiffener damage plus interior web damage and stiffener damage plus the web damage at both side of the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> were considered in the analytical program. Various residual thicknesses i. e. 75 %, 50 % and 25 etc. were assumed within the different damage heights zones. As the study is targeted to study the effect of the local damage, the maximum damage height is considered as 100 mm (10 % of girder height). True stress-strain relationships are determined by performing the tension test on the coupon cut from the used specimens with isotropic strain hardening rule are utilized in the analytical study. Initial deflections and welding residual stresses are also considered in the finite element (FE) study. Many trial analyses with different damage shapes and forms suggest that a simple uniform rectangular type of the damage with minimum thickness can be utilized in the FE simulation. Further, analytical results conclude that <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> has very important role in resisting the <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> and any severe damage may reduce its radiusiiiof gyration along the week axis which may give rise to the stability problem by causing the buckling/ crippling failure at bearing. The results also revealed that the web damage alone does not affect the load carrying capacity significantly however; it reduces the load carrying capacity substantially when web damage is combined with the stiffener damage. The Chapter 6 describes the effect of local corrosion damages at the girder end on its shear capacity. An extensive analytical study is conducted on a four panel plate girder model and similar damage cases are assumed as considered (in Chapter 5) for the bearing capacity analysis. A mild steel with yield stresses equal to 345 Mpa with elastics perfectly plastics (EPP) characteristics under kinematics plasticity rule is used. A small initial out-of-plane deflection is also incorporated while; no residual stresses are considered in the study as they have no effect on the shear capacity. Analytical results indicate that a loss of the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> more than 50 % can be fatal for the plate girder and it reduces the anchorage for the tension field action and thus refrains the girder to achieve its full post buckling strength. Also, complete loss of stiffener thickness shifts the failure mode of the girder from shear to buckling. The Chapter 7 comprises of some proposed empirical relationships to estimate ultimate capacity under the shear and compressive loads application. This section also discusses a proposed damage parameter named the “Reduced Thickness Ratio” to assess the buckling failure mode of the plate girder specimen under compressive loadFinally, Chapter 8 consists of a summary of conclusions and recommendations that are drawn from the above mentioned work.

A nonlinear finite element model was developed and verified against the test results in terms of failure buckling modes. It was concluded that the M-V interaction equation for specimens with web stiffeners was conservative where these specimens experienced plastic failure mode rather than local (Msl) or distortional (Msd) buckling mode. Moreover, the results indicated that proposed M-V interaction equation calculated by local buckling strength (Msl) adequately predicted the behavior of specimens with circular web holes...|$|R

METHODS: All frameworks mimicked a four-unit posterior situation with 7. 3 mm 2 interdental cross-sections and possessed exactly the same dimensions. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was measured on a special bridge test setup with 15 specimens for each of the materials. The data were analyzed with Weibull statistics giving the characteristic <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity F 0 at 63 % failure probability and the Weibull modulus m as indicator for the reliability and reproducibility. RESULTS: For the E 2 frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and the SD was 260 (+/- 53) N, the characteristic load F 0 282 N and the reliability m = 5. 7. For the ICZ frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was 470 (+/- 101) N, F 0 518 N and m = 4. 5.

The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure is made of reinforced concrete, based on strip and isolated foundation footings, slabs, columns and walls. It is analysed with the programme Tower 7, which utilises the final elements method. Two computational models of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure are built. The first one is used to analyse the typical ceiling construction in the building. Besides the slab, we also include some vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements {{above and below the}} slab into the model. To analyse the vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements we create a more complex three-dimensional computational model of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> construction. The ceiling slab analysis takes into account both the dead load as well as the live load. The analysis of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure also includes snow load and the horizontal effects of wind and earthquake. The dynamic effect is determined by the means of a linear modal analysis with a response spectrum. The core of the thesis is represented in the analysis and the dimensioning of typical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements in the building. Firstly, dimensioning of the lower and upper reinforcement is executed. The calculation results are compared to the amount of built-in reinforcement, information about which is gathered from the original project documentation that followed the old PBAB regulation.

40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, cross bars and support bars. The connections between the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. The cross bars redistribute a local load over the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bar. The support bars are spot-welded to both the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars and cross bars. For relatively thick-set <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. For slender <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R
