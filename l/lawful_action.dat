40|$|Contractual duress, unconstitutional conditions, and {{blackmail}} {{have long}} been puzzling. The puzzle is why these doctrines sometimes condemn threatening <b>lawful</b> <b>action</b> to induce agreements but sometimes do not. This Article provides a general solution to this puzzle. Such threats are (and should be) deemed unlawfully coercive only when they are contrived, meaning that the threatened action would not have occurred if no threat could have been made. I show that such contrived threats can be credible because making the threat strongly influences whether the threatened action occurs. When such threats are uncontrived warnings, meaning that the threatened action would have occurred even if no threat could have been made, they are not coercive and can only benefit the agreeing parties. However, sometimes (as with blackmail) agreements produced by uncontrived warnings are also unlawful {{on the ground that}} they harm third parties. The contrived-threat test explains why the Medicaid-defunding threat in the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional.

5000|$|The {{common law}} of England {{did not provide}} {{for a way to}} dispose of land held by feudal tenure through wills, only urban land, and instead uses were applied, which allowed a {{landowner}} to give his land to one or more feoffees, to dispose of it or treat it as the original landowner provided. It was viewed with distrust due to the possibility of abuse; Edward Coke wrote that [...] "there were two Inventors of Uses, Fear and Fraud; Fear in Times of Troubles and civil Wars to save their Inheritances from being forfeited; and Fraud to defeat due Debts, <b>lawful</b> <b>Actions,</b> Wards, Escheats, Mortmains etc". With as many as 13 of such feoffees, there was much confusion over the title to land following a lord's death, as evidenced by the case of Sir John Fastolf, which lasted from 1459 to 1476. While this was a problem that needed correcting, the actual motivation of the Statute was not to do so, but instead to bolster the finances of Henry VIII. For several years prior to the Statute, Henry had been struggling with the need to raise revenue; his royal lands did not provide enough, loans and benevolences would have destroyed his personal popularity; as a result, simply increasing the size of his royal lands was the best option. He turned his attention to land law, arguably the most well developed and complex parts of the common law, and sought to reform it to further his aims. This was well-aimed, since it was uses that were destroying his income; the royal revenue was traditionally gathered through seisin, which uses completely ignored.|$|R

Initially transactions made only with the intention of depriving creditors of assets, or perverting the priorities for order of distribution were vulnerable, while the modern approach of the Insolvency Act 1986 contains more provisions that unwind transactions simply because their effect is deprivation of assets available to creditors. Reminiscent of the 1571 Act, under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 423, a company may recover assets if they were paid away for [...] "significantly less than the value" [...] of the thing, and this was done [...] "for the purpose of" [...] prejudicing other creditors' interests. In Arbuthnot Leasing International Ltd v Havelet Leasing Ltd (No 2) Scott J held that the motive of the company or its directors was irrelevant, so that even though Havelet Leasing Ltd's lawyers had advised (quite wrongly) that their scheme of starting another company and transferring assets to it would be lawful, because the scheme's purpose was to put the assets out of other creditors' reach it breached section 423.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an examination}} of human moral precariousness in Kant 2 ̆ 7 s ethics. Human beings {{are in a state}} of moral precariousness insofar as they are ever-capable of transgressing the moral law and are often uncertain of the moral worth of their actions.

This relation is the fundamental characteristic of the human moral condition because such a relation is built into Kant 2 ̆ 7 s account of human moral agency. We have a tenuous relation to the moral law because we always have at least the possibility of conflict between our desire for happiness (i. e. the satisfaction of our inclinations) and the requirements of the moral law. We also may have a vacillating relation to the moral law insofar as we usually find ourselves acting in accordance with the moral law (that is, we often find ourselves committing <b>lawful</b> <b>actions),</b> while also (for many, if not all, human beings) finding ourselves occasionally deviating from the requirements of the moral law (this is a consequence of Kant 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine of radical evil). In my dissertation, I argue that this moral precariousness manifests itself as a set of ongoing, perpetual moral crises.

In each of these crucial points, Kant 2 ̆ 7 s account of human beings as dual-natured (both natural and rational) generate a struggle (or at least the representation of a struggle) that has a variety of moral consequences. This dissertation approaches this moral precariousness through analyses of several key features of Kant 2 ̆ 7 s moral philosophy: his concept of humanity, the dignity of human beings, the moral feeling of respect, and experience of sublimity, and Kant 2 ̆ 7 s theory of radical evil.

40|$|This paper focuses upon a {{comparatively}} overlooked issue {{with regard to}} the scope of self-defence in international law: whether the subjective ‘psychological’ positions of the states concerned in a dispute involving the use force have any impact upon the lawfulness of an action avowedly taken in self-defence. There exists a long standing conception that the motives of a state responding in self-defence are relevant to the lawfulness of that response. The purity (or impurity) of a state's motive forms the basis of a distinction for many writers between a <b>lawful</b> self-defence <b>action</b> and an unlawful armed reprisal. Similarly, in recent decisions of the ICJ, the implication has been that the subjective intention of the attacking state may be relevant {{to the question of whether}} the attack perpetrated by that state can trigger the right of self-defence. The conclusion is reached here that the lawfulness of an avowed self-defence action should be premised upon objective criteria alone. Moreover, this reflects the law as it is in fact applied in practice. It is argued that the subjective ‘psychological’ position of either the responding or attacking state has no place in the final analysis of whether an action in self-defence was lawful or unlawful...|$|R
40|$|This article locates strike ballot laws at the {{intersection}} of two of labour law’s primary goals, promoting collective bargaining by responsible unions and reducing industrial conflict. Depending on their design, strike ballot laws may aim to protect democratic voice or to create an obstacle to engaging in lawful strikes. Strike ballot requirements in Canada were initially imposed during World War II primarily to reduce industrial conflict. The requirement was controversial and after the war most provinces opted not to make a strike ballot a condition of <b>lawful</b> strike <b>action.</b> Between the 1960 s and the late 1990 s, however, strike ballot votes became universally required in private sector collective bargaining laws. Focusing on three Canadian jurisdictions, this article explores the circumstances in which these laws were enacted and the forms they took. Overall, the article finds that Canadian strike ballot laws do not unduly burden unions when they seek a mandate to conduct a lawful strike from their members and that they have been interpreted by labour boards and courts as a way to protect trade union democracy rather than to limit industrial conflict. For this reason, the issue of strike votes is not currently a controversial topic in Canada...|$|R
