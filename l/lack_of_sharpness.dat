40|$|In direct volume {{rendering}} (DVR), {{the choice}} of reconstruction filter can {{have a significant effect}} on the visual appearance of the images produced and thus, on the perceived quality of a DVR rendered scene. This paper presents the results of a subjective experiment where participants stereoscopically viewed DVR rendered scenes and rated their subjective quality. The statistical analysis of the results focuses on the relationship between the quality of the stereoscopic scene and properties of the filters such as post-aliasing and smoothing, as well as the relationship between the quality of the stereoscopic scene and properties of the rendered images such as shape compactness. The experiment evaluated five reconstruction filters on four different volumetric datasets.

5000|$|On 2 July 2013, Bartley agreed a season-long loan move to Championship club Birmingham City. Although he {{had played}} little senior {{football}} over the previous year, and {{had not had a}} full pre-season, manager Lee Clark selected him for the opening match, playing alongside fellow loanee Dan Burn and experienced captain Paul Robinson in a three-man defence; Birmingham lost 1-0 at home to Watford. In the next match, Bartley scored his first goal in senior English football, an extra-time winner against Plymouth Argyle in the League Cup. His <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> and security in defence meant he was left out for the next match in favour of Hayden Mullins, and was selected less than Burn thereafter. He scored twice in a 3-1 win at Huddersfield Town on 9 November - both goals were headers from Jesse Lingard crosses - but was then sent off after receiving a second yellow card for what the referee deemed to be [...] "over-celebrating".|$|E
5000|$|Prehistorically, and in less technologically {{advanced}} cultures even into modern times, tool and weapon blades {{have been made}} from wood, bone and stone. Most woods are exceptionally poor at holding edges and bone and stone suffer from brittleness making them suffer from fracture when striking or struck. In modern times stone, {{in the form of}} obsidian, is used in some medical scalpels as it is capable of being formed into an exceedingly fine edge. Ceramic knives are non-metallic and non-magnetic. As non-metals do not corrode they remain rust and corrosion free but they suffer from similar faults as stone and bone, being rather brittle and almost entirely inflexible. They are harder than metal knives and so more difficult to sharpen, and some ceramic knives may be as hard or harder than some sharpening stones. For example, synthetic sapphire [...] is harder than natural sharpening stones and is as hard as alumina sharpening stones. Zirconium dioxide is also harder than garnet sharpening stones and is nearly as hard as alumina. Both require diamond stones or silicon carbide stones to sharpen and care has to be taken to avoid chipping the blade. As such ceramic knives are seldom used outside of a kitchen and they are still quite uncommon. Plastic knives are difficult to make sharp and poorly retain an edge. They are largely used as low cost, disposable utensils or as children's utensils or occasionally in environments where it is considered that even a bread and butter knife would be undesirable. They are often serrated to make up for their general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> but, as evidenced by the fact they can cut food, they are still capable of inflicting injury. Plastic blades of designs other than disposable cutlery are, as they are undetectable by metal detectors, restricted/illegal items or prohibited weapons in some jurisdictions.|$|E

Several full-reference metrics exist {{for this kind of}} artifact [6], while the literature is poor in no-reference ones. Some no-reference sharpness metrics [7, 8] could be adopted, but they can not take into account typical chromatic and achromatic zipper effects. Liu et al.

However this metric has not been correlated with psycho-visual experiments.|$|E
40|$|Low {{contrast}} images, {{suffering from}} a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sharpness,</b> are easily influenced by noise. As a result, many local false peaks may be generated in contrast measurements, {{making it difficult for}} the camera’s passive auto-focus system to perform its function of locating the focused peak. In this paper, a new passive auto-focus algorithm is proposed to address this problem. First, a noise reduction preprocessing is introduced to make our algorithm robust to both additive noise and multiplicative noise. Then, a new contrast measure is presented to bring in local false peaks, ensuring the presence of a well defined focused peak. In order to gauge the performance of our algorithm, a modified peak search algorithm is used in the experiments. The experimental results from an actual digital camera validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm...|$|E

Current super-resolution algorithms address the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> by filling in the image with probable details. These algorithms break the outlines of text. Our novel algorithm for super-resolution of text magnifies images in real-time by interpolation with a variable linear filter. The coefficients of the filter are determined nonlinearly from the neighborhood {{to which it is}} applied. We train the mapping that defines the coefficients to specifically enhance edges of text, producing a conservative algorithm that infers the detail of magnified text. Possible applications include resizing web page layouts or other interfaces, and enhancing low resolution camera captures of text. In general, learning spatially-variable filters is applicable to other image filtering tasks. 1...|$|E

In this paper we demonstrate, using a simple, explicitly solvable model equation, that estimates on the radius of analyticity obtained by the usual Gevrey class approach do not scale optimally across a family of solutions, nor do they scale optimally {{as a function of the}} physical parameters of the equation. We attribute the observed <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> to a specific embedding inequality, and give a modified definition of the Gevrey norms which is shown to finally yield a sharp estimate on the radius of analyticity...|$|E
