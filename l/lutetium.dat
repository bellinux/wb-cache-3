5|$|A <b>lutetium</b> atom has 71 electrons, {{arranged}} in the configuration 4f145d16s2. When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The <b>lutetium</b> atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, {{and as a result}} <b>lutetium</b> has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E
5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, <b>lutetium</b> is very {{difficult}} to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of <b>lutetium</b> is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of <b>lutetium</b> in the Earth crust is only about 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of <b>lutetium</b> (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure <b>lutetium</b> metal {{is very difficult}} to prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E
5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, <b>lutetium</b> is {{regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, <b>lutetium</b> fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. <b>Lutetium</b> nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. <b>Lutetium</b> oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> {{aluminium}} garnet (Al5Lu3O12) {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography. Additionally, a tiny amount of <b>lutetium</b> is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices. Cerium-doped <b>lutetium</b> oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). <b>Lutetium</b> aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> metal is {{slightly}} unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150°C to form <b>lutetium</b> oxide. The resulting compound {{is known to}} absorb water and carbon dioxide, and {{may be used to}} remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres. Similar observations are made during reaction between <b>lutetium</b> and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); <b>lutetium</b> hydroxide is formed in the reaction. <b>Lutetium</b> metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|The International Commission on Atomic Weights, {{which was}} then {{responsible}} for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact}} that the separation of <b>lutetium</b> from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. Until the 1950s, some German-speaking chemists called <b>lutetium</b> by Welsbach's name, cassiopeium; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to <b>lutetium.</b> The reason for this was that Welsbach's 1907 samples of <b>lutetium</b> had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of <b>lutetium.</b> This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure <b>lutetium.</b> The later discrediting of Urbain's work on element 72 led to a reappraisal of Welsbach's work on element 71, so that the element was renamed to cassiopeium in German-speaking countries for some time. Charles James, who stayed out of the priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of <b>lutetium</b> at the time. Pure <b>lutetium</b> metal was first produced in 1953.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> dissolves readily in weak {{acids and}} dilute sulfuric acid to form {{solutions}} containing the colorless <b>lutetium</b> ions, which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules, the average being 3+.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Lu and atomic number 71. It is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, {{but not in}} moist air. <b>Lutetium</b> is the last element in the lanthanide series, and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths. <b>Lutetium</b> is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals, although lanthanum is more often considered as such.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> {{occurs on}} the Earth {{in form of}} two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out of these two, only the former is stable, making the element monoisotopic. The latter one, lutetium-176, decays via beta decay with a {{half-life}} of 3.781010 years; it makes up about 2.5% of natural <b>lutetium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly to {{the other}} rare-earth metals, <b>lutetium</b> has no known {{biological}} role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. <b>Lutetium</b> salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for <b>lutetium</b> content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble <b>lutetium</b> salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from stable}} <b>lutetium,</b> its {{radioactive}} isotopes have several specific uses. The suitable half-life and decay mode made lutetium-176 {{used as a}} pure beta emitter, using <b>lutetium</b> which has been exposed to neutron activation, and in lutetium–hafnium dating to date meteorites. The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, <b>lutetium</b> has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable <b>lutetium</b> can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including <b>lutetium,</b> are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. <b>Lutetium</b> is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. <b>Lutetium</b> salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. <b>Lutetium</b> metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|In other tables, <b>lutetium</b> and {{lawrencium}} {{are classified}} as the remaining members of group 3. In these tables, <b>lutetium</b> and lawrencium end (or sometimes succeed) the lanthanide and actinide series, respectively. Since the f-shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals, they behave most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals {{compared to the other}} lanthanides and actinides, and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium. However, this resemblance in not unique to <b>lutetium</b> and lawrencium, but is common among all the late lanthanides and actinides.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and <b>lutetium,</b> as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide <b>lutetium</b> with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener <b>lutetium,</b> though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of <b>lutetium</b> and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of <b>lutetium</b> and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for <b>lutetium</b> (1925K).|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> has no {{biological}} role as well, but it {{is found}} even in the highest known organism, the humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. <b>Lutetium</b> salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for <b>lutetium</b> content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble <b>lutetium</b> salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not. Lanthanum is not essential for humans and has a low to moderate level of toxicity. However, it is essential for the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the general similarity of the rare earths means that it may be substituted by some of the other early lanthanides with no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} lanthanum or <b>lutetium.</b> Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while <b>lutetium</b> behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} <b>lutetium</b> would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to <b>lutetium</b> and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, {{lanthanum}} {{has been placed}} under scandium and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} yttrium {{and to a lesser extent}} scandium are closer in their chemical properties to <b>lutetium</b> than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place <b>lutetium</b> under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and <b>lutetium</b> also goes into a d-orbital, both <b>lutetium</b> and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to <b>lutetium</b> in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog <b>lutetium.</b> This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with <b>lutetium</b> and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, <b>lutetium,</b> the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, <b>lutetium</b> suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> was {{independently}} {{discovered in}} 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these researchers found <b>lutetium</b> as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on {{the priority of}} the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to <b>lutetium.</b> In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name cassiopeium (or later cassiopium) for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and <b>lutetium</b> tend {{to occur}} {{together}} with the other lanthanides (except promethium) tend to occur together in the Earth's crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30parts per million (ppm); the abundance of scandium is 16ppm, while that of <b>lutetium</b> is about 0.5ppm. The abundance of lanthanum is greater, being about 35ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50ppm, that of chromium is 160ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5ppm.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} {{configurations of}} Lr+ and Lr2+ {{are expected to}} be 7s2 and 7s1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides which tend to be 5d1 as Ln2+. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr3+ cation, lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of <b>lutetium,</b> especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of <b>lutetium.</b> Hence, unlike thallium but like <b>lutetium,</b> lawrencium would prefer to form LrH3 than LrH, and LrCO is expected to be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ2π1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is expected to be observed in LrCl3 just as it is for LuCl3 and more generally all the LnCl3, and the complex anion − is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{commercially viable}} ore of <b>lutetium</b> is the rare-earth phosphate mineral monazite, (Ce,La,etc.)PO4, which contains 0.003% of the element. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Pure <b>lutetium</b> metal {{is one of}} the rarest and most expensive of the rare-earth metals with the price about 10,000 USD/kg, or about one-fourth that of gold. Lanthanum is much more common, being the second most abundant rare earth, and in addition to monazite can also be extracted economically from bastnäsite.|$|E
5|$|Chemical and {{physical}} arguments {{have been made}} in support of <b>lutetium</b> and lawrencium but the majority of authors seem unconvinced. Most working chemists are not aware there is any controversy. In December 2015 an IUPAC project was established to make a recommendation on the matter.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the four blocks of the long- or 32-column form of the {{periodic}} table {{are a series of}} linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block. These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. Chemically, the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals or, more generally, s block metals but have some of the physical properties of d block transition metals. <b>Lutetium</b> and lawrencium, {{at the end of the}} end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. <b>Lutetium</b> behaves chemically as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide and transition metal physical properties. Lawrencium, as an analogue of <b>lutetium,</b> would presumable display like characteristics. The coinage metals in group 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are chemically capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals. The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors in group 13. The relatively inert noble gases, in group 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic table—the halogens in group 17 and the alkali metals in group 1.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{the first}} {{ionization}} energy of lawrencium was measured, using the isotope 256Lr. The measured value, , agreed {{very well with}} the relativistic theoretical prediction of 4.963(15)eV, and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the transactinides. This value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides, and supports the s2p configuration as the 7p1/2 electron {{is expected to be}} only weakly bound. This suggests that <b>lutetium</b> and lawrencium behave similarly to the d-block elements (and hence being the true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium, instead of lanthanum and actinium), and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the alkali metals sodium and potassium in some ways. Given that the s2p configuration is correct, then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under the IUPAC definition ("An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell"), unlike its lighter homolog <b>lutetium</b> and the group 3 elements, with which <b>lutetium</b> and lawrencium are sometimes classified. It is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to curium, which has an 5f76d17s2 configuration, and show the expected 5f146d17s2 configuration, which is supported by the earlier volatility experiments.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes of hafnium and <b>lutetium</b> (along with ytterbium) {{are also}} used in isotope {{geochemistry}} and geochronological applications. It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earth’s mantle through time. This is because 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lutetium</b> {{tantalate}} (LuTaO4) is the densest known stable {{white material}} (density 9.81 g/cm3) and therefore {{is an ideal}} host for X-ray phosphors. The only denser white material is thorium dioxide, with density of 10 g/cm3, but the thorium it contains is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium, {{like all}} of the {{lanthanides}} (except lanthanum, ytterbium, and <b>lutetium,</b> which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1K.|$|E
5|$|The most {{available}} {{element in}} group 3 is yttrium, with annual production of 8,900tonnes in 2010. Yttrium is mostly produced as oxide, {{by a single}} country, China (99%). <b>Lutetium</b> and scandium are also mostly obtained as oxides, and their annual production by 2001 was about 10 and 2tonnes, respectively.|$|E
5|$|High-purity thulium oxide {{was first}} offered commercially {{in the late}} 1950s, {{as a result of}} the {{adoption}} of ion-exchange separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash & Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% purity. The price per kilogram has oscillated between US$4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was second highest for lanthanides behind <b>lutetium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later {{became known as}} the element ytterbium, and lutecia {{became known as the}} element <b>lutetium.</b> The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact that}} the separation of <b>lutetium</b> from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium.|$|E
5|$|The element {{also has}} 42 nuclear isomers, with masses of 150, 151, 153–162, 166–180 (not every mass number {{corresponds}} {{to only one}} isomer). The most stable of them are lutetium-177m, with half-life of 160.4 days and lutetium-174m, with half-life of 142 days; this is longer than half-lives of the ground states of all radioactive <b>lutetium</b> isotopes, except only for lutetium-173, 174, and 176.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of ytterbium {{range in}} atomic weight from 147.9674 {{atomic mass unit}} (u) for 148Yb to 180.9562u for 181Yb. The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, 174Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than 174Yb are thulium isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are <b>lutetium</b> isotopes.|$|E
5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and <b>lutetium,</b> which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
