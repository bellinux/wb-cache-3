5|$|Tanahashi next tried a Rainmaker, which Okada {{countered with}} one of his own and scored a nearfall. Although Okada {{attempted}} the Rainmaker three more times, Tanahashi countered with a bridging straitjacket German suplex, a bridging dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three High Fly Flows. The first was a crossbody while Okada was on the ropes; the second a frog splash to a seated Okada, and the third another frog splash, after which Tanahashi scored a pinfall on Okada to retain the title at 30 minutes and 57 seconds. Okada wept as he left the ring, and Tanahashi shouted that his opponent had a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go before becoming the New Japan ace. Tanahashi closed the show, thanking the fans and performing his air guitar routine.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks went a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over {{the course of the}} 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E

25|$|<b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> the Top was a 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) six-part {{documentary}} {{on the history of}} Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. Episode 3: Billy Killed the Fish, broadcast on 29 August, featured interviews with Loyde, Michael Chugg (Thorpe's manager / promoter) and Thorpe. They described their Sunbury festival experiences and the development of pub rock in Australia. According to Chugg, an Aztec performance at Sydney's Bondi Lifesaver club in 1974 was so loud as to kill a tankful of tropical fish in an upstairs area–hence the episode title. During August 2002, promoters Chugg and Kevin Jacobsen with Thorpe as co-producer, organised a related concert tour, <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> the Top. Concerts included Thorpe performing with the 'original' Aztecs line-up in one set and the 'Sunbury' Aztecs in a second.
