40|$|Java 3 D proves {{a natural}} choice for any Java {{programmer}} wanting {{to write an}} interactive 3 D graphics program. A programmer constructs a scene graph containing graphic objects, lights, sounds, environmental effects objects, and behaviour objects that handle interactions or modify other objects in the scene graph. The programmer then hands that scene graph to Java 3 D for execution. Java 3 D starts rendering objects and executing behaviours in the scene graph. Virtual reality applications go through an identical writing process. However, before a user can use such an application, Java 3 D must additionally know about the user's physical characteristics (height, eye separation, and so forth) and physical environment (number of displays, their <b>location,</b> <b>trackers,</b> and so on). Not surprisingly, such information varies from installation to installation and from user to user. So Java 3 D lets application developers separate their application's operation from {{the vagaries of the}} user's final display environment. The Java 3 D application programmer's interface (API) provides a very flexible platform for building a broad range of graphics applications.

40|$|Noncooperative target spacecrafts {{are those}} assets in orbit that cannot convey any {{information}} about their states (position, attitude, and velocities) or facilitate rendezvous and docking/berthing (RVD/B) process. Designing a guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) module for the chaser in a RVD/B mission with noncooperative target should be inevitably solved for on-orbit servicing technologies. The proximity operations and the guidance for achieving rendezvous problems are addressed in this paper. The out-of-plane maneuvers of proximity operations are explored with distinct subphases, including a chaser far approach in the target’s orbit to the first hold point and a closer approach to the final berthing location. Accordingly, guidance solutions are chosen for each subphase from the standard Hill based Closhessy-Willtshire (CW) solution, elliptical fly-around, and Glideslope algorithms.

40|$|Abstract. Human {{activity}} {{can be described}} as a sequence of 3 D body postures. The traditional approach to recognition and 3 D reconstruction of human activity has been to track motion in 3 D, mainly using advanced geometric and dynamic models. In this paper we reverse this process. View based activity recognition serves as an input to a human body <b>location</b> <b>tracker</b> with the ultimate goal of 3 D reanimation in mind. We demonstrate that specific human actions can be detected from single frame postures in a video sequence. By recognizing the image of a person’s posture as corresponding to a particular key frame from a set of stored key frames, it is possible to map body locations from the key frames to actual frames. This is achieved using a shape matching algorithm based on qualitative similarity that computes point to point correspondence between shapes, together with information about appearance. As the mapping is from fixed key frames, our tracking does not suffer from the problem of having to reinitialise when it gets lost. It is effectively a closed loop. We present experimental results both for recognition and tracking for a sequence of a tennis player...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of neuroscience experiments are using virtual reality {{to provide a more}} immersive and less artificial experimental environment. This is particularly useful to navigation and three-dimensional scene perception experiments. Such experiments require accurate real-time tracking of the observer's head in order to render the virtual scene. Here, we present data on the accuracy of a commonly used six degrees of freedom tracker (Intersense IS 900) when it is moved in ways typical of virtual reality applications. We compared the reported <b>location</b> of the <b>tracker</b> with its <b>location</b> computed by an optical tracking method. When the tracker was stationary, the root mean square error in spatial accuracy was 0. 64 mm. However, we found that errors increased over ten-fold (up to 17 mm) when the tracker moved at speeds common in virtual reality applications. We demonstrate that the errors we report here are predominantly due to inaccuracies of the IS 900 system rather than the optical tracking against which it was compared. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Object {{tracking}} is {{an essential}} task in computer vision that has been studied {{since the early days}} of the field. Being able to follow objects that undergo different transformations in the video sequence, including changes in scale, illumination, shape and occlusions, makes the problem extremely difficult. One of the real challenges is to keep track of the changes in objects appearance and not drift towards the background clutter. Different from previous approaches, we obtain robustness against background with a tracker model that is composed of many different parts. They are classifiers that respond at different scales and <b>locations.</b> The <b>tracker</b> system functions as a society of parts, each having its own role and level of credibility. Reliable classifiers decide the tracker's next move, while newcomers are first monitored before gaining the necessary level of reliability to participate in the decision process. Some parts that loose their consistency are rejected, while others that show consistency for a sufficiently long time are promoted to permanent roles. The tracker system, as a whole, could also go through different phases, from the usual, normal functioning to states of weak agreement and even crisis. The tracker system has different governing rules in each state. What truly distinguishes our work from others is not necessarily the strength of individual tracking parts, but the way in which they work together and build a strong and robust organization. We also propose an efficient way to learn simultaneously many tracking parts, with a single closed-form formulation. We obtain a fast and robust tracker with state of the art performance on the challenging OTB 50 dataset.

We present a new formulation of the constellation model with correlation filters that treats the geometric and visual constraints within a single convex cost function and derive a highly efficient optimization for MAP inference of a fully-connected constellation.

40|$|Most thermal {{infrared}} (TIR) tracking methods are discriminative, which treat the tracking problem as a classification task. However, {{the objective of}} the classifier (label prediction) is not coupled to {{the objective of the}} <b>tracker</b> (<b>location</b> estimation). The classification task focuses on the between-class difference of the arbitrary objects, while the tracking task mainly deals with the within-class difference of the same objects. In this paper, we cast the TIR tracking problem as a similarity verification task, which is well coupled to the objective of tracking task. We propose a TIR tracker via a hierarchical Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN), named HSNet. To obtain both spatial and semantic features of the TIR object, we design a Siamese CNN coalescing the multiple hierarchical convolutional layers. Then, we train this network end to end on a large visible video detection dataset to learn the similarity between paired objects before we transfer the network into the TIR domain. Next, this pre-trained Siamese network is used to evaluate the similarity between the target template and target candidates. Finally, we locate the most similar one as the tracked target.

40|$|Abstract This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} high accuracy sun tracking control equipment, to be integrated in high concentration photovoltaic systems. In order to achieve the sub degree accuracies required by these photovoltaic concentrators, a new control approach is presented that primarily based in the computation of analytic sun ephemeris equations, adds in its software a calibration model, that characterizes the concentrator geometry {{through a set of}} parameters, in order to precisely convert the sun coordinates supplied by the ephemeris into tracking axes rotation angles. Fitting the calibration model parameters is done through an automatic process that runs during the in‐field installation of the concentration system, in which a set of precise sun position measurements with respect to the tracking axes are taken throughout a day from dawn to dusk. The full development cycle of this product is described going from the theory of its operation, to its validation and testing, its physical implementation as an electronic system, and finally to the steps given towards the volume production of the resultant technology. The work is divided in five chapters that follow an introduction in which an overview is given of the present context of Concentration PhotoVoltaics (CPV), to later focus in presenting the CPV tracker, and finally reviewing the history and state of the art of sun tracking control for high accuracy applications. The tracking control developed in this work is based in an autocalibration process, very common in instrumentation equipment and applied also to the relatively similar problem of the tracking of orbital targets, such as required in big astronomical telescopes. In fact, the novelty of this work resides in adapting these astronomy sun tracking techniques to some sort of “telescopes” that only “see” the electrical power output of a PV generator. These particular telescopes or sun trackers will usually be a two axis pointable structure, where in the approach presented in this work, sun tracking will be firstly based in obtaining the sun’s coordinates with respect to the <b>tracker</b> <b>location</b> through the computation of sun ephemeris equations encoded in a microprocessor. However converting these so called topocentric coordinates into the tracker axes rotations pointing it to the sun, will require another set of equations, i. e. the calibration model or transform as is termed in this work, that usually based in rotation transforms and spherical geometry (or alternatively obtained through quaternions) will parametrically model the orientation of the tracking axes and its rotation origins, and also the orientation with respect to these axes, of the supported CPV array pointing vector, i. e. the one that when perfectly parallel to the local sun vector produces maximum power output. Chapter 1 covers the development of this Calibration Transform (C‐Transform), its application and possible variations to consider the most common tracker axes configurations, and finally the consideration of flexure in the tracking structure and propose how it can be characterized and integrated in an extended calibration transform. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} algorithms used for the fitting of the calibration model once a set of accurate sun position measurements is collected by the tracker. Least squares (LS) fitting through the Levenberg Marquardt method is developed for the C‐Transform of Chapter 1. Firstly the correct operation of our encoding of the Levenberg Marquardt (LM) method is tested, as is usual for numerical optimization algorithms, with the Moré set of test functions. Then the numerical accuracy of the LM method when fitting the C‐Transform and having its code compiled to run in a low cost 8 bit microprocessor, is obtained when compared with that of the same code running in a conventional 32 bit desktop PC. Along with these main topics some other are considered in this chapter such as the analysis of the proper definition of the LS merit function when operating on the C‐Transform, checking the right definition of the C‐Transform that doesn't give rise to discontinuities that may slow its fitting, and also exploring the accuracy of an alternative implementation of the LM algorithm in which the derivatives in the Hessian and gradient are calculated through finite differences instead of using their closed analytic forms. Chapter 3 first gets to prove the physical grounds of the calibration model, by using a laboratory tracker that mounts several different samples of CPV modules, and where some of the parameters of the calibration model can be previously adjusted, tweaking the position of both the tracker and the test modules, so after collecting a set of sun positions and then fitting the C‐Transform best fit parameter values should be equal to those preset during the experiment. Once the calibration model is validated, next goal is the precise measurement of the tracking accuracy being achieved by the proposed hybrid calibrated tracking control. This will first require the development of a Tracking Accuracy Sensor (TAS) able to provide real time measurements of the sun tracking error. This sensor essentially consists of a collimating pipe mounted on top of an imaging electronic sensor, with the necessary signal conditioning electronics, developed along with the conversion equations necessary to compute a tracking error angle from its internal electric variables, and also with the calibration procedure to accurately obtain the internal construction parameters of the sensor that intervene in these conversion equations. This sensor will end up featuring the rather impressive resolution of 1 / 10. 000 th degree within its 1 ° acceptance angle. Finally a monitoring system is built around the TAS mounted in the referred laboratory tracker, and by calibrating the controller against this TAS, a best case estimate of the tracking accuracy statistics, can be obtained for several variations of the calibrated routine here developed. In these experiments average daily accuracies of 0. 05 ° are proven possible with accuracies better than 0. 1 °, 97 % of the time. All tests in Chapter 3 to prove the correct operation of the calibrated sun tracking control, had to previously collect a set of in between fifty and a hundred sun position measurements, throughout a day from dawn to dusk, in order to feed the fitting of the calibration model. This was to be manually done, by aiming the laboratory tracker with its CPV modules to the sun till, according to some criterion, best pointing accuracy was obtained, and then recording axes position along with a measurement time stamp. This was a boring and error prone task, that had to be fully automated in order to be feasibly integrated in a commercial tracking controller unit, so it would run with the least amount manual operation and maintenance. In Chapter 4 the necessary hardware and algorithms to implement the automatic collection of sun position measurements are explained. But prior to the full description of the automatic measurement acquisition process, a review of the existent sun ephemerides and their accuracy is presented, including the set finally chosen for the tracking controller described in this work. Regarding sun position measurements these can first start by a preliminary search of the sun within the concentrator’s tracking range, till this gets within the acceptance angle, a problem which as will be described can be attacked mathematically by resorting to the toolbox of Search Theory, a branch of Operations Research developed during WWII for antisubmarine warfare. In particular when helping the search with a coarse sun sensor such as a low power flat PV module, the optimum search path can be derived by making the assumptions of the so called “Flaming Datum Problem” firstly developed for the search of an evading submarine after it reveals its position after attacking a friendly ship. Once the sun is within acceptance angle, to precisely point to the sun we would ideally maximize the power output of the CPV array, but as will be discussed some practical problems appear when choosing power output as the variable to maximize, and this due to the difficulties of maximum power point (MPP) tracking stages in inverters to follow the tracker scanning movements. Therefore other alternative electrical variables under different biasing than MPP are here proposed. Short circuit current is finally the variable chosen for maximization, and the additional hardware developed to automatically short the CPV array and measure its current is described. Searching for the short circuit current maximum is a problem of maximization of a two dimensional function, that in the sun tracking application can be approached more straightforwardly by avoiding computation of derivatives and instead by determining the minimum number of linear maximizations, which will be translated into tracker sweeps, that lead to the overall maximum of the function. In this occasion the mathematical corpus behind corresponds to the Powell‐Brent derivative‐free conjugate direction set method. Following the description of the mechanism for automatically taking a certain position measurement, investigation of the right number of measurements to obtain the most accurate calibrated ephemeris and their distribution or scheduling is presented. The chapter ends with a discussion about the possibility to introduce a statistical filter to detect outliers during sun position measurement acquisition, understood as those faulty measurements affected by whatever errors, or alternatively considers the possibility to introduce maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) other than the Least Squares, for the fitting of non linear models such as the CTransform. In this respect the so called Cauchy‐Lorentz MLE appears as the most feasible option. Chapter 5, the final one, describes how all the methods developed for the autocalibrated sun|$|R
