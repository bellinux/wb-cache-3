Fiber Metal <b>laminates,</b> FML, is a {{combination}} of metal with fiber/resin <b>laminates</b> and it is a well-known application in composite <b>laminates</b> due to its dimension stability and properties consistency. Generally, the strength of these <b>laminates</b> systems is much depends on the mechanical interlocking mechanism between the metal surface and the composite <b>laminates.</b> Therefore, surface treatment is needed to enhance the <b>laminates</b> strength. In this research, aluminum plates with different surface roughness were <b>laminated</b> with carbon-fiber/epoxy <b>laminates.</b> The strength of these hybrid systems was then characterized to study the effect of surface roughness on the interfacial strength. It shows that the higher surface roughness will result in better interfacial interaction between the metal surface and the fiber <b>laminates...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tests are {{conducted}} using stitched <b>laminates</b> {{in order to}} calculate the unnotched failure stress and the compression after impact (CAI) strength of the stitched <b>laminates.</b> Unnotched <b>laminates,</b> <b>laminates</b> with a hole, and <b>laminates</b> with impact damage {{are used in the}} tests. All the specimens are made of two different types of layup sequence of <b>laminates</b> with three different stitching directions – 0, 45, and 90. In this paper, an FEM model is developed using the MSC PATRAN software to predict the CAI strength of stitched <b>laminates.</b> Two failure criteria are applied to the model to predict the CAI strength, the point stress criterion (PS) and the fiber breakage in damage zone (FD) criterion. The influence of the moduli retention ratio (Mr) is investigated. The predicted CAI strengths show a good agreement when compared with the test results.
