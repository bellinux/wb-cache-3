5|$|Besides the {{ordinary}} matrix multiplication just described, there exist other <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> used operations on matrices {{that can be}} considered forms of multiplication, such as the Hadamard product and the Kronecker product. They arise in solving matrix equations such as the Sylvester equation.|$|E
5|$|Neolithic petroglyphs from Asia depict antler-less female elk, {{which have}} been {{interpreted}} as symbolizing rebirth and sustenance. By {{the beginning of the}} Bronze Age, the elk is depicted <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> in rock art, coinciding with a cultural transformation away from hunting.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Bauer used Ellqvist {{as a model}} <b>less</b> <b>frequently.</b> With {{the birth}} of their son, Bauer started to paint {{pictures}} with children as part of the composition. The painting Rottrollen (The Root Trolls), completed in 1917, is of Putte sleeping among troll-shaped roots in a forest.|$|E

50|$|He {{has been}} overshadowed by James Murray, {{and it must}} be conceded that Bradley was a slower, <b>less</b> durable worker, <b>frequently</b> ill. However, he remains a {{noteworthy}} linguistic scholar, largely self-taught.|$|R
5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, {{in which}} acanthocytes are a typical feature, are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes are seen <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> in other {{conditions}} including Huntington's disease-like syndrome 2 (HDL2) and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN).|$|E
5|$|The {{albatrosses}} are {{a family}} of 21 species of large seabird found across the Southern and North Pacific Oceans. The largest are among the largest flying birds in the world. Ten species are regularly seen in Tasmanian waters, with another three recorded <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> and one vagrant species.|$|E
5|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Mutations and amplification of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and {{provide the basis for}} treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. Her2/neu is affected <b>less</b> <b>frequently.</b> Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are c-MET, NKX2-1, LKB1, PIK3CA, and BRAF.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{are similar}} to Aristotelia roseosuffusella, but the {{forewings}} are much <b>less</b> roseate, <b>frequently</b> showing no tinge of the roseate hue. The first dark band does not cover {{the base of the}} wing and the second band is like that of roseosuffusella, but the third extends across the wing, the dorsal portion being, however, paler than the costal, and the costo-apical part of the wing is ochreous-fuscous.|$|R
5000|$|Inflorescences in racemiform, paniculate or thyrse with partial inflorescences in a capituliform cyme or pseudo-umbel, multifloral, rarely {{single or}} paired flowers, {{axillary}} or on sharp branches or cauliflorous trunks, females <b>frequently</b> <b>less</b> branched.|$|R
50|$|Neck knives {{are usually}} single-edged, with blade lengths {{typically}} under four inches, and <b>frequently</b> <b>less</b> than three inches. They are primarily intended for utilitarian use, although non-utilitarian versions (i.e., daggers and T-handled push daggers) also exist.|$|R
5|$|The winter diet {{is mainly}} plant {{material}} including seeds and rhizomes of aquatic plants, but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> than other Anas ducks. During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly invertebrate animals, including aquatic insects, molluscs and crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|Weekday peak service {{operates}} {{with one}} or two additional Queen's Park-Elephant & Castle trains per hour, and Sunday service operates with two fewer Queen's Park-Elephant & Castle trains per hour during the core of the day.

5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Schmitt {{turned away}} from the {{assurance}} of popularity as a pleasant painter to become one of our potentially great painters, although he works in more or <b>less</b> obscurity. <b>Frequently,</b> his themes suggest religious subjects. He never troubles about the conventional associations of his subjects but uses them to indulge his ardent love for richly colored compositions of involve forms in which the human figure does not distract the eye but it is a unit of a co-ordinated whole.|$|R
5000|$|Artificial silk or art silk is any {{synthetic}} fiber which resembles silk, but typically costs <b>less</b> to produce. <b>Frequently,</b> [...] "artificial silk" [...] {{is just a}} synonym for rayon. When made out of bamboo viscose it is also sometimes called bamboo silk.|$|R
5000|$|... ‘Continuing Churches’ are <b>frequently</b> <b>less</b> {{tolerant}} of doctrinal diversity than the parent Church and {{claim that they}} hold on to an 'orthodox' position.

5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} {{for the remainder of}} 2006, but thereafter played <b>less</b> <b>frequently,</b> appearing in only four of Spain's twelve Euro 2008 qualifiers. Named in the 31-man provisional squad for the competition finals, he failed to make the cut. His last international appearance came as a substitute in a 1–0 friendly win against France in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to both its main cast and guest stars, Family Guy utilizes a deep bench of regularly appearing supporting voice actors.

5|$|In the {{weighted}} maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, <b>less</b> <b>frequently,</b> edges) and the output is a clique with maximum total weight. The maximum clique {{problem is the}} special case in which all weights are equal. As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.|$|E
50|$|The first haiku {{written in}} English was by Ezra Pound, {{published}} in 1913. Since then, the haiku {{has become a}} fairly popular form among English-speaking poets. English haiku can follow the traditional Japanese rules, but are <b>frequently</b> <b>less</b> strict, particularly concerning the number of syllables and subject matter.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{assistance}} of his foreman Louis-Claude Brullé, Le Breton would occasionally censor articles {{in order to make}} them <b>less</b> radical, <b>frequently</b> drawing the ire of Diderot. According to Grimm, writing in 1777, [...] "The entire extent of the injury done by this unexampled, murderous, and infamous depredation will never be known, since the perpetrators of the crime burned the manuscript {{as soon as it was}} printed and left the evil without remedy." [...] This claim has proved not to be true for, unknown to Grimm, le Breton had kept copies of the page proofs.|$|R
30|$|When {{the selling}} price p increases, {{there is a}} {{decrease}} in the optimal order quantity Q^*. The larger the value of p, the smaller is the value of the optimal cycle time T^*. That is, when the unit selling price is increasing, the retailer will order <b>less</b> quantity more <b>frequently.</b>|$|R
5|$|Manchester City {{returned}} to the First Division for the 1966–67 season, and Young remained a key player. Before Manchester City's game against Leeds United, Leeds manager Don Revie, known for his meticulous scouting of opposition teams, identified Young as a particular threat in a Grandstand interview. Operating mainly on the wing, Young scored <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> {{than in the previous}} season, with 7 goals in 45 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Mills made {{large-scale}} {{changes to}} the squad over the summer of 2006, although a few months into 2006–07 more budget cuts were made and this limited his ability to add to a squad lacking in depth. When he left Alfreton they were 13th in the Conference North, and he was playing <b>less</b> <b>frequently,</b> making five appearances in 2006–07.|$|E
5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity. A French study {{has shown that}} mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, {{and there is some}} evidence that fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> than in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Orfii {{used only}} the most common praenomina, {{including}} Gaius, Lucius, and Marcus. There are a few instances of other common praenomina, including Titus, Quintus, and Gnaeus, {{as well as one}} instance of Vibius, an much <b>less</b> common name, <b>frequently</b> associated with families of Sabine or Oscan origin.|$|R
50|$|Jango {{is a free}} online music {{streaming}} service that allows users to create and share custom radio stations. Users choose artists to stream, and the station plays music from similar artists. Users can further refine their stations by rating songs and artists in their feed to play <b>less</b> or more <b>frequently.</b>|$|R
40|$|A product {{estimator}} of {{the population}} mean which is predictive in character is proposed. Although optimal {{in the sense of}} unbiasedness and minimum mean squared error under a certain superpopulation model, the estimator is <b>frequently</b> <b>less</b> biased than its competitors under a sampling theoretic approach. Some key words: Predictive estimator; Product estimator; Superpopulation model. 1...|$|R
5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but <b>less</b> <b>frequently,</b> in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
5|$|The English Earl of Northumberland {{was also}} held here, after fleeing to Scotland {{following}} {{the failure of}} the Catholic Rising of the North in 1570. He was captured by the Earl of Morton, and confined at Loch Leven before being sent back to England for execution. In 1588, Sir William Douglas of Lochleven succeeded to the earldom of Morton, as the 6th earl. With the title he inherited other properties, including Aberdour Castle in Fife, and Loch Leven Castle became <b>less</b> <b>frequently</b> used.|$|E
25|$|The commonest {{surviving}} Romanesque {{buildings are}} churches, of which many are still standing, more or <b>less</b> intact and <b>frequently</b> in use.
