5|$|At the FBI, Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) {{discloses}} {{to a room}} {{of agents}} that Dana Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) son William has been abducted. Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick). However, Follmer <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> any potential motive for these crimes, which causes a frustrated Scully to leave the room. Byers (Bruce Harwood) reveals that he put a cell phone in the baby’s belongings so they can track the Overcoat Woman; Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Scully head out to find William. The two eventually find William's car seat along with the cell phone in an abandoned SUV. Meanwhile, the Overcoat Woman reports to Josepho that she has William.|$|E
5|$|Klaus {{tells of}} the Krampus, unnerving Kathy. Before bed, Toby <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> his boots for the Krampus, and Kathy empties a bottle of tablets. The next morning, Toby's boots are filled with switches, indicating—according to Klaus's story—that he has been visited by the Krampus due to his naughtiness. Celia {{suspects}} Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby {{tells of the}} wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads to bed, and Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced. That night, both Toby and Celia are out of bed, and {{the figure of the}} Krampus is seen. The next day, scratches are found on Toby's body, and Celia leaves with the child.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E

It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as textured vegetable protein or tofu, or a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, mushrooms, or beets.|$|E

Marburg kidnaps Madison; Thorton must choose between saving her or preventing the museum's destruction and innocent deaths. Afterwards, Marburg escapes unless Thorton can persuade him to finish their fight to the death. If Thorton chooses to save Madison over the civilians, she <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> of guilt.|$|E
25|$|The organization's {{translations}} {{are regularly}} quoted by major international newspapers, and its work has generated strong criticism and praise. Critics have accused MEMRI of producing inaccurate, unreliable translations with undue emphasis and selectivity in translating and disseminating {{the most extreme}} views from Arabic and Persian media, which portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets. Other critics charge that while MEMRI does sometimes translate pro-US or pro-democracy voices in the regional media, it systematically <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> intelligent criticism of Western-style democracy, US and Israeli policy and secularism.|$|E
25|$|As a writer, {{poetry is}} {{basically}} Changmarín's fundamental tool of expression. Once {{established as a}} consecrated poet, he reached an outstanding moment in his creation with the book of poetry entitled Poemas Corporales (Corporeal Poems), which was awarded the Ricardo Miró National Award in 1955. With this work, Changmarín showed himself as a developed poet who has achieved great control over this literary form. Changmarín <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> as much as possible, which mirrors the trends of the time. This clarity serves as a method to deliver {{the social and political}} messages, as most of his works are fundamental. His mastery of the decasyllable writing imprints Poemas Corporales with a classical accent comparable to the Quevedo Verses.|$|E

25|$|While Pager’s {{study is}} greatly informative, it does lack some {{valuable}} information. Pager only studied {{white and black}} males, which <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> women and people of other races. It also fails {{to account for the}} fact that applying for jobs has largely shifted from applying in person to applying over the Internet. A study done by Scott H. Decker, Cassia Spohn, Natalie R. Ortiz, and Eric Hedberg from Arizona State University in 2014 accounts for this missing information. This study was set up similarly to the Pager study, but with the addition of female job applicants, Hispanic job applicants, and online job applications. Men and women of white, black, and Hispanic ethnicities account for 92% of the US prison population.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of the Paths of the Dead adds a conversation between Aragorn and the King of the Dead (in the book the Dead don't speak at all) and a scene where the companions must flee an avalanche of skulls, but <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> the encounter with Baldor's skeleton. In contrast to the book, the viewer doesn't get told what happened in Lebennin between Aragorn and the Corsairs of Umbar. The film version (Extended Edition) doesn't correspond with the map of Gondor, as the company sees a near river with Corsair ships immediately after leaving the Haunted Mountain. In the book, the River Anduin lies several hundred miles farther east, requiring a much longer journey with the Army of the Dead following behind, bringing terror to the towns they pass along the way.|$|E
25|$|The name Ám {{agrees with}} that of a son of Dag in the Ættartolur and Jöfurmar is {{probably}} identical with Jöfur of the Ættartolur. Fradmar, Gyrd, Álf the Old, and the two Frekis bring the total to seven. Adding the names Óli and Arngrím to this list from the Ættartolur brings the tally to nine, as the Ættartolur promised. This may be coincidental. It is odd that the Hyndluljód here <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> the only two names for which the Hversu provides descendants. It is possible that the following stanzas of the Hyndluljód down to stanza24 cover otherwise unknown members of the Dögling lineage since stanza23 at least returns to the Dödlings, providing the names of the twelve sons of Arngrím and the following stanza tells of their birth to Arngrím and Eyfura. Áli mentioned in stanza14 of the Hyndluljód (quoted near the beginning of this article) may be identical to Óli son of Dag mentioned in the Ættartolur.|$|E
