40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} coarse and fine-grained {{techniques for}} parallel FPGA routing on modern multi-core processors. In the coarse-grained approach, sets of design signals {{are assigned to}} different processor cores and routed concurrently. Communica-tion between cores is through the MPI (message passing interface) communications protocol. In the fine-grained approach, the task of routing an individual <b>load</b> <b>pin</b> on a signal is parallelized using threads. Specifically, as FPGA routing resources are traversed during maze expansion, delay calculation, costing and priority queue insertion for these resources execute concurrently. The proposed techniques provide deterministic/repeatable results. Moreover, the coarse and fine-grained approaches are not mutu-ally exclusive {{and can be used}} in tandem.

The experiment had done using various dimensions of the specimens which is pin diameter, plates thickness and plate thickness to diameter ratio, t/D. The specimens were tested using universal tensile testing machine. The movement for upper crosshead of the testing machine is stopped when the specimen is break. For each specimen, the bearing load was taken and determined from the load vs. displacement graph which is obtained from the Trapezium software in computer that connects with the universal tensile testing machine.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of mathematical models to study the failure loads of fiber glass reinforced woven epoxy composite plates with two parallel holes subjected to traction forces by two rigid pins. To understand the effect of joint geometry on the failure loads the geometrical parameters like the edge distance to the hole diameter (E/D), the distance between center of two holes-to-hole diameter (K/D), the distance from the upper or the lower edge of the specimen to the centre of the hole-to-hole diameter (M/D) were varied. Mathematical models have been developed for wet and dry specimens to determine the failure loads of different geometry plates. Wet specimens are specimens immersed in seawater for 3 months. The unimmersed specimens are called dry specimens. Here Full Cubic models have proved to be very efficient. A comparison of the results from mathematical models with the experimental results from existing literature shows high values of correlation co-efficient, Root Mean Square Error and Maximum Absolute Error. For estimation of the failure loads within the range of E/D, K/D and M/D considered for the study, the mathematical models developed are found to be efficient.

Metal-composite single lap coupons, reinforced with additively manufactured metallic pins, {{are subjected to}} high-cycle fatigue. A backface strain technique is used to identify damage initiation/growth and an ultrasonic inspection method {{is also used to}} help characterise failure. Fatigue life curves are generated and it is found that there is a discrete change in failure mode when load severity is reduced. High severity testing results in pin fracture above the pin root - similar to that observed during a previous static test programme. However, for high-cycle fatigue, at low <b>loads,</b> <b>pins</b> are torn from the adherend and cracks propagate through the stock material below the pin microstructure. It is proposed that this results from a change to the <b>pin</b> <b>load</b> mixity as joint rotation increases. Coupon failure is controlled and repeatable (for a given load severity) due to the sacrificial role of the pins and there is no significant damage to the composite adherend. Hence, it is believed that HYPER joints not only have excellent mechanical strength, compared to benchmark tests with bonded joints, but also offer greater potential for in-service repair than conventional, mechanically fastened joints...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} stress states in two-dimensional models of metal-to-metal adhesively bonded joints subjected to 4 -point flexural loading using finite element (FE) method. The FE simulations were carried out on adhesive bonded joints of high support span to specimen thickness ratio undergoing extensive plastic deformations. Two different adhesive types with eight different adhesive layer thicknesses each varied between 50 μm to 1500 μm were considered. The lower interfaces in the brittle adhesive were observed to be under a lower stress state because of the constraint exerted by a relatively stiff lower adherend. The ductile adhesive layers were under a lower state of stress {{as a result of}} the lower elastic modulus. It is concluded that the degree of plastic deformation in the adhesive is dictated by the adherend stiffness and the load transfer along the interface. The effect of <b>load</b> and support <b>pins</b> is noticeable at all adhesive thicknesses. High stress localisation exists in the vicinity of the <b>load</b> <b>pins.</b> The constraint exerted by the adherends dictates the deformation gradient through thickness of the adhesive layer.
