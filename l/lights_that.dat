5|$|The Christmas tree is {{decorated}} with <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> are switched on at a seasonal ceremony. It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day. The festivity {{is open to the}} public and attracts a large number of people. The switch-on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events. On the twelfth night of Christmas, the tree is taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.|$|E
5|$|The GWR began {{experimenting with}} the {{electric}} lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> year. Although {{the system was}} unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and Royal Oak and Westbourne Park stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with gas lighting on the same scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{operates}} with seven stadium-style seating X-Car trains. Each train has two cars that can hold six riders each {{for a total}} of twelve riders per train. On the head rest of each seat there are two speakers that play music during the ride. The speakers have been designed so that only the rider's selected music track will be audible. On the restraint is a small touch screen where riders can choose which song they want to listen to during the ride. Additionally, the trains are equipped with multi-coloured <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> can be seen during the night.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of DJ lighting such as scanners which use a mirror to reflect beams of <b>light</b> <b>that</b> move around, twister-style effects that project multiple beams of <b>light</b> <b>that</b> rotate in a twisting style and also strobe <b>lighting</b> <b>that</b> flash intensely.|$|R

5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and lighting system, with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio and lighting system animates LED <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station. The lighting pattern used for the park entrance track section gives {{the effect of a}} Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E
5|$|From 2010, Smooth and Real Radio {{were the}} {{official}} broadcaster of the switch-on ceremony for the Blackpool Illuminations, the broadcast rights {{to which it}} won from BBC Radio 2, which had aired it since 1997. 2010 {{was the first time}} the event was broadcast on commercial radio. The annual event was compered by presenters from the two stations at a purposely-built arena, and featured a music concert by popular artists. Performers in 2010 included Alesha Dixon, Gabriella Cilmi, The Wanted, Olly Murs, and Robbie Williams, who switched on the <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> year. The 2012 switch-on was performed by Greg Rutherford, Luke Campbell and Beth TweddleBritish Olympians who won gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Ben Serotta helped {{redesign}} {{the bicycle}} {{to include a}} new seat, a simpler gear shifting mechanism, fewer and brighter lights, and a European-style center kickstand. All of Citi Bike's bicycles were to be renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes were taken out of service due to {{a part in the}} front wheel degrading faster than expected. In early 2017, as part of a pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> project a teal silhouette on the ground to warn drivers and pedestrians in their path.|$|E

50|$|The {{reflectance}} field over a {{human face}} was first captured in 2000 by Paul Debevec et al. The method they used to find the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> travels under the skin {{was based on the}} existing scientific knowledge <b>that</b> <b>light</b> reflecting off the air-to-oil retains its polarization while <b>light</b> <b>that</b> travels under the skin loses its polarization.|$|R

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial. Shots of {{the interior of the}} mine were captured at night so it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of judo and karate.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} bicycling {{included}} a suspension ramp {{that would allow}} bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without dismounting their bikes. Due {{to the length of}} time any new downtown bridge would take to be built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, which happens yearly during Thunder Over Louisville, bicyclists preferred the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge. By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a pedestrian walkway. With the approach ramps, the bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side with construction still continuing on the Indiana ramp. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties.|$|E
50|$|Actinic {{light was}} first {{commonly}} used in early photography to distinguish <b>light</b> <b>that</b> would expose the monochrome films from <b>light</b> <b>that</b> would not. A non-actinic safe-light (e.g., red or amber) {{could be used in}} a darkroom without risk of exposing (fogging) light-sensitive films, plates or papers.|$|R
