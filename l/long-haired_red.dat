50|$|Firestar {{continues}} {{her education}} while engaging in super heroics part-time. In her one-shot issue, {{she is wearing}} a <b>long-haired</b> <b>red</b> wig as her natural hair has not grown back yet.|$|E
50|$|The galls of {{the rose}} gall wasp (Diplolepis rosae) are also {{distinctive}} and are known as bedeguars or robin's pincushions. These are found on the shoots of dog roses and have a length of up to 5 cm with <b>red,</b> <b>long-haired</b> outgrowths. Inside the galls are several chambers, which may be occupied by larvae.|$|R
60|$|As he rode {{around a}} corner of the stone house his horse snorted and stopped. A lean, shaggy pony jumped at sight of him, almost {{displacing}} a <b>red</b> <b>long-haired</b> blanket that covered an Indian saddle. Quick thuds of hoofs in sand drew Shefford's attention to a corral made of peeled poles, and here he saw another pony.|$|R
5000|$|Tyris is {{the protagonist}} of Golden Axe: Beast Rider, wherein the {{developer}} Secret Level said {{the focus was on}} her reimagining. In this game, she is a [...] "half-gladiator/half-barbarian" [...] defender of the Axirian Priestesses, a female sect worshipping the Great Dragon in the Island of Axir. After the sisterhood is wiped out by Death Adder's forces, she takes up sword and sorcery to avenge them and stop him from taking over the world. She is depicted as a <b>long-haired</b> in skimpy <b>red</b> or red-and-white costumes and various hair colors. She has darker skin, shorter red hair, and white warpaint around her green eyes, and wears several different tribal-like outfits throughout the game, depending on which stage she is in, which are unlocked and can be used in other stages.|$|R
60|$|Another instance, {{more to the}} point, {{occurred}} at my own house on the pampas, and I {{was one of several}} persons who witnessed it. A small, <b>red,</b> <b>long-haired</b> bitch--a variety of the common native cur--gave birth to four or five pups. A peon was told to destroy them, and, waiting until the bitch was out of sight, he carried them off {{to the end of the}} orchard, some 400 or 500 yards from the house, and threw them into a pool of water which was only two to three feet deep. The bitch passed the rest of the day in rushing frantically about, searching for her young, and in the evening, a little after dark, actually succeeded in finding them, although they were lying at the bottom of the pool. She got them all out, and carried them, one by one, to another part of the grounds, where she passed the night with them, uttering at intervals the most piercing cries. In the morning she carried them to still another spot, where there was a soft mould, and then dug a hole large and deep enough to bury them all, covering them over with the loose earth. Her task done, she returned to the house to sleep all day, but when night came again the whole piteous performance was repeated: the pups were dug up, and she passed the long, piercingly cold night--for it was in the depth of winter--trying to keep them warm, and uttering, as before, distressing cries. Yet a third time the whole thing was repeated; but after the third night, when the dog came home to sleep, the dead pups were taken out of the ground and buried at a distance.|$|R
