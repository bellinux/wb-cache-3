They don't hear your accent and make assumptions. All they see are your words." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the backspace key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you kind of {{have to go back and}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future." [...] The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic's Great Turtle Race.|$|E

During the shoot, Rowland said, [...] "This video {{has been one of}} the best video {{experiences}} I’ve ever had. I’ve shot a lot of videos, but this one is probably the most intriguing because of how it’s shot, the lighting—everything is so detailed." [...] Rankin said that [...] "the concept for the video was 3D" [...] to best portray how [...] "the people <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> relationships with an optimism that can't be seen from the inside." [...] The scenes feature the use of circular trap and turntables so that Rowland [...] "could be seen from every angle." [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] was set to premier on the Vevo network on September 20, 2010; however, it was uploaded to her Vevo account on September 15, 2010, five days earlier than expected.|$|E

500|$|Scudder {{provides}} the additional detail that [...] "instruments {{of all kinds}} were interdicted", including any magnifying glass. After several hours Agassiz asks for a report and Scudder describes [...] "the fringed gill-arches and moveable operculum; the pores of the head, fleshy lips and lidless eyes; the lateral line, the spinous fins and forked tail; the compressed and arched body". Disappointed, Agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe [...] "the most conspicuous features of the animal" [...] and commands him to [...] "look again, look again!" [...] The mortified Scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen, {{and is able to}} report to Agassiz the following morning that [...] "the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs", which was the observation Agassiz was looking for. However, when Scudder then asked what he should do next, Agassiz replied, [...] "Oh, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> fish!" [...] which Scudder did for another two full days.|$|E

Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

[...] Lima gave it three stars writing, [...] "Although the appearance of so many characters in one book reads awkwardly, some of the dialogue was clever and funny and that at least redeemed the contents of this issue a little bit, at least for me."

2500|$|While {{away on a}} trip to England in March 2004, Christopher {{received}} an email from Joan Porco's account admonishing him for failing classes at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, NY.

Blaming the community college's office of registrar, he wrote, [...] "ut obviously they are incorrect...My lowest grade that I got on anything was a B on a physics test...Don't jump to conclusions, I'm fine."

As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted {{he had been}} drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on air and continually referred to his [...] "greater intellect". He openly taunted and mocked Vidal (who responded in kind), finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced during the discussion that she was [...] "becoming very, very bored", telling Mailer [...] "You act as if you're the only people here." [...] As Cavett made jokes comparing Mailer's intellect to his ego, Mailer stated [...] "Why don't you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> question sheet and ask your question?", to which Cavett responded [...] "Why don't you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don't shine?" [...] A long laugh ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he {{had come up with}} that line and Cavett replied [...] "I have to tell you a quote from Tolstoy?". The headbutting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his essay [...] "Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots".|$|E

2500|$|In February 1982, Iraq {{was removed}} from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism to ease the {{transfer}} of dual-use technology to that country. According to investigative journalist Alan Friedman, Secretary of State Alexander Haig was [...] "upset at the fact that the decision had been made at the White House, even though the State Department was responsible for the list." [...] "I was not consulted," [...] Haig is said to have complained. In March, President Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82—seeking [...] "a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East"—and in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: [...] "The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran." [...] Pursuant to this Directive, Thomas Twetten arrived in Baghdad on July 27 to share CIA satellite imagery on Iranian troop movements with the Iraqi Mukhabarat. This was [...] "the first U.S. provision of intelligence to Iraq," [...] and sparked a short-lived debate over whether Iraq would tolerate a CIA presence in the country: Mukhabarat head Barzan Tikriti told Twetton to [...] "get the hell out of Iraq," [...] but Iraqi military intelligence—"having already drooled over it and having said repeatedly how valuable it was"—subsequently informed Twetton [...] "we'll continue to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> information, and we'll assess whether it is of use to us in any way." [...] Reports of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran reached the CIA as early as 1983, but the U.S. took no action to restrain Iraq's violations of international law, failing even to alert the UN. In late 1983, Reagan selected Donald Rumsfeld as his envoy to the Middle East; Rumsfeld met Saddam in Baghdad in December 1983 and March 1984. [...] "On November 26, 1984, Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The young priestess enters, {{concerned}} at how pale Norma looks. Norma makes her swear {{to do everything}} she asks and, upon her agreement, tells her that she is entrusting the two children to her care and states {{that they should be}} taken to the Roman camp to their father Pollione, a man whom she hopes will make a better mate for Adalgisa than he was for her. [...] Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: [...] "I beg you for his children's sake." [...] (Duet, first Norma: Deh! con te, con te li prendi, Li sostieni, li difendi / [...] "Please, take them with you, support them and protect them; I don't ask you for honour or power, let that be kept for your own children.") Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> dear children of yours on your knees.

They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E
