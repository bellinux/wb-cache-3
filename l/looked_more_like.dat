5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they were similar to turtles. There {{is no evidence of}} any shelled Dicynodon, and recent more complete fossils show that they <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|When {{the puppet}} for Marion was first created, he was {{depicted}} as having stripy fur, but <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a mouse {{in the eyes}} of the crew, so his puppet was changed. Marion's image was based on topless photos of the comic actor James Corden.|$|E
5|$|Producers Avery Drewe and Richie Owens {{coordinated the}} visual effects {{during the final}} scene of the episode and were only able to do one take during filming. Stunt driver Steve Kelso drove the SUV when it crashed into Tony's car, {{reportedly}} driving at 50 miles per hour, though bloggers indicated that they thought that the car <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> it was going 80 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn thought he <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood {{was offered a}} playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything {{to escape from the}} mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E
25|$|The Lord Nelsons {{were the}} last British battleships to have an {{armoured}} ram built into their bow. They cost just over £1,600,000 each, the 2005 equivalent of about £110,000,000. The ships as completed were homely but intimidating in appearance, and <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> French battleships than the previous British pre-dreadnought pattern.|$|E

25|$|From {{at least}} {{the late nineteenth century}} in Europe, there was {{speculation}} that the range of human sexual response <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a continuum than two or three discrete categories. Berlin sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld published a scheme in 1896 that measured the strength of an individual's sexual desire on two independent 10-point scales, A (homosexual) and B (heterosexual). A heterosexual individual may be A0, B5; a homosexual individual may be A5, B0; an asexual would be A0, B0; and someone with an intense attraction to both sexes would be A9, B9.|$|E
25|$|The {{most diverse}} group of labyrinthodonts was the Temnospondyli. Temnospondyls {{appeared}} the Late Devonian and came in all sizes, from small salamander-like Stereospondyli that scurried along the waters edge and undergrowth, to giant, well armoured Archegosauroidea that <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> crocodiles. Prionosuchus was an exceptionally large member of the Archegosauridae, estimated to have been up to 9 meters long, {{it is the largest}} amphibian ever known to have lived. Temnospondyls typicall had large heads and heavy shoulder girdles with moderately long tails. A fossil trackway from Lesotho shows larger forms dragged themselves by the front limbs over slippery surfaces with limited sideways movement of the body, very unlike modern salamanders.|$|E
25|$|After the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of {{the group}} (by this time known as Bogoiskateli, or God-seekers) were {{cancelled}} by the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Konstantin Pobedonostsev's decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass sectarian settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular. In Novy Put things changed too: {{with the arrival of}} strong personalities like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov and Semyon Frank the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit Novy Put, remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas. This time it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a literary circle than anything it had ever purported to be.|$|E

500|$|Parhad's {{work was}} met with some {{criticism}} by local Assyrians, who argued it was inaccurate to portray Ashurbanipal holding a clay tablet and a lion, or wearing a skirt. The critics thought the statue <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Sumerian king Gilgamesh; Renee Kovacs, a [...] "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", believed the sculpture depicted neither figure, but rather a Mesopotamian [...] "protective figure". Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took artistic liberties.|$|E
500|$|Markowitz based the {{character}} on a former boss, claiming she was [...] "very sexually aggressive with everybody". When writing the script, Markowitz {{intended for the}} role to go to Aniston. He stated, [...] "but [...] <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Cruella de Vil. It was like flirting with a cobweb. So I decided {{for the sake of}} the movie, let’s go with Jennifer Aniston.” The actress insisted on wearing a brown wig for the role, wanting to look different from other characters she had played.|$|E

500|$|Some events {{disturbed}} {{the project}} {{while working on}} Sarge, as Debian servers were attacked by fire and hackers. One {{of the most memorable}} was the Vancouver prospectus. After a meeting held in Vancouver, release manager Steve Langasek announced a plan {{to reduce the number of}} supported ports to four in order to shorten future release cycles. There was a large reaction because the proposal <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a decision and because such a drop would damage Debian's aim to be [...] "the universal operating system".|$|E

When he began teaming with La Peste Negra Bucanero wore ring gear that <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Jack Sparrow from the [...] movie series and less like his fellow Guerreros de la Atlantida members. He was also given a mascot, a Mini-Estrella wearing a parrot outfit that {{accompanied}} him to the ring. The parrot was later named Zacarias.|$|E
500|$|Banksy's op-ed {{article about}} One World Trade Center, posted on his website on 27 October, came as {{an insult to}} many across the city. Former FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "disgrace to New York City and all the {{families}} who lost loved ones on 9/11." [...] Sally Regenhard, a leading voice for families of 11 September victims, expressed concerns about Banksy's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa, saying the piece was [...] "horrific" [...] and that the placed flower <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an explosion. A Century 21 department store near Ground Zero had planned to show Banksy's work on 29 October, but cancelled due to the controversy.|$|E

500|$|The first post-B-70 {{strategic}} penetrator {{study was}} known as the Subsonic Low-Altitude Bomber (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This produced a design that <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an airliner than a bomber, with a large swept wing, T-tail, and large high-bypass engines. This was followed by the similar Extended Range Strike Aircraft (ERSA), which added a variable-sweep wing, then in vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a [...] payload and a range of , with [...] being flown at low altitudes.

500|$|Squires {{drops his}} cup, as Nina {{continues}} {{to fill in}} the crossword, including SOWERBERRY and KNOWITALL. Squires is apparently paralysed in his chair, watching. Nina reveals herself as a marine biologist, and has acquired tetrodotoxin from a pufferfish, which causes paralysis and asphyxiation. Simon was actually Nina's brother, and is visible on the photo of Squires and his wife. Simon had reached a crosswording final only to be beaten by Squires after the latter challenged that a u <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a v. Depressed by the trivial defeat, Simon had killed himself. Squires, to Nina's shock, is unharmed. He leaps up to fill out NEUN and ASPS, revealing the nina ISWAPPEDCUPS within the crossword. As Nina induces vomiting, Squires makes a phone call. He had been warned by Dr Jacob Tyler, an old friend and Nina's supervisor. Squires places Nina—for whom paralysis is setting in—on a chair, and goes back to the crossword, filling out UNDERSLIP.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer of}} Rap-Up {{magazine}} wrote Beyoncé was [...] "spread the love" [...] with the [...] "feel-good clip". Idolator's Mike Wass said [...] "Happily [...] is as gorgeous {{as the song}} with Terry Richardson simply filming Bey living it up at Coney Island. It's almost too perfect." [...] In another review, he also hailed it as [...] "carefree, neon-drenched" [...] {{and one of the}} best clips on the whole album adding that it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a home movie than a music video which was [...] "part of its immense appeal". Rob Harvilla from Spin magazine described it as [...] "the sweetest" [...] video on the album. Chris Martins from the same publication wrote that the video is [...] "all pretty huge and heartwarming". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph found [...] "happy innocence" [...] in the clip. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone noted that the clip was a [...] "fun video for a likewise song" [...] further saying that the hand choreography was Beyoncé's version of a similar dance from the song [...] "Y.M.C.A."
