5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the Saturn I or Saturn IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} to propel the crew far enough in the event of an explosion, so a <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of an abort {{requiring}} the destruction of the rocket, the range safety officer would remotely shut down the engines and after several seconds send another command for the shaped explosive charges attached to the outer surfaces of the rocket to detonate. These would make cuts in fuel and oxidizer tanks to disperse the fuel quickly and to minimize mixing. The pause between these actions would give time for the crew to escape using the <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>Tower</b> or (in the later stages of the flight) the propulsion system of the Service module. A third command, [...] "safe", was used after the S-IVB stage reached orbit to irreversibly deactivate the self-destruct system. The system was also inactive as long as the rocket was still on the launch pad.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{experienced}} a single anomaly: {{one of the}} eight first-stage Saturn I engines shut down early, but the guidance system compensated by burning the remaining seven engines longer. AS-101 was followed by four more flights to verify the launch aerodynamics of the Apollo Command and Service Module and its <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> System (LES) <b>tower.</b>|$|R
50|$|The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center was {{responsible}} for the design, production and operation of the three Pegasus satellites which were launched by Saturn I rocket test flights in 1965. At launch, a boilerplate Apollo Command/Service Module and <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> system <b>tower</b> were atop the Saturn I, with the Pegasus experiment folded inside the Service Module. After first stage separation and second-stage ignition, the <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> system was jettisoned. When the second stage attained orbit, the 10,000-pound Apollo boilerplate Command and Service modules were jettisoned into a separate orbit. Then a motor driven device extended the winglike panels on the Pegasus to a span of 96 ft. The Pegasus wings remained attached to the Saturn I's second stage as planned.|$|R
50|$|AS-102 was {{designed}} to repeat the flight of AS-101. It would once again carry a boilerplate Apollo Command and Service Module. The only difference from Boilerplate 13 carried on AS-101 was that on Boilerplate 15, one of the simulated Reaction Control System thruster quads (attitude control thrusters) was instrumented to record launch temperatures and vibrations. Another major difference on AS-102 was that the <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> System (LES) <b>tower</b> would be jettisoned using the <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> and pitch control motors. The mission used Apollo boilerplate BP-15.|$|R
2500|$|The basic IU {{structure}} {{is a short}} cylinder, 36inches high and [...] in diameter, fabricated of an aluminum alloy honeycomb sandwich material [...] thick. The cylinder is manufactured in three 120-degree segments, which are joined by splice plates into an integral structure. The top and bottom edges are made from extruded aluminum channels bonded to the honeycomb sandwich. This type of construction was selected for its high strength to weight ratio, acoustical insulation, and thermal conductivity properties. The IU supported the components mounted on its inner wall {{and the weight of}} the Apollo spacecraft above (the Lunar Module, the Command Module, the Service Module, and the <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>Tower).</b> To facilitate handling the IU before it was assembled into the Saturn, the fore and aft protective rings, 6inches tall and painted blue, were bolted to the top and bottom channels. These were removed in the course of stacking the IU into the Saturn vehicle. The structure was manufactured by North American Rockwell in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Edward A. Beasley was the I.U. Program Manager.|$|E

At T+2 minutes 14 seconds Cooper felt BECO (Booster Engine Cutoff) and staging. The two Atlas booster engines {{had been left}} behind. The <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>Tower</b> was then jettisoned. At T+3 minutes the cabin pressure sealed at [...] Cooper reported, [...] "Faith 7 is all go." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first five}} {{launches}} of the Saturn I had carried Jupiter-C nosecones, a proven design which allowed engineers {{to focus on}} development of the rocket. To verify the launch aerodynamics of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM), AS-101 carried BP-13, a boilerplate spacecraft which weighed 17000 lb and duplicated {{the size and shape}} of the CSM, and a dummy <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> System (LES) <b>tower.</b> A flight-weight Command Module weighed around 12000 lb. The boilerplate spacecraft was instrumented with 116 sensors reading strain, pressure, and acceleration.|$|R
50|$|The followup to Cosmos 133 {{was planned}} for 14 December, but ended disastrously. At liftoff, the Blok A core {{stage of the}} 11A57 booster ignited, but not the strap-ons. A {{shutdown}} command was immediately sent and pad crews began to move the service towers back in place and drain the propellants. This task was completed for the core stage and strap-ons, and then about 30 minutes after the attempted <b>launch,</b> the <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> suddenly fired. Its exhaust caused the Blok I third stage propellant tanks to overheat and explode, killing one person {{on the ground and}} damaging the Soyuz and core stage/strap-ons beyond repair. LC-1 was also badly damaged and took a month of repair work in the frigid Kazakhstan winter to be restored to use. The reason for the LES firing was thought to be either a timer being activated due to the Earth's rotation affecting the gyroscope package in the launch vehicle or perhaps one of the service towers bumping it.|$|R
50|$|For the Apollo program, Lockheed Propulsion Company {{provided}} {{both the}} <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> Motor and the Pitch Control Motor {{of the emergency}} <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> atop the Apollo command module, using propellant made of polysulfides.|$|R

50|$|The canard {{surfaces}} deployed {{and turned}} the vehicle to the desired orientation for drogue parachute deployment. During the turnaround maneuver, the <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> and forward heat shield were jettisoned as planned. The boost protective cover, which {{was attached to the}} launch escape system, protected the conical surface of the command module and remained intact through a canard-induced pitch maneuver. At tower jettison, the soft boost protective cover, as expected, collapsed because of differential pressure during removal from the command module. No recontact or interference between the major components was evident during tower jettison and parachute deployment.|$|E
50|$|Unacceptable wind {{conditions}} had forced a 24-hour postponement of the launch, but the vehicle was successfully launched on May 13, 1964, at 12:59:59.7 UTC (05:59 am MST). A ground commanded abort signal terminated {{thrust of the}} launch vehicle (by rupturing the Algol motor casing), ignited the launch escape and pitch control motors, and separated the command module from the service module. Some structural damage was incurred by the command module aft heat shield because of recontact with the booster at thrust termination. At approximately 44 seconds, the tower jettison motor was ignited and satisfactorily separated the <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> from the command module.|$|E
50|$|Only 43 {{seconds after}} liftoff, Mercury-Atlas 3's mission {{ended in a}} rain of fiery debris falling back to Earth. The <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> {{activated}} the moment the destruct command was sent and lofted Mercury spacecraft #8 to safety. The capsule flew to an apogee of 7.2 km and downrange only 1.8 km. The flight of the Mercury capsule lasted 7 minutes and 19 seconds, {{most of that time}} descending on its parachute. The spacecraft was recovered some 20 minutes after launch in the Atlantic Ocean and reused on the next flight (MA-4) as spacecraft No. 8A. One comforting fact to the Mercury team was that the flight verified the reliability of the <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> system (this was the first Mercury-Atlas launch with a live <b>escape</b> <b>tower).</b>|$|R
50|$|Since rockets {{carry the}} {{potential}} for fire or explosive destruction, space capsules generally employ some sort of <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> system, consisting either of a tower-mounted solid fuel rocket to quickly carry the capsule away from the launch vehicle (employed on Mercury, Apollo, and Soyuz), or else ejection seats (employed on Vostok and Gemini) to carry astronauts out of the capsule and away for individual parachute landing. The <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> is discarded at some point before the launch is complete, {{at a point where}} an abort can be performed using the spacecraft's engines.|$|R
25|$|Gemini's {{emergency}} <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> {{system did}} not use an <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned {{that they could do}} away with it as the Titan II's hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after launch, {{recovery}} crews {{began searching}} a region from the Badain Jaran Desert in Inner Mongolia to Shaanxi for the <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower,</b> booster rockets, first stage and payload fairing. Of particular interest was the [...] "black box" [...] of the rocket, which contained telemetry {{that may not}} have been downlinked during the launch phase. It was found 45 minutes after launch somewhere near Otog Banner. It was first sighted by a herdswoman, Lian Hua, about 1.5 km from her home. Other wreckage from the launch was found and destroyed at its impact location or brought back to Jiuquan.|$|E

40|$|In 2007, the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) {{initiated}} the Max Launch Abort System Project to explore crew escape system concepts {{designed to be}} fully encapsulated within an aerodynamic fairing and smoothly integrated onto a launch vehicle. One objective of this design {{was to develop a}} more compact <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> vehicle that eliminated the need for an <b>escape</b> <b>tower,</b> as was used in the Mercury and Apollo escape systems and what is planned for the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV). The benefits for the launch vehicle of eliminating a <b>tower</b> from the <b>escape</b> vehicle design include lower structural weights, reduced bending moments during atmospheric flight, and a decrease in induced aero-acoustic loads. This paper discusses the development of encapsulated, towerless <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> vehicle concepts, especially as it pertains to the flight performance and systems analysis trade studies conducted to establish mission feasibility and assess system-level performance. Two different towerless escape vehicle designs are discussed in depth: one with allpropulsive control using liquid attitude control thrusters, and a second employing deployable aft swept grid fins to provide passive stability during coast. Simulation results are presented for a range of nominal and off-nominal escape conditions...|$|R
50|$|Little Joe 5 was an {{unmanned}} atmospheric {{test flight}} of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted {{as part of the}} U.S. Mercury program. The objective was to test a production Mercury capsule (#3) and the <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> System during an ascent abort at maximum dynamic pressure. The mission was launched November 8, 1960, from Wallops Island, Virginia. Sixteen seconds after liftoff, the escape rocket and the tower jettison rocket both fired prematurely. Furthermore, the booster, capsule and <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> failed to separate as intended. The entire stack was destroyed on impact with the Atlantic Ocean. The Little Joe 5 flew to an apogee of 10.1 miles (16.2 km) and a range of 13 miles (20.9 km). Some capsule and booster debris was recovered from the ocean floor for post flight analysis.|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} {{objective was to}} make observations of the ground from the spacecraft; returning the spacecraft to automatic control, Shepard {{found that he was}} able to distinguish major land masses from clouds easily, and could make out coastlines, islands and major lakes, but had difficulty identifying cities. He had problems working with the spacecraft periscope - early Mercury capsules had a small periscope rather than a viewing window - and had to abandon an attempt to change optical filters on it after noticing that a pressure gauge on his wrist kept bumping the lever that would have activated the <b>Launch</b> <b>Escape</b> System. Although the <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> was long gone and pressing on the lever probably wouldn't do anything, Shepard still didn't want to risk it in case something unexpected happened.|$|R
5000|$|Pad abort: If {{the rocket}} {{failed in the}} last five minutes before launch, the CM and the launch escape system (LES, see figure) would {{separate}} from the remainder of the rocket below with the LES propelling itself and the CM beneath it upward and eastward to the sea using a small solid-fueled motor (the launch escape motor) {{at the top of the}} tower on the launch escape system. The <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> would then be jettisoned in anticipation of the parachute deployment and the CM would splash down. (Preparation for a pad abort is seen in Apollo video footage: five minutes before launch, the umbilical arm connecting to the CM retracts and swings clear of the rocket. It does so because the swing arm must be out of the way in case the EDS decides to abort.) ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1958, the United States {{announced}} Project Mercury, {{with the}} goal of sending men into low Earth orbit, and selected a group of seven astronauts to pilot them. The single-man capsule was designed and patented by a team led by Maxime Faget. [...] The McDonnell Aircraft company won the contract to build Mercury. The cone-shaped capsule was 6 ft in diameter with a blunt-body heat shield at the base. Total capsule length was 10.8 ft, including a retrorocket pack strapped over the heat shield. The heaviest capsule had a gross weight of 3000 lb, and was capable of just over one day of orbital flight. A 24.1 ft-long <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> was connected to the nose of the capsule at launch, containing a solid-fueled rocket capable of carrying the capsule away from the launch vehicle in case of an emergency. Capsules for suborbital flights used a radiative heat shield made of beryllium and were launched with the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle. Orbital capsules used an ablative heat shield made of fiberglass embedded in an aluminum honeycomb matrix, and were launched with the Atlas LV-3B.|$|E

40|$|The NASA Engineering and Safety Center {{initiated}} the Max Launch Abort System (MLAS) Project to investigate alternate crew escape system concepts that eliminate the conventional <b>launch</b> <b>escape</b> <b>tower</b> by integrating the escape system into an aerodynamic fairing that fully encapsulates the crew capsule and smoothly integrates with the launch vehicle. This paper proposes an ascent abort flight test for an all-propulsive towerless escape system concept that is actively controlled and sized {{to accommodate the}} Orion Crew Module. The goal of the flight test is to demonstrate a high dynamic pressure escape and to characterize jet interaction effects during operation of the attitude control thrusters at transonic and supersonic conditions. The flight-test vehicle is delivered to the required test conditions by a booster configuration selected to meet cost, manufacturability, and operability objectives. Data return is augmented through judicious design of the boost trajectory, which is optimized to obtain data at a range of relevant points, rather than just a single flight condition. Secondary flight objectives are included after the escape to obtain aerodynamic damping data for the crew module and to perform a high-altitude contingency deployment of the drogue parachutes. Both 3 - and 6 -degree-of-freedom trajectory simulation results are presented that establish concept feasibility, and a Monte Carlo uncertainty assessment is performed to provide confidence that test objectives can be met...|$|E
