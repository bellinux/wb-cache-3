5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery <b>light-reflecting</b> pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
25|$|Chromatophores are pigment-containing and <b>light-reflecting</b> cells, {{or groups}} of cells, found {{in a wide range}} of animals {{including}} amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} diffuse {{reflectance}} methodology for quantifying minerals in powdered iron ores, which is a key quality control requirement for these materials. Selected samples ranging widely in their concentrations of hematite (as specularite and martite), goethite, magnetite, and quartz were collected in mines from the Iron Quadrangle, Minas Gerais State, and also in the Carajás region, Pará State, Brazil. A chemometric analysis based on the concentrations of the different minerals as determined with a combination of conventional methods (chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, <b>light-reflected</b> microscopy, and magnetic susceptibility) and the principal components derived from the diffuse reflectance spectra in the visible range was performed. Principal component regression analysis provided successful calibration for the concentrations of goethite (r 2 = 0. 94; standard error of validation (SEv) = 4. 2 %) and hematite (r 2 = 0. 89; SEv = 7. 4 %), in addition to good estimates for quartz (r 2 = 0. 83; SEv = 7. 4 %), specularite (r 2 = 0. 80; SEv = 11. 6 %), and martite (r 2 = 0. 78; SEv = 10. 6 %). Our results suggest that diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is a promising tool for the simultaneous determination of minerals in iron ores within a few minutes only...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrganic {{petrography}} and geochemical analyses {{have been}} carried out on the shales, carbonaceous shales and coals of the Shemshak Group (Upper Triassic-Middle Jurassic) from fifteen localities along the Alborz Range of Northern Iran. Organic matter (OM) has been investigated using Rock-Eval pyrolysis, elemental analysis of kerogen, vitrinite reflectance (VRr) and Thermal Alteration Index (TAI). Reflectance of autochthonous vitrinite varies from 0. 6 to 2. 2 % indicating thermally early mature to over mature OM in the Shemshak Group, in agreement with other maturity parameters used. The shales of the Shemshak Group are characterized by poor to moderate residual organic carbon contents (0. 25 to 8. 5 %) and the presence of hydrogen-depleted OM, predominantly as a consequence of petroleum generation and of oxidation of OM. According to <b>light-reflected</b> microscopy results vitrinite/vitrinite-like macerals are dominant in the kerogens concentrated from the shaly facies. The coals and carbonaceous shales of the Shemshak Group show a wide range in organic carbon concentration (3. 5 to 88. 6 %) and composition (inertinite- and vitrinite-rich types), and thereby different petroleum potentials. Among the studied sections only the coals and carbonaceous shales of the Hive locality show good residual petroleum potential and may still generate oil. Thermal modelling results suggest that low to moderate paleo-heat flow, ranging from 47 to 79 mW. m- 2 (57 mW. m- 2 on average), affected the Central-Eastern Alborz. The maximum temperature which induced OM maturation of the Shemshak Group seems to be related to its deep burial rather than to a very strong heat flow related to an uppermost Triassic-Liassic rifting. The interval of petroleum generation in the most deeply buried part of the Shemshak Group (i. e., Tazareh section) corresponds to Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous times. Exhumation of the Alborz Range during Late Neogene time, especially along the axis of the Central-Eastern Alborz, where maxima of VRr values are recorded, probably destroyed possible petroleum accumulations. However on the northern flank of the Central-Eastern Alborz, preservation of petroleum accumulations may be better. The northern part of the basin therefore seems the best target for petroleum exploration...|$|R

2500|$|After {{several years}} of {{retirement}} from the fashion industry, French designer Thierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour. Knowles was attracted with {{his work at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, [...] "Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy" [...] (2008), where several of his haute couture pieces were on display. Knowles immediately {{fell in love with the}} costumes and wanted to use them on her tour after her mother and designer Tina Knowles influenced her decision. She met with Mugler in Paris in September and started exchanging ideas with him, further designing costumes which were inspired by her love of music and life. She hired him as the designer for the tour costumes in November, 2008. Speaking about her collaboration, Knowles said, [...] "The best part about this tour is I'm working with Thierry Mugler, who is an icon and a legend, and I've been a fan." [...] Mugler wanted to capture the duality between being a woman and a warrior and understand these two sides with [...] own perception of both aspects while creating the costumes for Knowles and using the words [...] "Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce" [...] as inspiration. He felt, [...] "Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyoncé's personality, she is Fierce on stage and Beyoncé in real life... Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality. On stage, there is Sasha Fierce and there is Beyoncé in her truest self." [...] He described the costumes as [...] "very elaborate" [...] and rooted in the songs' meanings. He conducted a 71-piece wardrobe for Knowles, her dancers and the band for the tour. For the shows, Knowles had ten different looks which were noted to be [...] "fierce" [...] as her onstage alter ego. She wore [...] "ferocious power-glam superheroine outfits for a one-two punch of femininity and fierceness". American fashion designer Chris March also collaborated with Knowles during the tour helping Mugler in the process of creating the costumes and making them usable for stage purposes as his expertise was execution of outfits. On July 23, 2009, March filled a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Knowles' look captured a duality of soft and hard, combining bows with metal and incorporating fishnets, mismatched gloves and power shoulders into costumes that mirror Knowles' lyrics about [...] "all the single women" [...] femme fatales and power brokers in a [...] "high-tech Blade Runner world" [...] as stated by Michael Quintanilla of San Antonio Express-News. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the wardrobe designs consisted of a variety of gold sparkly leotards, all form-fitting, <b>light-reflecting</b> and leg-baring. Knowles also wore leopard-print pants and glow-in-the-dark bra with a blinking beacon affixed to her body.

50|$|Colour is {{determined}} by <b>light-reflecting</b> chemical particles, pigments, in the paint. These particles can have very different physical sizes, {{as shown in the}} diagram in figure 1.2. In this example, the black pigments are the small black dots; red pigments are larger spheres, while the yellow pigments are acicular. This combination of pigments produces the original brown colour. The upper diagram has had no weathering, and the surface is still smooth and undamaged. The lower diagram shows the painted surface after weathering has occurred. The surface has eroded with significant loss of the black and red pigments from the surface layer. The pitted surface scatters light, therefore reducing the gloss and creating the chalky affect. The larger acicular yellow pigments are more difficult to remove, resulting in a colour change towards a more yellowy appearance. Weather testing was paramount in discovering this mechanism. Pigment composition has recently been modified to help minimise this effect.|$|E
