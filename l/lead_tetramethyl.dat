50|$|Tetramethyllead, {{also called}} tetra methyllead and <b>lead</b> <b>tetramethyl,</b> is a {{chemical}} compound {{used as an}} antiknock additive for gasoline. Its use is being phased out for environmental considerations.|$|E
40|$|Of {{the several}} major {{developments}} that {{have provided the}} framework for progress in chemical kinetics since the first kinetic study of a reaction in 1850 (1), probably none has played a more prominent part than the introduction of free radical chain concepts. The existence of free radicals was first demonstrated by Gomberg in 1900 (2) in his classioal identification of the triphenylmethyl radical in solutions of hexaphenyl ethane. It remained for H. S. Taylor, 25 years later, to suggest that simple radioals, such as C 2 H 5, might function as chain carriers in chemical reactions (3). He reacted ethylene with hydrogen atoms and round more ethane produced than would be expected {{from the number of}} hydrogen atoms available. He postulated the chain mechanism. H + C 2 H 4 → C 2 H 5; H 2 + C 2 H 5 → C 2 H 6 + H. The possible validity of the suggestion received support from the well-known demonstration by Paneth and Hofeditz (4) that such simple radicals., in particular the methyl radical, had an appreciable lifetime. They showed that methyl radicals, produced by the thermal decomposition of <b>lead</b> <b>tetramethyl,</b> could be detected with metallic mirrors placed in the path of a stream of methyl radicals in a carrier gas. This was followed by a program of research by F. O. Rice and collaborators (5) which showed that the thermal decomposition of many organic vapours yielded free radicals as intermediate products.

40|$|Accidental human {{exposure}} to {{a high level of}} <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> is described. <b>Tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> is blended with petrol as an antiknock agent, and it has similar physical properties to tetraethyl lead. The patient had high levels of lead in urine, averaging 4 - 75 mumol (983 mug) daily for the first four days after exposure and he continued to have raised levels of urinary lead for six months. He had no symptoms or physical signs of lead poisoning and comparisons are made between this case and previously reported cases of poisoning by tetraethyl lead. In the cases of tetraethyl lead poisoning all the patients had symptoms, some severe, yet in no instance did the urinary lead levels approach those described in this patient. The effects of chelation therapy with calcium disodium versenate are discussed and the results are similar to those found in tetraethyl lead poisoning. Blood lead levels of up to 3 - 91 mumol/l (81 mug/ 100 g) occurred but these levels were not raised commensurate with the urinary lead output. The levels of deltaaminolaevulinic acid (ALA) in the urine were not significantly raised and this report shows that the urinary lead levels give a better guide to the degree of absorption of <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> compared with the blood lead or urinary ALA levels. The report illustrates that <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> is less toxic to man than tetraethyl lead...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The special {{property}} of lead to increase engine performance by preventing self-ignition {{was discovered in}} the early 1920 s. Lead additives in gasoline, such as tetraethyl <b>lead</b> and <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead,</b> solved the combustion problems of Otto engines. Higher-compression engines could be produced {{and the use of}} leaded gasoline increased enormously all over the world. In the 1960 s, increased automobile traffic resulted in air pollution problems in high-income countries. While the United States reacted quickly to this challenge and passed the "Clean Air Act Amendments" in 1963, {{it was not until the}} 1970 s that environmental legislation was enacted in Europe. In those years, environmental damage was perceived in some European countries as a potential risk to human health. Reducing air pollution was one of the main topics in the initial development of environmental policies which concluded with gasoline lead content regulations. In the "lead study" conducted at the Institute for Co...|$|R

30|$|Today, {{there is}} a {{consensus}} to enhance fuels quality to reduce their detrimental impacts {{on the environment and}} human health [1]. As a result, restrictions are imposed on gasoline to reduce its benzene, cyclic compounds, heavy aromatics, and olefin concentrations along with the removal of <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> [2]. However, the octane number of aromatics and olefins is relatively high, so reducing their concentration in gasoline causes a decrease in octane number and, consequently, fuel quality [3, 4]. Therefore, the process of isomerization is gaining significant attention in the petroleum refineries to increase the fuel octane number [5]. However, the process mainly depends on the catalysts and how efficient they are in their activity and selectivity [2].|$|R
40|$|A radical is {{a species}} with an {{unpaired}} electron. The classical research papers of Gomberg 1 on the triphenylmethyl radical (I) (reaction 1 and 2), {{and the study}} by Lund and [diagram] Bodenstein 2 (1906) of the H 2 an Br 2 hain reaction, mark thebeginning of organic free-radical chemistry. Radical kinetics openedup with the radical-mirror removal experiments of Paneth et. al. 3 (1929) (reaction 3) and others. 4. [diagram] (3) The pyrolysis of <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> (900 [...] 1200 °K; 1 s, residence in quartz furnace) produced species (methyl radicals) which were capable of removing mirrors of lead, antimony and zinc.

40|$|Background and objective: Lead {{poisoning}} {{have been}} reported from {{many parts of the}} world. They are one of global clinical problem that effect all body organs and many deaths every year. This review was done to survey toxicological aspects of lead compounds Methods: The data bank used in this study is web of science, scopus, pubmed, pubmed central, SID. The keywords are Alzheimerâ��s Disease, medical plants, acetylcholine, antioxidant. Findings: Metallic lead is used industrial, organic lead eg., tetraethyl and <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> in gasoline additives to prevent engine knock, and inorganic lead salts combined with other elements. Majority of absorptive lead through the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Lead compounds can lead to clinical manifestation in neurologic system, hematopoietic, kidneys, cardiovascular, reproduction, bones. There are tests available to diagnose poisoning by measuring lead in blood, urine, hair and fingernails. Patients of lead toxicity need to decontamination (GI tract irrigation), supportive cares, use traditional and new chelating agents to combination therapy, also antioxidants, vitamins, and nanoparticle. Conclusion: Based on the survey, it is recommended to detect contaminated areas and consider an educational plan for the exposed people to prevention of lead poisoning.

50|$|Ships {{entering}} the harbour in Table Bay {{from the east}} coast of Africa have to round the coast at Sea Point and over the years many of them have been wrecked on the reefs just off-shore. In May 1954, during a great storm, the Basuto Coast (246 tonnes) ended up on the rocks within a few metres of the concrete wall of the promenade. A fireman who came to the assistance of the crew was swept off the wall of the swimming pool adjacent to the promenade by waves and was never seen again. The vessel was soon thereafter salvaged for scrap. In July 1966 a large cargo ship, the S.A. Seafarer, was stranded on the rocks only a couple of hundred metres from the Three Anchor Bay beach. The stranding was the cause of one of Cape Town's earliest great environmental scares, owing to the cargo including drums of <b>tetramethyl</b> <b>lead</b> and tetraethyl lead, volatile and highly toxic compounds that in those days were added to motor fuels as an anti-knocking agent. The ship was gradually destroyed by the huge swells that habitually roll in from the south Atlantic. Salvage from the ship can still be found in local antique shops.|$|R
40|$|No toxicokinetic {{data were}} {{identified}} that estimated {{the degree of}} absorption of TML following dermal exposure; however, a model predicted TML to be absorbed following skin contact. An ALD of 6, 203 mg/kg [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company 1959, 1991] and a MLD of 4, 000 were identified, indicating that TML can be absorbed by the skin but were above the critical dermal LD 50 value of 2, 000 mg/kg body weight that identifies chemical substances {{with the potential for}} acute dermal toxicity. Based on the results of the model prediction, and because virtually identical effects were produced by the oral, cutaneous, and inhalation routes of exposure to TML [Schepers 1964], the potency of the substance was evaluated following repeated or prolonged exposure via other exposure routes (i. e., oral) in animals. TML at very low doses caused liver and neuronal damage in rats in an oral exposure study [Schepers 1964], indicating that the potential exists for dermal exposure to cause similar effects as observed in the oral study. No epidemiological investigations or experimental animal studies were identified that evaluated the potential for TML to cause direct skin effects or skin sensitization. Therefore, {{on the basis of these}} assessments, TML is assigned a composite skin notation of SK: SYS. Table 3 summarizes the skin hazard designations for TML previously issued by NIOSH and other organizations. No Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of classification and labeling of chemicals dermal classification for TML was located [European Parliament 2008]. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Suggested citation: NIOSH [2017].
