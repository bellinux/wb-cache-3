5|$|A <b>lepton</b> is an elementary, half-integer spin {{particle}} {{that does}} not undergo strong interactions but {{is subject to the}} Pauli exclusion principle; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Electrons are stable and the most common charged <b>lepton</b> in the Universe, whereas muons and taus are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions, such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|The photon is {{the gauge}} boson for electromagnetism, and {{therefore}} all other quantum {{numbers of the}} photon (such as <b>lepton</b> number, baryon number, and flavour quantum numbers) are zero. Also, the photon does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lepton</b> epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the <b>lepton</b> epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leptons</b> are {{particles}} of spin-, {{meaning that they}} are fermions. They carry an electric charge of −1 e (charged <b>leptons)</b> or 0 e (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, <b>leptons</b> do not carry colour charge, meaning {{that they do not}} experience the strong interaction. <b>Leptons</b> also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the weak interaction. <b>Leptons</b> are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.|$|R
40|$|Events {{containing}} several <b>leptons</b> {{are useful}} probes of new phenomena {{due to the}} low background from Standard Model processes. We look for anomalous production of prompt like-sign <b>leptons</b> or events with three or more <b>leptons,</b> as well as search for excited <b>leptons,</b> heavy <b>leptons</b> and heavy neutrinos. The searches use data recorded in 2012 at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC...|$|R
50|$|Sterile neutrinos may {{be neutral}} heavy <b>leptons</b> (NHLs), also called Heavy Neutral <b>Leptons</b> (HNLs).|$|R
25|$|For every <b>lepton</b> flavor {{there is}} a {{corresponding}} type of antiparticle, known as an antilepton, that differs from the <b>lepton</b> only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. According to certain theories, neutrinos may be their own antiparticle. It is not currently known whether this is the case.|$|E
25|$|For each neutrino, {{there also}} exists a {{corresponding}} antiparticle, called an antineutrino, {{which also has}} half-integer spin and no electric charge. They are distinguished from the neutrinos by having opposite signs of <b>lepton</b> number and chirality. To conserve total <b>lepton</b> number, in nuclear beta decay, electron neutrinos appear together with only positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, and electron antineutrinos with electrons or electron neutrinos.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} mass of the tau <b>lepton</b> there will be {{left-right}} mixing of the stau {{similar to that of}} stop and sbottom (see above).|$|E
40|$|Final {{states with}} exactly three <b>leptons,</b> four <b>leptons,</b> two same-sign <b>leptons,</b> two opposite-sign-same-flavor <b>leptons</b> plus two jets, and two opposite-sign <b>leptons</b> {{inconsistent}} with Z boson decay, are studied using a data sample consisting {{of an integrated}} luminosity of 19. 5 fb^- 1 of proton-proton collision data collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at √(s) = 8 TeV. The observed event rates are in agreement with expectations from the standard model. The results are used to set limits on the direct production of charginos, neutralinos, and sleptons...|$|R
40|$|We {{search for}} signs of new physics in events with multi-leptonic final states in 9. 2 fb− 1 of protonproton {{collisions}} at √s = 8 TeV with the CMS experiment [1]. The final states under study comprise exactly three <b>leptons,</b> four <b>leptons,</b> a pair of same-sign <b>leptons,</b> two opposite-sign-same-flavor <b>leptons</b> plus jets, and two opposite- sign <b>leptons</b> which have a mass outside the Z-boson decay window.

25|$|Recent {{tests of}} <b>lepton</b> {{universality}} in B meson decays, {{performed by the}} LHCb, BaBar and Belle experiments, have shown consistent deviations from the Standard Model predictions. However the statistical significance is not yet high enough to claim an observation of new physics.|$|E
25|$|The tau <b>lepton</b> is a {{negatively}} charged elementary particle with {{a lifetime of}} 2.9×10−13 s and a mass of 1,777 MeV/c2. It was detected {{in a series of}} experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl with his colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Because the <b>lepton</b> number {{conservation}} law {{in fact is}} {{violated by}} chiral anomalies, there are problems applying this symmetry universally over all energy scales. However, the quantum number B − L {{is much more likely}} to work and is seen in different models such as the Pati–Salam model.|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} the general pion-nucleon SU(2) Lagrangian including both virtual photons and <b>leptons</b> for relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to fourth order.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the production and}} signatures of a single, pair of heavy-exotic <b>leptons</b> via the electron-positron induced process {{and a pair of}} heavy exotic <b>leptons</b> via the Drell-Yan process at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that the cross-section for the case of the production of heavy pair exotic <b>leptons</b> are competitive with the ones for the single production of exotic <b>leptons.</b> We also exhibit some kinematical distributions.

40|$|We {{consider}} an SU(3) _L⊗ U(1) _N {{model for the}} electroweak interactions which includes extra charged <b>leptons</b> which do not mix with the known <b>leptons.</b> These new <b>leptons</b> couple to Z^ 0 only through vector currents. We consider constraints on the mass {{of one of these}} <b>leptons</b> coming from the Z^ 0 -width and from the muon (g- 2) factor. The last one is less restrictive than the former.

25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} is {{a quantum}} mechanical phenomenon whereby a neutrino created {{with a specific}} <b>lepton</b> flavor (electron, muon, or tau) can later be measured {{to have a different}} flavor. The probability of measuring a particular flavor for a neutrino varies between 3 known states as it propagates through space.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} {{of the control}} numbers {{at the back of}} the stamps is becoming a constant, except for the two smallest values, the 1 <b>lepton,</b> brown, and the 2 lepta, bistre.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{prospects}} for excluding or discovering vectorlike <b>leptons</b> using multilepton events at the LHC. We consider models in which the vectorlike <b>leptons</b> decay to tau <b>leptons.</b> If the vectorlike <b>leptons</b> are weak isosinglets, then discovery in multilepton states {{is found to be}} extremely challenging. For the case that the vectorlike <b>leptons</b> are weak isodoublet, we argue that there may be an opportunity for exclusion for masses up to about 275 GeV by direct searches with existing LHC data at sqrt{s}= 8 TeV. We also discuss prospects for exclusion or discovery at the LHC with future sqrt{s}= 13 TeV data. Comment: 36 pages. v 2 : references adde...|$|R
40|$|Excited <b>leptons</b> are {{searched for}} using the L 3 {{detector}} at LEP. The data collected at centre-of-mass energies {{in the range from}} 192 up to 202 GeV correspond to a total luminosity of 233 pb − 1. No evidence of either pair production of excited <b>leptons,</b> nor of single production is found. From the searches for pair produced excited <b>leptons,</b> lower mass limits close to the kinematic limit are set. From the searches for singly produced excited <b>leptons,</b> upper limits on their couplings are derived in the mass range up to 200 GeV. Several fundamental aspects of the Standard Model [1], such as the number of families and the fermion masses could be explained naturally in composite models where <b>leptons</b> and quarks have substructure [2 – 4]. The existence of excited <b>leptons</b> is a typical consequence of these models...|$|R
40|$|Events {{containing}} multiple <b>leptons</b> {{are useful}} probes of new phenomena {{due to the}} low background from Standard Model processes.

25|$|Leptons are spin- particles. The spin-statistics theorem thus {{implies that}} they are fermions and thus {{that they are}} subject to the Pauli {{exclusion}} principle: No two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time. Furthermore, it means that a <b>lepton</b> can have only two possible spin states, namely up or down.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of the leptons {{to gauge}} bosons are flavour-independent (i.e., {{the interactions between}} leptons and gauge bosons are {{the same for all}} leptons). This property is called <b>lepton</b> universality and has been tested in measurements of the tau and muon lifetimes and of Z boson partial decay widths, particularly at the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) and Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) experiments.|$|E
25|$|In this expression, mi is the {{neutrino}} masses (of the ith mass eigenstate), and the Uei are {{elements of}} the <b>lepton</b> mixing Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) matrix. Therefore, observing neutrinoless double beta decay, in addition to confirming the Majorana neutrino nature, would give information on the absolute neutrino mass scale, potentially the neutrino mass hierarchy, and Majorana phases in the PMNS matrix.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the anomalous magnetic moment for muons at one loop level arising from left right symmetric excited <b>leptons</b> which are excited states of known standard model <b>leptons.</b> Such excited states arise in compositeness theories where the known <b>leptons</b> {{are assumed to}} be made of more fundamental particles. In this work, we assume that the excited <b>leptons</b> possess a left right symmetry also. We show that at the one loop level, the QED contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment from these excited <b>leptons</b> comes from only one Feynman diagram, which {{turns out to be a}} natural analog of the only diagram contributing to anomalous muon magnetic moment in the Standard Model.

25|$|The Standard Model {{contains}} {{at least}} three sources of CP violation. The first of these, involving the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix in the quark sector, has been observed experimentally and can only account for {{a small portion of}} the CP violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. The strong interaction should also violate CP, in principle, but the failure to observe the electric dipole moment of the neutron in experiments suggests that any CP violation in the strong sector is also too small to account for the necessary CP violation in the early universe. The third source of CP violation is the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix in the <b>lepton</b> sector. The current long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and NOνA, may be able to find evidence of CP violation over a small fraction of possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase while the proposed next-generation experiments, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE, will be sensitive enough to definitively observe CP violation over a relatively large fraction of possible values of the Dirac phase. Further into the future, a neutrino factory could be sensitive to nearly all possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase. If neutrinos are Majorana fermions, the PMNS matrix could have two additional CP violating Majorana phases, leading to a fourth source of CP violation within the Standard Model. The experimental evidence for Majorana neutrinos would be the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay. The best limits come from the GERDA experiment. CP violation in the <b>lepton</b> sector generates a matter-antimatter asymmetry through a process called leptogenesis. This could become the preferred explanation in the Standard Model for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe once CP violation is experimentally confirmed in the <b>lepton</b> sector.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} of parity violation in muon decay {{can be compared}} to the concept of violation of parity in weak interactions in general as an extension of The Wu Experiment, as well as the change of angular momentum introduced by a phase change of π corresponding to the charge-parity operator being invariant in this interaction. This fact is true for all <b>lepton</b> interactions in The Standard Model.|$|E
25|$|If CP {{violation}} in the <b>lepton</b> {{sector is}} experimentally {{determined to be}} too small to account for matter-antimatter asymmetry, some new physics beyond the Standard Model {{would be required to}} explain additional sources of CP violation. Fortunately, it is generally the case that adding new particles and/or interactions to the Standard Model introduces new sources of CP violation since CP is not a symmetry of nature.|$|E
