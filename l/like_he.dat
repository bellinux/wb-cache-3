Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did in the minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E

5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2010 {{with the goals}} of {{reworking}} the character Falco Lombardi to mechanically play <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did in Melee and increasing the accessibility of the gameplay style, but the project quickly evolved to a full-scale reworking of Brawl. The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Eric Young got his TNA X Division Championship {{match on}} the November 13 episode of Impact! against then-champion Sheik Abdul Bashir. Though he {{defeated}} {{him to become}} the new champion, a week later the decision was reversed and Young was forced to relinquish the title belt to Bashir due to a controversial ending to their match. Young and Bashir fought for the championship once again at Final Resolution, with referee Shane Sewell interfering in the bout <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had done in the previous encounter, which allowed Young to gain the victory. Afterwards, Management Director Jim Cornette stripped Young of the championship. This set up a tournament for the title, ending at Genesis where Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin to become the new champion.|$|E
5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just <b>like</b> <b>he</b> imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement factory level, {{while most of the}} console versions did not.

5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E

He assures her that their relationship won't end badly and the two go to the parade.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E

5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E

At one point, Tatanka looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was gaining control, as he began his usual war dance. Bigelow {{kicked him in the}} back of the head, however, to end his momentum. Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win.|$|E

5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was going to win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
5|$|Despite Harry's {{aunt and}} uncle's desperate {{prevention}} of Harry gleaning about his powers, their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, {{who is also}} his first contact with the Wizarding World. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts {{as well as some}} of Harry's history. Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who subsequently attempted to kill him as well. Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the Wizarding World. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and torturing him <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.|$|E
