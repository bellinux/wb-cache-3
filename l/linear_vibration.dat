40|$|Linear {{piezoelectric}} gauges, {{eddy current}} transducers and other control and measuring devices {{have been widely}} applied for vibration diagnostics of objects in industry. Methods based on such gauges and used for measuring angular and <b>linear</b> <b>vibrations</b> do not provide the possibility to assess a rotation center or point angle of an object. Parasitic oscillations may occur during rotor rotation {{and in some cases}} the oscillations are caused by dis-balance. The known methods for measuring angular and <b>linear</b> <b>vibrations</b> make it possible to detect the phenomenon and they do not provide information for balancing of the given object. For this very reason the paper describes a method for obtaining instantaneous rotation center in the vibrating object. It allows to improve informational content of the measurements owing to obtaining additional data on position of object rotation center. The obtained data can be used for balancing of a control object. Essence of the given method is shown by an example of piezoelectric gauges of <b>linear</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Two three-axial gauges are fixed to the investigated object. Then gauge output signals are recalculated in angular vibrations of the object (for this purpose it is necessary to know a distance between gauges). Further projection positions of the object rotation center are determined on three orthogonal planes. Instantaneous rotation center is calculated according to the position of one of the gauges. The proposed method permits to obtain data on <b>linear</b> and angular <b>vibrations</b> and rotation center position of the vibrating object using one system of linear gauge.

40|$|Objectives] Studying the {{influence}} of the system parameters of a quasi-zero stiffness isolator on vibration isolation performance can provide a key direction for the application of quasi-zero stiffness isolation in vibration isolation systems. [Methods] Based on a double layer vibration isolation system consisting of linear isolation and quasi-zero stiffness isolation, as well as an equivalent <b>linear</b> <b>vibration</b> isolation system with two degrees of freedom, dynamic models are separately established. Moreover, the average method is applied to derive the power transfer rate under the condition of two harmonic force excitation systems. It is proven that the double layer vibration isolation system has better vibration isolation performance than the equivalent <b>linear</b> <b>vibration</b> isolation system with two degrees of freedom, and a method for enhancing the vibration isolation effect of the double layer vibration isolation system is proposed. [Results] The results show that the power transfer rate of the double layer vibration isolation system is greater than 1 in the second order resonance frequency, which means that it has the effect of vibration isolation in the vicinity of resonance frequencies of the second order, which overcomes the shortcomings of the freedom <b>linear</b> <b>vibration</b> isolation system with two degrees of freedom.
