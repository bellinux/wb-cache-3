50|$|Magnet-assisted {{transfection}} is {{a relatively}} new and time-saving method to introduce nucleic acids into a target cell with increased efficiency. In particular, adherent mammalian cell lines and primary cell cultures show very high transfection rates. But also suspension cells and cells from other organisms can be successfully transfected.Further, a major advantage of the method is the mild treatment of the cells. Other methods might be limited by either possible cytotoxic effects of the lipidic transfection reagent (<b>lipofection)</b> or simply by the directly applied force on the cells (electroporation, 20-50% dead cells). In addition, the transfection efficiency is increased in numerous cases by the directed transport in a magnetic field, especially for low amounts of nucleic acids. In contrast, methods like <b>lipofection</b> offer only statistical hits between cargo and cells, because of the three-dimensional motion of cells and transfection aggregates in a liquid suspension. Magnet-assisted transfection can also be performed in the presence of serum, which is a further benefit. Currently, there are over 150 cells known to be successfully transfected. Additionally, synergistic effects in transfection efficiency can arise from the possible combination of <b>lipofection</b> and magnet-assisted transfection.In future, this technology might be also an alternative strategy to the currently used viral and non-viral vectors in gene-therapy and gene transfer.|$|E

40|$|The endothelial {{lining of}} the {{cardiovascular}} system is a target for cardiovascular gene therapy and anti-tumor genetic therapies in vascularized tumors. Nonviral vectors are amenable to large-scale production and are safer than viral vectors. However, the gene transfer efficiency of nonviral vectors is quite low compared to viral vectors, because they are made from engineered materials such as lipids or polymers that lack the targeting and delivery moieties of viral vectors. The shortcomings of nonviral vectors are only exacerbated in non-dividing or confluent cell types, such as endothelial cells. ^ To improve the efficiency of lipid-based nonviral vectors, a detailed understanding of the <b>lipofection</b> mechanism is necessary. A powerful method to {{understand the importance of}} host factors is loss-of-function analysis. RNA interference (RNAi) is a rapidly growing technique capable of silencing the expression of every gene in the human genome, which is transferable to loss-of-function mechanistic studies. ^ Here, we used RNAi to probe the mechanism of nonviral gene transfer to human aortic endothelial cells with two approaches. In the first approach, human lysosomal DNase II was silenced using shRNAs and siRNAs. Following the knock down of DNase II, we found no change in <b>lipofection</b> efficiency, which indicates that DNase II was not a significant barrier in our system. ^ In a second approach, we performed an RNAi-based high-throughput screen to determine the importance of 5, 520 genes on <b>lipofection.</b> Following confirmation studies, 33 genes, when silenced, improved <b>lipofection</b> with 1 or more siRNAs and 18 genes improved <b>lipofection</b> with 2 or more siRNAs.

Here we studied whether phospholipase D (PLD), an important enzyme responsible for phospholipid breakdown, was affected during <b>lipofection</b> of HepG 2 cells with a luciferase plasmid. Synthetic cholesterol (Chol) derivatives, including 3 β[L-ornithinamide-carbamoyl]Chol, [polyamidoamine-carbamoyl]Chol and 3 β[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane) -carbamoyl]Chol, and a cationic lipid, N-[1 -(2, 3 -dioleyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride were {{mixed with a}} helper lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine to form respective cationic liposomes.

Methods: In the current study, calcium phosphate (CaP), DEAE-dextran, superfect, electroporation and <b>lipofection</b> transfection methods were used to optimize delivery of a plasmid construct that expressed Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Transgene expression was detected by fluorescent microscopy and flowcytometry. Toxicities of the methods were estimated by trypan blue staining. In order to evaluate the density of the transfected gene, we used a plasmid construct that expressed the Stromal cell-Derived Factor- 1 (SDF- 1) gene and measured its expression by real-time PCR.

Therefore, miRNAs labeled with different fluorescent dyes were transfected into adherent and suspension cells using <b>lipofection</b> reagent. Then, the non-specific binding and its mechanism were investigated by flow cytometer and laser confocal microscopy. The results showed that miRNAs labeled with Cy 5 (cyanine fluorescent dye) could firmly bind to the surface of adherent cells (Hela) and suspended cells (K 562) even without <b>lipofection</b> reagent. The binding of miRNAs labeled with FAM (carboxyl fluorescein) to K 562 cells was obvious, but it was not significant in Hela cells. After lipofectamine reagent was added, most of the fluorescently labeled miRNAs binding to the surface of Hela cells were transfected into intra-cell because of the high transfection efficiency, however, most of them were still binding to the surface of K 562 cells. Moreover, the high-salt buffer which could destroy the electrostatic interactions did not affect the above-mentioned non-specific binding, but the organic solvent which could destroy the hydrophobic interactions eliminated it. These results implied that the fluorescent-labeled miRNAs could non-specifically bind to the cell surface by hydrophobic interaction. It would lead to significant errors in the estimation of transfection efficiency only according to the cellular fluorescence intensity. Therefore, other methods to evaluate the transfection efficiency and more appropriate fluorescent dyes should be used according to the cell types for the accuracy of results...|$|E

To build on our previous studies and to further characterize PLNP formulated from polycationic lipid (PCL) and cholesterol, we report here the synthesis of multigram quantities of PCL and employ analytical tools, such as Raman spectroscopy of single PLNP and live-cell imaging of <b>lipofection,</b> for the physicochemical characterization of PCL, PLNP, and the transfection process. Mass spectrometry demonstrates the characteristics of polymeric lipids. Raman spectrum of PCL reveals the polymeric structure of the polymers. The presence of cholesterol in PLNP formulation did not markedly change the Raman spectrum. PLNP-derived polyplexes exhibit Raman spectra very similar to PLNP except that the C-H out-of-plane deformation mode of the polymeric lipid is significantly suppressed, indicating the interaction with plasmid DNA. Zeta potential measurement indicates a large DNA-carrying capacity of PLNP and their stability for in vivo gene delivery. The live-cell fluorescent imaging dynamically shows that PLNP exerts transfection efficiency similar to lipofectamine in leading to early reporter gene expression in live hepatic cells. In conclusion, polylipid nanoparticles possess a high DNA carrying capacity and <b>lipofection</b> efficiency, rendering them suitable for testing in large animals.

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that cell-mediated gene therapy can be an interesting method to obtain intratumoral expression of therapeutic proteins. This paper explores {{the possibility of using}} transfected myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), derived from a murine cell line, as cellular vehicles for transporting plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) to tumors. Transfecting these cells via electroporation caused massive cell death. This was not due to electroporation-induced cell damage, but was mainly the result of the intracellular presence of plasmids. In contrast, pDNA transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (LF 2000) did not result in a significant loss of viability. Differences in delivery mechanism may explain the distinctive effects on cell viability. Indeed, electroporation is expected to cause a rapid and massive influx of pDNA resulting in cytosolic pDNA levels that most likely surpass the activation threshold of the intracellular DNA sensors leading to cell death. In contrast, a more sustained intracellular release of the pDNA is expected with LF 2000. After <b>lipofection</b> with LF 2000, 56 % of the MDSCs were transfected and transgene expression lasted for at least 24 h. Moreover, biologically relevant amounts of IL- 12 were produced by the MDSCs after <b>lipofection</b> with an IL- 12 encoding pDNA.

40|$|The {{artificial}} {{introduction of}} nucleic acids (NA) into mammalian cells (transfection) has become, in recent years, a well-established procedure in basic and applied research, which allowed {{the study of}} gene function and regulation. The advances in this area have made possible {{the use of these}} methods for gene-based medicines, which constitute alternative therapeutic approaches. One of the most prominent methods is <b>lipofection</b> that uses cationic liposome/NA complexes (a. k. a. lipoplexes) for the complexation, transport and release of therapeutic sequences into target cells. Although yielding lower transfection efficiencies compared with viral gene delivery, <b>lipofection</b> vectors are much safer for medical applications because no significant mutational or toxicological risk exist. Dioctadecyldimethylammonium Bromide (DODAB) /Monoolein (MO) liposomes have recently been described as a new promising alternative to common transfection reagents, due to the pioneering application of MO as helper lipid in lipoplex formulations. In this chapter, we will review the effect of MO on the physicochemical properties of DODAB/MO liposomes and pDNA/DODAB/MO lipoplexes. How lipoplex properties may affect the interaction with different extracellular components and their cell uptake and trafficking will be discussed. The importance of lipoplex biocompatibility towards efficient gene therapy will also be approached presenting pDNA/DODAB/MO system as a lipoplex model, supporting the use of MO as new helper lipid in <b>lipofection.</b> FCTCOMPETEThis work was supported by FCT research project PTDC/QUI/ 69795 / 2006, which is cofunded by the program COMPETE from QREN with co-participation from the European Community fund FEDER; CFUM [PEst-C/FIS/UI 0607 / 2011]; CBMA [Pest C/BIA/UI 4050 / 2011]; J.

40|$|New nanotechnological {{products}} containing nano-sized particles (NPs) {{are already}} {{present in the}} market, but the results of nanotoxicological tests are not exhaustive and sometimes contradictory. The cytotoxicity tests ruled by chemical standards appear inadequate for the NPs very peculiar adhesive superficial properties that make their handling difficult and not immediately controllable. The present study highlights a new strategy to set up meaningful in-vitro tests to assess cells massive NPs uptake. A new approach was developed to obtain homogenous dispersion of NPs in-vitro. A lipid-based transfection technique (<b>lipofection)</b> was evaluated in two different cell lines: a mouse fibroblast embryonic cell line (NIH/ 3 T 3) and a human hepatoblastoma derived cells (HEP-G 2), using gold (Au), iron (Fe 3 O 4), cobalt oxide (Co) and cerium oxide (CeO 2) NPs. The results indicate that after massive entrance of NPs due the <b>lipofection</b> technique, cells showed a stimulus in the proliferation, except for Co NPs. The technique may represent an innovative approach to perform toxicity tests, inducing a homogeneous NPs exposure. Further studies should be carried out to validate and improve this method...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} <b>lipofection</b> treatment and exogenous DNA uptake {{on the quality of}} sahiwal cattle spermatozoa. Materials and Methods: Semen collected from sahiwal bulls (n= 7) were evaluated separately for color, volume, mass activity, concentration, motility and viability using standard procedures. Pooled sperm samples from selected bulls (n= 3) were transfected with a model gene construct enhanced green fluorescent protein (p-EGFP) via <b>lipofection</b> method and confirmed the genome integration by PCR technique. Furthermore the effect of transfection on spermatozoa was assessed based on apotosis, viability and motility. Results: In the current investigation sahiwal bulls were selected based on their breeding records and better semen characteristics. Although the transfected sperm samples failed to show florescence under fluorescence microscope, PCR studies confirmed the successful uptake of the p-EGFP gene in to the host sperm cell genome. Moreover transfected samples showed a significant reduction in the viability and motility without causing any DNA damage induced apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA Ladder assay.

40|$|AbstractMost of the {{cationic}} lipids {{used for}} gene transfer experiments drastically lose their efficiency {{in the presence}} of serum. We used a cationic lipid with a spermine head group and its fluorescent analog to study the cellular uptake and the intracellular fate of lipoplexes in the presence and absence of serum. We found that the amount of DNA and lipid taken up by the cells was not related to the efficacy of the gene transfer. When the <b>lipofection</b> was performed {{in the presence of}} serum, lipoplexes were contained within small intracellular vesicles. In the absence of serum, the vesicles were larger and heterogeneous in size and shape. By analysis of their size distribution, we showed that lipoplexes preformed in the absence of serum tended to aggregate. This aggregation was inhibited in the presence of serum. We used a carbonate formulation that led to the preformation of large particles: those large particles gave a high <b>lipofection</b> efficiency in the presence of serum and their intracellular distribution was identical to that observed in the absence of serum...|$|E
