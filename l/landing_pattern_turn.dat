40|$|Background Tibial stress {{fracture}} {{is a common}} injury in runners. This condition {{has been associated with}} increased impact loading. Since vertical loading rates are related to the <b>landing</b> <b>pattern,</b> many heelstrike runners attempt to modify their footfalls for a lower risk of tibial {{stress fracture}}. Such effect of modified <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> remains unknown. This study examined the immediate effects of <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> modification on the probability of tibial stress fracture. Methods Fourteen experienced heelstrike runners ran on an instrumented treadmill and they were given augmented feedback for <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> switch. We measured their running kinematics and kinetics during different <b>landing</b> <b>patterns.</b> Ankle joint contact force and peak tibial strains were estimated using computational models. We used an established mathematical model to determine the effect of <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> on stress fracture probability. Findings Heelstrike runners experienced greater impact loading immediately after <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> switch (P 0. 986). Interpretation Immediate transitioning of the <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> in heelstrike runners may not offer timely protection against tibial stress fracture, despite a reduction of impact loading. Long-term effects of <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> switch remains unknown. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} supporting that habitual barefoot runners {{are able to}} disperse impact loading rates by <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> modification. Yet, case studies suggested that barefoot running may result in severe running injuries, such as metatarsal and calcaneal stress fractures. Injuries {{may be due to}} a difference in biomechanical response between habitual and novice barefoot runners. This study investigated the initial effects of barefoot running in habitual shod runners in terms of <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> modification and vertical loading rates. Thirty habitual shod runners (mean age 25. 5 ± 5. 2 years; 18 men; with a minimum running mileage of 30 km per week for at least one year) ran on an instrumented treadmill at 10 km/h shod and barefoot in a randomized order. Vertical average (VALR) and instantaneous loading rates (VILR) were obtained by established methods. <b>Landing</b> <b>pattern</b> was presented as a ratio between the number of footfalls with a heelstrike and the total step number. Twenty participants demonstrated an automatic transition to a non-heelstrike landing during barefoot running, whereas a mixed <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> was observed in 10 participants. Compared to shod running, both VALR and VILR were significantly reduced during barefoot running (p <. 021). In the subgroup analysis, VALR for the shod condition was significantly higher than barefoot running, regardless of the <b>landing</b> <b>pattern.</b> VALR for the non-heelstrike pattern during barefoot running was significantly lower than participants with a mixed <b>landing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Conversely, we observed two participants who completely altered their <b>landing</b> <b>patterns,</b> presented high VALR and VILR values. Habitual shod runners presented lower loading rates during barefoot running but their <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> transitions were not uniform. Novice barefoot runners with a mixed <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> may sustain higher loading rates, compared with those who completely avoided heelstrike pattern. However, a complete <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> modification may not guarantee lower loading rates. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|The Master thesis {{focuses on}} <b>land</b> <b>patterns,</b> as {{proposed}} by Ilešič (1950), with the particular focus on their occurrences in the selected regional classifications of Slovenia. The analysis covers four natural geographical classifications of Slovenia, done by geographers Melik (1954 – 1960), Ilešič (1968), Gams (1983) and Gabrovec et. al. (1995), {{as well as the}} regional distribution of landscape types in Slovenia, done by the Institute for Landscape architecture of the Biotechnical Faculty at the University of Ljubljana (1997). The thesis first introduces and cartographically presents all eight <b>land</b> <b>patterns</b> and five selected regional classifications of Slovenia. Following this, are the analyses of the individual regional units in view of <b>land</b> <b>patterns</b> and their graphical and numerical representations. Here, the author calculates the areas and ratios of the individual <b>land</b> <b>patterns</b> in the regional units. On the basis of the ratio of matching between the prevailing <b>land</b> <b>pattern</b> and the border of a regional unit, the author determines that the best match between the selected regional classifications and <b>land</b> <b>patterns</b> occurs in the Melik’s natural geographical classification of Slovenia (1954 – 1960). The author further determines that the best match between the borders of the regional units and <b>land</b> <b>patterns</b> occurs in the areas of Lendavske Gorice, Goričko and Goriška Brda, and that among the <b>land</b> <b>patterns,</b> these give the best matches with the borders of the regional units of the transitional form between parties called »grude« and parties called »delci«...|$|R

40|$|Many urban areas, in both {{developed}} and developing countries, {{have been subject to}} the forces of relatively uncontrolled expansion and sprawl. While the political, social and economic drivers of sprawl may not affect urban areas identically, all urban areas rely on suburban, rural, and other less densely settled lands to supply the resources necessary for their existence. Sprawling <b>land</b> <b>patterns</b> have changed the regional balance between land dedicated to resource consumption (urban areas) and resource production (rural areas), a balance essential for the long-term sustainability of human systems. In this context, it is critical for the long-term vitality of urban areas to ensure that resource consumptive and productive <b>land</b> <b>patterns</b> are in balance.

40|$|Sustainable <b>land</b> use <b>patterns</b> are {{ecological}} and economic prerequisites of regional sustainable development. This {{is especially true}} for arid lands, where the environment is wholly fragile thanks to extremely limited precipitation, and where human activities have greatly transformed natural desert system by clearing natural vegetation, expanding oases and even building dams on inland rivers. However, the current studies on <b>land</b> use <b>patterns</b> are still characterized by field investigations and case studies, with almost no solid scientific basis. This paper holds that land types and their combination patterns are the principal basis for designing sustainable <b>land</b> use <b>patterns,</b> and that GIS and RS-based large-scale land type mapping and the study of their spatial combination structures should be coordinated with the demand of social development. The existing environmental problems induced by irrational land use mostly result from their deviation from the natural properties of land types.

This study examined the effect of surface inclination on vertical loading rates and <b>landing</b> <b>pattern</b> during the first attempt of barefoot running among habitual shod runners. Twenty habitual shod runners were asked to run on treadmill at 8. 0 [*]km/h at three inclination angles (0 °; + 10 °; − 10 °) with and without their usual running shoes. Vertical average rate (VALR) and instantaneous loading rate (VILR) were obtained by established methods. <b>Landing</b> <b>pattern</b> was decided using high-speed camera.

In this study, microbial community compositions were investigated in a red soil with different long-term <b>land</b> utilization <b>patterns</b> to understand the potential effects of cultivation and vegetation successions on relevant soil functions. Materials and methods <b>Land</b> utilization <b>patterns</b> include restoration, degradation (logging), cropland, and pine plantation. Both DNA- and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) -based methods were used to measure the abundance and community structure of microorganisms. Results and discussion In general, DNA- and PLFA-based methods showed similar results of microbial composition, but for some parameters, only one approach showed significant differences between different <b>land</b> utilization <b>patterns.</b> <b>Land</b> utilization <b>patterns</b> showed significant effects on abundance of total microbial community, bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes which were all lowest in the cropland plot either by PLFA or DNA analyses. 17 : 0 cyclo/ 16 : 1 ? 7 c and 19 : 0 cyclo/ 18 : 1 ? 7 c which are possibly associated with environmental stresses also varied among different <b>land</b> utilization <b>patterns.</b> Both PLFA and T-RFLP analyses showed that each <b>land</b> utilization <b>pattern</b> possessed a specific microbial community structure.
