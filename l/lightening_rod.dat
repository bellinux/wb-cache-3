50|$|The brick {{magazine}} {{was used as}} a hall by the local community between the wars, and a photograph, possibly from this period or post World War II, shows a timber skillion extension to {{the east side of the}} magazine building. At this time the ridge ventilator, lightning rods and copper earthing straps were still in place. The <b>lightening</b> <b>rod</b> assembly reportedly survived on a local farm for some time, and consisted of a copper cylinder about 4 inches in diameter, which had holes for three copper spikes (1/2 inch thick by 2 feet long, or 12.7mm by 609.6mm) to jut out at angles, so that the tips were 2 feet apart. Two 2 inch (50.8mm) copper straps at least ¼ inch (6.35mm) thick led down the sides of the building to be earthed. In the photograph double timber doors are shown in the west end of the magazine, and these may have existed before the building became a hall. These doors are not on the 1887 plans for the magazine. Lead sheeting from under the roofing iron (of either the two timber and iron magazines or the brick magazine) were recycled by locals for stump caps and guttering.|$|E

Many administrative offices of {{the eastern half of}} the city remained under Palestinian control, including the Islamic Awqaf, or religious endowment, Jerusalem's churches, and some municipal services. Slowly, Israel has applied pressure on these various offices in hopes of gaining rock-solid physical sovereignty. Certainly one of the <b>lightening</b> <b>rods</b> in this struggle for control has been the Haram al-Sharif, or al-Aqsa Mosque compound.

We consider the corresponding signature effects in photovoltaic applications; they are: low open circuit voltages and exponentially strong random device leakiness. Comparing the proposed theory with our data for CdTe based solar cells, we conclude that stress can stimulate semi-shunts' growth making them shunting failure precursors.

We present fluorescence imaging using the strong local field created {{at the apex}} of a gold tip and demonstrate optical resolution of 25 nm: The enhancement effect gives also rise to photoemission from the tip itself. Measured spectra of the tip emission show a broad band continuum together with a second-harmonic peak. Both continuum and secondharmonic are confined {{at the apex of}} the tip. We find that, depending on the spectral position, the photoluminescence originates either from intraband or from interband transitions. The nonlinear response can be described by a single dipole oscillating at the second-harmonic frequency and oriented along the tip axis. These unique properties can be used to map focal fields distributions...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} {{of the origins of}} strong Raman signals from molecules near roughened Ag, Cu, and Au surfaces has progressed {{to the point where the}} action of two very different types of process are recognized. There is "chemical" enhancement that is apparent only for chemisorbed species, as for example, specifically adsorbed anions on Ag electrodes. The chemical mechanism is poorly understood, however, ingenious ideas and concepts have been advanced, including localization of electron-hole pair states and optically driven charge transfer between adsorbate and metal, to model aspects of the chemical enhancement. The second and best understood process is the enormous enhancement of the incoming and outgoing radiation fields at the surface resulting from <b>lightening</b> <b>rod</b> geometries and the excitation of localized surface plasmon modes. Calculations show that for special geometries, very high (approximately 106 - 108) enhancement factors are possible in confined regions...|$|E

40|$|Metal {{nanostructure}} on dielectric substrate {{with increased}} hotspot density has drawn considerable research interest {{in recent years}} toward the study of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In this paper, we report the fabrication of a diagonally aligned squared metal nano-pillar (SMNP) on a dielectric substrate and revealed it as an efficient SERS substrate with increased hotspot density for sensing of Raman active materials. Due to dipolar coupling and <b>lightening</b> <b>rod</b> effect between the neighboring nano-pillars, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) field intensity increased significantly {{in the space between}} two neighboring SMNP which would lead to the enhancement of SERS signal. The SMNP has been fabricated using electron beam lithographic (EBL) technique with hotspot density of 2. 45 x 10 (7) /mm(2).

40|$|Plasmonic systems {{based on}} metal {{nanoparticles}} {{on a metal}} film have generated great interest for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) chemical sensors. In this study, we describe the fabrication of ultrasensitive SERS substrates based on high-density gold nanostar assemblies on silver films with tailored surface plasmons, where multiple field enhancements from particle-film and interparticle plasmon couplings and <b>lightening</b> <b>rod</b> effects of sharp tips of nanostars contribute to the enormous Raman enhancements. We show that the interplay between interparticle and particle-film plasmon couplings of high-density gold nanostars (GNSs) on metal and dielectric films {{as a function of}} interparticle separation can be tailored to provide maximum SERS effects. We observe that the SERS enhancement factor (EF) of GNSs on a metal film as a function of interparticle separation follows a broken power law function, where the EF increases with the interparticle separation for the strong interparticle coupling range below an interparticle separation of ∼ 0. 8 times the GNS size, but decreases for the weak interparticle coupling range (for an interparticle separation of > 0. 8 times the GNS size). Finally, we demonstrate the use of tailored plasmonic substrates as ultrasensitive SERS chemical sensors with an attomole level of detection capability of 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene, a model compound of nitroaromatic explosives. close 6...|$|E
40|$|Despite all the invective hurled at {{international}} financial markets by {{critics of the}} “Washington Consensus, ” {{the fact is that}} strong healthy financial markets are essential for middle-income countries that aspire to the ranks of advanced countries. Deeper financial mar-kets mean a better allocation of risk, but they can also make econo-mies more vulnerable to crises. The question is not simply how to avoid crises entirely, but how to handle the ones that do inevitably occur. When it comes to avoiding international debt crises, the single best precaution any middle-income country can take is to keep down its debt/GDP ratios, especially public debt, and especially public ex-ternal debt. The second most important step is to adopt a sufficiently flexible exchange rate regime.

40|$|The Citizens Protection Act (CPA) of 1998 {{has always}} been a <b>lightening</b> <b>rod</b> for criticism, and it remains so today. This article reassesses the CPA’s {{perceived}} inadequacies in light of how it has actually affected (or, not affected) federal prosecutors’ involvement in criminal investigations. The article takes issue with the critics and demonstrates that the CPA succeeded where it should have, failed where it should have, and left us—however inadvertently—with a remarkably coherent and consistent approach to regulating federal prosecutors’ involvement in criminal investigations regardless of whether a suspect retains counsel early in the proceedings. The CPA requires federal prosecutors to follow state rules of professional conduct “to the same extent and in the same manner” as all other lawyers. The CPA was intended to—and did—nullify a U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) declaration that unilaterally exempted federal prosecutors from much of the “no-contact” rule, which prohibits a lawyer in a matter from communicating with the client of another lawyer in the matter. The CPA was also intended to—but did not—require federal prosecutors to comply with various state interpretations of the no-contact rule that might have restricted their ability to participate in both covert and overt communications with represented criminal suspects. It is a good thing the CPA passed because DOJ’s assertion of authority over the no-contact rule for its own lawyers would inevitably have undermined public confidence in federal prosecutors’ commitment to fair and ethical investigatory processes. By the same token, it is a good thing that the CPA failed because broadly depriving DOJ of federal prosecutors’ involvement in communications with represented suspects would have substantially hindered criminal investigations for no good reason...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how Herman Melville's {{depiction}} {{of the relationship between}} Man and Wilderness in his collection of short stories, The Piazza Tales, critiques the social reform movements of the mid-nineteenth century. By highlighting how Melville's portrayal of the relationship between Man and Wilderness parallels that seen in Early American survey writing texts such as Notes on the State of Virginia as well as midnineteenth century nature writing texts such as Walden, this thesis asserts that Melville is showing how the evolution of the relationship between Man and Wilderness retains an inherent level of subjugation. Similarly, by showing how Melville's text parallels the relationship between Man and Wilderness with that of Man and subjugated Man, this thesis suggests that Melville was making a claim that, due to the inherent subjugation that exists within the American social structure, the social reform movements of the mid- 19 th century would, ultimately, be ineffective-a reality which is apparent in the persistence of social, racial, and economical stratification in early 21 st century America. Chapter 1 synthesizes G. W. F. Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic and Bill Brown's "Thing Theory" in order to demonstrate how Melville's {{depiction of}} the relationship between Man and Wilderness mirrors the relationship between Man and Subjugated Man. Chapter 2 explores the parallels between Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, Melville's {{depiction of the}} relationship between Man and Wilderness in "The Piazza," "The Lightning Rod Man," "The Encantadas," and "The Belltower," and the treatment of subjugated peoples in pre-Westward Movement America.

Section 404 of the Act 2 ̆ 2 lies like an open wound across the body of environmental law. 2 ̆ 2 Given the ecological and economic value of the resource, this seems puzzling [...] {{but only for a}} moment. An examination of the federal wetlands permitting program reveals significant problems. These problems, combined with ingrained attitudes about the sanctity of private property, lack of public appreciation of wetland values, and insufficient political will to protect them, make it easy to see why wetlands continue to disappear, and why the federal wetlands regulatory program {{is one of the most}} controversial of the country 2 ̆ 7 s environmental programs. Recent attempts by the federal government to improve the regulatory program, while laudable, have only served to magnify the program 2 ̆ 7 s problems. Each attempt has become a <b>lightening</b> <b>rod</b> for the program 2 ̆ 7 s many opponents. Two of these attempts will be discussed in depth in this article. Both initiatives involved the issuance of agency staff guidance documents: one, an inter-agency agreement on federal policy for mitigating wetland losses; the other, a manual containing technical criteria for delineating wetland boundaries. The controversy surrounding these documents has swirled into the halls of Congress and has reached as high as the Oval Office, threatening to unravel gains made in wetlands protection during the first year of the Bush Administration and threatening the very continuation of the federal program in its current form. While it may be startling that the debate over these administrative initiatives reached such heights and gained so much momentum in the political structure, the controversy should not have been unexpected. In fact, the brouhaha was, sadly, all too predictable from prior experience with this extremely truculent area of environmental policy. This article examines these two initiatives and attempts to show how the hostility with which they were greeted is illustrative of the deep-seated problems plaguing the wetlands regulatory program. In order to clarify these problems, this article places the initiatives against a backdrop of wetland losses and of imperfections in the protective regulatory program. The rationale behind the initiatives is examined and their contents parsed for the seeds of what was to come. The article concludes with some general recommendations, based upon this analysis, concerning where improvements could be made in the federal approach to protecting wetlands...|$|E
