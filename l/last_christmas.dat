500|$|... "Dwight Christmas" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} story editor Robert Padnick, marking his fourth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the seventh season. It was directed by Charles McDougall, his first directing credit for the season. McDougal's first job for the series was directing its first Christmas episode during the show's second season. The basic plot of the episode, involving Belsnickel, had originally been conceived during the writing for fourth season {{and was going to}} air as that year's Christmas installment. However, the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike halted production, and the unfinished script was never used. According to executive producer and showrunner Greg Daniels, the writing staff wanted to use the premise for many years, but could never find a right time to implement it, until an opportunity during the show's last season presented itself. Before the episode aired, Kemper, in an interview with TV Guide said that [...] "I feel like I might be expected to say this because it is the last one, but I truly love this episode so much" [...] and that she [...] "specifically love Dwight's storyline" [...] because [...] "he brings in his family Christmas traditions.

David Pakman, President of non-DRM music retailer eMusic, agreed with Jobs, stating that [...] "consumers prefer {{a world where the}} media they purchase is playable on any device, regardless of its manufacturer, and is not burdened by arbitrary usage restrictions.

Mike Bebel, CEO of music subscription service Ruckus, explained his view that the letter was an effort to shift focus, saying that [...] "This is a way for Steve Jobs to take the heat off the fact that he won't open up his proprietary DRM. ... The labels have every right to protect their content, and I don't see it as a vow of good partnership to turn the tables on the labels and tell them they should just get rid of all DRM... He is trying to spin the controversy." [...] An anonymous music label executive said that [...] "it's ironic that the guy who has the most successful example of DRM at every step of the process, the one where people bought boatloads of music <b>last</b> <b>Christmas,</b> is suddenly changing his tune". In an article from The New York Times, Ted Cohen, managing partner at TAG Strategic, commented that the change could be [...] "a clear win for the consumer electronics device world, but a potential disaster for the content companies".
