25|$|While he lived, he was {{a patron}} and benefactor to the Tseng-Lung Hui-kuan in Penang, Taiping and Gopeng. Chung, Keng Quee built the current temple-like {{premises}} of the Tseng Lung (Zeng Long) Association in Taiping in 1888, rebuilt the premises of the Tseng-Lung Hui-kuan, Gopeng in 1898 and the premises of the Tseng-lung Hui-kuan, Penang in 1886. The Tseng Lung Hui Kuan were associations for people from Tseng ch'eng and Lung-men (<b>Longmen</b> 龙门) <b>counties</b> of Kuang-chou (Guangzhou or Canton) prefecture in South China. According to Tan Kim Hong, Keng Quee whose father was an early leader of the association became the Chief Director of the association around 1890.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change during}} the Quaternary played an {{important}} role in the distribution of extant plants. Herein, cone scales of Cedrus (Pinaceae) were uncovered from the Upper Pliocene Sanying Formation, <b>Longmen</b> Village, Yongping <b>County</b> of Yunnan Province in southwestern China. Detailed comparisons show that these fossils all belong to the genus Cedrus (Pinaceae), and a new species is proposed, Cedrus angusta sp. nov. This find expands the known distribution of Cedrus during the Late Pliocene to Yunnan, where the genus no longer exists in natural forests. Based on the analysis of reconstructed Neogene climate data, we suggest that the intensification of the East Asian winter monsoon during the Quaternary may have dramatically increased seasonality and given rise to a much drier winter in Yunnan. Combined with information on Cedrus fossil records and its seed physiology, we conclude that the intensification of a drier climate after the Late Pliocene may have prevented the survival of Cedrus seedlings, leading to the eventual disappearance of Cedrus in western Yunnan. This study indicates that the topography in southwestern China acted as a vital refuge for many plants during the Quaternary, but that other species gradually disappeared due to the intensification of the monsoonal climate...|$|R
50|$|Ma Zhanshan {{had emerged}} onto the plains again from his {{shelter in the}} Lesser Khingan {{mountains}} along the Amur River after the Japanese had defeated his forces in the north.

5000|$|Ma Zhanshan {{had emerged}} onto the plains again from his {{shelter in the}} Little Hsingan range along the Amur River after the Japanese had {{defeated}} the forces in the north. He arrived in <b>Longmen</b> <b>County</b> in September and established relationship with Su Bingwen's force. But from September to December 1932, nearly 30,000 Japanese and Manchukuoan soldiers including the Japanese 14th Division and the 4,500 Mongol Cavalrymen of the Manchukuoan [...] "Hsingan" [...] Army directed a fierce campaign at Su and Ma's troops.|$|E
50|$|Zengcheng County was {{established}} under the Qin following their {{conquest of the}} area, formerly held by the Baiyue tribes. Under the Ming, the northern area of the county was separated to form <b>Longmen</b> <b>County,</b> administered from Huizhou. The county was promoted to city status in 1993. In 2006, a western section of Zengcheng was severed to form Guangzhou's Luogang District, which was renamed Huangpu in 2014. On 12 February of the same year, Zengcheng was annexed to Guangzhou as a district. A riot of migrant workers occurred in Zengcheng in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Miao Jinqing {{was born}} in 685, during the first reign of Emperor Ruizong. His family was from Lu Prefecture (潞州, roughly modern Changzhi, Shanxi) and traced its ancestry to the royal clan of Chu, {{a state of the}} Warring States period. [...] His {{ancestors}} had been Confucian scholars for generations. His grandfather Miao Kui (苗夔) was known for having refused appointment to civil service. His father Miao Daishu (苗殆庶) did serve as an official, but only reached the office of secretary general of <b>Longmen</b> <b>County</b> (龍門, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). Miao Jinqing himself was known for studiousness in his youth, {{and he was able to}} pass the imperial examinations, allowing him to enter civil service.|$|E
50|$|The units under Ma {{undertook}} ambushes {{along the}} major roads and badly weakened Manchukuo and Japanese troops in several engagements. In the “Ma Chan-shan Subjugation Operation”, the Kwantung Army transferred a large mixed force of Japanese and Manchukuo troops to encircle and destroy Ma's Army. Ma Zhanshan's troops, though seriously depleted from previous battles, escaped {{due to the}} laxity of the Manchukuo troops. In September, Ma Zhanshan arrived in <b>Longmen</b> <b>County</b> and established {{a relationship with the}} Heilungkiang National Salvation Army of Su Bingwen. In the “Su Ping-wei Subjugation Operation”, 30,000 Japanese and Manchukuo troops forced Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen to retreat across the border into the Soviet Union in December. Most of these troops were then transferred to Rehe.|$|E

40|$|A violent {{attack on}} medical staff in Guangdong Province, {{in which a}} female doctor at <b>Longmen</b> <b>County</b> People’s Hospital (LCPH) was {{severely}} injured by a knife-wielding patient, has drawn significant public attention to the phenomenon of hospital violence and initiated discussions on how to resolve violence in hospitals. Social networking sites, such as Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter, {{have played a role}} in this public debate. The incident at LCPH provides an opportunity to examine how Weibo has been used in the debate about violence against medical staff in China. Using the Sina Weibo’s built-in search tool, we established a dataset of 661 Chinese-language micro-blogs containing the search terms: Longmen (“龙门”), doctor (“医生”), and slash (“砍”) that were posted between July 15, 2015, the date of the violent incident at LCPH, and August 15, 2015. We performed a content analysis of the micro-blogs to examine: users’ demographics, attitudes toward the injured doctor and the attacker, possible reasons for the hospital violence, and proposed measures for preventing doctors from violent incidents...|$|E
40|$|Bamboo {{toothpicks}} {{are widely}} used in many Asian countries, especially in China where there are {{a large number of}} small-scale toothpick production units. Bamboos are renewable, can be harvested annually and are an ideal source of softwood for light uses such as toothpicks. The productivity of sympodial bamboos (clump-forming types) is much higher than monopodial bamboos (running bamboos) and for this reason, only toothpicks made from sympodial bamboos are considered in this TOTEM. Bamboos have been used to produce toothpicks in China since the Qing dynasty. <b>Longmen</b> <b>county</b> in Guangdong province in southern China is a major toothpick production centre and toothpicks have been produced by hand here for generations [...] In Vietnam bamboo toothpick production methods have been developed specifically for the blind. The toothpicks produced by the blind association involved have captured a considerable portion of the domestic market and have created jobs and stable incomes. In China there are now a range of modern machines available that permit the efficient medium-scale production of toothpicks in community or village level enterprises. They permit greater production rates, increased uniformity and higher quality than hand production. Toothpick manufacturing uni...|$|E
