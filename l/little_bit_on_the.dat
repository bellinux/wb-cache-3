500|$|Following {{a ten-year}} absence of nighttime-run stages, {{the first two}} Special Stages of the event were held on Thursday night. They were the first night stages {{scheduled}} in the rally since 1997. Throughout the day it had rained, and although it had stopped before the race began, the roads were still very wet and slippery. In discussing the day's weather, Grönholm said that he expected the stages that night to be difficult, and added, [...] "I hope this time we can take the right tyres, we were always a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side – it’s not easy, but I hope we will manage {{to get it right}} this time." [...] Earlier in the day, the crews had driven a shakedown stage in Mauves; however, due to a large number of fans and spectators along the route the shakedown was stopped early, and some crews including Loeb and co-driver Daniel Elena were forced to carry out last-minute testing and necessary changes to their cars on the main roads back to Valence. Though forty-nine crews registered in the rally, only forty-seven actually competed. Privateers François Duval driving a , and Angelo Villa in a [...] failed to start the event.|$|E
500|$|As {{the studio}} was {{simultaneously}} developing , limitations were set on which mutants {{could be used}} for cameo appearances in X-Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine. Gambit was considered for both the convoy scene being freed by Magneto and the Battle of Alcatraz along with the X-Men, but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and [...] "not be able to do him justice." [...] Kinberg reasoned, [...] "there just wasn't enough space", and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast. Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2, but still planned to return for the sequel. The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process, and the character was cut. Kinberg felt that [...] "there wasn't much left to do with the character. It also felt like he might tread a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terrain of Beast, in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy." [...] Nightcrawler's absence was later explained in [...] The introdutory scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film, going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters. Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room, which was considered for the previous X-Men films but never included for budget and writing concerns. The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a [...] "Days of Future Past"-inspired battle with a Sentinel. Another repurposed scene was Magneto attacking the convoy to free Mystique, Madrox and Juggernaut, which Penn had previously envisioned for X2.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1983, {{students}} {{reported for the}} first SAMS class. Although the curriculum was ready, the school faced a number of challenges at the outset. For example, there was no separate academic building for the school. Classrooms in Fort Leavenworth's Bell Hall (image right) were reserved [...] "on a daily basis." [...] During the first year, Winton observed that, [...] "It was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fly and everybody {{put up with that}} and understood it."

2500|$|Local radio stations' initial {{reception}} of Pupil's music, though, was relatively limited (with {{the exception of}} NU 107) due to the band's genre and musical style. While the band's carrier single, [...] "Nasaan Ka?" [...] was played often and achieved quite a popularity among listeners, other singles released from their album encountered more hurdles. The song [...] "Nasaan Ka?" [...] was used as main theme and [...] "story" [...] (based on lyrics) for the first episode of the second season of Your Song. Frontman Ely Buendia says, [...] "Some pop radio stations are still making up their minds on 'Dianetic' which I personally don’t understand since it’s really {{just one of those}} straightforward love songs medyo on the noisy side nga lang (just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> noisy side)." [...] "Then again, minsan talaga hindi mo maintindihan ang ibang radio stations (sometimes you cannot understand some radio stations). It’s not as if they don’t play songs by foreign artists like Nirvana with music heavier on distorted electric guitar than ours. Pero okay lang (But that's okay), that’s the reality of things." [...] He speculates that xenocentrism has something to do about the double standard these radio stations go by. Consequently, they were forced to release an acoustic version of their second single, [...] "Dianetic". The acoustic version of [...] "Nasaan Ka?" [...] was then used as a Bonus Track for Sony BMG's CD Sampler 2006 Volume 3.|$|E

60|$|I am in {{the habit}} of looking to the Yorkshire drawings, as {{indicating}} one of the culminating points in Turner's career. In these he attained the highest degree of what he had up to that time attempted, namely, finish and quantity of form united with expression of atmosphere, and light without color. His early drawings are singularly instructive in this definiteness and simplicity of aim. No complicated or brilliant color is ever thought of in them; they are little more than exquisite studies in light and shade, very green blues being used for the shadows, and golden browns for the lights. The difficulty and treachery of color being thus avoided, the artist was able to bend his whole mind upon the drawing, and thus to attain such decision, delicacy, and completeness as have never in any wise been equalled, and as might serve him for a secure foundation in all after experiments. Of the quantity and precision of his details, the drawings made for Hakewill's Italy, are singular examples. The most perfect gem in execution is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rhine, with reeds in the foreground, in the possession of B. G. Windus, Esq., of Tottenham; but the Yorkshire drawings seem to be on the whole the most noble representatives of his art at this period.|$|E

So this album kind of rubbed me in a bit of a weird way. Overall I like the songs, I just wish the production was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> punk rock side of things, and I don’t feel like this album was the best representation of how we wanted to sound at that time.” ...|$|R
