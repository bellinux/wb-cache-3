5|$|Though Dhumavati {{may seem}} to be a goddess to be avoided due to her inauspiciousness, she is {{described}} as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati is described as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E
5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to expand {{the scope of the}} city. Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E

25|$|The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association {{argued that}} the court should <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> mere {{dictionary}} definitions of “sewer” to examine the legal {{meaning of the term}} in the specific context of how that term is used in Proposition 218. The Association also observed that numerous California statutes differentiated between storm drainage and sewerage systems, including a specific statute that legally authorizes many local governments to levy fees and charges for storm drainage or sewerage systems.|$|E
25|$|It {{emphasized}} the need for foresters to <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> their own resource base to consider how forest policies can be formulated {{in the light of}} such global events as an international banking crisis. The purpose of the Congress was to develop clear lines of action that may serve as guidelines for (a) formulating national policies; (b) providing incentives and guidance to the private and government sectors; and (c) promoting international cooperation in forestry.|$|E

25|$|Unger {{finds the}} two major orientations of {{contemporary}} Leftism inadequate and calls for a 'Reconstructive Left' – one which would insist on redirecting the course of globalization by reorganizing the market economy. In his two books The Left Alternative and , Unger lays out a program to democratize the market economy and deepen democracy. This Reconstructive Left would <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> debates on the appropriate size of government, and instead re-envision the relationship between government and firms in the market economy by experimenting with the coexistence of different regimes of private and social property.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of VC/NVA {{performance}} must <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the American interlude, and {{the guerrilla}} warfare phases {{to the final}} outcome of the Vietnam War in 1975. Well before the end, the Viet Cong were reduced to a minor force, and regular PAVN formations controlled the field. While final victory was aided by absence of American airpower, the PAVN/VPA armies were no longer the light-infantry formations mauled at the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965, but a tough, proficient, well-equipped modern force. Their capabilities had grown considerably, and several shortcomings of the conventional 1972 Easter Offensive were remedied.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring by {{the board}} of directors: The board of directors, with its legal {{authority}} to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance. Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management {{on the basis of the}} quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ex ante. It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the financial criteria.|$|E

25|$|Most genes {{have more}} than one effect on the {{phenotype}} of an organism (pleiotropism). Some of these effects may be visible, and others cryptic, so it is often important to <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the most obvious effects of a gene to identify other effects. Cases occur where a gene affects an unimportant visible character, yet a change in fitness is recorded. In such cases the gene's other (cryptic or 'physiological') effects may be responsible for the change in fitness. Pleiotropism is posing continual challenges for many clinical dysmorphologists in their attempt to explain birth defects which affect one or more organ system, with only a single underlying causative agent. For many pleiotropic disorders, the connection between the gene defect and the various manifestations is neither obvious, nor well understood.|$|E
25|$|Archibald's work in {{investigating}} the disease of pancreatitis {{led to the}} development of the sphincterotomy, a procedure still in use today. His earlier experience with tuberculosis prompted him to <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> neurosurgery into other areas of the body, and his work in fighting tuberculosis led to the refining of thoracic surgery. When World War I began, Archibald went with the Third Canadian General Hospital to France, where he was able to apply his experience in combating the disease to the patients he encountered on the war front. The surgeon was also greatly interested in the education of new surgeons, and believed that the standard of doctor education had been declining, leaving incapable surgeons to perform procedures. Archibald returned to McGill University, this time as a staff member in the Department of Surgery, and revitalised it following almost thirty years of stagnation. In 1929, he served as a member of the first Royal College of Surgeons of Canada Examining Board in Surgery, and after becoming President of the American Surgical Association in 1935, made a speech entitled Higher Degrees in the Profession of Surgery, triggering the formation of the American Board of Surgery. He was also considered a key influence in the surgical education of Norman Bethune, however he reportedly disapproved of Bethune and his actions. Additionally, he was a mentor to Wilder Penfield, another famous physician who worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The decades between 1780 and 1830 feature several {{characteristics}} at Râmnic. The {{traditions of}} spiritual, cultural and artistic life were continued, with war-damaged churches repaired and new ones {{built in a}} manner that balanced a post-Brâncovenesc style with folk art innovations. The monasteries and the diocesan center continued to educate calligraphers, copyists, miniaturists, painters and musicians. The diocesan printing press was continued, albeit with difficulties and interruptions. Bishop Filaret, after being elected metropolitan, took the printing instruments with him to use at Bucharest. His successor Nectarie rebuilt the press, turning out twenty books, including a collection of sermons in Bulgarian for that country's believers; he followed as metropolitan in 1812. Galaction (1812-1824) published few books, but these were important, including a re-edited alphabet book in 1814 and a book on the miracles of the Virgin Mary in 1820. Neofit, who took over in 1824, sold the press to a group of laymen. (The current press dates to the time of Bishop Vartolomeu (1920-1938).) Bishop Calinic (1850-1868), whose reign coincided with the formation of the modern Romanian state, was the diocese's pre-eminent leader during the 19th century; his successors did not rise to the same spiritual level and were privy to the definitive imposition of government authority upon the church. Calinic set up his own press and published a number of liturgical and spiritual books, including a lamentation in verse, a collection of advice for monks and a chronicle on the Wallachian uprising of 1821. He also disseminated word of the government order replacing Greek with Romanian for liturgical use. Finally, local writers began to <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the confines of the diocese, dealing with themes of national interest and making themselves known in the Romanian cultural and literary scene of the day.|$|E

500|$|Dhumavati {{is said to}} {{manifest}} herself {{at the time of}} cosmic dissolution (pralaya) and is [...] "the Void" [...] that exists before creation and after dissolution. While Dhumavati is generally associated with only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn relates her positive aspects as well as her negative ones. She is often called tender-hearted and a bestower of boons. Dhumavati is described as a great teacher, one who reveals ultimate knowledge of the universe, which is beyond the illusory divisions, like auspicious and inauspicious. Her ugly form teaches the devotee to <b>look</b> <b>beyond</b> the superficial, to look inwards and seek the inner truths of life.|$|E
