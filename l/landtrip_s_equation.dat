40|$|In 1958, Preucil {{suggested}} an equation to calculate ink trap based on measurements of a printed sheet with a densitometer. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> {{was based on}} the additivity rule and the proportional rule. However, these rules do not hold in all cases. Several alternative equations have been suggested. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of three ink trap equations using densitometry by means of comparing the calculated values to those measured by the gravimetric method. An attempt is also made to estimate the value of maximum printable density, Dm, in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The theoretical basis of each equation is briefly introduced. The causes attributing to the failure of additivity and proportionality are discussed as well. Also reviewed are several methods for measuring ink trap, such as colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and magnetic methods, and factors involved in the efficiency of ink trapping. In the experiment, two newsprint and one coated paper were printed with cyan, magenta, and yellow ink in a simulated wet-on-wet condition on the IGT printability tester. Each ink had a specific tack. The second-down inks were transferred on the first ink layers with low, medium, and high thickness. The percent ink trapping on printed strips were then calculated by both the densitometric methods and the gravimetric method. The factors causing poor trapping and back-trap in the experiment are discussed. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> was found to correspond better with gravimetric trap values than Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> However, both under estimated ink trap in the majority of the tested conditions. As the ink trap measured gravimetrically increased, the discrepancy of ink trap calculated by Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> increased. This applied to Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> as well, but not obviously to Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> proved to reduce the differences between gravimetric ink trap and densitometric ink trap significantly. A Dm value of 1. 59 for newsprint A, 1. 99 for newsprint B, and 2. 5 for coated paper resulted in the greatest accuracy over the conditions tested. When the Dm value approaches infinity, Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> becomes the equivalent of Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The experiment suggests that a range of Dm values between 1. 5 and 2. 5 was suitable for the tested conditions. For future research, a larger selection of various types of papers and inks are needed to specify a Dm value for general conditions. It might also be useful to specify a theoretical maximum printable density for general conditions, with which the maximum printable density of a given paper can be compared. Thus, the reproduction quality of the paper can be predicted before the printing is conducted. Since the effects of back-trap and ink contamination influence the accuracy of Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> in this experiment, studies for compensating this inaccuracy are suggested...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{three different}} mathematical models {{based on the}} time domain Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> using three different numerical methods: a Yee scheme using a non-uniform grid, a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (nDG) method, and a newly developed discontinuous Galerkin method named the weak Galerkin (WG) method. The non-uniform Yee scheme is first applied to an electromagnetic metamaterial model. Stability and superconvergence error results are proved for the method, which are then confirmed through numerical results. Additionally, a numerical simulation of backwards wave propagation through a negative-index metamaterial is given using the presented method. Next, the nDG method is used to simulate signal propagation through a corrugated coaxial cable {{through the use of}} axisymmetric Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations.</b> Stability and error analysis are performed for the semi-discrete method, and are verified through numerical results. The nDG method is then used to simulate signal propagation through coaxial cables with a number of different corrugations.

40|$|A full-wave {{approach}} has been developed to study the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in stratified media with nonuniform boundaries and varying electromagnetic parameters (Bahar, 1972 a, b). By expanding the electromagnetic field vectors E and H using the generalized Fourier Transforms and imposing the exact boundary conditions at the irregular boundary, Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> are converted into the generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> for the forward and backward traveling wave amplitudes. The generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> have been solved for the radiation fields scattered from rough surfaces using iterative approaches for the single scatter and the double-scatter. ^ A numerical method is developed in this dissertation to solve the generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> for the diffuse scattered radiation fields from one-dimensional rough surfaces. The full-wave numerical solution includes both single scatter and all the higher-order multiple scatters. Using this approach, the coupled generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> are first combined into a single integro-differential equation for the forward and backward wave amplitudes on applying the analytical properties of the basis functions and the scattering coefficients. Then, the primary (unperturbed) field components are subtracted from the total fields. The rapidly varying phase components of the wave amplitudes are factored out. The singularities in the scattering coefficients are removed through integration by parts. Thus, the integro-differential equation is converted into an integral equation for the diffuse scattered wave magnitudes which depend on the wave vector variable only. Finally, the continuous wave vector variables are discretized and the integral equation is converted into a matrix equation (moment method). The wave magnitudes are determined by solving the matrix equation. The far field vectors at a remote observation point are obtained from the field transformation using the steepest descent approach. ^ The full-wave numerical solution for the diffuse scattered radiation fields is applied to both deterministic rough surfaces with known profile and random rough surfaces with known statistics. The Monte-Carlo technique is used to simulate random rough surfaces. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} diffuse scattered radiation fields can be approximated using the single scatter iterative solutions when the maximum rough surface slope is less than 35 degrees. ...|$|R

40|$|Organisms {{in highly}} {{suitable}} sites generally produce more offspring, and offspring can inherit this suitability by not dispersing far. This combination of spatial selection and spatial inheritance acts to bias {{the distribution of}} organisms toward suitable sites and thereby increase mean fitness (i. e., per capita population increase). Thus, population growth rates in heterogeneous space change over time by a process conceptually analogous to evolution by natural selection, opening avenues for theoretical cross-pollination between evolutionary biology and ecology. We operationally define spatial inheritance and spatial selective differential and then combine these two factors in a modification of the breeder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation,</b> derived from simple models of population growth in heterogeneous space.
