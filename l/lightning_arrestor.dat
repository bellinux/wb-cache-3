50|$|A {{gas-filled}} tube {{can also be}} used as a shunt, particularly in a <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestor.</b> Neon and other noble gases have a high breakdown voltage, so that normally current will not flow across it. However, a direct lightning strike (such as on a radio tower antenna) will cause the shunt to arc and conduct the massive amount of electricity to ground, protecting transmitters and other equipment.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the factors which {{influence}} the stability of simultaneous, distributed arcs on power lines is reported. The types of arcs studied were through air between iron electrodes, flashover along a wood-air boundary between copper electrodes and arcs confined in expulsion-tube <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestors.</b> Variations of line geometry influence line characteristic impedance, series and shunt impedances and equivalent length. The studies indicate that of these factors, only the series impedance between the simultaneous arcs is important unless the line length separating the two arcs is very short. The analysis illustrates {{that it is possible}} to calculate approximate critical spacing of a test gap in terms of the geometry and material of arc electrodes and the potential at the gap. This potential was shown to depend upon both the power frequency conduction characteristics of the remainder of the circuit and upon the nature of the surge initiating the arc. The relative importance of these two factors was estimated. The studies show that it is possible for arcs to rob one another after they have been independently initiated on power distribution systems. Consequently, with appropriate placement of <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestors</b> it is possible to protect a system so that even though a direct stroke of lightning may initiate an arc at a location remote from the arrestors, the arrestors can still rob the open arc of current and hence extinguish it...|$|R
40|$|In this article, the {{theoretical}} concepts and the experimental techniques for {{measurements of the}} volume and surface resistivity of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite materials have been explained. The purpose of these measurements is to investigate the potential of composite materials as <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestors</b> for an aircraft. In particular, the AC resistivity method and the Delta mode of measurement have been described in detail. A few measurements were carried out using an indigenously designed and fabricated collinear four-probe resistivity measurement tool, for which factors dependent on {{the dimensions of the}} samples have to be incorporated, as per the ASTM F 390 - 11 standards. The validity of the two-probe and four-probe methods is also analyzed, along with techniques to minimize errors in measurements. Conductivity measurements on uni-directional laminates {{have been made in the}} longitudinal (fibre) direction as well as perpendicular to it, indicating a marked difference in the relative magnitudes. When investigating the potential of materials as <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestors,</b> a very high surface conductivity is desired so that lightning currents (even of the order of kA) pass along the exterior of the aircraft, without penetrating the underlying structure. The effects of the addition of copper nanotubes (CNT) and copper mesh have also been studied. The instruments involved in these experiments have been automated based on the IEEE – 488. 2 protocols. The software to program them was developed using Labview. Measurements have also been performed on standard samples to test the accuracy of the data.

5000|$|In {{telegraphy}} and telephony, a <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestor</b> {{is placed}} where wires enter a structure, preventing damage to electronic instruments within and ensuring {{the safety of}} individuals near them. Smaller versions of lightning arresters, also called surge protectors, are devices that are connected between each electrical conductor in power and communications systems and the Earth. These prevent {{the flow of the}} normal power or signal currents to ground, but provide a path over which high-voltage lightning current flows, bypassing the connected equipment. Their purpose is to limit the rise in voltage when a communications or power line is struck by lightning or is near to a lightning strike.|$|E
50|$|Elihu Thomson of Thomson-Houston was {{concerned}} about AC safety and put {{a great deal of}} effort into developing a <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestor</b> for high-tension power lines as well as a magnetic blowout switch that could shut the system down in a power surge, a safety feature the Westinghouse system did not have. Thomson also worried what would happen with the equipment after they sold it, assuming customers would follow a risky practice of installing as many lights and generators as they could get away with. He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installations until a safer transformer could be developed.|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} {{sections of}} conductive guys can develop large charges of static electricity, especially on very tall masts. The voltage caused by this static electricity can be several {{times larger than}} that generated by the transmitter. In order to avoid dangerous and unpredictable discharges, the insulators must be designed to withstand this high voltage, which results at tall masts in over-dimensioned backstage insulators. At each backstage insulator, a <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestor</b> {{in the form of}} an arc gap is required for the purpose of over-voltage protection in case of lightning strikes. The insulators and arrestors must be maintained carefully, because an insulator failure can result in a mast collapse. Egg insulators have the porcelain in compression and if it fails, the end loops of the guy wires are still intertwined.|$|E

Power was connected by closing simple knife switches and the system was shut down (the electrical circuit [...] "opened") by a worker garbing a connecting line at the power pole and pulling it out of the arc-light style plug mounted on the pole (a sometime dangerous maneuver that produced 6 to 8 foot (1.83-m to 2.44-m) long high voltage arcs). One continual problem was repairing damage from lightning strikes, a common occurrence at the mountainous location.

This study examined the use of zinc as a potential substitute for the cadmium protective surface finish. Tests were performed with an R and RMA flux and test temperatures of 230 C, 245 C, and 260 C. Contact angle, {theta}{sub c}, served as the generalized solderability metric. The wetting rate and wetting time parameters were also collected. The solderability ({theta}{sub c}) of the Erie Plating Cd/Ni coatings was better than that of similar Amphenol coatings. Although the {theta}{sub c} data indicated that both Cd/Ni platings would provide adequate solderability, the wetting rate and wetting time data showed the Amphenol coatings to have better performance.

5000|$|Static dischargers, {{commonly}} known as static wicks or static discharge wicks, are installed on the trailing edges of aircraft, including (electrically grounded) ailerons, elevators, rudder, wing, horizontal and vertical stabilizer tips. Fitted on almost all civilian aircraft today, they are high electrical resistance (6-200 megaohm) devices with a lower corona voltage than the surrounding aircraft structure. They control the corona discharge into the atmosphere, isolating noise and preventing it from interfering with aircraft communication equipment. They are used on aircraft to allow the continuous satisfactory operation of onboard navigation and radio communication systems during precipitation (p-static) conditions. Precipitation static is an electrical charge on an airplane caused by flying through rain, snow, ice, or dust particles. When the aircraft charge is great enough, it discharges into the surrounding air. The discharge path is through pointed aircraft extremities, such as antennas, wing tips, vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and other protrusions. The discharge creates a broad-band radio frequency noise from DC to 1000 MHz. This RF noise can affect aircraft communication. During adverse charging conditions (air friction), static dischargers limit the potential static buildup on the aircraft and control interference generated by static charge. Static dischargers are not <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestors</b> and do not reduce or {{increase the likelihood of}} an aircraft being struck by lightning. Static dischargers are subject to damage as a result of lightning strike to the aircraft, and should be inspected after a lightning strike to ensure proper static discharge operation. Static dischargers will not function if they are not properly bonded to the aircraft. There must be a conductive path {{from all parts of the}} airplane to the dischargers, otherwise they will be useless. Access panels, doors, cowls, navigation lights, antenna mounting hardware, control surfaces, etc., can create static noise if they cannot discharge through the static wick.|$|R

The electricity consumers in Sri Lanka, especially {{those who live in}} areas with high isokeraunic levels, suffer considerable damages to their electrical appliances due to lightning. The objective of this project is to assist the electricity distribution authorities in finding remedial measures to overcome the difficulties faced by the consumers. Beregala in Avissawella, an area severely affected by consequences of lightning, was selected for the study. Two low voltage distribution lines that run across a rural mountainous area were identified for the modeling purpose.

Therefore this study was carried out to investigate the effect of wind speed to the building tower. Computational Fluid Dynamic {{has been used in}} order to examine the effect of wind to the tower. Variations of directions are tested to the tower model. From the result it clearly shows that wind load may increase up 2. 71 times from North West Direction from the normal wind act to tower. Additionally historical wind speed data at the nearest meteorological station after the building was also examined. From that it was observed historical wind speed is greater compare to the design wind speed. It may also seem that this value is not the worst that can cause the structure to collapse. Historical wind speed also showed foremost wind blow come from North West Direction. It can be concluded that the possibility of the collapse are highly foreseeable due to repeatable wind speed. The effect of the geometrical shape of the tower may also increase the wind load effect to the tower. Based on the result it can be conclude the repeatable load acting to structural component of the tower may weaken the structural component.

40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Mantenimiento Industrial) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Electromecánica, 2017. The {{concept of}} {{grounding}} {{refers to the}} intentional electrical connection with the earth, either from {{a part of the}} circuit (system grounding) or from metal parts that do not belong directly to it (equipment grounding). These ground connections must be sufficiently low impedance and ampacity to prevent the formation of dangerous voltages for people or connected equipment and to provide a path for the earth fault current to flow, Facilitate the operation of the protection devices to release the fault. On the other hand, lightning arrester systems must be capable of safely conducting ground current from lightning. The objective of the present work was to design the grounding system and lightning rods for a 500 kW solar complex located at the headquarters of the Technological Institute of Costa Rica. In addition, the development of a grounding guide for photovoltaic systems in the country. To achieve this, the design was based and adapted from the IEEE 80 standard, which corresponds to the design of grounding for alternating current substations. The fundamental parameters for obtaining ground designs are the ground resistivity and the maximum fault current. The first was measured with the Wenner method with a value of 98. 65 Ωm and the second was determined for the system as the short-circuit current for the PV array that was larger, in this case 103 A. The voltages of touch and step, where the maximum permissible values were 104. 06 V and 144. 30 V respectively. The theoretically obtained design will have a resistance of 0. 80 Ω, which is less than the 1 Ω value allowed by the standard.

As {{part of this}} recent knowledge preservation effort, improved documentation of the sample preparation and electrical testing procedures for lead magnesium niobate [...] lead titanate (PMN/PT) qualification pellets was completed. The qualification pellets are fabricated from the same parent powders used to produce PMN/PT <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestor</b> connector (LAC) granules at HWF&T. In our report, the procedures for fired pellet surface preparation, electrode deposition, electrical testing and data recording are described. The dielectric measurements described in our report are an information only test. Technical reasons for selecting the electrode material, electrode size and geometry are presented. The electrical testing is based on measuring the dielectric constant and dissipation factor of the pellet during cooling from 280 C to 220 C. The most important data are the temperature for which the peak dielectric constant occurs (Curie Point temperature) and the peak dielectric constant magnitude. We determined that the peak dielectric constant for our procedure would be that measured at 1 kHz at the Curie Point. Both the peak dielectric constant and the Curie point parameters provide semi-quantitative information concerning the chemical and microstructural homogeneity of the parent material used {{for the production of}} PMN/PT granules for LACs. Finally, we have proposed flag limits for the dielectric data for the pellets. Specifically, if the temperature of the peak dielectric constant falls outside the range of 250 C {+-} 30 C we propose that a flag limit be imposed that will initiate communication between production agency and design agency personnel.

40|$|Lightning strikes {{can cause}} {{structural}} damage, ignite flammable materials, and produce circuit malfunctions in missiles, aircraft, and ground systems. <b>Lightning</b> <b>arrestor</b> connectors (LACs) {{are used to}} divert harmful lightning energy away from these systems by providing less destructive breakdown paths. Ceramic granules in the size range of 150 [...] 200 {micro}m are used in LACs to provide physical and electrical separation of contacts (pins) from the surrounding metal web, and to control the voltage breakdown level. Pressure compaction (P-C) tests were used to characterize the strength of ceramic granules. When compaction data are plotted as relative density of the compact versus the compaction pressure two linear regions are generally observed. The intersection of these regions, which {{is known as the}} ``breakpoint,`` {{has been used as a}} semi-quantitative measure of granule strength. Comparisons were made between the P-C breakpoint and strengths of 150 [...] 200 {micro}m diameter ZnO, TiO{sub 2 } (rutile), and lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) granules, where the strengths were determined by diametral compression (D-C) tests. At high compaction pressures the compliance of the die itself is significant and was accounted for in the analyses. Tests were conducted at different compaction rates, and with different aspect ratio compacts. High aspect ratios and loading rates decrease the slope of the second linear portion of the compaction curve and produce higher apparent P-C breakpoints. Comparison of the P-C breakpoint to the average D-C strength indicates that the D-C strength is approximately fifty percent higher for PMN-PT granules. To eliminate the uncertainty in results due to irregular granules sizes and shapes, comparisons were made for uniform size (210 {micro}m) glass spheres. In this case the average D-C strength coincided with a second breakpoint in the P-C data, which occurred after compaction by a mechanism of bridge formation and collapse had ceased...|$|E
40|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{the term}} ground or earth has several meanings {{depending on the}} specific application areas. Ground is the reference point in an electrical circuit from which other voltages are measured, a common return path for electrical current (earth return or ground return), or a direct physical connection to the earth. Electrical circuits may be connected to ground (earth) for several reasons. In a power circuit, a connection to ground is done for safety purposes to protect people {{from the effects of}} faulty insulation on electrically powered equipment. A connection to ground helps limit the voltage built up between power circuits and the earth, protecting circuit insulation from damage due to excessive voltage. There are several types of earthing in the world. They are TT system, TN system and IT system. But in Sri Lanka most common method is the TT system. That means both the consumer and the source end should separately be earthed. Those earth electrodes should have less resistance and non corrosive perfect bonding. In the power distribution system in Sri Lanka normally the main source is -the CEB transformer. According to the TT system, the. substation should be earthed properly. If not it will affect the consumers by creating neutral leakage current, unbalancing voltage" voltage fluctuations and poor lightning protection etc. As a result transformer can be damaged, customer's electrical equipment and installation can be damaged. Life of humans and animals are in danger as the step and touch voltages have high values. Generally CEB distribution substation has two earth electrodes: one for neutral and the other for <b>lightning</b> <b>arrestor</b> and the body. According to the CEB rules and IEE regulations the earth resistance of those electrodes should be less than 10 Ohms. During last 20 years, CEB has used different types of earth electrodes for distribution substations. That is 10 feet long cast iron pipes, 6 feet long GI pipes, 1 m long copper plated steel rod with concrete mesh etc. But according to my investigations most of distribution substations of CEB have the resistance of around 100 Ohms. Hence I decided to select this topic as a project. Therefore the aim of this project is to design an earth electrode with high performance for distribution substations. This electrode can be used at consumer end too. First, an electrode was designed for a better surface area. The electrode was a combination of a rod and a semi sphere. According to the soil type, the length of the rod can be varied. However to reduce the resistivity of the surrounding soil, a special mixture was prepared with a resistivity of around 4 ohm m 'and it was used to back fill the electrode., An Aluminum or Galvanized barrel was used to avoid mixing that solution with the soil. As a result, the resistance of the electrode was reduced. I have designed eight types of electrodes for different soil types. However, the electrode- type D, that is 3 m rod and a radius of O. 75 m barrel can be used at the most of areas since the resistivity is below 650 Ohm m in Sri Lanka Therefore we can maintain the level of earth resistance below 10 ohms easily...|$|E
