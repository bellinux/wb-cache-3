5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement factory level, {{while most of the}} console versions did not. None of the home versions of Donkey Kong had all of the intermissions or animations from the arcade game. Some have Donkey Kong {{on the left side of}} the screen in the barrel level (<b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in the arcade game) and others have him on the right side.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|Despite Harry's {{aunt and}} uncle's desperate {{prevention}} of Harry gleaning about his powers, their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, {{who is also}} his first contact with the Wizarding World. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts {{as well as some}} of Harry's history. Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who subsequently attempted to kill him as well. Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the Wizarding World. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and torturing him <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.|$|E

25|$|Bobby (McCulloch) is {{a rebellious}} {{teenager}} whose love of rock'n'roll {{serves as the}} basis for most of his sketches. Bobby views rock as an expression of personal freedom, and always fights back when he feels <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> being denied that freedom. He is frequently in conflict with his parents, played by McKinney (father) and Foley (mother). He has also taken on a sarcastic jazz-loving teacher (Foley), and once even faced off against the Devil himself (McKinney) in a guitar-playing contest. Despite his rebellious attitude toward authority, he emphatically enjoys the taste of his mother's ham steak. A pre- Nicole de Boer appeared in three sketches as Bobby's girlfriend Laura. He, like Bauer above are a tongue-in-cheek satire of the rebellious late-80/1990s Grunge/Generation X subculture.|$|E
25|$|Ted— Ted is {{represented}} much <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in the novel, but AM has apparently made him severely paranoid, playing on his {{past as a}} con artist where he would use his charm and looks to seduce rich single women out of money, while he lived in constant fear of finally being discovered and revealed as a fraud. Initially offered freedom if he can solve the puzzle in a dark room, this {{turns out to be}} a feint to further provoke his neuroses. He then finds himself in a medieval castle where his love Ellen is apparently slowly dying due to a spell cast on her by her wicked stepmother. The castle is full of deceptive characters who make contradictory demands and whom Ted cannot decide whether to trust, and surrounded by wolves who are slowly closing in. Ted eventually finds a way to redeem both himself and Ellen, and is presented with a door to the surface world, which is irradiated and uninhabitable.|$|E
25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{concerns about}} his age, {{the beginning of}} the 2012 season saw Jeter on a hot streak: he batted [...]411 through April 23. Rodriguez commented that Jeter is playing as he did in 1999, while Girardi said Jeter looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> 25 years old. In the 2012 MLB All-Star Game, Jeter recorded his eleventh All-Star hit, passing Mantle for the most All-Star Game hits in Yankees history.

When told to act <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing a newscast, Andy does a Tom Brokaw impersonation. Andy also says that if necessary he will go all-nude for the role in a [...] "full-on Lena Dunham", a reference to her skit at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. Darryl tells Andy that he was in a production of The Wiz in high school. Kevin mistakes Orville and Wilbur Wright—the credited inventors of the airplane—for [...] "Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher"—a brand of popcorn.

500|$|The storyline {{played out}} {{on-screen}} when Belle discovers she has cancer. Aden only discovers the truth just before their wedding. Belle refuses treatment because her cancer is so advanced {{she does not}} want to [...] "prolong her agony". Aden is [...] "confused, devastated, and completely and utterly heartbroken". Lasance said Aden is [...] "destroyed" [...] and feels <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also dying in the process, because Aden has never given himself to anyone - he feels Belle is a part of him. Tovey explained that Belle is worried about Aden's frame of mind on their wedding day. The scriptwriters played the scenes in a way that kept viewers unsure whether or not Aden would attend his wedding. While Belle [...] "truly believes he will show up", Tovey explains the tone and mood of the wedding is unhappy. Aden marries Belle, and she dies a couple of weeks later.|$|E
500|$|He {{originally}} did {{not want}} to make sports his career. On the day that Magic Johnson announced his HIV-positive status in 1991, the 11-year-old Gasol, who had heard the news in school, decided {{that he wanted to be}} a doctor and find a cure for AIDS. He enrolled in medical school at the University of Barcelona, but left as his basketball career at FC Barcelona advanced. He remains strongly interested in medicine. Gasol regularly visits Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, a standard stop for athletes making charitable visits in the L.A. area, but does not limit his business to visiting young patients. On one visit, he asked a group of doctors well-informed questions about their treatment of children with scoliosis. In April 2010, Gasol was scheduled to sit in on a spinal surgery, wearing surgical scrubs, with Dr. David Skaggs, the hospital's chief of orthopedic surgery. Skaggs has said, [...] "We talk to him now almost <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a surgical colleague." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Convict" [...] was {{the first}} Office episode to be {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz, who later won an Emmy Award for the fifth season episode [...] "Stress Relief". In a departure from series routine, Gervais and Merchant were not present on set for much of filming, though episode writers had typically been available in the past. Actress Kate Flannery found the episode [...] "a {{lot of fun to}} shoot," [...] and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, [...] "it seems to me <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> looking at all of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent." [...] One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team {{put effort}} into trying to make Edgeworth look right; Eshiro described Edgeworth's running animation as [...] "graceful, while exerting effort", while Iwamoto was not entirely convinced and thought it looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> [...] "walking really fast accidentally". Eshiro and Yamazaki wanted to add a lot of features to the Little Thief system, but due to time constraints it ended up more simplistic than they had originally envisioned. Eshiro used his experience with producing action games such as Shadow of Rome and laying out scenes to get backgrounds to move smoothly without scrolling issues when Edgeworth moves. The programmers faced big technical challenges and had to make significant modifications to the game when implementing the graphics: in the game, two animated characters - whose graphics each are larger than those in previous Ace Attorney games - appear simultaneously {{and on top of}} smaller [...] "mini-avatar" [...] graphics. Eshiro said that he thinks they pushed the graphic processing ability of the Nintendo DS system to its limits for this. Eshiro said that they would consider making DSiWare episodes if demand was high enough, but {{that they did not have}} any plans at the time. He said that there were many technical aspects to consider, such as memory limitations for DSiWare.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> making {{a big deal out}} of nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E
500|$|During pre-season, {{ahead of}} the 2006–07 campaign, May injured his {{shoulder}} in training, resulting in him missing the club's pre-season tour of Iceland. Millwall manager Nigel Spackman revealed that May's injury would rule {{him out of the}} first two months of the season — [...] "He fell over during the close season, and it looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going to be out for a couple of months". He made his first appearance of the season in October 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute in Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy, scoring Millwall's second goal with his first touch of the game. In his first start of the season, he scored after six minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup win against Havant & Waterlooville in a game played at Fratton Park, netting from close range after good work from Chris Hackett. Five days later, he provided the assist for Darren Byfield's goal in a 2–2 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. May scored his third goal in five appearances when he scored in Millwall's 3–1 loss at Nottingham Forest on 24 November 2006. After Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bradford City, a game in which May assisted Filipe Morais in scoring Millwall's first goal, Millwall manager Willie Donachie stated — [...] "There's more to come from this team, especially Darren Byfield and Ben May, who are as good as anyone in this league. They're committed, honest players who want to work for each other". Three days later, on 12 December 2006, May's pacey cross resulted in Nathan Doyle putting the ball into his own net, giving Millwall a 1–0 win against Bradford City after extra-time in the FA Cup. May scored the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory at Yeovil Town on 3 February 2007, converting Darren Byfield's cross to give Millwall the three points. However, he was substituted after 53 minutes in the same game with an ankle injury, and in March 2007, he was ruled out of first-team action {{for the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Despite this, he made a second-half substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 2–2 draw at Bradford City, assisting Darren Byfield's goal just after coming on. May scored four times in 19 appearances in a season disrupted by injuries.|$|E
