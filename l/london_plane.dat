5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} <b>London</b> <b>plane</b> (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The <b>London</b> <b>plane</b> (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E

25|$|Ealing Common {{preserves}} a {{large area}} of open space with fine avenues of horse chestnut trees, {{most of which were}} planted in the late Victorian period, following the purchase of the common land by the Ealing Local Board. The northern part of the common has a large English oak tree at its centre, and <b>London</b> <b>plane</b> trees are also found with the horse chestnuts {{around the perimeter of the}} common. Charles Jones was the borough surveyor responsible for the layout.|$|E
25|$|The street's layout {{is simple}} but elegant. Not {{dissimilar}} to Paris' Champs-Élysées, though more intimate in scale, {{it has a}} wide pavement {{each side of the}} street serving the retail outlets that line its length, and a parallel pair of two-lane (formerly three-lane) roadways. A paved median space runs down the centre of the street, featuring monuments and statues to various Irish political leaders. The famous large <b>London</b> <b>Plane</b> trees that lined the median for {{the second half of the}} 20th century were removed in 2003 amidst some controversy, with the oldest of these at the northern end planted c. 1903 being cut down in 2005 – all as part of an extensive regeneration scheme recently completed by Dublin City Council.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the former}} {{reservoir}} remains as a small lake within the park - this had been drained but was reinstated after a local campaign. The lake is surrounded by mature trees, including <b>London</b> <b>planes.</b> The south of the park contains an area of native plants on disused railway embankment.|$|R
50|$|The former Luwan District {{occupied}} most of {{the eastern}} part of the former Shanghai French Concession and some nearby areas.

500|$|Plant hybrids are {{generally}} given names that include an [...] "×" [...] (not in italics), such as Platanus × acerifolia for the <b>London</b> <b>plane,</b> a natural hybrid of P. orientalis (oriental plane) and P. occidentalis (American sycamore).|$|E
500|$|John Alcock, Bishop of Ely {{and founder}} of Jesus College, Cambridge, {{constructed}} the Bishop's Palace during his bishopric, between 1486 and 1500; of the original fabric, only the east tower and {{the lower part of}} the west tower remain. A [...] "startlingly huge" [...] <b>London</b> <b>Plane</b> tree, planted in 1680, still grows in the garden and is [...] "said to be one of the largest in England". Benjamin Lany, Bishop of Ely from 1667 until 1675, demolished much of Alcock's work and thus became responsible for most of the present-day building. This GradeI listed building is southwest of and close to the west end of the cathedral, opposite the original village green, now named Palace Green.|$|E
2500|$|The south (Brighton Road) end of {{the park}} is planted with shrubs, flowers and trees, while the {{northern}} section is given over to bowling greens, tennis courts and associated buildings. [...] Trees run down the eastern and western boundaries, and surround the war pigeon memorial in the centre. [...] The <b>London</b> <b>Plane</b> tree (Platanus × hispanica) is the predominant species; many were planted in 1992. [...] There are also Cappadocian Maples (Acer cappadocicum). A herbaceous border runs along {{the north side of}} the formal gardens, separating them from the bowling greens. [...] Formal flowerbeds line the pathways in the ornamental gardens and the central pathway from there through the bowling greens.|$|E
50|$|<b>London</b> <b>planes</b> {{are often}} pruned by a {{technique}} called pollarding. A pollarded tree has a drastically different appearance than an unpruned tree, being much shorter with stunted, club-like branches. Although pollarding requires frequent maintenance (the trees must usually be repruned every year), it creates a distinctive shape that is often sought after in plazas, main streets, and other urban areas.|$|R
50|$|Like other plane trees, {{its leaves}} are borne {{alternately}} on the stem, deeply lobed, and palmate or maple-like. It usually has flaking bark, occasionally not flaking and becoming thick and rugged. Flowers and fruit are round and burr-like, borne in clusters of between 2 and 6 on a stem. Considerable variation exists among {{trees in the}} wild, {{and this may be}} complicated by crossbreeding with planted <b>London</b> <b>planes</b> (Platanus x acerifolia), the hybrid of P. orientalis with the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis).|$|R
50|$|The former French Concession {{remained}} largely unchanged {{during the early}} decades of Communist rule in China. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, however, largely unregulated re-development of the area tore apart many old neighbourhoods. For example, the <b>London</b> <b>Planes</b> that graced the former Avenue Joffre were removed in the 1990s, only to be later replaced after public outcry. The old French Club building and its gardens, which used to be a sports field in the early days, were gutted and became the base of the high-rise Okura Garden Hotel.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to development by Germania, between 1905 and 1908, architect and builder Thomas Benton Ackerson’s eponymous T.B. Ackerson Company, simultaneously built and sold forty-two detached homes along Westminster Road in West Midwood for $10,000 each. Design {{and construction of}} these houses conformed to Ackerson’s “village in the city” vision and houses were graced with columns and fine details. Similarly, Germania advertised the neighborhood as “country living in the city.” To maintain it’s suburban aesthetic, utilities and train tracks were kept underground and streets were lined with trees, mainly <b>London</b> <b>Planes</b> and maples. Further keeping with the park-like ambiance, the original property deeds forbade construction of front yard fences.|$|R
50|$|Tree {{planting}} began {{immediately after}} the konak construction in the 1830s. In the 19th century {{it was the first}} nursery garden in Serbia,. Most abundant species are platanus, black pine, spruce and field maple. The Topčider <b>London</b> <b>Planes</b> (Platanus × acerifolia) are today among the oldest ones in Europe. The biggest and oldest specimen was 34 m high in 2008, with the diameter of the deck being 55 m, while the shade of its crown covers an area of 1,400 m2. Some sources claim it was planted in 1834 when prince Miloš ordered for a seedling to be planted in the lime kiln in front of the konak. Other, more reliable sources say the tree was planted in 1868, when 250 seedlings of Platanus were bought in Vienna, Austro-Hungary, for which a receipt still exist today. In 2015 it measured 37 m in height and was estimated to be 160 years old, while the crown has grown to 1,885 m2 and is now supported by the 17 metal piles. The tree is declared a natural monument.|$|R

The Germans forced inmate artisans to produce forged American and British currency, as part of a plan to undermine the British and American economies, courtesy of Sicherheitsdienst (SD) chief Reinhard Heydrich. Over one billion pounds in counterfeit banknotes were recovered. The Germans introduced fake British £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes into circulation in 1943: the Bank of England never found them. Plans had been made to drop British pounds over <b>London</b> by <b>plane.</b> Today, these notes are considered very valuable by collectors.|$|R
