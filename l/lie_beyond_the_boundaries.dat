Antitrust law, the law of securities regulation, the law of criminal solicitation and conspiracy, much of labor law, most of the law of evidence, most of the law of sexual harassment, along with scores of other examples, involve legal control of speech that is well understood to <b>lie</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the First Amendment’s concerns.

If we examine First Amendment salience more closely, we see that the First Amendment’s special political and cultural place in American society gives it a kind of magnetism that leads a wide variety of legal and political claims to migrate to the First Amendment.

The body of scholarship to explore and address the challenges of working with difference {{that are at the}} heart of a collaborative approach evolved earlier and, we argue, remains largely grounded in the social sector. Responding to a call for ‘less silo-bound and more integrated research’ into modern policymaking, our exploratory, comparative study of child protection and flood protection first highlights the strong parallels in the two domains and directs environmental managers and policymakers to the lessons they can gain from the accumulated scholarship on collaborative leadership. Secondly, due to the lack of comparative work to clarify ways in which the challenges might vary or contrast in the context of different inter-organizational domains, the comparative study also teases out differences, demonstrating that problem context does matter for collaborative leadership, that there are distinctive challenges for collaborative leadership in the flood protection domain with implications for both practice recommendations and theory building. For example, the technocratic tendencies of scientists and the dynamics of power and ideology, the historical alignment of the problem domain with neoliberalism, the potential protective international drivers and global imperatives of climate change and a consequent reversal in our direction of potential lessons to be transferred - to sustain policy innovation in the social domain.

Interpretation inevitably brings in subjective factors and we necessarily find ourselves creating scenarios and looking inward into the contexts of the human heart to speculate on the prehistoric moment when imagination, conceptual thought, and abstract knowledge became possible. In other words, using the tools of our objective sciences, we create narratives of origin that attempt to exceed their own limitations by blending the objective with the subjective. Generative anthropology embraces such subjectivity and tends not to avail itself of such empirical data. It is instead an outstanding example of what might be seen as a more literary or even intuitional approach.

40|$|Abstract Background Greater {{transparency}} and, in particular, {{sharing of}} clinical study reports and patient level data {{for further research}} is an increasingly important topic for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and other organisations who sponsor and conduct clinical research as well as academic researchers and patient advocacy groups. Statisticians are ambassadors for data sharing and are central to its success. They play an integral role in data sharing discussions within their companies and also externally helping to shape policy and processes while providing input into practical solutions to aid data sharing. Data sharing is generating changes in the required profile for statisticians in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, as well as academic institutions and patient advocacy groups. Discussion Successful statisticians need to possess many qualities required in today’s pharmaceutical environment such as collaboration, diplomacy, written and oral skills {{and an ability to}} be responsive; they are also knowledgeable when debating strategy and analytical techniques. However, increasing data transparency will require statisticians to evolve and learn new skills and behaviours during their career which may not have been an accepted part of the traditional role. Statisticians will move from being the gate-keepers of data to be data facilitators. To adapt successfully to this new environment, the role of the statistician is likely to be broader, including defining new responsibilities that <b>lie</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the traditional role. Statisticians should understand how data transparency can benefit them and the potential strategic advantage it can bring and be fully aware of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry commitments to data transparency and the policies within their company or research institute in addition to focusing on reviewing requests and provisioning data. Summary Data transparency will evolve the role of statisticians within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, academia and research bodies to a level which may not have been an accepted part of their traditional role or career. In the future, skills will be required to manage challenges arising from data sharing; statisticians will need strong scientific and statistical guiding principles for reanalysis and supplementary analyses based on researchers’ requests, have enhanced consultancy skills, in particular the ability to defend good statistical practice in the face of criticism and the ability to critique methods of analysis. Statisticians will also require expertise in data privacy regulations, data redaction and anonymisation and be able to assess the probability of re-identification, an ability to understand analyses conducted by researchers and recognise why such analyses may propose different results compared to the original analyses. Bringing these skills to the implementation of data sharing and interpretation of the results will help to maximise the value of shared data while guarding against misleading conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Au cours de la dernière décennie, {{plusieurs}} auteurs se sont interrogés sur les facteurs qui ont fait chuter le taux de syndicalisation dans certains pays et qui sont à la source de sa stagnation dans d'autres. Parmi les facteurs de nature structurelle, le déplacement des emplois de la grande entreprise vers la petite entreprise, de l'entreprise publique vers l'entreprise privée, du secteur manufacturier vers le secteur des services constituent ceux qui reviennent le plus souvent. Dans la foulée de la restructuration des services, on peut constater au Québec comme dans d'autres pays occidentaux, un mouvement en faveur de nouvelles formes d'organisation sociale visant la production de biens et services. Ces organisations prennent la forme de petites entreprises communautaires du secteur des services privés, ajoutant ainsi à la masse de salariés, pour la plupart non syndiqués, de ce secteur. Cet article vise à évaluer le potentiel de syndicalisation des salariés du communautaire. Cette évaluation qualitative est faite à partir de données recueillies lors d'entrevues dans six entreprises types du secteur communautaire dans l'Outaouais, de commentaires rassemblés lors de réunions de groupes focus d'informateurs-clé et de rencontres avec des représentants syndicaux. Les données sont analysées à l'aide d'un modèle explicatif de la propension à se syndiquer. Suivent quelques considérations stratégiques pour les organisations syndicales intéressées par la syndicalisation de ces groupes de salariés. The {{union density}} of private services workers is clearly {{lower than that}} of other categories of organizations. The average for Canada as a whole is 40 %, while that for personal services workers is less than 11 %. The situation is, to say the least, disturbing for unions, which have difficulty organizing these continually growing groups of workers. Community organizations {{do not appear to be}} exceptions to the major extrinsic rules of labour relations in the private services sector, with wages lower than the national average, an absence of job security, precariousness and low union density. Since the early 1980 s, these organizations have multiplied, for example, in the areas of job rcadiness, employment entry, health and social services, and so on. Even though these organizations have a social mission, provide services to members, function democratically, and are non-profit, they are nevertheless characterized by management-worker relations in the sociological and legal sense of the term, entalling an employment relationship that is the basis of unionization. There are appoximately 60, 000 paid jobs in the community and association movement in Quebec, including organizations involved in the defense of social rights and popular education, health and social services, child care, housing and recreation. In the absence of research into the unionization of community workers, the theoretical basis of this paper draws on the analytic elements developed by Wheeler for explaining the propensity to unionize and, from there, to build our own conceptual framework. Dissatisfaction is taken as the point of departure for the process leading to unionization. This dissatisfaction may result from working conditions considered to be inappropriate, a particular management style, or specific incidents that give rise to frustration. Feeling dissatisfied, frustrated, or even aggressive, the worker looks for a way to improve his or her situation. Several options are avallable. Economic theory predicts that the worker may decide to do nothing and put up with the situation, to leave the organization, or to put forward his or her point of view. If they decide to act, workers may do so individually, presenting their problem to management in the hope of solving it, or they may see the union as a tool that can be used to express dissatisfaction. The instrumental evaluation by the worker in large part depends on subjective elements that go well beyond the simple framework of objective utility. Thus, in order to fully appreciate workers' evaluations, their attitudes towards unions must be considered, that is, their beliefs and values regarding the movement itself (the affective dimension) as well as their individual perception of what they may gain or lose by unionizing (the instrumental dimension). Finally, a union must be willing to extend membership to the workers and offer them services to assist them in the process of unionizing. However, some unions have very restrictive policies in this regard. The elements of this explanatory model were studied in field research conducted in three consecutive stages between May 1997 and May 1998. While the first two stages examined the propensity to unionize, the third examined the supply of union services. The study's first stage involved field work in six community services organizations in the Outaouais region. In each organization, the researchers interviewed the person in charge of administration and, depending on the size of the organization, between one and three workers. The information gathered in the first stage was then explored in more depth during the second stage of the field work through three discussion groups with community workers. Finally, in the third stage, the supply of union services was examined through six individual interviews with representatives of the two major labour federations in Quebec. Examination of the comments made by employees in interviews and group discussions regarding their needs at work reveals that employees are generally satisfied with the team-based management of work and the autonomy enjoyed in carrying out their tasks. On the whole, our analysis brought out four major sources of dissatisfaction: (1) relations with the board of directors, in which the workers have little involvement in decision-making; (2) extrinsic working conditions, particularly salaries and benefits; (3) the funding of organizations; and (4) the work itself. Internai mechanisms for raising and solving problems that give rise to dissatisfaction are rare, although in some organizations employees are consulted directly regarding wage determination. On this latter point, it also seems important to emphasize that many sources of dissatisfaction <b>lie</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the community organization. In fact, low wages, poor working conditions, understaffing and job instability are elements of dissatisfaction that are in very large part related to insecurity and lack of funding sources, which are external to the organization. This has a bearing on the evaluation of attitudes towards unions and the instrumental dimension. The analysis of attitudes towards unions revealed that the beliefs and values of community workers are compatible with unionism. As a whole, both the managers, as well as the unionized and non-unionized workers interviewed, share the general values of the union movement and believe in its social relevance. However, they do not see unions as appropriate in the community sector, even though they believe that it is necessary to have an institution that plays a role similar to that played by a union. At first glance, it seems that the image held by workers of the effects of a union presence stand in the way of their willingness to unionize. In this study, the supply of union services, the third and final component of the framework used to analyze the unionization process, has two dimensions: the existence of union supply; and the particular form of union services offered. The interview data revealed that unions are very much aware of the specificity of community organizations as compared to private and public sector organizations. These characteristics serve to diminish the enthusiasm of unions, and cause others to reject outright the possibilities of organizing in this sector. None of the union officiais interviewed work for a union that is taking the lead in organizing this group of workers. The majority are content to wait for requests and to deal with such requests according to the criteria already mentioned. A minority simply refuse to organize in the community sector for reasons related to the number of workers concerned, the costs involved or the organizationai mission. Thus the union supply is relatively limited when it comes to unionizing community workers. Such workers must normally initiate the demand and approach the right union organizations, and the latter must perceive the group and the organization that employs them as viable. The specificity of community organizations can also affect the form of supply in that union representatives consider it essential to adapt union demands to the specific needs of the workers and community organizations. Certain demands that are proposed fit in well with the needs of these workers. However, none of the union officiais interviewed mentioned the issues of inflexibility that were referred to by so many of the workers. For their part, judging from the comments made during interviews and discussion groups, the workers do not appear to be aware that unions are willing to adapt their demand strategy to the particularities of the community sector. Rather, their opinions are influenced by their observation of labour relations in the much larger health and social services sector. Thus, the form of union supply and how it is perceived by community workers also have a negative influence on their willingness to unionize. The results of the empirical measurement of the constructs that make up the explanatory model of the unionization process lead us to conclude that, as a whole and according to the situation as it was at the time of this study, the probability of unionizing community workers is low. Although an examination of the needs of this group of workers suggests that they would have a high propensity to unionize, this assumption is quickly undermined by the workers' perceptions of the utility of unionization. In fact, although these workers have a large number of unsatisfied needs at work, most of them do not believe that unionizing will help them to improve their situation. Several aspects of supply of union services also help reduce the potential of unionization. In addition to being limited due to various inherent constraints, it is only partially congruent with the needs of community workers. There is also a strong perception among these same workers that union services are not well suited to their situation. The changes in the provision of health and social services in Quebec created by the trend towards ambulatory care could, however, have a positive effect on the propensity to unionize in the community sector. Indeed, during the past few years, many community organizations have experienced an appreciable increase in their funding base and in the number of workers they employ. Often this comes with control mechanisms regarding the mission of the organization and how its services are delivered. AH this is leading to significant change in these organizations. This may result in a degree of alienation among workers regarding the objectives of the organization and the services that it provides, thus partly countering the normative control referred to above. The increase in the number of employees also involves a degree of formalization of labour relations. However, as we have already seen, fear of the formalism brought about by unionization is one of the factors that contributes to resistance to unionization. Once established in the organization by management, this obstacle obviously diminishes accordingly. In light of the analytical elements presented in this article, as well as the additional discussions with union representatives and workers in the sector, we believe that it is possible to develop a union strategy to increase the potential of unionizing community workers. At the outset, this strategy should target certain community organizations and be based on realistic demands adapted to their needs as well as include organization and demand structures that are suited to the reality of community organizations. Due to their more stable funding base, labour relations that are often more impersonal and greater union viabiliry, organizations with a larger number of employees should be targeted first. The organizing campaign initiated by the union itself could be carried out on the basis of a set of issues identified through contacts with employees who are representative of the environment. Once the issues are identified, credible demands can then be developed, demands that then become a springboard to unionization. The relatively recent breakthroughs by the CSN in the day-care sector and the structures of representation they have put in place also provide interesting possibilities for unionization in the community sector. A lo largor de la ultima década, varios autores se han interrogado sobre los factores que han llevado a la caìda del porcentaje de sindicalizaciòn en varios paises y que son a la base de la paralizacion en otros.

Finally an analysis is sketched which reveals that the assertion "ought-to-sentences cannot be reduced to is-sentences" need not be tautological if it is meant to hold within a system only. If the pertinent normative remnant <b>lies</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> system <b>boundaries,</b> a value judgement can indeed be reduced to a factual statement, but merely within this system. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} shock-loading experiments which, {{as a result of}} solid-to-solid phase transitions, give rise to certain characteristic patterns consisting of two shock-like waves. We show that the single assumption that stresses in a phase cannot <b>lie</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> transition <b>boundaries</b> leads to a complete description of the observed phenomena. The model presented here is dierent from others proposed in the literature: it does not make use of kinetic relations and it accounts for the observed wave histories without parameter tting. The present paper focuses on the basic mathematical description of our model and it presents solutions to the complete set of Riemann problems which could arise as a result of dynamic interactions | including the basic two-wave structures mentioned above. In the companion paper, based on our Riemann solver and appropriate equations of state (EOS), we solve initial boundary value problems associated with a variety of experimental con gurations. There we show that, in presence of well-accepted EOS for the pure phases, our model leads to close quantitative agreement {{with a wide range of}} experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|Images {{and visions}} of New Zealand society, {{as they appear}} in {{selected}} works of fiction by John A. Lee, Frank Sargeson and Robin Hyde, are the prime concern of the thesis. The fiction selected for analysis broadly encompasses the decade 1930 to 1940. The dominant image is of New Zealand as the respectable society. However, Lee, Sargeson and Hyde emotionally reject the bourgeois-puritan world they portray in their fiction; all three writers seek alternative societies in which the human qualities they see as denied in bourgeois-puritan life can find expression. The world of the dispossessed, a world seen particularly clearly {{in the light of}} the deprivation of the Depression, plays a large part in the fictional images cast by each writer; sometimes it is depicted as a world separated from the respectable society, sometimes it is depicted as a world inevitably locked into the dominant and respectable way of life. However, none of the three writers can find an imaginative resting-place in the world of the dispossessed as an alternative way of life. Furthermore, the writers cannot extend their images of society as they experience it into a Utopian vision of an ideal society which is attainable within the existing social structure. The failure to create a practicable alternative persists in spite of a powerful interest, shared by all three writers, in the social world as they feel it ought to be as well as in the social world as it is. In their quest for alternatives, two of the three writers create visions of potential societies, that is of societies seen as <b>lying</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of <b>the</b> existing social structure. These are not realisable Utopias, as they would be if they were practicable alternatives; instead, they are wish-fulfilment Utopias. In other words they are compensatory in that they embody values repressed in orthodox society. The analytical approach adopted in the thesis consistently views both images and visions of the writers' imagined worlds as either direct or indirect portrayals of the New Zealand society to which the writers belong and which, in the end, shapes their fictional creations. Ultimately, it is argued, the writers' Utopias, like their images of existing society, lack the imaginative and social strength to stand on their own...|$|R

40|$|Although our {{central concern}} {{in this book}} is to explore {{the way in which}} {{migrants}} from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have set about making themselves at home in Britain, it is well worth remembering that immigration itself is anything but an unprecedented phenomenon. Throughout its history Britain has been a recipient of immigrant inflows, as with the Celts, Anglo-Saxons and Normans in the relatively distant past, supplemented by the more recent arrival of substantial numbers of Irish, Jewish and Eastern European settlers. Thus while the most recent wave of arrivals — in which migrant workers were drawn in from the Indian subcontinent and the islands of the Caribbean to fill the yawning gaps that emerged in the British labour market during the years of the post-war boom — is in some senses nothing but the latest episode in a long chain of developments, it has nevertheless brought about a profound and indeed irreversible change in the whole character of the British social order. First, Britain is now a visibly multi-racial society, in the sense that its citizens now include 2. 7 million people who are either wholly or partly of non-European ancestry. Secondly, and just as important, it has become a much more overtly polyethnic society. Inspired as they are by cultural, religious and linguistic traditions whose roots <b>lie</b> far <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of Europe, <b>the</b> new minorities have significantly expanded the range of diversities covered by local British lifestyles...|$|R
60|$|I shall, accordingly, {{attempt to}} analyze the process of inference, and the {{processes}} subordinate to inference, so far only as may be requisite for ascertaining {{the difference between a}} correct and an incorrect performance of those processes. The reason for thus limiting our design, is evident. It has been said by objectors to logic, that we do not learn to use our muscles by studying their anatomy. The fact is not quite fairly stated; for if the action of any of our muscles were vitiated by local weakness, or other physical defect, a knowledge of their anatomy might be very necessary for effecting a cure. But we should be justly liable to the criticism involved in this objection, were we, in a treatise on logic, to carry the analysis of <b>the</b> reasoning process <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> point at which any inaccuracy which may have crept into it must become visible. In learning bodily exercises (to carry on the same illustration) we do, and must, analyze the bodily motions so far as is necessary for distinguishing those which ought to be performed from those which ought not. To a similar extent, and no further, it is necessary that the logician should analyze the mental processes with which Logic is concerned. Logic has no interest in carrying <b>the</b> analysis <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> point at which it becomes apparent whether the operations have in any individual case been rightly or wrongly performed: {{in the same manner as}} the science of music teaches us to discriminate between musical notes, and to know the combinations of which they are susceptible, but not what number of vibrations in a second correspond to each; which, though useful to be known, is useful for totally different purposes. The extension of Logic as a Science is determined by its necessities as an Art: whatever it does not need for its practical ends, it leaves to the larger science which may be said to correspond, not to any particular art, but to art in general; the science which deals with the constitution of the human faculties; and to which, in the part of our mental nature which concerns Logic, as well as in all other parts, it belongs to decide what are ultimate facts, and what are resolvable into other facts. And I believe it will be found that most of the conclusions arrived at in this work have no necessary connection with any particular views respecting the ulterior analysis. Logic is common ground on which the partisans of Hartley and of Reid, of Locke and of Kant, may meet and join hands. Particular and detached opinions of all these thinkers will no doubt occasionally be controverted, since all of them were logicians as well as metaphysicians; but the field on which their principal battles have been fought, <b>lies</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of our science.|$|R
40|$|The York Street vaults {{lie on the}} {{periphery}} of the Roman baths in Bath, England. They form the southern perimeter of this Grade 1 listed site, but they <b>lie</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> of <b>the</b> museum ‘experience’. The vaults, rich in Roman archeology, sit in darkness, uncurated, unframed for the tourist gaze, uncommodified, crudely maintained and largely unseen (and unsuspected) by visitors. Yet these spaces have much to teach us about the nature of heritage and authenticity, and they offer a new lense through which to view the spatial and cultural value of the Roman baths themselves. The “estranged space” project* examines the spatial and theoretical relationships between the public (curated) realm of the museum and the uncurated, haphazard accumulation of the York Street vaults. Close examination of the commodified centre and the largely unknown periphery reveals a tense relationship between the two zones that could be described as one of estrangement. The 1964 Charter of Venice declares that historic monuments should be handed on to future generations “in the full richness of their authenticity” without describing what the term “authenticity” actually means. The 1994 Nara Document, the result of an attempt by UNESCO to define the word in heritage terms, introduced the notion that cultural heritage has both “tangible and intangible expression”. The York Street vaults, lying on both the spatial and heritage periphery, occupy an awkward position in relation to the terms described within Nara. The vaults clearly qualify as cultural heritage because of the extent of Roman remains and their inclusion within <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> of <b>the</b> Grade 1 listing. Yet their condition and spatial aesthetic do not sit within generally accepted codes of what heritage is, or what it should look like. Consideration of the status and meaning of the vaults becomes, therefore, a value judgement; the significance of the vaults’ tangible and intangible expression becomes open to interpretation. The peripheral status of the vaults offers a challenge to heritage orthodoxy. These spaces have never been handled within the terms set out in UNESCO ordinances – and yet they have accumulated a character which makes them a unique expression of human occupation, mixing the Roman, the medieval, the Georgian, the Victorian and the contemporary in an unself-conscious collision. These qualities, and the consequences of neglect and ad hoc interventions, are being explored through light, sound and film installations; indeed, the project seeks to re-present the vaults through art practices which legitimate artefacts from all eras without privileging the Roman The intention is to prompt a reassessment of the relative value of the spatial zones of the baths and the curatorial values which apply to each of them. The contention is that the abnormal other, the back-of-house zone at the site’s unseen periphery, can provide an alternative reading to the wider site - and that the vaults can, in fact, be considered as a dynamic source of “contemporary archaeology” and not merely the mute inferior of the tourist zone. * The project is being conducted with colleagues from University of the Arts London and the University of Plymouth...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 <b>The</b> {{definition}} of <b>boundary</b> conditions {{are an important}} part of all core neutronics models. In the CITATION model, used as part of the VSOP core simulation, <b>the</b> neutronic <b>boundary</b> condition is defined in terms of an extrapolation constant called a. In this work, the {{definition of}} a, the sensitivity of the neutronic results to changes in a and the appropriate value of a for the PBMR 400 MW core design is determined. The value a = 0. 4692 used in the current model of VSOP has been shown to represent a vacuum boundary condition. Decreasing this value in the VSOP calculations to 0. 3 does not change the reactivity significantly, but decreasing it further below that shows a significant increase in the calculated core reactivity. The appropriate value of a was determined from a transport 1 - 0 model using XSDRNPM calculations and yielded a value of a = 0. 11414. In this case, the core barrel and the reactor pressure vessel were included in the neutronic calculation, so that the influence of these structures which <b>lie</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> neutronic <b>boundary</b> in <b>the</b> VSOP analysis would be included. The change in reactivity in the VSOP model when the default (a = 0. 4692 representing vacuum) and newly determined (a = 0. 11414) are used compares well with similar MCNP and XSDRNPM calculations where either a vacuum <b>boundary</b> condition or <b>the</b> actual geometry (barrel and reactor pressure vessel) was modelled. These values are 249 pcm (VSOP), 150 & 40 pcm (MCNP) and 219 pcm (XSDRNPM) respectively. In this work both a corrected extrapolation constant a = 0. 11414 and a methodology to calculate it from a reference 1 -D transport solution was determined. Master...|$|R

40|$|Summary of results: This desktop {{study is}} a revised version of a report {{prepared}} in April 2005. It has been prepared to address the unique planning condition required for a modification of the original planning consent for the site which requires an increased land take for a proposed bin store. The site is in a location which can be considered to have moderate to high archaeological potential. Although much of the site had been truncated to level it for the ironworks buildings, substantial parts of it have been levelled up rather than down, which may have preserved intact any archaeology below the modern surface level. Preservation of palaeoenvironmental evidence may be enhanced by the damp setting, although possible contamination of the groundwater may counteract this. Evaluation for {{the main part of}} the site failed to reveal any deposits of archaeological interest but with peaty and alluvial deposits present in the deepest trenches as anticipated. Two hand dug trenches in the location of the new bin store which <b>lies</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> original site <b>boundary</b> located modern disturbance and a deposit of 17 th century or later date with residual medieval finds. A further phase of fieldwork is proposed for the latter area to mitigate the effects of development o...|$|R

We also present 12 CO J= 3 → 2 data that extends over a good fraction of the area mapped in the J= 1 → 0 transition. We compare the molecular data to widefield, narrow-band optical emission in Hα. While there are multiple outflows in the L 1551 cloud, the main outflow is oriented at 50 ◦ position angle and appears to be driven by embedded source(s) in the central IRS 5 region. The blueshifted outflowing molecular gas extends to the edge of the molecular cloud and <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> last HH object, HH 256. On the contrary, the redshifted molecular gas terminates within the cloud, short of the most distant HH object, HH 286, which <b>lies</b> well <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> cloud <b>boundary.</b> <b>The</b> J= 3 → 2 data indicate that there may be molecular emission associated with the L 1551 NE jet, within the redshifted lobe of main outflow.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), we have {{discovered}} four new globular clusters (GCs) associated with the M 31 dwarf elliptical (dE) satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185. Three of these are associated with NGC 147 and one with NGC 185. All <b>lie</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> main optical <b>boundaries</b> of <b>the</b> galaxies and are the most remote clusters yet known in these systems. Radial velocities derived from low resolution spectra are used {{to argue that the}} GCs are bound to the dwarfs and {{are not part of the}} M 31 halo population. Combining PAndAS with UKIRT/WFCAM data, we present the first homogeneous optical and near-IR photometry for the entire GC systems of these dEs. Colour-colour plots and published colour-metallicity relations are employed to constrain GC ages and metallicities. It is demonstrated that the clusters are in general metal poor ([Fe/H] < - 1. 25 dex), while the ages are more difficult to constrain. The mean (V-I) $_ 0 $ colours of the two GC systems are very similar to those of the GC systems of dEs in the Virgo and Fornax clusters, as well as the extended halo GC population in M 31. The new clusters bring the GC specific frequency (S_N) to ~ 9 in NGC 147 and ~ 5 in NGC 185, consistent with values found for dEs of similar luminosity residing in a range of environments.
