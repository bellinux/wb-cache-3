An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played {{no role in the}} decision. In 2008, he was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.|$|E

5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E

When Jim and Pam <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day, Pam asks Hank Tate (Hugh Dane) why he let the magician into the elevator {{when he was asked}} not to.

5|$|Despite {{the rule}} changes, {{there were still}} protesters among the spectators; {{in the first stage}} all riders except Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq {{punctured}} due to 125kg of nails spread along the road. The first stage was won by Louis Trousselier. Trousselier was serving the army, and had requested his commander <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tour de France; this was allowed for 24 hours. After he won the first stage and led the classification, his leave was extended {{until the end of the}} Tour. From 60 starting cyclists, only 15 cyclists reached the finish line within the time limit; 15 more reached the finish after the limit and the rest took the train.|$|E
5|$|Due to the threat, the {{government}} of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources.

Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category4 hurricane, {{much of the city}} was evacuated in fear of a repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek shelter, and warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time hurricane Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.|$|E

During this time, Bayern's players frequently {{appeared in the}} gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname FC Hollywood. Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned {{at the end of}} the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final. For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time.|$|E

Tintin, Haddock and Snowy <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Red Sea coast and board a sambuk for Mecca; they are attacked by fighter planes before Tintin shoots one down and rescues its mercenary Estonian pilot, Piotr Skut. The four are picked up by di Gorgonzola's yacht, the Scheherazade, but are soon offloaded onto the SS Ramona, a tramp steamer. Di Gorgonzola turns out to be another of Tintin's old adversaries, Roberto Rastapopoulos.

While karas from other cities observe the showdown between Otoha and Eko, Homura steps in to help Otoha. Otoha carries out Nue's request to kill him and his brother, depriving Eko of his new power source and stopping his entire scheme. Confronting the depowered Eko on equal terms, Otoha finally defeats him. Eko claims Otoha will understand his reasons after 400 years as a karas. Despite defending his human body and Yurine from soldiers ordered by the Deputy Governor to shoot them, Otoha proclaims himself as Tokyo's appointed agent, who will protect all its inhabitants. While Hinaru stays behind in Shinjuku as it is being rebuilt, Kure and Yoshiko have had enough and <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> countryside.|$|E

5|$|Whilst playing {{part-time}} for Distillery he {{also worked}} at the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company. Though the maximum wage in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined to <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> English Football League at the earliest opportunity, particularly so {{following the death of}} his mother in June 1955. He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat Glentoran 1–0 in the second replay of the 1956 final of the Irish Cup at Windsor Park. He played mostly at half-back in the 1956–57 season as Distillery finished sixth in the Irish League and ended up as runners-up in the Ulster Cup, City Cup, and County Antrim Shield.|$|E

5|$|William Legrand has {{relocated}} from New Orleans to Sullivan's Island in South Carolina {{after losing}} his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, {{a friend of}} Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold. Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for safekeeping. Confused, the narrator takes his <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> night.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman {{were the}} leading {{portrait}} {{artists of the}} first half of the century. John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720. His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of George Drummond the Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the New Town in Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary, which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of John Campbell of the Bank (1749), who was chief cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Whig, but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland Dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{marriage}} in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him {{money and the}} Governorship of Hanover if they would <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Continent. Ernest refused, and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace {{for the next three}} years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The Government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by £6,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about £ today), so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue, and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.|$|E
