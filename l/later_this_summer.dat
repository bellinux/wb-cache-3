40|$|Many {{ways to use}} it. I n t r o d u c t I o n In Spring 2008, ebrary {{collaborated with}} more than 150 college and {{university}} librarians throughout the world to develop an informal survey to better understand students ’ usage, needs, and perceptions with regard to e-books. A partial listing of librarians who contributed to the survey is provided on page 2. Colleges and university libraries of all types, worldwide, were encouraged to invite their {{students to participate in}} the survey. ebrary did not promote the survey directly to students. The survey was promoted primarily through ebrary’s newsletter distribution list, which includes more than 12, 000 college and university librarians, representing approximately 2, 100 individual institutions. Approximately half of these institutions are located in North America, the other half {{in the rest of the}} world. Participating students were entered into a drawing to win a free iPod of their choice, and every 25 respondents will receive a free ebrary T-shirt. Participating colleges and universities will be provided with institution-specific survey results upon request. Librarians were also invited to participate in a “cloned ” student survey to see how their responses differ from those of students. You may register to receive a copy of the “cloned ” report, available <b>later</b> <b>this</b> <b>summer,</b> at www. surveymonkey. com/s. aspx?sm=EQsGMKpGjexPPCixSYsSQg_ 3 d_ 3 d.

We truly appreciate the tremendous support from the library community, as well as their students, in making this survey a success. ebrary would especially like to thank Susa...|$|E
