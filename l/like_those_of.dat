5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Uranus, {{are thought to}} be {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E

5|$|Females of P. schultzi, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> P. labiata, try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, London {{divided the}} eight major subfamilies of Bovidae into two major clades {{on the basis}} of their {{evolutionary}} history: the Boodontia, which comprised only the Bovinae, and the Aegodontia, which consisted of the rest of the subfamilies. Boodonts have somewhat primitive teeth, resembling those of oxen, whereas aegodonts have more advanced teeth <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> goats.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E

Other platyhelminths have rings of ganglia {{in the head and}} main nerve trunks running along their bodies.|$|E

5|$|Interpretations {{of other}} {{features}} of Opabinia fossils differ.

50|$|Kim {{considered}} {{becoming a}} professional gamer {{as a freshman}} in high school. He began playing StarCraft: Brood War {{when one of his}} relatives took him to an internet café. As a newcomer Bisu used to watch others' games and particularly <b>liked</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> NaDa, as well as Nal rA's strategic gameplay. Nonetheless, Bisu did not have any particular role model and wanted to emulate all great players. During Bisu's MBCGame HERO (Pirates of Space at the time) years his gameplay was largely influenced by Protoss player Pusan, whose games Bisu frequently watched. Bisu's coach and player Best in turn taught him everything related to Protoss builds.|$|R
5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other insects, are centrolecithal in {{that the}} eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> cnidarians, (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), ctenophores' bodies {{consist of}} a {{relatively}} thick, jelly-like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia, layers of cells bound by inter-cell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete. The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one, {{and some of the}} cells in the upper layer have several cilia per cell.|$|E
