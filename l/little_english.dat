5|$|Baith Israel hired Marcus Friedlander as rabbi in 1887. Born in Congress Poland in 1862, he left Russia for England {{before he}} was twenty. Though {{speaking}} <b>little</b> <b>English</b> at the time, he graduated there from the London Theological Seminary, before emigrating to the United States. He was 24 {{years old when he}} assumed the post at Baith Israel, at the time the youngest man in New York state to be appointed to so significant a position of Jewish leadership. Friedlander served until 1893, when he resigned to take a more lucrative position in California at the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland. After Friedlander left, his name was, for reasons unknown, deleted from the synagogue histories, and the financial records and minute books dating from his tenure were removed from Baith Israel's archives. He was succeeded by Joseph Taubenhaus, the brother of Dr. Gottheil/Godfrey Taubenhaus, the rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim; another brother, Jacob/Jean Taubenhaus was a famous French chess master.|$|E

He was used sporadically, making only ten Premier League appearances, of which just two came in 2011. Teammate Jonas Olsson suggested that it took at least a season to accustom oneself to English football, especially for someone who spoke <b>little</b> <b>English</b> when he first arrived.|$|E

5|$|Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man {{obsessed with}} gold. Orson Welles was {{considered}} as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed. Fröbe was cast because the producers saw his {{performance as a}} child molester in the German film Es geschah am hellichten Tag. Fröbe, who spoke <b>little</b> <b>English,</b> said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, he had to double the speed of his performance {{to get the right}} tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during his meeting with members of the Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fröbe's natural voice can be heard above. However, he was redubbed {{for the rest of the}} film by stage actor Michael Collins.|$|E
5|$|Wail al-Shehri and {{his younger}} brother Waleed were from Khamis Mushait in the Asir province, which is an impoverished area in southwestern Saudi Arabia, along the Yemeni border. Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar {{neighborhood}} in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister.

25|$|Unlike {{most other}} areas of India, British rule meant no major {{upsetting}} of the community's traditional social system, although the traditional peasant landowning class, the Banias and Patidars, were absorbed into the Jain business community. The British {{did not have a}} financing vacuum to fill in the city, so their presence was limited to administrative and military spheres. Unlike other Indian cities, Ahmedabad lacked a comprador class or dominant, Western-educated middle class. Western education was slower to be introduced into the city than in most other Indian cities. There was very <b>little</b> <b>English</b> higher education available in the city and no English-language newspapers there in the 19th century.|$|E
