Note that edit boxes shown in the “Deconvolution” panel will automatically update depending on the selection of optimization method in the “ABIC Optimization” panel. The grid of ln(u), position shift, and <b>length</b> <b>correction</b> values are defined by three edit boxes for each parameter, where the first and the third boxes define the minimum and maximum values for the parameter, respectively, and the middle box defines the increment of the parameter value within the range (note that step values must be non-zero). Realistic ranges for ln(u) should be between − 10 and 10. It is usually a good practice to start with a large range and big increment (e.g., 1 or 2) to perform an initial optimized deconvolution, to guide the selection of a more constrained ln(u) range with finer increment. Position shift values should be within few centimeters (± 2  cm) or much less (±few mm) if the measurement start line of the system is well calibrated and void space {{at the beginning of the}} continuous sample is negligible. <b>Length</b> <b>correction</b> should be between − 0.5 and + 0.5  cm, which correspond to an empty or full last sample slice respectively, assuming the paleomagnetic measurements are collected at every 1 -cm interval resolution (see Oda and Xuan 2014).

40|$|The {{deliquescence}} {{of sodium}} chloride is size dependent for par-ticles smaller than 100 nm, with some discrepancies between mea-sured and predicted deliquescence relative humidity {{as a function}} of size. Two sources of uncertainty in current models are the solid– liquid/solid–vapor surface tensions and the curvature dependence of surface tension. Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to calculate surface tensions and their corresponding upper bounds, which compare well with measured values of liquid–vapor (LV) interfaces and significantly reduce uncertainty compared to ex-perimental estimates of solid–liquid (SL) and solid–vapor (SV) in-terfaces. Surface tensions calculated for nanoparticles in the 2 – 10 nm size range are related to the corresponding flat interface val-ues using the first-order Tolman length (δ). At 1 atm and 300 K, the Tolman length determined from the test-area method is of the order of 0. 1 nm with a precision between 5 % and 10 %.

30|$|Although the “Simplex method” in UDECON {{generally}} {{provides a}} fast way for optimized deconvolution, {{it is an}} unconstrained optimization method and can result in optimized <b>length</b> <b>corrections</b> that are beyond the − 0.5 to 0.5 -cm range, and the optimization may also fall in a local minimum. We recommend that users utilize the “Grid search” method (default option in UDECON) with large ranges and big increment values to perform an initial optimization. The resulting optimum ln(u), position shift, and length correction values can then be used as initial values for further optimization using the “Simplex method”. Alternatively, users can further optimize the deconvolution using the “Grid search” method with smaller range and small increment values for the optimization parameters. Optimized position shift and length correction values acquired from low demagnetization step data of a sample (usually with high signal-to-noise ratio compared with high demagnetization step data) {{can be used for}} optimized deconvolution for higher demagnetization step data of the same sample. For the “Grid search” method, this can be done by setting the “min.” and “max.” values of length correction or position shift both to the optimum value acquired from low demagnetization step data. This process will significantly increase the speed of deconvolution optimization in UDECON by reducing the amount of iteration needed to search for the minimum ABIC value. In addition, we recommend that users check the actual length of the sample if applicable.

Revised one-dimensional transmission-matrix models of open and closed toneholes are presented to extend the validity of the models based on the FEM results.
