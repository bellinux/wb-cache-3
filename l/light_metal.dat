5|$|Some general {{physical}} and chemical properties of light and heavy metals are summarised in the table. The comparison should be treated with caution since the terms <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> and heavy metal are not always consistently defined. Also the physical properties of hardness and tensile strength can vary widely depending on purity, grain size and pre-treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{adhesive}} {{surface was}} protected by a <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> case which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge. The inside of the case was fitted {{with a number of}} rubber spikes that kept it clear of the glued surface of the grenade. Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of the casing.|$|E
5|$|These {{properties}} make it {{relatively easy}} to distinguish a <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become less clear at the boundaries. Light structural metals like beryllium, scandium, and titanium {{have some of the}} characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead have some of the characteristics of light metals, such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|E
5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than <b>lighter</b> <b>metals</b> and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a <b>lighter</b> <b>metal</b> such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of <b>lighter</b> <b>metals,</b> and, <b>lighter</b> <b>metals</b> such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The CAST Cooperative Research Centre was {{established}} in 1993 as {{a joint venture between}} industry, research and government partners to carry out research and development in the area of <b>light</b> <b>metals.</b> Over the thirteen years since its formation CAST has developed a world class research program and, in addition to the significant application of outcomes by our industry partners, much of our research is being commercialised. In addition, CAST has developed a significant education and training program, a best practice technology transfer program for small and medium enterprises, consulting and design activities and established an alliance with Advanced Magnesium Technologies as a provider of their research and development needs. The development of CAST has been achieved by cooperation between all our partners who represent most of the <b>light</b> <b>metals</b> research groups and a significant proportion of <b>light</b> <b>metals</b> industries in Australia. The close involvement of the industry partners in all aspects of the operation of CAST has ensured we have a program of activities focused on delivering benefits to Australia’s <b>light</b> <b>metals</b> industry. This paper presents an overview of the magnesium research undertaken by CAST and other research groups such as the Centre of Excellence in Design of <b>Light</b> <b>Metals</b> and the CSIRO including their <b>Light</b> <b>Metals</b> Flagship program. Some highlights are new magnesium powertrain alloys, an alloy suitable for decorative and domestic applications called AM-lite, and new CSIRO casting technologies T-Mag and a twin roll strip casting process...|$|R

25|$|The {{anaerobic}} digestion {{process can be}} inhibited by several compounds, affecting {{one or more of}} the bacterial groups responsible for the different organic matter degradation steps. The degree of the inhibition depends, among other factors, on the concentration of the inhibitor in the digester. Potential inhibitors are ammonia, sulfide, <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> ions (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al), heavy metals, some organics (chlorophenols, halogenated aliphatics, N-substituted aromatics, long chain fatty acids), etc.|$|E
25|$|When {{stored in}} the {{presence}} of air or oxygen, ethers tend to form explosive peroxides, such as diethyl ether peroxide. The reaction is accelerated by <b>light,</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts, and aldehydes. In addition to avoiding storage conditions likely to form peroxides, it is recommended, when an ether is used as a solvent, not to distill it to dryness, as any peroxides that may have formed, being less volatile than the original ether, will become concentrated in the last few drops of liquid.To check presence of peroxide in old samples of ethers may be detected by shaking them with freshly prepared solution of a FeSO4 followed by addition of kcn appearance of blood red colour indicates presence of peroxides.|$|E
25|$|Sundsvall was 97.5 {{meters long}} and 9.2 meters wide. The hull {{was made of}} steel while the {{superstructures}} were constructed of <b>light</b> <b>metal.</b> The main superstructure was just forward of midships and housed among other the galley, wheelhouse and navigation bridge and the command bridge. The machine consisted of three Penhoët A oil-fired boilers which generated steam {{for two of the}} de Laval steam turbines of 36,000 horsepower, which in turn drove two propellers. This machinery gave the ships a maximum speed of 39 knots. The main artillery consisted of three 12 cm guns and the air defense consisted of eight 40 mm anti-aircraft automatic cannon m/36. In addition, there were anti-aircraft machine guns and torpedo tubes, and more than 40 mines and 16 depth charges could be carried.|$|E

25|$|Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence {{to produce}} a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design {{reflected}} the heritage of the marque, with a <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.|$|E

Curved side and roof panels for the Victoria line trains of London Underground, side panels for Bombardier's Electrostar trains at Sapa Group and side panels for Alstom's British Rail Class 390 Pendolino trains are made at Sapa Group. Japanese commuter and express A-trains, and British Rail Class 395 trains are friction stir welded by Hitachi, while Kawasaki applies friction stir spot welding to roof panels and Sumitomo <b>Light</b> <b>Metal</b> produces Shinkansen floor panels. Innovative FSW floor panels are made by Hammerer Aluminium Industries in Austria for the Stadler KISS double decker rail cars, to obtain an internal height of 2 m on both floors and for the new car bodies of the Wuppertal Suspension Railway.|$|E

The prefectural police force of Shizuoka actually has an anthropomorphic football as a mascot. The west of the prefecture was already home to the company team of Yamaha Motor Corporation who played in the Japan Soccer League and who would later go on to form Júbilo Iwata, but it was believed there was room for another team for the football-hungry population. An earlier attempt {{had been made in}} the 1970s with the local club belonging to Nippon <b>Light</b> <b>Metal</b> Corp., which briefly competed in the JSL Division 2 under the name Hagoromo Club.

500|$|The {{first rule}} of {{heraldry}} is the rule of tincture: [...] "Colour must not appear upon colour, nor metal upon metal." [...] The heraldic metals are gold and silver, usually represented as yellow and white, while red, green, blue, purple and black normally comprise the colors. Heraldic bearings are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a contrast of <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> against dark color is desirable. The same principle {{can be seen in}} the choice of colors for most license plates.|$|E
2500|$|The main duty of a heraldic {{device is}} to be easily recognisable. Certain {{tincture}} pairs are difficult to distinguish when placed atop or over each other. [...] Specifically, a dark colour {{is very difficult to}} distinguish if it is placed on top of another dark colour, and likewise a <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> is very difficult to distinguish {{on top of the other}} <b>light</b> <b>metal.</b> Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule. Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint with enamel (colour) over enamel, or with metal over metal.|$|E

2500|$|In a moving-coil microphone, the {{diaphragm}} {{is attached to}} a light movable coil that generates a voltage as it moves {{back and forth between the}} poles of a permanent magnet. In ribbon microphones, a <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> ribbon is suspended between the poles of a magnet. As the ribbon vibrates, a voltage is induced at right angles to both the ribbon velocity and magnetic field direction and is picked off by contacts at the ends of the ribbon. [...] Ribbon microphones are also called [...] "velocity microphones" [...] because the induced voltage is proportional to the velocity of the ribbon and thus of the air particles in the sound wave, unlike in some other microphones where the voltage is proportional to the displacement of {{the diaphragm}} and the air.|$|E
