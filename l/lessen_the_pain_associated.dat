5000|$|Anticonvulsants. These {{agents are}} used to manage severe muscle spasms and provide {{sedation}} in neuralgia. They have central effects on pain modulation. Medications such as phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), used to treat seizures, also can <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with postherpetic neuralgia. The medications stabilize abnormal electrical activity in the nervous system caused by injured nerves. Doctors often prescribe another anticonvulsant called carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol) for sharp, jabbing pain. Newer anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and lamotrigine (Lamictal), are generally tolerated better and can help control burning and pain.|$|E

50|$|Olympic lifters {{frequently}} use tape {{to cover}} the areas of their bodies exposed to friction while completing Olympic lifts. Tape is most commonly found on the Olympic lifter's thumb.

50|$|They offer Jesus wine {{laced with}} myrrh to <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> but he refuses. Mark then simply says they crucified him.

50|$|In this case, if Keech {{could add}} {{consonant}} elements by converting {{others to the}} basic premise, then the magnitude of her dissonance following disconfirmation would be reduced. Festinger and his colleagues predicted that the inevitable disconfirmation would be followed by an enthusiastic effort at proselytizing to seek social support and <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of disconfirmation.|$|R
5000|$|Sappho 94, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Sappho's Confession, is {{a fragment of}} a poem by the archaic Greek poet Sappho. The poem is written as a conversation between Sappho {{and a woman who}} is leaving her, perhaps in order to marry, and describes a series of memories of their time together in order to <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of separation.|$|R
5000|$|Realize, don't idealize. Use various {{strategies}} to <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of <b>the</b> breakup. One strategy is the silent ridicule where the one left behind imagines {{a flaw in}} the other partner and mentally exaggerates it {{to the point of}} humor (Phillips & Judd, 1978). Once the person is seen as human with flaws, it's easier to leave him or her behind.|$|R
5000|$|When the Old Gods Die"It is {{said that}} {{from the moment of}} birth, even of conception, every living thing has {{embarked}} upon an inevitable trajectory that culminates in its death...

[...] For a man intent on maintaining the traditional ways, cultural change may not represent life but the death of the old gods.|$|R
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes <b>lessens</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of grief itself.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with {{myocardial}} infarction may {{be treated with}} nitroglycerin or morphine. Nitroglycerin (given under the tongue or intravenously) may improve the blood supply to the heart, and decrease the work the heart must do. It {{is an important part}} of therapy for its pain relief, despite there being no benefit to overall mortality. Morphine may also be used, and is effective for <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with STEMI. <b>The</b> evidence for benefit from morphine on overall outcomes, however, is poor and there is some evidence of potential harm.|$|R
40|$|Does taking NSAIDs {{before a}} {{surgical}} procedure <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> during <b>the</b> procedure? Evidence-Based Answer: Taking NSAIDs before the procedure {{has no effect}} on the discomfort of intrauterine device (IUD) insertion (SOR: A, meta-analysis) Administering ibuprofen 600 mg before molar extraction may decrease pain immediately (< 2 hours) postoperatively (SOR: B, RCT). Use of NSAIDs in pain management of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy reduces nausea and vomiting postoperatively (SOR: B, extrapolated from a meta-analysis) ...|$|R

50|$|When alpha 1 receptors in {{the bladder}} {{neck and the}} {{prostate}} are blocked, this causes a relaxation in smooth muscle and therefore less resistance to urinary flow. Due to this, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with BPH can be reduced.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with RA is induced at {{the site}} of {{inflammation}} and classified as nociceptive as opposed to neuropathic.

40|$|Some {{students}} in the humanities take fright when introduced to the formal manipulations characteristic of elementary sentential & predicate logic. One way to <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of initiation is to start with word games, of which Lewis Carroll’s Doublets (section 1) is a familiar example. The paper presents some other games that successively introduce more {{of the features of}} systems of natural deduction (such as the system of Lemmon’s Beginning Logic). All the examples are in English, but in principle the games can be implemented in any written language based on an alphabet. ...|$|R
5000|$|Stonefish stings {{are both}} {{potentially}} lethal and extremely painful. The two most recommended treatments include {{the application of}} heat to the affected area and antivenom. People have used hot water (at a temperature no higher than [...] ) applied to the injured area which {{has been found to}} destroy stonefish venom, and causes minimal discomfort to the victim. For more extreme cases, antivenom has been used.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Transrectal {{ultrasound}} biopsy {{of prostate}} is a painful procedure. The {{introduction of the}} rectal probe {{is one of the}} major contributors to <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with this procedure. Drugs that relax the anal sphincter should theoretically decrease this pain. This study was done to compare the efficacy and safety of two topical medications that relax the anal sphincter, diltiazem and nitroglycerine, in decreasing <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 66 patients who were to undergo their first prostate biopsy were randomized to receive either 2 mL of 2 % topical diltiazem or 2 mL of 0. 2 % topical nitroglycerine or placebo 20 minutes before prostate biopsy. All patients also received 15 mL of intrarectal lignocaine. A 10 -point visual analogue score was used to record <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> immediately after <b>the</b> insertion of the probe, during biopsy and at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>pain</b> scores due to probe insertion, during biopsy and at the end of the procedure in patients who received topical diltiazem or nitroglycerine were significantly lower compared to the placebo group (p < 0. 001). There were no significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> scores between <b>the</b> patients receiving diltiazem compared to those receiving nitroglycerine. Higher incidence of headache and fall in blood pressure was noted in patients who received nitroglycerine compared to those receiving diltiazem. CONCLUSION:Topical diltiazem and nitroglycerine are equally effective in reducing <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>associated</b> with transrectal prostatic biopsy. Diltiazem is safer compared to nitroglycerine...|$|R
50|$|At this stage, {{there is}} still some hope that the {{relationship}} can be revived.
