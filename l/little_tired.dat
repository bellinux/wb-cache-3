The locomotive The Queen was too expensive to remove, so, rather than being cut up, it was incorporated as a feature of a restaurant on the concourse. It is still there today, but looking a <b>little</b> <b>tired.</b> The tender– the only original (and historic) part of the replica engine– was sold to a scrap dealer and cut up, although the springs and axleboxes were salvaged for use in the replica LB Atlantic project at the Bluebell Railway, and part of one side was rescued by the Slough and Windsor Railway Society, where it is now on display.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} career start, Scott ran for 157yards, but Friedgen {{thought he could}} have done better. Friedgen said, [...] "He was a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> from camp... Normally, he would break some of those runs. I don't think he quite had his third gear today." [...] Steffy played a solid first half, but in the second, threw two interceptions before {{suffering}} a season-ending thumb fracture. He was replaced by back-up Chris Turner who started {{for the remainder of the}} season. Regarding their loss, Delaware head coach K.C. Keeler said, [...] "This is not like a moral victory. I don't believe in moral victories... This was not a payday for us... We play a home game, we make more money than playing this game down here. When we scheduled this game, I thought our program would possibly be in a position to beat a solid ACC school." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1905, after {{publishing}} {{four other}} {{books in the}} interim, Hornung brought back the character Stingaree, previously seen in Irralie's Bushranger. Later that year he responded to public demand and produced a third series of short Raffles [...] stories in A Thief in the Night, in which Manders relates some of his and Raffles's earlier adventures. The reviewer for the Boston Herald thought that [...] "the sentimental {{side of the story}} has never before been shown so dramatically and romantically", and described the book as [...] "thrilling and exciting". Hornung's next book was published in 1909 and was the final Raffles story, the full-length novel Mr. Justice Raffles; the book was poorly received, with the reviewer for The Observer asking if [...] "Hornung is perhaps a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> of Raffles", and stating that [...] "it has not the magic or the 'go' of the first Raffles, and there is no good in pretending that it has". During {{the course of the year}} he collaborated with Charles Sansom to write a play A Visit From Raffles, which was performed in November that year at the Brixton Empress Theatre, London.|$|E

500|$|Stephen King {{called the}} series [...] "a feat of which only a {{superior}} imagination is capable", and declared [...] "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" [...] to be [...] "remarkable". However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Canning of IGN said the episode was great {{and gave it}} an 8.8 out 10 rating, {{saying that he was}} [...] "impressed" [...] with how the ending handled Jack and Nancy's [...] "not-quite romance." [...] Canning enjoyed the [...] "platonic romance" [...] between them saying, [...] "A lesser series could have simply had the pair hook up, break up and move on, but 30 Rock has drawn out the relationship with flirtation, what-ifs and possible future ex-husbands." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, found the episode [...] "perfectly" [...] and [...] "well-timed". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club said that the episode started [...] "out wicked strong, with everyone in the cast getting great lines". In regards to the two plots, Pierce said that the Liz, TGS, and Dale Snitterman story was [...] "stuffed with great comedic moments", while the Jack and Nancy angle just sat there and flopped [...] "around like a dying fish." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the Boston theme in [...] "Winter Madness"; his only complaint was that the episode {{had nothing to do with}} TGS, the fictional show on 30 Rock. [...] "I'm getting a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> of that. I want more sketches and NBC network shenanigans." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a <b>little</b> <b>tired.</b> I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E

"Do you not find," [...] he said, [...] "that {{with your}} short sight it is a <b>little</b> <b>tiring</b> {{to do so}} much typewriting?""I did at first," [...] she answered, [...] "but now I know where the letters are without looking." [...] Arthur Conan Doyle A Case of Identity (1891) Original layouts for the first few {{mechanical}} typewriters were in alphabetical order (ABCDE etc.) but the frequent jams suffered by experienced typists forced the manufacturers to change the layout of the letters, placing keys that are often pressed in a sequence as far as possible from each other. This allows engaging the second printing bar of the typewriter before the first falls down, increasing the speed of the mechanism. Equal distribution of the load over most of fingers also increased the speed as the keys of the mechanical typewriter are more difficult to press.|$|R
5000|$|Bosley Crowther, {{film critic}} for The New York Times said, [...] "After {{watching}} an endless succession of courtroom melodramas {{that have more}} or less transgressed the bounds of human reason and the rules of advocacy, it is cheering and fascinating to see one that hews magnificently to a line of dramatic but reasonable behavior and proper procedure in a court. Such a one is Anatomy of a Murder, which opened at the Criterion and the Plaza yesterday. It is the best courtroom melodrama this old judge has ever seen... Outside {{of the fact that}} this drama gets a <b>little</b> <b>tiring</b> in spots—in its two hours and forty minutes, most of which is spent in court—it is well nigh flawless as a picture of an American court at work, of small-town American characters and of the average sordidness of crime." ...|$|R
500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a <b>little</b> <b>tired,</b> just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E
2500|$|This {{conflict}} {{lasted only}} a few months however. The provisional government fell shortly after American Embassy officials were taken hostage on 4 November 1979. Bazargan's resignation was received by Khomeini without complaint, saying [...] "Mr. Bazargan ... was a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> and preferred to stay on the sidelines for a while." [...] Khomeini later described his appointment of Bazargan as a [...] "mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bush has {{questioned}} the scientific opinion on climate change, while stating [...] "I think global warming may be real", and [...] "It is not unanimous among scientists {{that it is}} disproportionately manmade. What I get a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> of {{on the left is}} this idea that somehow science has decided all this so you can't have a view." [...] National Journal wrote that Bush [...] "does not acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change".|$|E

Contactmusic.com noticed the track adheres to Del Rey's trademark sound, {{stating that the}} notion of her even having a trademark after one commercially successful album indicates that [...] "we haven't seen the last of her just yet." [...] Of the production itself, it was said that [...] "Ride" [...] is more accomplished than Del Rey's previous endeavors, with the strengths of the track outshining the flaws. The reviewer concluded by saying, [...] "All that doe-eyed “you can be my full-time daddy / baby” shtick is going to start getting a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> pretty soon, though, we reckon." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Kirchner {{began to}} {{experience}} health problems due to smoking and in 1931 Erna had to undergo surgery in Berlin {{due to a}} suspected growth. In 1931, he was made {{a member of the}} Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. As the Nazi party took power in Germany, it became impossible for Kirchner to sell his paintings. In 1933, he was forced to resign from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Kirchner became increasingly disturbed by the situation in Germany, writing: [...] "Here we have been hearing terrible rumours about torture of the Jews, but it’s all surely untrue. I’m a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> and sad about the situation up there. There is a war in the air. In the museums, the hard-won cultural achievements of the last 20 years are being destroyed, and yet the reason why we founded the Brücke was to encourage truly German art, made in Germany. And now {{it is supposed to be}} un-German. Dear God. It does upset me".|$|E
2500|$|A third {{sequel to}} Gamesmanship, was {{published}} in 1958 under the title of Supermanship. Its publisher, Rupert Hart-Davis, privately wrote of the book, [...] "Gamesmanship made me laugh a lot, and its two successors were just good enough (all three still sell prodigiously), but the world has moved (deathwards, you may say) {{in the last ten}} years, and Potter hasn't budged an inch. In truth the joke is played out, but he won't face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care." [...] Some critics agreed. The New Yorker commented, [...] "his methods and the point of view behind them don't seem as funny or as sharp as they once did, possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is getting a <b>little</b> <b>tired</b> of his own joke." [...] But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising [...] "the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long." ...|$|E

Wright Mills. Fascinated by words and language, by his early 20s Kapalan had edited translations of Plato and Aristotle. In his memoir Back Then (2002) Kaplan wrote: [...] "It was fun to work at Simon & Schuster. was not surprising to see editors staying long after hours to talk books, trade industry gossip, and joke over office bottles of Scotch and gin.
