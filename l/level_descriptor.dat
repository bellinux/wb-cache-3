The postgraduate diploma programme is open to undergraduate candidates, subject to entry prerequisites. The postgraduate diploma comprises twelve modules, amounting to a total of 130 credits, and is the academic equivalent of a [...] "graduate diploma" [...] - the matching academic <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> which is applied in certain other countries (e.g. Australia). The <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> matches the academic significance which it holds in the UK, per example. The programme is structured as a trimester programme, conducted from January/February to October/November of each year. Conservation specialisms within the programme include the conservation of historic metals, stone and mortar, artwork on paper, and ceramics.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBehavior {{recognition}} and prediction {{in public and}} private areas are still major concerns in video surveillance. Automatic surveillance systems are widely used to extract and analyze the complicated behaviors through logical and mathematical rules. We propose in our work three applications: crowd event detection, human activity {{recognition and}} motion pattern extraction. To achieve this goal, we followed an approach based on three levels of analysis. The first level is the detection of low-level features which are retrieved from the pixels of each video frame. The second level is the intermediate <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> which is extracted from low-level features and have more semantics. The third level uses the features of the intermediate level in order to produce human readable and useful information. For example, it will be responsible for displaying which event occurred and when. The advantage of this approach is that we can reuse the information of certain levels for different applications. This allowed us to use the optical flow as a low level feature and the direction model as an intermediate <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> in all our applications. We have tested our approach using different datasets and different types of video such as day life actions videos and traffic videos...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims at {{proposing a}} method for {{evaluating}} the environmental friendliness of a supply chain department in any organization. Supply chain involves activities that could affect the natural environment and if these activities are not properly evaluated and monitored, it could affect the natural environment and also generate ecological performance change. Design/methodology/approach: The model for the appraisal consists of 5 criteria and 30 subcriteria. The method is applied at 3 level; beginning with finding the relative weight of the subcriteria under each criterion using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), followed by computing the value associated with each <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> in a scale. Some subcriteria have 5 level descriptors (very strong/moderate /weak/very weak / no), some subcriteria have 3 level descriptors (always / sometimes/ never) and some have 2 levels descriptor (yes/no). Finally the method is concluded by the means of an additive model, whereby the weight associated with each subcriteria is multiplied by the corresponding <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> and summed up to get the limit/state. This methodology is called the weighing multiplication and additive model (WMAAM). Finding: Supply chain (SC) involves operational activities and for these activities to be environmental friendly, they have been categorized under criteria namely; green design, green procurement, green manufacturing, environmental management and green marketing. These criteria which consist of 30 subcriteria are evaluated in other to compute the overall environmental friendly appraisal of the SC department. Practical Implication: The study plays important role in understanding various areas to be monitored and considered during supply chain activities {{in order to achieve}} a green supply chain management or an environmental friendly supply chain. Originality/value: The main contribution of this work is to propose an effective methodology that guides SC practitioners on carrying out green performance appraisal of a SC department in any organization. </p...|$|E

40|$|Chapter summary: This chapter {{outlines}} {{the purpose and}} application of <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> currently in use in Higher Education (HE) and vocational learning and how they link to work based learning. It will consider the differing frameworks in use, how academic <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> contribute to qualifications and whether different frameworks articulate with each other. The main <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> for HE are qualification descriptors compiled by QAA, the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) and credit <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> devised by SEEC (South England Consortium for Credit Accumulation and Transfer). The <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> for the vocational sector are those overseen by the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) and the Sector Skills Councils (SSC) National Occupational Standards (NOS).

40|$|Objectives: Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{quantitative}} position of the <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> of the standard EQ- 5 D three-level system (3 L) and a newly developed, experimental five-level version (5 L) using a direct and a vignette-based indirect method. Methods: Eighty-two respondents {{took part in the}} study. The direct method represented a visual analog scale (VAS) rating of the nonextreme <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> for each dimension and each instrument separately. The indirect method required respondents to score 15 health scenarios with 3 L, 5 L and a VAS scale. Investigated were: (1) equidistance (Are 3 L and 5 L <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> distributed evenly over the VAS continuum?); (2) isoformity (Do the identical <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> on 3 L and 5 L yield similar results?); and (3) consistency between dimensions (Do the positions of similar <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> differ across dimensions within instruments?). Results: Equidistance without transformation was rejected for all dimensions for both 3 L and 5 L but satisfied for 5 L after transformation. Isoformity gave mixed results. Consistency between dimensions was satisfied for both instruments and both methods. Discussion: The <b>level</b> <b>descriptors</b> have similar distributions across comparable dimensions within each system, but the pattern differs between 3 L and 5 L. This methodological study provides evidence of increased descriptive power and a broadened measurement continuum that encourages the further development of an official five-level EQ- 5 D...|$|R

We report on classification results for emotional user states (German database of children interacting with a pet robot, recorded at our institute). We are modelling the following four classes: motherese, neutral, emphatic, angry. Starting with five emotion labels per word, we obtain chunks, i. e. meaningful units such as clauses or phrases, with different degrees of prototypicality: the more labels in a chunk belong to the class the chunk is attributed to, the higher its prototypicality. Six sites computed acoustic and linguistic features independently from each other, following in part different strategies.

40|$|In {{response}} to a questionnaire-based survey of teachers of English {{as a second language}} (ESL) (involving a sample of teachers from five different countries), more than one third indicated that the institution in which they worked either did not have an overall curriculum for the English courses offered or {{that they did not know}} whether it had one or not. Many respondents added comments indicating that the curriculum documents that were made available to them were inadequate, incomplete or unhelpful. In follow-up in-depth interviews with a sample of language programme managers, interviewees were asked a series of questions about their institutional curricula. All but one claimed that their institutions had curricula relating to their ESL programmes, that each of the courses offered was described in terms of levels with associated proficiency-style <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> statements and that there were ‘can do’ learning outcome statements associated with each course. However, a review of the curriculum documents provided by the interviewees did not always confirm their perceptions of them.

30|$|Participants’ judgements {{resulted}} in problematic misfitting and overfitting descriptors, among {{which there were}} qualitative and quantitative descriptors (see Table  6). Possible reasons for mismatch {{might be due to}} participants having difficulty in distinguishing such terms as “a wide range of”, “a large number of” and “a range of”. Take descriptor V 34, for example. This descriptor (knows about 6, 000 words, and words from the AWL (Academic Word List) and 1, 200 phrases, among which 2, 200 are active words) had a comparatively high logit value (0.90), and was rated as more difficult than its original B 2 level. According to the CECR, “Has a command of a lexical repertoire of 7, 675 words and 1, 870 phrases” is the requirement for advanced users. So the participants rated the descriptor one level higher. It is also likely that the vocabulary size stipulated in the CECR has greater discrepancy in comparison with the CEFR. Descriptor V 5 was also rated as more difficult than its CEFR <b>level.</b> <b>Descriptor</b> V 21 showed overfit, with an infit mean square of 0.35. The most problematic scaling lay with the B 1 + level in that there were different degrees of overlap between B 1 + and B 1, B 1 + and B 2 level. It is likely that the closeness of the intervals between B 1, B 1 +, and B 2 led to the overlap between these levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of environmental noise in urban environments requires {{the solution of}} a complex and non-linear problem, since there are complex relationships among the multitude of variables involved in the characterization and modelling of environmental noise and environmental-noise magnitudes. Moreover, {{the inclusion of the}} great spatial heterogeneity characteristic of urban environments seems to be essential in order to achieve an accurate environmental-noise prediction in cities. This problem is addressed in this paper, where a procedure based on feature-selection techniques and machine-learning regression methods is proposed and applied to this environmental problem. Three machine-learning regression methods, which are considered very robust in solving non-linear problems, are used to estimate the energy-equivalent sound-pressure <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> (LAeq). These three methods are: (i) multilayer perceptron (MLP), (ii) sequential minimal optimisation (SMO), and (iii) Gaussian processes for regression (GPR). In addition, because of the high number of input variables involved in environmental-noise modelling and estimation in urban environments, which make LAeq prediction models quite complex and costly in terms of time and resources for application to real situations, three different techniques are used to approach feature selection or data reduction. The feature-selection techniques used are: (i) correlation-based feature-subset selection (CFS), (ii) wrapper for feature-subset selection (WFS), and the data reduction technique is principal-component analysis (PCA). The subsequent analysis leads to a proposal of different schemes, depending on the needs regarding data collection and accuracy. The use of WFS as the feature-selection technique with the implementation of SMO or GPR as regression algorithm provides the best LAeq estimation (R 2 = 0. 94 and mean absolute error (MAE) = 1. 14 – 1. 16 dB(A)) ...|$|E
40|$|Document {{clustering}} is an unsupervised {{machine learning}} method that separates a large subject heterogeneous collection (Corpus) into smaller, more manageable, subject homogeneous collections (clusters). Traditional method of document clustering works around extracting textual features like: terms, sequences, and phrases from documents. These features {{are independent of}} each other and do not cater meaning behind these word in the clustering process. In order to perform semantic viable clustering, we believe that the problem of document clustering has two main components: (1) to represent the document in such a form that it inherently captures semantics of the text. This may also help to reduce dimensionality of the document and (2) to define a similarity measure based on the lexical, syntactic and semantic features such that it assigns higher numerical values to document pairs which have higher syntactic and semantic relationship. In this paper, we propose a representation of document by extracting three different types of features from a given document. These are lexical, syntactic and semantic features. A meta-descriptor for each document is proposed using these three features: first lexical, then syntactic and in the last semantic. A document to document similarity matrix is produced where each entry of this matrix contains a three value vector for each lexical, syntactic and semantic. The main contributions from this research are (i) A document <b>level</b> <b>descriptor</b> using three different features for text like: lexical, syntactic and semantics. (ii) we propose a similarity function using these three, and (iii) we define a new candidate clustering algorithm using three component of similarity measure to guide the clustering process in a direction that produce more semantic rich clusters.
