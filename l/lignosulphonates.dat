40|$|<b>Lignosulphonates</b> are by‐products {{from the}} {{sulphite}} pulping {{process for the}} manufacture ofspecialty dissolving pulps and paper. During the liberation of the cellulose, the lignin isfractionated and solubilised through covalent addition of sulphonic acid groups at variouspositions in the structure. The formed sulphonated lignin, lignosulphonate is then furtherisolated and refined. The amphiphilic nature of <b>lignosulphonates</b> has enabled them {{to be used as}} additives to varioussuspensions to improve their dispersion and stability. The by far largest utilisation oflignosulphonates is as dispersants in concrete. Here, <b>lignosulphonates</b> act by dispersing cementparticles to prevent flocculation, un‐even particle distribution and reduced strengthdevelopment. The dispersion is achieved through steric and electrostatic repulsion of the cementparticles by the lignosulphonate polymer. This behaviour is intimately linked with the overallsize and amount of charged groups in the dispersing polymer. Traditional modifications oflignosulphonates have been limited to removal of sugars, filtration and fractionation. Thesemodifications are not sufficient for utilisation of <b>lignosulphonates</b> in high‐strength concrete. Heresynthetic dispersants and superplasticisers are used which are considerably more efficient evenat low dosages. To compete with these, additional modifications of <b>lignosulphonates</b> are likely tobe necessary. The molecular weight and functional group composition have been identified anddescribed as the most interesting parameters that can be modified. Currently, no suitable method exists to increase the molecular weight of <b>lignosulphonates.</b> Oxidation by the natural radical initiating enzyme laccase is an interesting tool to achieve suchmodifications. In this thesis several aspects of the mechanism through which this enzyme reactswith lignin and lignosulphonate structures have been elucidated through model compoundstudies. Further studies showed that laccase alone was a highly efficient tool for increasing themolecular weight of commercial <b>lignosulphonates</b> at low dosages and in short incubation times. Immobilisation of the laccase to a solid support to enable re‐utilisation was also investigated. Modification of functional group composition of <b>lignosulphonates</b> was achieved throughozonolysis and the Fenton’s reagent, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and iron(II) acetate. Introduction of charged carboxylic groups was achieved through opening of the benzyl rings oflignosulphonates. It was found that a two‐stage process consisting of laccase oxidation followedby ozonolysis was an efficient technique to create a polymer enriched with carboxylic acidgroups with a sufficient molecular size. Oxidation by the Fenton’s reagent was shown to yield similar modifications as the combinedlaccase/ozonolysis treatment albeit with less pronounced results but with a large level of controlthrough variation of a number of reaction parameters. The Fenton’s reagent can therefore be aninteresting alternative to the aforementioned two‐stage treatment. These modifications are interesting for large‐scale applications not only because of theirsimplicity in terms of reaction parameters but also because of the ubiquity of the used enzymeand the chemicals in the pulp and paper industry.

[...] cmartin@irnase. csic. esLignosulphonates {{are complex}} biopolymers which are {{recovered}} from the spent sulphite pulping liquids. In the production of wood pulp using a sulphite pulping process, the lignins are sulphonated so they become water soluble. <b>Lignosulphonates</b> are used as binders, dispersants, emulsifiers and sequestrants {{in a host of}} products such as gypsum board, animal feed pellets and micronutrient systems. The properties of <b>lignosulphonates</b> are strongly affected by their structure, and therefore whether they are produced from softwoods, hardwoods, or grasses. In this work, we are using analytical pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in order to get information on the structure of <b>lignosulphonates.</b> Analytical pyrolysis is a rapid and highly sensitive technique for characterizing the chemical structure of lignin, allowing the analysis of small amounts of sample without prior manipulation and/or isolation. Characteristic features of lignins, including their composition in terms of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units can be established based upon analytical pyrolysis. Four different lignosulphonate samples (one from hardwood and three from softwoods) were selected for this study: # 261 (hardwood calcium lignosulphonate); # 264 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 265 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 266 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+). These samples were analyzed by Py-GC/MS in order to asses the suitability of this technique for their characterization. All the lignosulphonate samples released, upon Py-GC/MS, high amounts of low molecular weight sulphur compounds (sulphur dioxide, dimethyl sulphide, propylene sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl trisulphide and methanesulphonic acid methyl ester) arising from the sulphonate group. Lignin-derived compounds with both guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) structures, characteristic of a hardwood lignin, as well as some amounts of carbohydrate-derived compounds, were identified in lignosulphonate # 261. However, only guaiacyl (G) lignin-derived compounds, characteristic of softwood lignins, were present in the rest of <b>lignosulphonates</b> (samples # 264, # 265, # 266). The presence of only guaiacol and vanillic acid methyl ester in the pyrolysate of the lignosulphonate sample # 266 seems to indicate that this sample is more oxidized than the rest.

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{inception}} of metal precipitation by hydrogen, it has been recognized that adding some organic compounds to the reduction solution accelerates the reaction, inhibits plating and helps control the resulting powder properties such as morphology, microstructure and particle size distribution, to name but a few. The powder properties are directly linked to the particulate processes taking place during reduction. Controlling these properties is crucial for downstream processes. For instance, in fuel cell technologies, the porosity of materials used to construct the electrodes is a critical parameter amongst others. However, {{in addition to their}} relatively high cost, additives’ function and mechanism of action are not well understood. Furthermore most of the additives are used on a trial and error basis. Since additives constitute one of the major operational costs, it becomes evident their use should be optimized. One of the most plausible options to achieve this is to develop an understanding of their mechanism of action.

40|$|BACKGROUNDThe {{development}} of sustainable industrial processes demands the recovery and transformation of their by-products. The production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) by mixed microbial cultures (MMC) {{is one of}} the available routes. This study evaluated the possibility of applying a two-step PHAs production process using an industrial by-product, hardwood sulphite spent liquor (HSSL), as feedstock for a MMC. The first step consisted in the selection of PHAs-storing microorganisms using an aerobic dynamic feeding strategy followed by a second step, accumulation. RESULTSThe selected MMC, despite not being able to use the main carbon source of HSSL, <b>lignosulphonates,</b> revealed the capacity to consume acetate and xylose to accumulate poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) and glucose biopolymer. The maximum PHAs content was relatively low, 6. 6 %, with a maximum production yield of 0. 49 C-mmol HA C-mmol S- 1 during the selection stage. CONCLUSIONA MMC was able to adapt to HSSL by consuming acetate and xylose. The imposed operational conditions resulted in a partial selection of the culture, since only acetate-consuming organisms experienced a real feast/famine regime, resulting in low PHAs production.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of cementitious pastes {{has been studied}} by various means. Six different cements have been studied in main parts {{of the work and}} all of them have been characterized according to the Rietveld method {{in order to determine the}} exact content of minerals. Easily soluble alkalis were measured by plasma-emission- spectroscopy of the fluid filtered from paste. Three types of plasticizers namely naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate (SNF), <b>lignosulphonate</b> and polyacrylate grafted with polyether (PA) have been used throughout the work. The influence of the plasticizer type on the rheological properties of the cementitious pastes, their adsorption characteristics and their effects on heat of hydration of the pastes has been studied. Limestone has been used as a nonreactive model material for cement in some parts of the work. All rheological measurements were performed with a parallel plate rheometer. Rather than describing the shear stress-shear rate flow curve with the usual Bingham model resulting in plastic viscosity and yield stress, the area under the curve (Pa/s) was used as a measure of “flow resistance”. The effect of silica fume and limestone on the rheology of cementitious pastes The {{rheological behaviour}} of cementitious pastes, with the cement being increasingly replaced by densified and untreated silica fume (SF) or limestone was studied. Three plasticizers were investigated namely two types of polyacrylate (PA 1 and PA 2) and SNF. PA 2 proved to be the most efficient plasticizer of the three while PA 1 and SNF provided comparable results. The flow resistance was found to increase with increasing silica fume replacement when SNF and polyacryalte (PA 1) were added as plasticizers which was explained by ionization of the silica fume surface and possible bridging with polyvalent cations like calcium. The flow resistance decreased, however, with increasing silica fume replacement when the second and more efficient type of polyacrylate (PA 2) was utilized which was believed to occur since the cement pastes were better dispersed by PA 2 than SNF and PA 1. The silica fume particles could thus pack between the cement grains and displace water. An alternative explanation for reduced flow resistance with increasing silica fume replacement could be a ball-bearing effect of silica spheres. There was found a trend of increasing gel strength with increasing silica fume replacement of cement even though the pastes seemed to be dispersed by PA 2. Cement pastes with densified SF developed lower gel strengths than pastes with untreated SF. This phenomenon was attributed to more grain shaped agglomerates with lower outer surface in densified SF compared to dendritic agglomerated in untreated SF. Decreasing gel strength was found for pastes with increasing limestone filler replacement. Thus silica fume may be advantageous as stabilizing agent for self-compacting concrete preventing segregation upon standing due to a more rapid gel formation. Effect of cement characteristics on flow resistance Rheological experiments were performed on pastes prepared from 4 cements originating from the same clinker, but ground to different finenesses (Blaine). The results showed that the flow resistance increased exponentially with increasing Blaine number. No correlations between single cement characteristics such as Blaine, content of C 3 A, cubic C 3 A (cC 3 A) and C 3 S with the flow resistance were however found when cements from different clinkers were used. This finding indicates that cement should not be treated as a univariable material. However, the combined cement characteristic (Blaine•{d•cC 3 A+[1 -d]•C 3 S}) was found to correlate with flow resistance, where the factor d represents relative reactivity of C 3 A and C 3 S. The flow resistance was found to be either a linear or exponential function of the combined cement characteristic depending on plasticizer type and dosage. Correlations were found for a mix of pure cement and cement with fly ash, limestone filler (4 %), as well as pastes with constant silica fume dosage when the minerals were determined by XRD. Influence of cement and plasticizer type on the heat of hydration The initial heat of hydration peak was measured for the 6 main cements with 0. 32 % SNF, <b>lignosulphonate</b> and PA 2 by cement weight. Correlations were attempted between the maximum heat of hydration rates of the initial peaks with various cement characteristics. The maximum heat of hydration rate seemed to correlate with the product of the cement fineness and C 3 A content regardless of plasticizer type. The fly ash cement had to be left out of the correlation plots due to its low initial heat of hydration. The second, third and fourth hydration peaks were measured on the cement pastes with 0 - 0. 8 % SNF, <b>lignosulphonate</b> and PA 2 by weight of cement. <b>Lignosulphonate</b> was found to be the strongest retarder while SNF had the least effect on the setting time of the three plasticizers. No correlations could be found between the setting times and cement characteristics such as cement fineness, aluminate and alkali contents for un-plasticized pastes probably because the setting times might have been too close to each other to be able to obtain accurate values. Correlations between setting time and cement characteristics were however found for pastes with plasticizers. The setting times did not correlate with the cement fineness (Blaine) as a single parameter. The product of cement Blaine and C 3 A content, however, resulted in a correlation. Furthermore the setting time correlated with the cubic modification of C 3 A. It may seem that the setting times depend more on the cubic modification of C 3 A than the sum of orthorhombic and cubic aluminate. This finding indicates that the cubic aluminate modification is more reactive than the orthorhombic. The setting time decreased with increasing content of easily soluble K-ions in the cements probably due to the formation of syngenite, K 2 SO 4 ·CaSO 4 ·H 2 O, which removes some sulphate from solution that would otherwise retard C 3 A hydration. A similar correlation was not found between the setting time and the sodium equivalent. Cement interactions with plasticizers Three plasticizers were studied namely SNF, <b>lignosulphonate</b> and polyacrylate (PA 2). PA 2 was the most efficient plasticizer of the three tested even thought it was found to adsorb to a lesser extent on cement than SNF and <b>lignosulphonate.</b> SNF and <b>lignosulphonate</b> brought about comparable results. PA 2 was observed to induce flow gain within the 2 hours of rheological measurements which might be caused by the polymer expanding in the water phase and thus improve the dispersion of the paste. Furthermore the grafted side chains of the polymer are considered to be long enough to provide steric dispersion even thought the backbone might be embedded in the hydration products. Cement pastes with SNF and <b>lignosulphonate</b> exhibited flow loss as a function of time which indicates that the plasticizer molecules were consumed by the hydration products. The concentrations of superplasticizer in the pore water were not found to change markedly in the time range 20 - 95 min after water addition, indicating that most of the plasticizer molecules were consumed (i. e. adsorbed or intercalated in surface hydration products) within the first 20 minutes after water addition. The adsorption characteristics were found to depend on the plasticizer type. The adsorption curves of SNF and <b>lignosulphonate</b> reached a plateau at saturation characterizing high-affinity adsorption or increased continuously as a sign of low affinity adsorption. The adsorbed amounts of polyacrylate decreased, however, after saturation had been reached which might indicate that surplus molecules in the water phase compress the ionic double layer or that adsorbed molecules expand and hinder molecules in the water phase to attach at the surface (i. e. osmosis). The plasticizer saturation dosages were found to depend on cement surface area (Blaine), amount of cubic C 3 A and easily soluble sulphates. The saturation dosage of <b>lignosulphonate</b> seemed to have a dependency on the amount of soluble alkali that was somewhat stronger than observed for pastes with SNF. This difference might be caused by <b>lignosulphonate</b> forming complexes with solvated ions in a higher degree than SNF. Moreover alkali sulphates are furthermore often added to commercial SNF based products as the one used in this work. The best correlation, overall, was found for the product of cubic C 3 A and Blaine which is logical since high surface and cubic aluminate contents accounts for high cement reactivity and since the plasticizers are known to coordinate with calcium sites. Correlations were also found between saturation dosage with the product of Na eqv and Blaine as well as the product of Na eqv and cubic C 3 A. The investigations seemed to indicate that the plasticizer saturation concentration increase with increasing alkali content. These findings, however, are rather unclear. According to literature an increased concentration of alkali sulphate in solution results in both an increased hydration rate (which would lead to a higher plasticizer intercalation) and a reduced plasticizer adsorption (due to SO 4 2 - - superplasticizer competition). The easily soluble sulphates might, of course, entail the opposing effects of Blaine and C 3 A in a way that smoothen the correlation plots of the plasticizer saturation dosage with the cement characteristics. Effect of temperature on rheology and plasticizer adsorption Flow resistance and adsorbed amounts of SNF, <b>lignosulphonate</b> and PA 2 were measured at temperatures ranging from 11 to 40 o C. Limestone was used as a nonreactive model material for cement. The adsorbed amounts of SNF and <b>lignosulphonate</b> on limestone were found to decrease after reaching a maximum which occurred at approximately 25 o C. Decreased amounts of adsorbed plasticizer with increasing temperature might be explained by increased kinetic energy to the molecules or by an entropy effect. The adsorption of PA 2 on limestone seemed to be independent of paste temperature in the range of 16 - 34 o C which might be caused by low reduction of entropy at adsorption due to its short backbone and long, grafted side chains. The flow resistance of the limestone pastes generally increased with increasing temperature which may be caused by reduced amounts of adsorbed plasticizer and/or dehydration of the paste during the rheological measurements. Two types of cements were used to study adsorption and flow resistance with increasing temperature namely CEM I 42. 5 RR and CEM I 52. 5 R-LA. Amounts of plasticizer adsorbed and intercalated (consumed) by cement reached a plateau or even decreased with increasing temperature in the case of SNF and <b>lignosulphonate.</b> This finding might be caused by two opposing effects namely: increased number of adsorption sites due to increased hydration rate with increasing temperature and reduced adsorption due to increased kinetic energy and/or reduced entropy of the plasticizer. Amounts of PA 2 consumed by cement increased linearly with increasing temperature as might be explained by the experiments with limestone where the adsorbed amounts of PA 2 seemed to be independent of temperature. Increased consumption of plasticizer by the cements with rising temperature is thus probably governed by the increased number of adsorption cites due to increased hydration rate. The flow resistance of CEM I 52. 5 R-LA cement increased exponentially with increasing temperature as a function of temperature most likely because of the increased hydration rate. The pastes of CEM I 42. 5 RR cement were generally highly viscous and probably agglomerated. The flow resistance reached a plateau value with increasing temperature in this case.
