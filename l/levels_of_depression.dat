This study {{examines}} the individual differences influencing the patterns of hemispheric asymmetry in the perception of emotional words. This study explores how individuals’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and anxiety affects how they perceive emotional words varying in valence and arousal. Participants with a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> demonstrated more hemispheric asymmetry with a bias toward words presented to the left hemisphere, but participants with a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> had no hemispheric differences. Participants with a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> demonstrated a bias toward positive words, but participants with a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> had no difference in valence. Similarly, participants with a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> anxiety had a positivity bias, but participants with a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> anxiety had no difference in valence. These findings indicate similarities and differences in emotional perception in depression and anxiety and may represent some of the neurological underpinnings of these disorders.

40|$|IntroductionBoth {{heroin use}} and {{depression}} are significant health problems. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) {{can be of}} great benefit to heroin users. However, changes in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in heroin users during MMT are not clear. Gender and age are also important factors in the development <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> and whether gender and age moderate changes in depression in heroin users during MMT warrants further study. This study aimed to explore: (1) the trajectory <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in opioid users during MMT and (2) the moderating effects of gender and age on the trajectory <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in opioid users receiving MMT. MethodA total of 294 intravenous heroin users were recruited into this 9 -month observational study. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> was measured at the intake interview and at follow-up interviews every 3 [*]months. A latent growth model was {{used to analyze the}} trajectory <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> among the participants. ResultsDepression improved rapidly during the first 3 [*]months of MMT and slowly after the first 3 [*]months in both the female and male heroin users. There was no gender difference in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> at each follow-up point. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in the female heroin users decreased faster than that in the male heroin users. In addition, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in the younger heroin users decreased faster than that in the older subjects.

In contrast, primary care physicians were the least satisfied, followed by nephrologists, obstetricians/gynecologists, and pulmonologists.

25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> on days they reported receiving support, but lowered <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{provided}} us with mixed results {{as to whether or}} not a person's involvement in social networking can affect their feelings of loneliness. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social networking can change their feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way. Some companies with mobile workers have encouraged their workers to use social networking to feel connected, educators are using it to keep connected with their students and individuals are benefiting from social networking to keep connect with already close relationships that they've developed under circumstances that would otherwise make it difficult to do so. Each social networking user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online. In his book Digital Identities: Creating and Communicating the Online Self, Rob Cover argues that social networking's foundation in Web 2.0, high-speed networking shifts online representation to one which is both visual and relational to other people, complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety. In 2016, news reports stated that excessive usage of SNS sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression, to almost triple the rate for non-SNS users. Experts worldwide have said that 2030 people who use SNS more have higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> than those who use SNS less.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Anxiety and {{depressive}} disorders {{belong to}} the most prevalent mental diseases. Concomitance of anx‑ iety and depression is very strongly correlated with increased sense of guilt, low self-esteem and hopelessness, which significantly contributes to worse social functioning. The sense of coherence (SOC) is a factor which influences the {{ability to cope with}} stress and is inseparably related with health. A high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> SOC makes people more self-confi‑ dent and gives them strength to fight with the disease. Aim: Defining the correlation between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the sense of coherence and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in people treated for anxiety disorders, as a determinant having an influence on maintaining the optimal health. Material and methods: The research was carried out among 96 patients treated in the Anxiety and Affective Disorders Ward in Bydgoszcz. The sense of coherence was assessed using Antonovsky’s Orientation to Life Questionnaire (SOC- 29) and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: People suffering from anxiety disorders have a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the sense of coherence and a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> A strong negative correlation was found between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the sense of coherence and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depression: with a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the sense <b>of</b> coherence the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> grows and vice versa.
