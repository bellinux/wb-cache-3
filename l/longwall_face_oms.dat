40|$|This paper {{describes}} the conceptual model of primary rock failure mechanisms {{in the floor}} ahead of the <b>longwall</b> coal mining <b>face</b> based on underground observations and numerical modelling. During longwall mining, the stress fields and displacements of strata are constantly changing. High stress concentrations ahead of the <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> can initiate fractures in the rock floor that can, under unfavourable stress conditions, develop into secondary floor failure, where large displacements of strata can occur. Severely broken floor strata or floor heave can seriously interfere with mining operations. Underground observations indicate that the sub-vertical shear fractures and the shear failure along the bedding planes in stratified rock {{are the most common}} fracture types observed in the rock floor below the <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> To explain how these fractures occur, basic principles of rock failure mechanism are applied to an overstressed rock subject to stress concentrations typically found at the <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> The computational simulation of the progressive longwall mining operations was undertaken in stratified rock to model complex stress distributions ahead of the <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> and to simulate the rock failure in the mining floor.

Despite extensive research into the development of dust control techniques, it is still difficult to achieve Australian statutory standard of 3. 0 mg/m 3 at the face without loss of production. {{is because of the}} complex nature of longwall mining, its environment and the introduction of high capacity machines. The objective of this thesis 2 ̆ 7 research has to address this problem and advance respirable dust control in longwall mining through {{the development of a new}} dust control technique. Major aspect of the research has been to provide a better understanding of the air velocities and respirable dust behaviour, through field studies and mathematical modelling, to assist in the development of new control techniques. This research has co-ordinated several elements in developing a dust control technique and in understanding respirable dust behaviour. They are: (i) A literature review dust control on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> (ii) Field investigations in <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> to develop fundamental data set on respirable dust distribution (iii) A new 2 ̆ 7 multi-scrubber 2 ̆ 7 to control dust levels along the walkway of the face; the design and development of compact prototype scrubber and field tests of the scrubber system in operating <b>longwall</b> <b>faces,</b> and (iv) Mathematical modelling of a <b>longwall</b> <b>face,</b> using finite element techniques to simulate air flow patterns, dust distribution and to assist in the evaluation of dust control methods; field investigations to validate the modelling results. EThe first series of field investigations in four <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> were conducted to data on respirable dust levels, the spatial and temporal behaviour of dust in the face, and to provide input data for mathematical modelling. The dust concentration data were related to shearer location, face operations and time, and showed that large dust gradients occur, not only around the shearer, but also across the whole cross-section the <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> The surveys helped in gaining a better understanding of the respirable dust problem at the <b>longwall</b> <b>face,</b> and along with the literature review, formed the basis of the development of the new dust control technique.

Nevertheless, in very gassy coal seams, this methane released at the face can pose a problem because the shearer is a ready ignition source. Preventing methane ignitions at <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> requires four actions. The first is to provide better ventilation around the shearer to eliminate the ventilation eddy zones at the drums where methane builds up. These eddy zones are eliminated by mounting additional water sprays on the shearer to direct air into them. The second action to prevent methane ignitions is to install a water spray behind each cutter bit and regularly replace worn bits. Water sprays behind each cutter bit act to quench the hot metal streak that follows a worn bit when it strikes rock. The third {{is to ensure that}} no ventilation eddy zones are inadvertently created by poor placement of water sprays. The fourth is to ensure that the methane monitor on the shearer is in the best location to detect methane accumulations. ADDRESSING METHANE ACCUMULATIONS AT LONGWALL FACES 3 Cecala et al.

There {{is little doubt that}} the ever-increasing dimensions of <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> are consequently increasing the likelihood of major roof falls occurring, especially in those more challenging geotechnical environments containing poor immediate roof conditions at depths of cover greater than 250 m. As a result, the efficiency and safety of longwall roof cavity recoveries is being given increased attention and is more relevant than ever {{to the success of the}} coal industry. This has led to the now almost universal use of cavity fills during the recovery of major roof falls on the <b>longwall</b> <b>face,</b> albeit that there is industry discussion regarding what constitutes ideal properties for cavity fill material. The paper discusses the geotechnical reasons why it is believed that major roof falls on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> are becoming more likely with time and defines a conceptual geotechnical model for the cavity recovery process and the inherent ground control problems involved. Furthermore the paper considers the needs of mine operators during the cavity recovery process and how these can be best achieved. Specifically the paper contrasts foaming cements and phenolic foams as the two main generic types of cavity fill and ranks them according to such parameters as strength, foaming properties, rate of cavity fill, material cost, effectiveness, safety and overall cost effectiveness. The paper concludes that on a holistic basis, phenolic foams are the more suitable means of cavity filling on the <b>longwall</b> <b>face,</b> accepting that foaming cements are also an effective medium. However in the final analysis neither type of cavity fill is cost effective when compared to the benefits of preventing such cavities occurring in the first place through layout design, equipment maintenance and good operating practices and this is the major point of the paper...|$|R

Results of the numerical simulation show that when the width of the section pillar increases to 24 m, there is an 8 m wide elastic zone in the coal pillar and a saddle-shaped vertical stress distribution, which shows that the coal pillar can maintain its stability. So the reasonable width of the coal pillar is 24 m, which is close to the result of theoretical calculation (23 m).

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} establish a physical relationship between applied stress and permeabilities of different coals. Seven different coals, ranging from medium volatile to high volatile bituminous, were tested for stress-permeability relationship under simulated subsurface stress conditions. Prior to the experimental investigations, the stress conditions around a working <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> were considered {{in order to achieve}} an accurate simulation of the stresses experienced underground. Laboratory stress-permeability experiments were carried out by passing nitrogen gas through a triaxially stressed cylindrical coal specimen. A slightly modified conventional triaxial testing apparatus was used for this purpose. The stress conditions employed simulated the stresses created in the front abutment zone, the crushing zone, the stress relief zone and the recompaction zone of a working <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> A number of specimens of the seven different coals were tested under such stress conditions and stress-permeability curves were obtained for each specimen. The effect of moisture and the direction of gas flow in relation to the direction of bedding planes and major fracture lines were also considered in laboratory investigations. A relationship between the stress-permeability behaviour and the rank of coals used was established.

40|$|In {{recent years}} uncomfortably high {{ventilation}} temperatures {{have become more}} common on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> in Australian coal mines. Increasing strata temperatures at relatively shallow depths in combination with high surface ambient temperatures, particularly in Queensland, have led to high intake temperatures. These have approached trigger levels that introduce reduced face operator exposure times. With the addition of heat from coal breakage and goaf caving on high production <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> the working environment has become uncomfortable and continuous exposure over a shift is potentially injurious to health. Typical strata temperatures at 200 m depth are 35 ºC increasing to 38 ºC at 350 m depth. The added heat from broken coal and rock on the face and in the goaf together with heat from machinery, that has been progressively increasing in capacity, results in wet bulb temperatures exceeding 30 ºC and humidity of 95 % to 100 % on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces.</b> Management plans have introduced controls to limit continuous working times for personnel on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> in the hot and humid conditions. This impacts on productivity and in some situations requires additional personnel in the panel crews. Increased ventilation quantities are a partial solution because evaporative cooling rates and reduction in effective temperatures are minimal in high humidity conditions and less effective in the already high air velocity currents on faces. High air velocities also introduce other face environment problems with dust, increased pressure differentials and goaf leakage quantities which re-enter as additional warm air back onto the face. Spontaneous combustion risks also increase in thicker seam environments.

40|$|Disallowed gas {{concentration}} (DGC), i. e., a cease in production due to {{gas concentration}} exceeding the allowable limits, occurs frequently {{during the initial}} mining phase of <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> in Yangquan Coalfield, and seriously affects safety. The mechanism of DGC during the initial mining phase of <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> is determined by analyzing the outflow behavior of methane. The results show that mining can induce ground movement and lead to pressure relief, leading to desorption and migration of the gas in the adjacent seams. Gas drainage from the high-level gas drainage roadway is unsuccessful because it is normally located too high to connect to vertical broken crevices of overlying strata {{in a timely manner}} during the initial mining phase, subsequently, the released methane from adjacent seams flows into the goaf. This results in the occurrence of DGC at the <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> Thus, based on the analysis of overlying strata movement and the flow characteristics of gas from adjacent seams, we propose an adjacent seams gas drainage technique of a large-diameter blind shaft joined to the high-level gas drainage roadway (LDBS-HGDR) for the initial mining phase. A computational fluid dynamics simulation was conducted to obtain the optimal design of the layout parameters for the LDBS-HGDR at Panel 15201. Compared with the conventional rear high-level gas drainage roadway technique, the gas drainage technique of the LDBS-HGDR is advantageous in terms of ease of construction, low cost, and sufficiently long drainage hours. Moreover, the outflow of gas from adjacent seams can be effectively decreased with this technique, thereby eliminating the hazards originating from the frequent occurrence of DGC...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{model of a}} floor failure at a <b>longwall</b> coal mining <b>face</b> based on the multiple sliding block model. During longwall mining, stresses and displacements of strata are constantly changing. High stress concentrations at the coal face can exceed the rock strength and initiate fractures in the strata that can, under unfavourable conditions, lead to large floor displacements and disruption of mining operations. Underground observations of the rock floor and the computational modelling of the <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> indicate that two types of fracture dominate floor failure. Extensive lateral fracturing often develops along the numerous weak bedding planes that are typically present in the sedimentary strata while sub-vertical fractures form in response to changing stress abutments ahead of the <b>longwall</b> coal <b>face.</b> The fractures that initially develop ahead of the <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> are subject to a secondary movement when exposed ahead of the longwall supports. In response to the stress relief as the coal is mined from above, strata move towards the opening and bending of the floor occurs. If fractures in the floor exist, the floor blocks will displace {{in response to the}} floor movement and interact at the fractured surfaces. This analysis attempts to explain how the stress distribution develops within the broken floor during an active movement of floor strata leading to high stress concentrations at the floor level. The analytical formulation in this paper is supplemented by numerical modelling, and results are presented to verify that the analytical solutions are in accordance with the numerical predictions...|$|R

40|$|To provide {{insights}} for the optimization of {{ventilation systems}} for U. S. underground coal mines facing both methane control and spontaneous combustion issues, a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) {{study was conducted to}} model the potential for spontaneous heating in longwall gob areas. A two longwall panel district using a bleeder ventilation system with a stationary <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> was simulated. The permeability and porosity profiles for the longwall gob were generated from a geotechnical model and were used as inputs for the CFD modeling. In this study, the effect of methane emissions from the mined coal seam, including the <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> and overlying rider seam reservoirs on the gob gas distribution was considered. The spontaneous heating is modeled as the low-temperature oxidation of coal in the gob using kinetic data obtained from previous laboratory-scale spontaneous-combustion studies. Unsteady state simulations were conducted, and the effects of the coal 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s apparent activation energy and reaction surface area on the spontaneous heating process were also examined. ...|$|R
