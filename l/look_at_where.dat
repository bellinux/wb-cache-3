500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} miniseries a [...] "B", {{noting that the}} event [...] "loses steam when it {{moves away from the}} introspective {{personal}} elements of the past to detail Marceline and her friends' vampire hunting adventure in the present." [...] He also bemoaned the fact that only [...] "Everything Stays" [...] features flashbacks, arguing that [...] "rushing through those past events is a missed opportunity to offer a more comprehensive <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>where</b> Marceline comes from and how those circumstances have shaped her". With that being said, Sava was highly complimentary towards the voice acting, with praise being directed towards Olson and the actors who voice the villains; Sava wrote, [...] "The new characters' personalities are quickly solidified by the guest stars' expressive performances." [...] Eric Thurm of Pitchfork Media opined that Stakes [...] "includes all sorts of cool action sequences and, best of all, it focuses on the backstory of the show's most musical character: Marceline [...] But Stakes, as fun as it is, ultimately fails to fully deliver, mostly because of a lack of, um, stakes." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} post was [...] "a {{fascinating}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>where</b> Kanye's head is at these days", and complimented West for his [...] "humility and honesty". Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, {{but in the}} end it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego. ... One day, we'll all look back on this day and thank South Park for ushering in this historic moment in the life of Kanye." [...] Kerrie Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly suggested West's modest response was actually a marketing stunt to help sell his upcoming personal fragrance and energy drink. Mitchell wrote, [...] "Did he just get the last laugh on South Park? Conspiracy!" [...] In response to the media coverage, West wrote another blog entry on April 10 claiming he had only seen part of the episode and found it funny, but he had been working on his arrogance problem for some time and that South Park did not lead to his [...] "ego epiphany". The next day, he said in another blog entry that while visiting The Cheesecake Factory restaurant, the manager brought him a plate of fishsticks as a joke.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{to season}} eight and nine, {{there will also}} be a new main villain. The {{producers}} revealed that Darkseid will fulfill this role for the final season, but will be a different incarnation than his comic book counterpart. They explained that Darkseid's presence will be felt throughout the whole season, but that he will not actually appear until near the end; unlike in previous seasons where the main villain was present from the start. Instead, Darkseid's minions—Granny Goodness, Desaad, Glorious Godfrey, and others to be named—will appear throughout the season as the physical presence for Clark to battle. That said, Darkseid will make an appearance in the season premiere, digitally created to start with, but with [...] "more solid forms" [...] making a short appearance by the third episode. The plan is for Darkseid's presence to be established as he takes over the bodies of various characters. The executive producers also wanted {{to take a look at}} the history of Smallvilles Clark Kent in the 200th episode of the series. According to Peterson, [...] " [...] explore a little bit of the past, the present and the future.

2500|$|In May 2005, Tom Cruise, {{an actor}} and scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, {{condemned}} Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking {{in favor of the}} antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, [...] "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> , <b>where</b> has her career gone?" [...] Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "dangerous." [...] She said that he should [...] "stick to fighting aliens" [...] (a reference to Cruise's starring role in War of the Worlds {{as well as some of}} the more esoteric aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), [...] "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." [...] The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay [...] "War of Words" [...] published in The New York Times on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, [...] "In a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today." [...] On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was [...] "heartfelt." [...] Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes.|$|E

60|$|Having her lily {{handkerchief}} in {{token of}} adieu to the departing travellers, Mrs. Lambert and her girls watched them pacing leisurely {{on the first}} few hundred yards of their journey, and {{until such time as}} a tree-clumped corner of the road hid them from the ladies' view. Behind that clump of limes the good matron had many a time watched those she loved best disappear. Husband departing to battle and danger, sons to school, each after the other had gone on his way behind yonder green trees, returning as it pleased Heaven's will at his good time, and bringing pleasure and love back to the happy little family. Besides their own instinctive nature (which to be sure aids wonderfully in the matter), the leisure and contemplation attendant upon their home life serve to foster the tenderness and fidelity of our women. The men gone, there is all day to think about them, and to-morrow and to-morrow--when there certainly will be a letter--and so on. There is the vacant room to go <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> <b>where</b> the boy slept last night, and the impression of his carpet bag is still on the bed. There is his whip hung up in the hall, and his fishing-rod and basket--mute memorials of the brief bygone pleasures. At dinner there comes up that cherry-tart, half of which our darling ate at two o'clock in spite of his melancholy, and with a choking little sister on each side of him. The evening prayer is said without that young scholar's voice to utter the due responses. Midnight and silence come, and the good mother lies wakeful, thinking how one of the dear accustomed brood is away from the nest. Morn breaks, home and holidays have passed away, and toil and labour have begun for him. So those rustling limes formed, as it were, a screen between the world and our ladies of the house at Oakhurst. Kind-hearted Mrs. Lambert always became silent and thoughtful, if by chance she and her girls walked up to the trees {{in the absence of the}} men of the family. She said she would like to carve their names up on the grey silvered trunks, in the midst of true-lovers' knots, as was then the kindly fashion; and Miss Theo, who had an exceeding elegant turn that way, made some verses regarding the trees, which her delighted parent transmitted to a periodical of those days.|$|E
