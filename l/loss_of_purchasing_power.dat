40|$|The {{demand for}} {{reform of the}} {{financial}} system {{has focused on the}} dollar's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> international <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> (the Triffin dilemma) and its substitution by an international reserve currency that is not a national currency. The problem, however, is not the particular asset that serves as the international currency but rather the operation of the adjustment mechanism for dealing with global imbalances. In a preliminary report issued in May, the Commission of Experts of the President of the United Nations General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System made clear that the international system suffers from an inherent tendency toward deficient aggregate demand, a reflection of the asymmetry in the international adjustment mechanism. Even the simple creation of a notional currency to be used in a clearing union (proposed by Keynes) cannot do this without some commitment to coordinated symmetric adjustment by both surplus and deficit countries. Thus, the first steps in the reform process must be (1) to offset the balance sheet losses caused by the collapse of asset values and (2) to provide an alternative source of demand to replace the U. S. consumer and an alternative source of finance to offset the deleveraging of financial institutions. This can be done through the coordinated introduction of traditional, countercyclical deficit expenditure policies, on a global scale. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the real <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> OPEC Member Countries' oil revenues, which are subject to "the value of the US dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies" and "world {{imported}} inflation". The exponential weighting average formula with a broad basket of currencies is suggested. The basket of currencies is labelled as a broad currency basket and includes the major trading partners of OPEC Member Countries. The weights are normalized OPEC import shares of the countries of the basket and are updated and adjusted every year to incorporate a gradual change in the trade pattern. In other words, the dynamic trade pattern approach is incorporated in the calculations. The nominal dollar oil revenues of OPEC Member Countries are about $ 5, 099 billion during 1970 to 2004, of which $ 3, 725 bn (73 per cent) have been lost due to imported inflation and the dollar's depreciation. Imported inflation and dollar depreciation have had a respective 78. 6 per cent and 21. 4 per cent contribution to the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> OPEC Member Countries. The imported inflation rate approaches a stable low level, but OPEC still has a lot of concerns on dollar swings. The euro offers opportunities for many oil-exporting nations that have extensive trade relations with Euro-zone countries. Payments for oil exports can be invoked in euros at the prevailing dollar-euro rate on the day of a given contract, or any other trigger formula. This would immunize a major portion of OPEC oil revenues from dollar depreciation. Copyright 2005 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. ...|$|R
50|$|Whatever the cause, {{hyperinflation}} involves {{both the}} supply and velocity of money. Which comes {{first is a}} matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>power.</b> As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.|$|E

50|$|These theorists further {{argue that}} {{the very concept of}} excess savings is {{meaningless}} without the presumption of an authority which can define the proper amount of savings. Money saved represents demand for money which is a commodity like windows or suits. The result of spending saved money is to decrease the demand for money relative to suits or glass and therefore contributes to general price inflation (or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>power).</b> Such an authority would suggest that by controlling prices (forcing the exchange of savings for consumer goods) the economy could be bettered. This concept when enforced by governments is known as price controls and results in shortages when prices are artificially reduced below market value. A shortage of savings results in a reduction of capital investment as more resources are diverted from future needs to present needs. The shop owner was saving so that he could grow his business, but an outside authority determined that his savings were 'excess' and that by breaking his window the economy would be better off. Without free exchange there are no prices, and without prices there can be no economic calculation, and without proper economic calculation there is no means {{to determine whether or not}} a particular action will be 'profitable.' Therefore any authority that suggests that there might be an 'excess of savings' presumes the ability to make economic calculations without prices established by free exchange. Ludwig von Mises argued that this was impossible.|$|E
