5|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> {{the movies}} of February 2014, Chris Kirk and Kim Thompson at Slate argued that February's movies were {{statistically}} {{the worst of}} any month. Their evidence was the average RT ratings for all movies for each month between 2000 and 2013. February's averaged 45%, three points lower than January and September and four below August. February also had the worst month in the entire sample period, with the 2001 releases from that month coming in at 31%; 2010 and 2012 tied for the best February at 54%.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{believed they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were <b>looking</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> Operation Chromite, their amphibious assault far behind North Korean lines {{at the port of}} Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E

25|$|Lyon {{suffered}} {{their third}} {{defeat of the}} season the following week against relegation strugglers Nantes. Lyon came into the match apparently <b>looking</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich and proceeded to underestimate the West Coast side, who defeated Lyon 1–2 with two goals from the Croat Ivan Klasnić. The loss was promptly followed by a showdown for first place with rivals Marseille the following week. Other than battling for first place, the return of Hatem Ben Arfa to the Stade Gerland was {{on the minds of}} supporters, as well as the players. However, despite the hype and build-up leading up to the match, including achieving a record television audience, both clubs failed to score a goal as the match ended in another 0–0 draw. Lyon finally ended their winless run with a 1–0 victory over Caen with Benzema scoring Lyon's lone goal, his tenth of the league campaign. With the victory, Lyon were assured first place heading into the three-week winter break.|$|E
25|$|Parker was <b>looking</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> {{the future}} when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, BBC One {{televised}} all {{the matches}} live, although for viewers in Scotland the week 4 match between Italy and France was shown on BBC Two Scotland.

There was also a special Six Nations special <b>looking</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> the final week match on BBC Two but only for viewers in Northern Ireland.

500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun <b>looking</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> {{the possibility of a}} film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] in thinking about a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... As far as I know right now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious about saying oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch kind of movie, but I could be totally wrong about that. I don't know." ...|$|E

2500|$|In England itself, {{the series}} against Pakistan was {{seemingly}} a secondary consideration.

[...] A year later, England having failed to regain The Ashes, Wisden commented that [...] "the season of 1962 was spoiled to a large extent by rain and main interest centred on finding a team to go to Australia". Although the era of amateur status in first-class cricket was about to end, the three contenders for the leadership of England were all amateurs: Colin Cowdrey, Ted Dexter and David Sheppard. Dexter had just led England in its 1961–62 winter tour of the sub-continent and retained the captaincy for the tour of Australia.|$|E

At the time, each organization was <b>looking</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> {{the possibility of a}} future without federal abstinence-only-until-marriage funding and simultaneously found themselves exploring the question of how best to advance comprehensive sexuality education in schools. In May 2008, Advocates, Answer and SIECUS formalized these discussions with funding from the Ford Foundation, George Gund and Grove Foundations, and the FoSE Project was launched. [...] The purpose of the project is to create a national dialogue about the future of sex education and to promote the institutionalization of comprehensive sexuality education in elementary schools. In [...] "Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide," [...] Jessica Fields discusses that sexuality education seeks behavioral change, and believes that worded in specific terms, can be transparent and neutral. At the heart of sexuality debates, practice, and sexuality education lies a stable, rational, and unambiguous relationship between knowledge and behavior.|$|E
