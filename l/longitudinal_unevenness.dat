40|$|The aim of bachelor’s {{thesis is}} the {{evaluation}} of the influence of variable surface characteristics of roadways (skid resistance and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>unevenness)</b> on fatal traffic accidents in The South Moravian Region in 2011. This bachelor’s thesis contains characteristics of chosen high accident locations and measurement results of the longitudinal friction coefficient and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>unevenness</b> of road surface...|$|E
30|$|For a 2 D vehicle model, {{only the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>unevenness</b> profile {{representing}} the deviation {{at a point}} along the road is considered. Road unevenness is measured by two general types of equipment: profilometers, which measure the unevenness in a straight-forward way, and response-type devices, which measure the unevenness in an indirect way, as the dynamic response of the measuring equipment [8]. When the road shows discrete or periodic irregularities, such as joints, potholes, or cracking zones [13], a description by a PSD is not suitable.|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of future {{implementation}} of object-related condition forecasts {{within the framework of}} road maintenance management, the ability to make a forcast about the individual condition characteristics was to be investigated and forecast models created or existing behaviour models further developed. The work was based on the data material from 13 long-term observation road sections in Hesse, Germany. The measured expression of the condition characteristics was compared with the development of these characteristics calculated backwards in the models. This revealed that the cross-section progressions calculated from the VESYS rut model virtually coincide completely with the measured cross-sections; however, lateral material displacements which could be observed on site on the rut shoulders were not sufficiently reproduced. Using the further developed Brunswick crack model, it is possible to carry out a reliable simulative reverse calculation of the time at which the first crack damage was formed. However, on account of unreliable climate forecasts, a condition forecast proves to be problematic. The condition characteristic 'General roughness/trafficability' cannot be calculated in a model on account of the unsuitable VESYS <b>longitudinal</b> <b>unevenness</b> model. A concept for creating a deterministic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>unevenness</b> model was created. (orig.)

40|$|AlertinfraPL is a {{diagnosis}} tool devoted to heavy vehicles safety, which detects automatically dangerous areas of infrastructure. This tool considers {{different types of}} risks. The method {{is based on a}} multicriteria analysis, which aims at detecting dangerous configurations of infrastructure (i. e. combinations of geometric and surface characteristics values that may entail a risk of accident). Software based on these configurations was developed. It allows an automatic analysis of a road database containing parameters of infrastructure (radius of curvature, crossfall, <b>longitudinal</b> slope, <b>unevenness,</b> skid resistance and macrotexture) and indicates warning messages when dangerous configurations are detected. These risky configurations are called “warnings”. In a first part, the methodology applied in this study is detailed. In a second part, the warnings implemented in the diagnosis tool are described. In a last part, the validation of some warnings by statistical methods is presented...|$|R
40|$|Alertinfra is {{software}} used {{in safety}} study, which detects automatically dangerous areas of 4 infrastructure. This tool {{was developed in}} French research project funded by the French 5 Central Laboratory of Road and Bridges. The method {{is based on a}} multicreteria analysis, 6 which aims at detecting dangerous configuration of infrastructure (i. e. combinations of 7 geometric and surface characteristics values that may entail a risk of accident). The software 8 makes an analysis of a road database containing six parameters of infrastructure (radius of 9 curvature, crossfall, <b>longitudinal</b> slope, <b>unevenness,</b> skid resistance and macrotexture) and 10 indicates warning messages when dangerous configurations are detected. These risky 11 configurations are called Alerts. Each alert matches to a specific warning message, which 12 indicates the road parameters that can represent a risk for road users. Moreover, each alert in 13 curves is associated to an individual level of risk, than can be added to obtain a global level of 14 risk in the curve. Thus, all the curves of an itinerary can be classified depending on the risk 15 they represent. The choice of the alerts was done thanks to the statistical analyses of a 16 database containing the characteristics of 774 curves (geometry, surface characteristics, 17 accidents). The validation of the alerts was realized on a second database containing 470 other 18 curves. The paper presents the software Alertinfra in a first step and some examples of use of 19 this tool in safety study in a second step...|$|R
40|$|Road surface {{condition}} measurements are in Austria periodically obtained {{for all the}} federal roads. These measurements refer to 50 m long road sections and {{form the basis for}} an evaluation of {{the current state of the}} road network as well as the subsequent analysis of maintenance strategies and their funding requirements. In order to systematically utilize the information contained in these measurement series, homogeneous sections have to be identified for <b>longitudinal</b> and transversal <b>unevenness</b> as well as skid resistance. For that purpose a recently published segmentation algorithm has been implemented as a stand-alone computer program that is capable of processing huge amounts of data in batch mode. This software takes a measurement series as input and identifies the borders of homogeneous sections by evaluating the statistical properties of the measurement series under study. A variety of quantities representing the homogeneous sections is calculated and can be exported in widely understood file formats for further processing. While the program is able to execute fully automatically, the user has the option to control all aspects of the implemented algorithm and might alter any suggested segmentation using the graphical interface of the application. About 10, 000 km of Austrian federal roads of category B have been successfully processed using this computer program, and homogeneous sections based respectively on measurements of the International Roughness Index, rut depth, and skid resistance have been identified and stored in the Austrian Pavement Management System. The program is available through the web pag...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} of the transverse profile measurement data collected in the FILTER Experiment are presented. The purpose of the analysis was to determine the repeatabilities, reproducibilities, and accuracies of the measurements. Application of the International Organization for Standardization 5725 standard resulted in the detection of a significant proportion of outlying results with most if not all devices. After removal of the outliers, average standard deviations (SDs) for repeatability were typically 0. 1 percent for cross fall, 0. 5 to 0. 9 nun for rut depth, and 0. 25 mm for water depth: cross-fall measurements exhibited an average SD for reproducibility of 0. 5 percent, for rut depth measurements the values were 1. 7 to 2. 7 mm, and for water depth measurements the values were 2. 1 to 2. 2 mm. The overall SD for the accuracies of the profile measurements was found to be 1. 9 mm. The rather wide range of (in) accuracy (0. 8 to 3. 2 mm) among the different test sections is explained by the influence of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>unevenness</b> (international roughness index). Operating speed in the speed range used in the experiment had no significant influence on most measurements obtained. Moreover, speed had no significant influence on the repeatabilities or the reproducibilities of the indices or on profile measurement accuracy. Averaging distance had a significant influence on the SD for repeatability, which decreased by a factor of 2 to 4 when the averaging distance increased from 50 to 500 m. The reproducibilities of the indices did not significantly depend on the averaging distance in any systematic way...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{was based on}} the hypothesis that the stochastic longitudinal profile of a flexible pavement by the stimulation of lorries' self-frequencies leads to irregular wheel load that causes an increase of amplitude in the area of self-frequency. Nine test sections of federal highways and provincial roads were identified as roads with pregnant corrugated deformation in their longitudinal profile. The highway assessment made in three measurement cycles contained the recording of longitudinal and transverse profiles, bearing capacity measurements and visual assessments. In addition core samples were taken and exploratory excavations had been made to characterise the different pavements. The comparative graphic evaluation of the <b>unevenness</b> of <b>longitudinal</b> profiles by a moving average of a length of 10 m with the bearing capacity longitudinal profiles {{as a result of the}} deflections in the centre of load leads to the following theses: Two of nine test sections showed tight relation between the <b>unevenness</b> <b>longitudinal</b> profile and the bearing capacity longitudinal profile. Comparing both profiles in one case there was a congenial in the other case a contrary development. Five of the remaining seven test sections showed that relationship too but in shorter terms; there were also congenial and contrary developments. The following attempts to prove the apparently particularly existing relations in some characteristics between the uneven and the bearing capacity longitudinal profiles in a mathematical way could not bring a satisfactory result. Due to the importance of the examined relationship for highway assessment and its analysis exploration should continue in a modified way. Therefore the exploration based on a wide range of test sections should contain nondestructive tests to examine the different layer thicknesses beside the highway assessment of unevenness and bearing capacity longitudinal profiles.
