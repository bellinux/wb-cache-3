25|$|In {{return for}} free lodging, and some tuition for the {{entrance}} exam (this has been questioned) Owen worked as <b>lay</b> <b>assistant</b> to the Vicar of Dunsden near Reading. During {{this time he}} attended classes at University College, Reading (now the University of Reading), in botany and later, {{at the urging of}} the head of the English Department, took free lessons in Old English. His time spent at Dunsden parish led him to disillusionment with the Church, both in its ceremony and its failure to provide aid for those in need.|$|E

[...] "I believe {{one of your}} {{charitable}} {{institutions is}} sending them out, {{and there seems to}} be a clergyman, who has a curate and a <b>lay</b> <b>assistant</b> to help him, in charge. The assistant won't be available while this rolling lasts, and the other two very naturally prefer the saloon. In a way, that's comprehensible." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had just}} {{finished}} his course at King's College, and taken a fair degree, and he was examining advertisements, {{with a view to}} obtaining some employment in teaching that would put a sufficient sum in his hands to enable him to spend a year at one of the theological colleges, in preparation for Ordination. His mother was not happy about it, she never would be quite easy as to Armine's roughing it at any chance school, and she had much rather he had spent the intervening year in working as a <b>lay</b> <b>assistant</b> to Mr. Ogilvie, who had promised to give him a title for Orders, and would direct his reading.|$|E

2500|$|High Church, {{especially}} {{the very high}} Anglo-Catholic movement, is ritually inclined towards the use of incense, formal hymns, and {{a higher degree of}} ceremony. In addition to clergy vesting in albs, stoles and chasubles, the <b>lay</b> <b>assistants</b> may also be vested in cassock and surplice. The sung Eucharist tends to be emphasized in High Church congregations, with Anglo-Catholic congregations and celebrants using sung services almost exclusively. Marian devotion is sometimes seen in the Anglo-Catholic and some High Church parishes.|$|R
50|$|The {{focus of}} church {{life is the}} Sunday Communion and other services, most {{commonly}} celebrated at 11:00 a.m. The liturgy {{is similar to that}} in use in the Roman Catholic Church. The language is entirely Norwegian, apart from the Kyrie Eleison, and the singing of hymns accompanied by organ music is central. A priest (often with <b>lay</b> <b>assistants)</b> celebrates the service, wearing an alb and stole. In addition, a chasuble is worn by the priest during the Eucharist and, increasingly, during the whole service.|$|R

"I {{have sent}} him to the toll at the Gemsbock's Pass," [...] replied Sir Eberhard, who had by this time come up the stairs, {{followed}} by Brother Peter and the two <b>lay</b> <b>assistants.</b> Then, as Christina turned on him her startled, terrified eyes in dismay and reproach for such thoughtlessness, he came towards her, and, bending his head and opening his hand, he showed on his palm two gold rings.

2500|$|Choir {{dress is}} the {{traditional}} vesture of the clerics, seminarians and religious of Christian churches worn for public prayer and {{the administration of the}} sacraments except when celebrating or concelebrating the Eucharist. It differs from the vestments worn by the celebrants of the Eucharist, being normally made of fabrics such as wool, cotton or silk, as opposed to the fine brocades used in vestments. It may also be worn by <b>lay</b> <b>assistants</b> such as acolytes and choirs. [...] It was abandoned by most of the Churches which originated in the sixteenth-century Reformation.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Yucatan was {{declared}} an independent state, the Yucatán Peninsula {{was divided into}} two independent warring states: a Hispanic state in the west that kept the Maya in a slave status, and a Maya free state in the east. For {{the first time in}} centuries, the Maya were in charge of a state that supported their indigenous faith. (The Roman Church had consistently refused even to ordain native Maya as priests). Previously, the village <b>lay</b> <b>assistants,</b> maestros cantores, who were sons of Maya priests, often acted as members of their fathers' profession as well, (Clendenin 1978).|$|R

60|$|After a time, the friar, {{finding his}} traffic slack, thought fit to remove, {{with his two}} <b>lay</b> <b>assistants,</b> outside the chapel, and try the effects of an out-of-door sermon.

50|$|The first Christian {{mission in}} the area was {{sponsored}} by the Church Mission Society in 1806, but the two missionaries who were sent succumbed to the unhealthy climate. A second attempt in 1855 by missionaries from Barbados was more successful; the Reverend James Humble Leacock landed with a <b>lay</b> <b>assistant,</b> John Duport, and in 1856 built the first church, St. James, in Fallanjhia in the Rio Pongas area. Although Leacock died that year, Duport was later ordained by the Bishop of Sierra Leone.|$|E

He travelled with the nuns {{all over the country and}} helped them organize the peasants and the lumad communities. “Know your rights!” was one of his battle cries; he believed that by raising the people’s consciousness of their human rights can they be empowered to defend themselves against the oppression and exploitation of the dictatorship and its powerful cronies.|$|E
5000|$|... 5. Isabel Carter Heyward {{was born}} in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1945. She earned a B.A. from Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1967 and then moved to New York to begin a B.D. at Union Theological Seminary. Finding that she wasn’t sure where she stood {{regarding}} her involvement in the church, she left Union {{after a year and}} moved back home to Charlotte to work at her home parish, St. Martin’s Episcopal Church, as a <b>lay</b> <b>assistant,</b> doing all the duties except those reserved for priests. In 1971 she returned to New York and pursued an M.A. in the comparative study of religion at Columbia University before completing an M.Div. back at Union in 1973. She later went on to earn a Ph.D. in systematic theology from Union in 1980. Feeling a call to the priesthood, Heyward was ordained a deacon on June 9, 1973, in the Diocese of New York and ordained to the priesthood in Philadelphia at 29 in 1974. Following this ordination, Heyward and fellow priest Suzanne Hiatt were hired as assistant professors at the Episcopal Divinity School (EDS) in January 1975, where she received tenure in 1981. Heyward’s teaching at EDS focused on 19th century Anglican theology, feminist liberation theology, and the theology of sexuality. She has published numerous books on these topics during her tenure, including A Priest Forever, an autobiographical account of her ordination published in 1976. Heyward retired from teaching in 2005 and moved back to North Carolina.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{important}} Syriac Orthodox centre in Tur Abdin is the monastery of Dayro d-Mor Hananyo, 6 km south east of Mardin, {{in the west}} of the region. Built from yellow rock, the monastery is affectionately known as Dayro d Kurkmo in Syriac, Dayr al-Zafaran in Arabic, or Deyrülzafarân in Turkish: the Safron Monastery. Founded in AD 493, the monastery was the residence of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch from 1160 to 1932. Although the patriarch now lives in Damascus the monastery still contains the patriarchal throne and tombs of seven patriarchs and metropolitans. Today the monastery is led by a bishop and a monk and some <b>lay</b> <b>assistants,</b> and is a school for orphans. The bishop of Mor Hananyo is also the patriarchal vicar of Mardin. His goal is to rebuild the monastery and to preserve the history of the Syriac Orthodox church. The Dayro d-Mor Hananyo is part of the UNESCO world cultural heritage and was visited by numerous celebrities e.g. like Prince Charles.|$|R
