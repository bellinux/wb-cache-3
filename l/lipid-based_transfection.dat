40|$|Fully {{differentiated}} adipocytes {{are considered}} to be refractory to introduction of siRNA via <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection.</b> However, large scale siRNA-based loss-of-function screening of adipocytes using either electroporation or virally-mediated transfection approaches can be prohibitively complex and expensive. We present a method for introducing small interfering RNA (siRNA) into differentiated 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and primary human adipocytes using an approach based on forming the siRNA/cell complex with the adipocytes in suspension rather than as an adherent monolayer, a variation of "reverse transfection". Transfection of adipocytes with siRNA by this method is economical, highly efficient, has a simple workflow, and allows standardization of the ratio of siRNA/cell number, making this approach well-suited for high-throughput screening of fully differentiated adipocytes...|$|E

These proteins were first applied in whole organisms with established germ-line transformation protocols, {{but now it is}} possible to label cells with fluorescent proteins in other organisms. Here we present two ways to introduce GFP expressing plasmids into avian embryos for vital confocal and two-photon imaging. First, electroporation is a powerful approach to introduce GFP into the developing neural tube, offering several advantages over dye labeling. Second, we introduce a new <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> system for introducing plasmid DNA directly to a small group of injected cells within live, whole embryos. These complementary approaches make it possible to transfect a wide-range of cell types in the avian embryo and the bright, stable, uniform expression of GFP offers great advantages for vital fluorescence imaging...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe use of RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{to deplete}} individual proteins from cells or tissue has revolutionised {{our ability to}} characterise gene function. The placenta is an attractive target for studies in which the role of specific proteins can be compared with cell culture models and explanted villous tissue where physiological function can be maintained ex vivo. In this study, we compared a variety of commercially available reagents and approaches to define methods for efficient delivery of siRNA to placental cells. Protocols optimised using fluorescently-labelled siRNA were subsequently tested using siRNA sequences that target placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), chosen because of its high abundance in trophoblast. mRNA abundance was assayed using qRT-PCR, and the effect on protein was examined using immunolocalisation. We report that different protocols are required for BeWo choriocarcinoma cells (nucleofection), primary cytotrophoblast cells (<b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection)</b> and villous tissue explants (nucleofection). The results provide guidelines for optimal siRNA-mediated knockdown in these three models of the human placenta...|$|E
40|$|Aberrations in {{splicing}} patterns play {{a significant}} role in several diseases, and splice correction, together with other forms of gene regulation, is consequently an emerging therapeutic target. In order to achieve successful oligonucleotide transfection, efficient delivery vectors are generally necessary. In this study we present one such vector, the chemically modified cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) TP 10, for efficient delivery of a splice-correcting 2 '-OMe RNA oligonucleotide. Utilizing a functional splice correction assay, we assessed the transfection efficiency of non-covalent complexes of oligonucleotides and stearylated or cysteamidated CPPs. Stearylation of the CPPs Arg 9 and penetratin, as well as cysteamidation of MPG and TP 10, did not improve transfection, whereas the presence of an N-terminal stearyl group on TP 10 improved delivery efficiency remarkably compared to the unmodified peptide. The splice correction levels observed with stearyl-TP 10 are in fact in parity with the effects seen with the commercially available transfection agent Lipofectamine 2000. However, the inherent toxicity associated with cationic <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfections</b> can be completely eliminated when using the stearylated TP 10, making this vector highly promising for non-covalent delivery of negatively charged oligonucleotides...|$|R
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, thus {{developing}} effective methods for its early diagnosis is urgently needed. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs, miR) {{have been reported to}} play important roles in carcinogenesis and have become potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Molecular beacon (MB) technology is a universal technology to detect DNA/RNA expression in living cells. As a natural polymers, chitosan (CS) nanoparticles {{could be used as a}} carrier for safe delivery of nucleic acid. In this study, we developed a probe using nanoparticles of miR- 155 MB self assembled with CS (CS-miR- 155 MB) to image the expression of miR- 155 in cancer cells. Hybridization assay showed that the locked nucleic acid (LAN) modified miR- 155 MB could target miR- 155 effectively and sensitively. The miR- 155 MB self-assembly with CS nanoparticles formed stable complexes at the proper weight ratio. The CS nanoparticles showed higher fluorescence intensity and transfection efficiency than the <b>lipid-based</b> formulation <b>transfection</b> agent by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. The CS-MB complexes were found to be easily synthesized and exhibited strong enzymatic stability, efficient cellular uptake, high target selectivity and biocompatibility. The CS-MB complexes can also be applied in other cancers just by simply changing for a targeted miRNA highly expressed in those cancer cells. Therefore, it is a promising vehicle used for detecting miRNA expression in living cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) and degenerate intervertebral discs (IVDs), chondrocytes and {{nucleus pulposus}} (NP) cells {{are responsible for}} producing secreted destructive proteinases to the extracellular matrix including collagenases, aggrecanases and metalloproteinases (MMPs). In addition, increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) are involved in catabolic effects, stimulating the cells to secrete proteolytic enzymes. In addition to conventional therapies aiming merely at symptom relief, research focus toward regenerative approaches has emerged. For example, application of RNAi may be of great potential {{in the treatment of}} degenerative diseases of joints by inhibiting the local degenerative processes along with regenerative approaches. In this thesis, strategies to deliver therapeutic compounds or small RNA molecules, with the use of biomaterials, are studied to ultimately treat degenerate musculoskeletal tissues toward regeneration by means of minimal invasive administration of therapeutic molecules, over a prolonged period of time. A new in vitro inflammatory model was used to measure the bioactivity of anti-inflammatory agents released from novel poly(thioester) -functionalized PLGA microspheres. In the bioactivity assay where OA chondrocytes were batch-wise thawed for new cell culture every 3 days, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels induced by TNFα were reduced extensively when microspheres loaded with 1 nmol of celecoxib (CXB) or triamcinolone acetonide (TA) were added. Gradually resumed PGE 2 levels were observed within 21 days if 0. 1 nmol of CXB or TA was loaded into microspheres. The potential application of RNAi for treating cartilaginous diseases was examined from the aspects of safety and delivery efficiency. Non-specific effects of siRNA transfection with the use of <b>lipid-based</b> or naturally-derived <b>transfection</b> reagents were studied in different types of mesenchymal cells. Variable viability, changes in DNA content and differential cell cycle regulations all together showed the complexity of siRNA transfection, in addition to affecting target gene expression. A novel injectable and thermoresponsive hydrogel based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAM) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) was used and shown for its use in supporting siRNA delivery in OA chondrocytes. In another approach pre-transfection of hsa-miR- 148 a for modulating chondrogenic phenotype in OA chondrocytes, prior to incorporation in hydrogel systems as a means of strategic delivery, was studied. Although high levels of hsa-miR- 148 a were found until 14 days, the effect was limited to a decreased MMP 13 expression compared to other previously shown regenerative effects. To translate the application of the thermoresponsive hydrogel into future clinical practice, the hydrogel incorporated with the anti-inflammatory drug CXB was studied for safety and efficacy in a canine model with spontaneously degenerated IVD. After the intradiscal injection, no clinical symptoms (i. e. of IVD herniation or progression of degeneration) were observed. Controlled release of CXB resulted in a non-significant inhibition of PGE 2, possibly because of the absence of its target, cyclooxygenase- 2, in the model. The studies presented in this thesis provided new insights into future regenerative therapies for OA or degenerate IVD, in a scope investigating safety and efficacy from in vitro to in vivo situations. These strategies have shown encouraging research outcomes. Further studies could promote translation into in vivo application and ultimately clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Silencing gene {{expression}} by RNAi {{is a powerful}} method for exploring gene function and validating drug targets and potentially for therapy. Lymphocytes and other primary blood cells are resistant to <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> in vitro and are difficult to target in vivo. We show here that antibody-protamine fusion proteins targeting the human integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) efficiently deliver siRNAs and specifically induce silencing in primary lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Moreover, a fusion protein constructed from an antibody that preferentially recognizes activation-dependent conformational changes in LFA- 1 selectively targets activated leukocytes {{and can be used}} to suppress {{gene expression}} and cell proliferation only in activated lymphocytes. The siRNA-fusion protein complexes do not cause lymphocyte activation or induce IFN responses.

The cytotoxicity tests ruled by chemical standards appear inadequate for the NPs very peculiar adhesive superficial properties that make their handling difficult and not immediately controllable. The present study highlights a new strategy to set up meaningful in-vitro tests to assess cells massive NPs uptake. A new approach was developed to obtain homogenous dispersion of NPs in-vitro. A <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> technique (lipofection) was evaluated in two different cell lines: a mouse fibroblast embryonic cell line (NIH/ 3 T 3) and a human hepatoblastoma derived cells (HEP-G 2), using gold (Au), iron (Fe 3 O 4), cobalt oxide (Co) and cerium oxide (CeO 2) NPs. The results indicate that after massive entrance of NPs due the lipofection technique, cells showed a stimulus in the proliferation, except for Co NPs. The technique may represent an innovative approach to perform toxicity tests, inducing a homogeneous NPs exposure. Further studies should be carried out to validate and improve this method...|$|E
40|$|Effects of the {{addition}} of a cationic amino acid-based synthetic amphiphile, arginine N-lauroyl amide dihydrochloride (ALA), to a <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> formulation have been investigated. It is shown that the inclusion of ALA results in a substantial enhancement of the transfection capability of lipoplexes prepared with liposomes of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -ethylphosphocholine and cholesterol, which themselves mediate highly efficient transfection. A possible explanation for the increased biological activity is that ALA adsorbed {{to the surface of the}} DNA-lipid complexes is involved in triggering internalization. However, in order to identify possible additional factors underlying the enhanced transfection efficiency, the physical properties of formulations with and without ALA were characterized using cryo-transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and an ethidium bromide intercalation assay. ALA seems to have limited influence on the initial internal structure of the complexes and the protection of DNA, but its presence is found to decrease the average effective size of the dispersed particles; this change in size may be important in improving the biological activity. Furthermore, ALA can act to influence the transfection efficiency of the formulation by promoting the release of DNA following internalization in the transfected cells...|$|E
40|$|To {{delineate}} {{the function of}} a single ion channel subtype amongst the multitude that normally constitutes a signalling pathway, it is often insightful to study the function or signalling of that one ion channel {{in the absence of}} the others. Mammalian cell lines that do not normally express the gene of interest can be manipulated to do so via plasmid DNA expression vectors. However, large and highly charged molecules like DNA cannot passively diffuse through cell membranes. Therefore introducing nucleic acid into mammalian cells may involve introducing pores transiently into the cell membrane to allow the passage of circular plasmid DNA. This is relatively easily carried out using cationic lipids that form liposomes around the DNA and fuse with the cell membrane to introduce the DNA inside the cell. Alternatively, a highly successful mechanism for introduction of DNA involves utilizing viral vectors. These take advantage of the molecular mechanisms that viruses have evolved to efficiently transport their genome inside cells. <b>Lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> techniques and adenoviral delivery of plasmids encoding large genes (such as ion channel genes) for expression in mammalian cells are the focus of this chapter...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> reagents have permitted their widespread use in molecular biology and gene therapy. This study outlines {{the effect of}} cryo-manipulation of a cationic lipid-based formulation, Lipofectamine 2000, which, after being frozen and thawed, showed orders of magnitude higher plasmid delivery efficiency throughout eight different cell lines, without compromising cell viability. Increased transfection efficiency with the freeze-thawed reagent was also seen with 2 '-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotide delivery and in a splice-correction assay. Most importantly, a log-scale improvement in gene delivery using the freeze-thawed reagent was seen in vivo. Using three different methods, we detected considerable differences in the polydispersity of the different nucleic acid complexes as well as observed a clear difference in their surface spreading and sedimentation, with the freeze-thawed ones displaying substantially higher rate of dispersion and deposition on the glass surface. This hitherto overlooked elevated potency of the freeze-thawed reagent facilitates the targeting of hard-to-transfect cells, accomplishes higher transfection rates, and decreases the overall amount of reagent needed for delivery. Additionally, as we also saw {{a slight increase in}} plasmid delivery using other freeze-thawed transfection reagents, we postulate that freeze-thawing might prove to be useful for an even wider variety of transfection reagents...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study {{nucleoside}} analog activation in the CEM cell line, a transfection protocol {{had to be}} optimized in order to silence an enzyme involved in nucleoside analog activation. Hematopoetic cell lines {{can be difficult to}} transfect with traditional <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection,</b> so the electroporation technique was used. Field strength, pulse length, temperature, electroporation media, siRNA concentration, among other conditions were tested in order to obtain approximately 70 - 80 % mRNA and enzyme activity downregulation of the cytosolic enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), necessary for nucleoside analog activation. Downregulation was assessed at mRNA and enzyme activity levels. After optimizing the protocol, a microarray analysis was performed in order to investigate whether the downregulation was specific. Additionally two genes were differentially expressed besides the downregulation of dCK. These were however of unknown function. The leakage of intracellular nucleotides was also addressed in the electroporated cells since it can affect the DNA repair mechansism and the efficiency of nucleoside analogs. Three of these pools were increased compared to untreated, unelectroporated cells. The siRNA transfected cells with reduced dCK expression and activity showed reduced sensitivity to several nucleoside analogs as expected. The multidrug resistance to other drugs, as seen in nucleoside analog-induced resistant cells, was not seen with this model.

40|$|The {{development}} of siRNA-based gene silencing therapies has significant potential for effectively treating debilitating genetic, hyper-proliferative or malignant skin conditions caused by aberrant gene expression. To be efficacious and widely accepted by physicians and patients, therapeutic siRNAs must access the viable skin layers {{in a stable}} and functional form, preferably without painful administration. In this study we explore the use of minimally-invasive steel microneedle devices to effectively deliver siRNA into skin. A simple, yet precise microneedle coating method permitted reproducible loading of siRNA onto individual microneedles. Following recovery from the microneedle surface, lamin A/C siRNA retained full activity, as demonstrated by significant reduction in lamin A/C mRNA levels and reduced lamin A/C protein in HaCaT keratinocyte cells. However, lamin A/C siRNA pre-complexed with a commercial <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> reagent (siRNA lipoplex) was less functional following microneedle coating. As Accell-modified "self-delivery" siRNA targeted against CD 44 also retained functionality after microneedle coating, this form of siRNA was used in subsequent in vivo studies, where gene silencing was determined in a transgenic reporter mouse skin model. Self-delivery siRNA targeting the reporter (luciferase/GFP) gene was coated onto microneedles and delivered to mouse footpad. Quantification of reporter mRNA and intravital imaging of reporter expression in the outer skin layers confirmed functional in vivo gene silencing following microneedle delivery of siRNA. The use of coated metal microneedles represents a new, simple, minimally-invasive, patient-friendly and potentially self-administrable method for the delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to the skin...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{uncover the}} {{mechanism}} by which hypoxia enhances cartilage matrix synthesis by human articular chondrocytes. METHODS: The hypoxic response was investigated by exposing normal (nonarthritic) human articular chondrocyte cultures to 20 % oxygen and 1 % oxygen. Induction of the differentiated phenotype was confirmed at the gene and protein levels. In its first reported application in human articular chondrocytes, the RNA interference method was used to directly investigate the role of specific transcription factors in this process. Small interfering RNA directed against hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha), HIF- 2 alpha, and SOX 9 were delivered by <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> of primary and passaged human articular chondrocytes. The effect of each knockdown on hypoxic induction of the chondrocyte phenotype was assessed. RESULTS: Hypoxia enhanced matrix synthesis and SOX 9 expression of human articular chondrocytes at both the gene and protein levels. Although HIF- 1 alpha knockdown had no effect, depletion of HIF- 2 alpha abolished this hypoxic induction. Thus, we provide the first evidence that HIF- 2 alpha, but not HIF- 1 alpha, is essential for hypoxic induction of the human articular chondrocyte phenotype. In addition, depletion of SOX 9 prevented hypoxic induction of matrix genes, indicating that the latter are not direct HIF targets but are up-regulated by hypoxia via SOX 9. CONCLUSION: Based on our data, we propose a novel mechanism whereby hypoxia promotes cartilage matrix synthesis specifically through HIF- 2 alpha-mediated SOX 9 induction of key cartilage genes. These findings have potential application {{for the development of}} cartilage repair therapies...|$|E

Realization of this potential depends on efficient and optimized protocols for genetic manipulation of stem cells. In the study reported here, we demonstrate the use of nucleofection as a method to introduce plasmid DNA into embryonic and adult stem cells with significantly greater efficiency than electroporation or <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> methods have. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as a reporter gene, mouse {{embryonic stem cells}} were transfected both transiently and stably at a rate nearly 10 -fold higher than conventional methods. The transfected cells retained their stem cell properties, including continued expression of the stem cell markers SSEA 1, Oct 4, and Rex 1; formation of embryoid bodies; differentiation into cardiomyocytes {{in the presence of}} appropriate inducers; and, when injected into developing blastocysts, contribution to chimeras. Higher levels of transfection were also obtained with human embryonic carcinoma and human embryonic stem cells. Particularly hard-to-transfect adult stem cells, including bone marrow and multipotent adult progenitor cells, were also transfected efficiently by the method of nucleofection. Based on our results, we conclude that nucleofection is superior to currently available methods for introducing plasmid DNA into a variety of embryonic and adult stem cells. The high levels of transfection achieved by nucleofection will enable its use as a rapid screening tool to evaluate the effect of ectopically expressed transcription factors on tissue-specific differentiation of stem cells. status: publishe...|$|E

Caspase- 3 can be up-regulated by IRI due {{to a variety of}} pathogenic processes such as oxidative damage. This study utilized synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) to posttranscriptionally silence target gene, caspase- 3, may represent a feasible approach to produce transient effects, but avoid side actions caused by viral vectors. The porcine proximal tubular cells (LLC-PK 1), with or without the stimulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2), an oxidizer), were transfected with synthetic caspase- 3 siRNA using a cationic <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> regent. The expression of caspase- 3 at mRNA and protein level was assessed at different times posttransfection and its downstream biological events were also monitored. The caspase- 3 mRNA was posttranscriptionally silenced by its siRNA up to 50 % after 24 [*]h. The active caspase- 3 protein was increased by transfection reagent alone and H(2) O(2) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Both the precursor and active protein of caspase- 3 were decreased by siRNA after 48 [*]h and maintained up to 96 [*]h at least, with a consistent change in its activity. Consequently, apoptotic cells and active IL- 1 β protein expression was reduced by caspase- 3 siRNA; cell viability, especially with H(2) O(2) treatment, was also improved. Taken together, caspase- 3 and apoptosis are sensitive markers for cellular injury; using synthetic siRNA silencing caspase- 3 may provide not only a valid approach for underlying mechanisms of diseases, but also a potential therapeutic intervention {{for a wide range of}} acute clinical disorders including IRI in renal transplantation. 7593...|$|E

Vital fluorescent probes, particularly green fluorescent protein (GFP) have revolutionized cell biology stemming from the ability to label specific intracellular compartments and cellular structures. For example, the live imaging of GFP (and its spectral variants) chimeras have allowed for a dynamic analysis of the cytoskeleton, organelle transport, and membrane dynamics in a multitude of organisms and cell types [1 - 3]. Although live imaging has become prevalent, this approach still poses many technical challenges, particularly in primary cultured neurons. One challenge is the expression of GFP-tagged proteins in post-mitotic neurons; {{the other is the}} ability to capture fluorescent images while minimizing phototoxicity, photobleaching, and maintaining general cell health. Here we provide a protocol that describes a <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> method that yields a relatively low transfection rate (~ 0. 5 %), however is ideal for the imaging of fully polarized neurons. A low transfection rate is essential so that single axons and dendrites can be characterized as to their orientation to the cell body to confirm directionality of transport, i. e., anterograde v. retrograde. Our approach to imaging GFP expressing neurons relies on a standard wide-field fluorescent microscope outfitted with a CCD camera, image capture software, and a heated imaging chamber. We have imaged a wide variety of organelles or structures, for example, dense-core vesicles, mitochondria, growth cones, and actin without any special optics or excitation requirements other than a fluorescent light source.

To complete mPPS-FA, folic acid was conjugated to a backbone (named mPPS) consisting of a copolymer of methyl PEG- 2000, PEI- 600, and sebacoyl chloride. 1 H NMR, FT-IR, and UV spectroscopy were used to characterize the structure of mPPS-FA. It was revealed that mPPS-FA holds the ability to bind plasmid DNA yielding positively charged particles (polyplexes). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM techniques were used to study the size and morphology of the formed mPPS-FA/DNA nanocomplexes. The mPPS-FA/DNA nanoparticles exhibited low cytotoxicity as transfection of B 16 -F 0, U 87 MG, CHO- 1, and Ho- 8910 cells produced > 80 % viability indicating low cytotoxicity of the polymer. The ability of mPPS-FA to deliver EGFP plasmid to melanoma B 16 -F 0, U 87, CHO- 1, Ho- 8910, and A 549 cells was investigated in vitro {{as compared to the}} <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> agent Lipofectamine™ 2000 and Linear PEI 22 kDa (L-PEI 22 kDa). We found that mPPS-FA/DNA complexes yielded the highest GFP transfection efficiency in B 16 -F 0, U 87, CHO- 1, and Ho- 8910 cells, which all highly express folate receptors (FR), at an mPPS-FA/DNA ratio (w/w) of 15. Furthermore, the transfection of mPPS-FA/DNA complexes in CHO- 1 cells could be competitively blocked by free folic acid molecules. In contrast, in low FR expressing A 549 cells, mPPS-FA showed similar low transfection efficiency as mPPS. Taken together, mPPS-FA showed the highest efficiency in vitro and the potential to be developed as a nonviral gene carrier. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

To be effective, the restorative pDNA or inhibitive siRNA must access the viable skin layers and cells {{in a stable}} and functional form, preferably without painful administration. Microneedles are able to penetrate the stratum corneum skin barrier in a minimally invasive manner to allow targeted delivery of therapeutic macromocules. To date, there are limited studies reporting the delivery of nucleic acids, particularly siRNA, to the skin using microneedle devices. A range of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo skin models was developed to characterise nucleic acid delivery and functional response. In vitro studies conducted in both continuous and primary keratinocyte cultures provided proof-of-concept of efficient and non-toxic cell uptake and gene silencing with siRNA and moderately efficient gene expression with pDNA. In initial studies, pDNA and siRNA was pre-complexed with <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> reagents, however, {{in the case of}} siRNA, coating of the lipoplexes onto microneedles resulted in a reduction in functionality. Hence, modified self-delivery (sd) siRNA formulations were used in subsequent microneedle delivery experiments. Stainless steel microneedles coated with reporter pDNA or sd-siRNA were successful in penetrating the stratum corneum barrier of ex vivo viable human breast skin. It was difficult to demonstrate equivocally both plasmid gene expression and functional gene silencing in the skin explants, which only remain viable for short periods. Delivery of pDNA and sd-siRNA to in vivo mouse skin however, resulted in demonstrable gene expression and gene silencing, particularly evident at the protein level, in an established transgenic reporter mouse skin model. Overall, these investigations generally support the use of the coated steel microneedles for the simple and potentially self-administrable delivery of nucleic acids to the skin...|$|E
40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD), {{underpinned}} by atherosclerosis, remains a {{leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality, particularly in the Western World. Although the advent of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has provided a fundamental change in the treatment of CAD and drug-eluting stents (DES) have brought about marked improvement, there still remain significant challenges such as restenosis and late stent thrombosis. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been acknowledged as {{the most effective way to}} treat CAD. However saphenous vein graft failures still present a problem due to stenosis. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration is the primary driver of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and vein graft failure after CABG. Endothelial dysfunction also plays an important role in both restenosis and late thrombosis following PCI. Therefore, key to the prevention of restenosis and late stent thrombosis is to suppress SMC proliferation and migration, and to enhance re-endothelialisation. The broad aim of work in this thesis is to seek more effective strategies to inhibit SMC hyperplasia and intimal thickening while promoting re-endothelialisation. More specifically, the effects of three kinds of bio-molecules on prevention of restenosis are investigated in this thesis. Firstly, a novel &# 147;cocktail&# 148; consisting of a combination of VEGF-A, VEGF-D and cRGD, which has not been studied with SMC and EC in response to injury, is tested in a rat carotid balloon injury model. Secondly, the efficacy of the DNAzyme, Dz 13, targeting c-Jun is tested in the rabbit autologous vein bypass graft model using the <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> agent 1, 2 - dioleoyl- 3 -trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) / 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). Lastly, the anti-restenotic potential of miR- 191, a natural microRNA inhibitor of the immediate early gene Egr- 1, is examined in the balloon-injured rat carotid artery model. The data presented in this thesis demonstrates that localised delivery of Dz 13, miR 191 and a novel cocktail of VEGF-A, VEGF-D and cRGD can inhibit neointima formation in animal models. According to these studies, the cocktail, Dz 13 and miR 191 may be useful approaches for reducing in-stent restenosis and late thrombosis. The ability of these biomolecules to be delivered at a local level makes them ideal for inclusion in stent-based strategies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Peptide {{surfactants}} {{developed in}} the Centre for Biomolecular Engineering at The University of Queensland are engineered to combine the advantages of traditional surfactants with biodegradability, biocompatibility, formation of a mechanically strong interfacial cohesive network, and reversible stimuli-responsiveness. In this project, the potential of peptide-stabilised emulsions as delivery systems for small interfering RNA (siRNA) was explored. In recent years, the potential of siRNA as {{a new class of}} therapeutics has attracted great attention. The ubiquitous nature of RNA interference (RNAi) implies that siRNA can be used to silence any disease-causing gene to treat any disease. The hurdle that needs to be overcome to turn siRNA therapy into clinical reality is its delivery into the cytosol, where gene silencing by siRNA occurs. Although numerous systems have been developed for the delivery of siRNA, safety and efficiency are major concerns associated with current formulations. Therefore this project aimed to prepare a stable peptide emulsion formulation and to conduct initial tests of its ability to deliver siRNA in vitro. The human tumour suppressor gene p 53 and the human breast cancer MCF- 7 cell line were used as the model gene and model cell line, respectively. The commercially available <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> reagent Lipofectamine™ 2000 was used as the benchmark control. Sonication and membrane extrusion were used to formulate emulsions with droplet size (d= 120 nm) suitable for intravenous applications using peptide surfactant in the presence of Zn(II). Although these peptide emulsions are stable by themselves and in bovine serum, emulsion stability was found to be strongly affected by the presence of salt, EDTA, and proteins. The instability of AM 1 emulsion in cell culture media has been a concern when it was subjected to in vitro cell culture tests. AM 1 -stabilised emulsion droplets were shown to be taken up by MCF- 7 cells. However, siRNA when coupled with AM 1 emulsion was not delivered into cells. Cytotoxicity studies showed that peptide surfactants did not exhibit high-level toxicity to CHO cells at the tested concentrations (0. 25 - 2 mg mL- 1). AM 1 peptide-stabilised emulsions were mildly toxic to CHO cells but no toxicity was observed with MCF- 7 cells. Future work could include evaluation of peptide emulsion-siRNA complex formation, and exploring the effects of different cell culture media compositions on emulsion stability and their relation to cytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Nucleic acids {{could be}} used as {{therapeutic}} agents for the treatment of many different diseases, but poor delivery limits their clinical application. A series of pH-responsive amphipathic peptides containing histidine or 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid (Dap) derivatives, LAH and LADap peptides, were investigated in this study as nucleic acid carriers for the treatment of respiratory infectious disease. LAH and LADap peptides are cationic, amphipathic pH-responsive peptides. The major attractive property of these peptides is their ability to promote endosomal escape, hence enhance transfection efficiency. Both LAH and LADap peptides were able to form complexes with DNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) through electrostatic interaction and facilitated cellular uptake via endocytosis. In acidic environments (e. g. in endosomes and lysosomes), the peptides were released from the complexes and changed their conformational structures to display membrane-destabilizing activity. Subsequently, nucleic acids were released from the endosomal/lysosomal compartments into the cytoplasm with improved transfection efficiency. These peptides were effective in transferring DNA and siRNA in various cell lines including human lung epithelial cells. In addition, they were less toxic than the commercially available <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> reagent LipofectamineTM 2000. LAH 4 -L 1 and LADap(Me) 6 -L 1 were the two most efficient peptides of the LAH and LADap peptide series respectively, and were selected for further formulation development for pulmonary delivery. To determine the optimal carrier for delivering nucleic acids to the lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was used as a model of airway surface liquid in the in vitro transfection experiments. High transfection efficiency was maintained with LADap(Me) 6 -L 1 peptide, making it a promising vector for pulmonary nucleic acid delivery. Two drying methods, spray drying and spray freeze drying, were investigated to prepare dry powder formulation containing pH-responsive peptides and nucleic acids for inhalation. Both methods could produce powders with desirable aerodynamic properties for inhalation. The physical integrity and biological activity of the nucleic acids were also successfully retained. Overall, SD powders performed better than SFD powders, suggesting that spray drying was a more suitable method to produce inhalable nucleic acid formulation. The clinical potential of the spray-dried powder formulation the peptide-based nucleic acid delivery system was further investigated for the treatment of lung diseases. siRNA has considerable therapeutic potential for treating respiratory infectious diseases including influenza. By introducing siRNA targeting the conserved region of viral genes encoding nucleocapsid protein (NP), viral replication can be inhibited in mammalian cells. Powder formulations containing antiviral siRNA against H 1 N 1 influenza virus and pH-responsive peptides were produced by spray drying. The SD powders were characterized and found to be suitable for inhalation with good stability. The formulations mediated highly effective in vitro delivery of antiviral siRNA into mammalian lung epithelial cells, leading to significant inhibition of viral replication when the transfected cells were subsequently challenged with H 1 N 1 influenza virus. SD siRNA powders containing pH-responsive peptides are promising inhalable formulations to deliver antiviral siRNA against influenza and are readily adapted for the treatment of other respiratory diseases. published_or_final_versionPharmacology and PharmacyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) is a 42 KDa serine/threonine {{protein kinase}} {{homologous}} to Cdk 1, 2 and 7. Previous work {{has shown that}} CCRK regulates cell cycle transition by phosphorylating Cdk 2 and Rb. More importantly, {{it was found that}} CCRK was a candidate oncogene in both glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and human colorectal cancer. However, the mechanistic role of CCRK in tumorigenicity is still not completely understood. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, I found that casein kinas II beta (CKIIβ) was one of proteins that interact with CCRK using the high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid analysis. Then I confirmed their interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. CCRK phosphorylated CKIIβ at Ser- 209 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of CKIIβ by CCRK enhanced the activity of CKII holoenzyme, protected CKIIβ against proteasome degradation, and facilitated CKIIβ translocation into the nucleus in U- 87 MG and U- 373 MG GBM cells. Importantly, CCRK de-sensitized GBM cells to the cytotoxic effect of three chemotherapy drugs, whereas knockdown of CCRK by siRNA reduced chemoresistance. Functionally, CKIIβ is responsible for CCRK-mediated inhibition of apoptosis, as suppression of CKIIβ by siRNA or CKIIβ inhibitor could re-sensitize cells to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in both wild type and CCRK-overexpressing U- 87 MG cells. In vivo studies also showed that stable over-expression of CCRK increased tumor growth and decreased the anti-tumor efficacy of cisplatin in a nude mice GBM xenograft model. These results provide the first evidence that phosphorylation of CKIIβ is a new mechanism by which CCRK confers tumor growth and drug resistance to GBM cells. In the second part of this thesis I described a novel polymer, mPPS-FA, synthesized as a potential gene transfer vector. To complete mPPS-FA, folic acid was conjugated to a backbone (named mPPS) consisting of a copolymer of methyl PEG- 2000, PEI- 600 and sebacoyl chloride. 1 H-NMR, FT-IR and UV spectroscopy were used to characterize the structure of mPPS-FA. It was revealed that mPPS-FA holds the ability to bind plasmid DNA yielding positively charged particles (polyplexes). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM techniques were used to study the size and morphology of the formed mPPS-FA/DNA nanocomplexes. Cytotoxicity of the mPPS-FA/DNA nanoparticles was also evaluated on B 16 -F 0, U 87 MG, CHO- 1 and Ho- 8910 cells. The ability of mPPS-FA to deliver EGFP plasmid to melanoma B 16 -F 0, U 87, CHO- 1, Ho- 8910 and A 549 cells was investigated in vitro as compared to the <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> agent LipofectamineTM 2000 and Linear PEI 22 KDa (L-PEI 22 KDa). I found that mPPS-FA/DNA complexes yielded the highest GFP transfection efficiency in B 16 -F 0, U 87, CHO- 1 and Ho- 8910 cells, which all highly express folate receptors (FR), at an mPPS-FA/DNA ratio (w/w) of 15. Furthermore, the transfection of mPPS-FA/DNA complexes in CHO- 1 cells could be significantly competed and blocked by the free folic acid molecules. All together, mPPS-FA showed the highest efficiency in vitro and the potential to be developed as a nonviral gene carrier. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2014. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Theresa Reineke. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xix, 208 pages. Cationic polymers {{have been widely}} explored as non-viral nucleic acid delivery vectors for gene therapy, as {{they are able to}} complex with nucleic acids, protect genetic materials from degradation, and facilitate the internalization of transgene expression process. To understand how various structural elements impact the nucleic acid delivery, several classes of polycations were synthesized and examined for their in vitro transfection performance. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was employed for the synthesis of several series of diblock glycopolycations with different carbohydrate containing blocks, including poly(2 -deoxy- 2 -methacrylamido glucopyranose) (PMAG) and poly(methacrylamidotrehalose) (PMAT). Amine containing monomers were subsequently polymerized through chain extension to yield cationic blocks for nucleic acid binding, including N-[3 -(N, N-dimethylamino) propyl] methacrylamide (DMAPMA), N-(2 -aminoethyl) methacrylamide (AEMA), aminoethylmethacrylate (AEMT), N-methyl aminoethylmethacrylate (MAEMT), N,N-dimethyl aminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEMT), and N,N,N-trimethylammoniumethylmethacrylate (TMAEMT). Initially, it was demonstrated that these polymers were all able to complex plasmid DNA into polyplex structures and prevent colloidal aggregation of polyplexes in physiological salt conditions. More importantly, glycopolymers with PMAT block can prevent polyplexes from aggregation, and exhibit the ability to protect polyplexes through the cycle of lyophilization and reconstitution. The role of charge type, block length, and cell type on transfection efficiency and toxicity were studied for the in vitro transfection in both HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) and HepG 2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma) cells by comparing the polyplexes formulation created with PMAG-b-PAEMA and PMAG-b-PDMAPMA. The glycopolycation vehicles with primary amine blocks and PAEMA homopolymers revealed much higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity when compared to analogs created with DMAPMA. Block length was also shown to influence cellular delivery and toxicity; as the block length of DMAPMA increased, polyplex toxicity increased while transfection decreased. While the charge block {{played a major role in}} delivery, the MAG block length did not affect these cellular parameters. Cell type played a major role in efficiency, these glycopolymers revealed higher cellular uptake and transfection efficiency in HepG 2 cells than in HeLa cells, while homopolycations (PAEMA and PDMAPMA) lacking the MAG blocks exhibited the opposite trend signifying that the MAG block could aid in hepatocyte transfection. Lastly, a new class of lipophilic polycations were designed, poly(alkylamidoamine) (PAAA) was synthesized to understand the role of lyophilicity in pDNA transfection. PAAAs with various length of lipophilic linker (C 3 to C 6) were synthesized via step-growth polymerization, and examined for their in-vitro transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity in multiple cell types, including HDFa (human dermal fibroblasts, adult) cells, HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) cells, HMEC (human mammary epithelial cells), and HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells). The PAAA vehicles exhibited comparable or even superior transfection efficiency to Lipofectamine 2000, a leading <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> reagent. It was revealed that, for the PAAA polymers examined in this study, an increase in lipophilicity leads to higher cytotoxicity, but also raised the transfection efficiency in HeLa cells. Overall, we demonstrated the great potential of carbohydrate containing polymer block, which has potential to serve as a targeting moiety, stealthy coating, and even lyo-protectant for polyplex formulations. Different amine types were examined for their nucleic acid delivery ability, and we conclude that tertiary amine containing monomer, DMAPMA, exhibits high toxicity along with low transfection efficiency while primary amine block shows relatively lower toxicity and higher transfection efficiency. Finally, the lipophilic polycations, PAAAs, were shown to be important for improving transfection efficiency in multiple cell types...|$|E
40|$|This thesis sets {{about to}} answer three {{research}} questions grounded in transcriptional regulation of hepatic {{genes in the}} high yielding postpartum dairy cow under negative energy balance (NEB). For this purpose we used liver tissue from a previously developed dairy cow model comprising of cows under mild negative energy balance (MNEB) and severe negative energy balance (SNEB). The first research question relates to what is the overall expression profile distribution of hepatic miRNAs in the early postpartum period under both conditions and whether hepatic miRNA expression is altered during SNEB. The second question is an in silico identification of the gene targets of these miRNAs among sets of differentially expressed hepatic genes previously reported in the same animals. The third question {{is to determine the}} functional role of miRNAs in regulating putative target mRNAs. Two high-throughput techniques were used to determine hepatic miRNA expression under NEB in a dairy cattle model. First microarray expression profiling was done to determine the differential expression of hepatic miRNAs under SNEB. Five miRNAs were differentially expressed including miR- 140, 31, 17 - 5 p, 1281 and 2885. For all differentially expressed miRNAs, in-slico target prediction was carried out on a set of 418 differentially expressed liver genes previously reported in the same animals. A custom Perl script from TargetScan was used to identify putative target sites on bovine 3 Â¿UTRs retrieved from Ensemble. Overall 32 down-regulated target genes were identified, including those relevant to NEB such as genes associated with lipid and glucose metabolism and homeostasis and the somatotropic axis. miR- 2885 has binding sites in the 3 Â¿UTR of FADS 2, a lipogenic gene which is strongly down-regulated under SNEB. In addition, an up-regulated hepatic transcription factor, HNF 3 -gamma involved in IGF- 1 expression is a putative target of miR- 31. In the second study the overall abundance and distribution of miRNAs under both MNEB and SNEB was profiled using next generation sequencing. Overall, liverspecific miR- 122 constituted 75 % of expressed miRNA. SNEB resulted in the iii down-regulation of miR- 143, which has been associated with fatty acid metabolism. Overall 16 up-regulated putative target genes of miR- 143 were identified in a set of differentially expressed hepatic genes of same animals from micro-array and RNA-seq based previous NEB model studies. Among these SLC 2 A 12 and LRP 2 have roles in glucose and lipid metabolism. The third study aimed to determine the functional role of miR- 2885 in the regulation of FADS 2 expression. The inhibition of miR- 2885 was carried out in an MDBK (Madin Darby Kidney) cell line through <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> of a miR- 2885 inhibitor and its effect on the expression of FADS 2 was determined. FADS 2 expression was up-regulated over 5 -fold validating a role for miR- 2885 in FADS 2 regulation. The thesis layout is as follows; Chapter 1 discusses the impact of NEB on liver physiology and liver gene expression in postpartum moderate yielding dairy cows. Effects of NEB on fertility are also discussed. The postpartum NEB model of moderate yielding dairy cattle and alterations in liver genes from this model are summarized. miRNAs and their role in gene expression regulation, in the context of liver function and disorders is also given. Chapter 2 is a review of current methodologies and data analysis protocols involved in miRNA expression profiling, target predictions and functional analysis. Chapter 3 (a selection from first paper) is a review of research work on miRNAs in domestic livestock. Chapters 4 and 5 (papers 2 and 3) present the results of hepatic miRNA expression analysis from the NEB model. Chapters 4 and 5 also report the putative targets of differentially expressed miRNAs, among differentially expressed liver genes reported previously from the same animals. Chapter 6 presents a functional analysis of miRNA inhibition in a MDBK cell line. Finally, Chapter 7 gives a general discussion on the work done in this thesis followed by a scoping of future work...|$|E
