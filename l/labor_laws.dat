5|$|By the 1910s, {{the use of}} breaker boys was {{dropping}} because of improvements in technology, stricter child <b>labor</b> <b>laws,</b> and the enactment of compulsory education laws. The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of {{the efforts of the}} National Child Labor Committee, sociologist and photographer Lewis Hine, and the National Consumers League, all of whom educated the public about the practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of national child <b>labor</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Spanish {{invasion}} in 1524, {{the population of}} Guatemala was almost exclusively Maya. The Spanish conquest created a system of wealthy European landowners overseeing a labor force composed of slaves and bonded laborers. However, the community lands of the indigenous population remained in their control until the late 19th century. At this point, rising global demand for coffee made its export {{a significant source of}} income for the government. As a result, the state supported the coffee growers by passing legislation that took land away from the Indian population, as well as relaxing <b>labor</b> <b>laws</b> so that bonded labor could be used on the plantations.|$|E

5|$|The Sprouses began acting {{at the age}} {{of eight}} months {{following}} a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. The twins first appeared in a commercial for diapers, switching on-screen time every few seconds. As with many twins, the two have often played the same role, due to child <b>labor</b> <b>laws</b> in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day. Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed. Beginning at eight months old, the two played a single character, Patrick Kelly, on the ABC series Grace Under Fire.|$|E

The fifth ship to be named for New York State, she was sponsored by Elsie Calder, the daughter of New York politician William M. Calder. The fourth , an armored cruiser, was renamed Rochester, and was later scuttled in Subic Bay in 1941.

5|$|The {{film was}} shot over {{eighteen}} days in April 2005. It was filmed {{on location in}} Echo Park inside Glatzer and Westmoreland's house and in three houses on their block that their neighbors allowed them to use for little or no money. Many of Glatzer and Westmoreland's Echo Park neighbors also stood in as extras. Due to California's child <b>labor</b> <b>laws,</b> they could only film with the underage cast members for six hours a day, so cinematographer Eric Steelberg used a hand-held camera with few accessories to maximize the time they could spend filming. Steelberg filmed the project in high-definition video format, which was converted to film during post-production. The film's soundtrack included reggaeton songs as well as music composed by Westmoreland's brother as a favor since the filmmakers could afford little else. Robin Katz finished editing the film in August 2005.|$|E

5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal <b>labor</b> <b>laws.</b> The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the most}} efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the <b>labor</b> <b>laws.</b> The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} reframing {{the project of}} <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> reform as a {{regulatory}} project might put the project on a firmer foundation and shake up existing conceptions of what <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> reform should look like. In other words, “labor law” {{should be seen as}} part of the larger societal project of regulating work and working conditions; and that larger project should be situated among other fields of regulation, alongside the regulation of consumer products, the environment, and financial integrity. Reframing <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> as a regulatory project brings into view an alternative set of analytical levers and tools of governance, and additional reservoirs of political support for the ultimate ends pursued by <b>labor</b> <b>law.</b> Reframing <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> as a regulatory project can also recast and refurbish old linkages between <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> and democracy. Good regulatory design aims to deepen and extend democracy [...] to effectuate societal decisions about the governance of powerful private organizations, in part by extending democracy beyond the polling booth and giving citizens more levers of power both within those private organizations and in public regulatory processes. Moreover, opening additional avenues of participation within non-governmental institutions can rejuvenate public participation in political processes. <b>Labor</b> <b>law</b> was in a pioneer in that democratization project. Proponents of the NLRA in the New Deal argued that extending democracy to the workplace would provide both a mechanism to improve and enforce labor standards and a training ground for citizens in political participation. But <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> has since fallen on hard times. Now <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> and <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> scholars may have to expand their field of vision to reach across fields of regulation, and to recognize that they have much to learn and much to teach about how to make the law effective and how to empower citizens vis-à-vis the powerful organizations that shape their lives...|$|R

40|$|A complex {{combination}} of socioeconomic factors {{have produced a}} situation in Poland in the mid- 1980 s which is in urgent need of reform.

There are currently three approaches to <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> reform in Poland.

These approaches include wide-ranging opinions on the current trends of <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> reform, its substance, the timing of its introduction, and the stages by which it will be performed. The reason for such variety is that each approach to reform is grounded on different understandings of social needs and of their priority. Moreover, each approach is based upon a different assessment of the value and efficacy of existing Polish <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> and the pertinence of different methods of regulation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Labor</b> <b>law</b> is failing. Disfigured by courts, {{attacked}} by employers, and rendered inapt by a global and fissured economy, many of <b>labor</b> <b>law’s</b> most ardent proponents have abandoned it altogether. And for good reason: {{the law that}} governs collective organization and bargaining among workers has little to offer those it purports to protect. Several scholars have suggested ways to breathe {{new life into the}} old regime, yet their proposals do not solve the basic problem. <b>Labor</b> <b>law</b> developed for the New Deal does not provide solutions to today’s inequities. But all hope is not lost. From the remnants of the old regime, the potential for a new <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> is emerging. In this Article, I describe and defend the nascent regime, which embraces a form of social bargaining long thought unattainable in the United States. The new <b>labor</b> <b>law</b> rejects the old regime’s commitment to the employer-employee dyad and to a system of private ordering. Instead, it locates decisions about basic standards of employment at the sectoral level and positions unions as political actors empowered to advance the interests of workers generally.
