40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of a videotaped model of a conductor, utilizing various <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> conducting gestures, on singers’ anticipated inappropriate vocal tension levels, given the meaning interpreted from a gesture. Specifically, the potential of <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> conducting gestures to generate or prevent perceptions of inappropriate vocal tension was examined. A stimulus tape was created including a control conducting condition (<b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> no change) and five experimental conducting conditions: (a) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> fisted gesture; (b) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> palm up; (c) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> palm down; (d) <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> stabbing gesture; and (e) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> sideways, phrase-shaping gesture...|$|R

5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is <b>left</b> <b>handed,</b> two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E

25|$|The backup {{style of}} bowling {{is where the}} bowler will flick their wrist {{clockwise}} (for right handers) or counter clockwise (for left handers) upon release of the ball. Like a conventional release that generates hook, this technique will also cause the ball to move in a curved path {{rather than in a}} straight line. However a right handed backup will follow a <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> conventional path, and a <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> backup will follow a right handed conventional path.|$|E
50|$|In the laboratory, {{a patient}} was given two {{different}} fabrics: a wire screen in his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> {{and a piece}} of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> he was able to correctly indicate and point with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the right hand tried to stop the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and make the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”. Joseph concluded that the left hemisphere did not understand at all why the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> (right hemisphere) would point to a different material.|$|R

50|$|The entire {{harmonic}} structure, {{save for}} one note, is constructed {{so that the}} <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> part is the highest note in a B Minor chord which is below the melody line.

When the melody is on an E or F#, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is on a D, and when the melody is on a G, A, or B, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is on an F#.
