60|$|Under {{the power}} of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, {{prepared}} everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus, loading myself with everything necessary. I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and about two dozen of small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat’s milk and a cheese; all which with great labour and sweat I carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side. And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly {{on both sides of the}} island at a distance, and which were very terrible to me from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} making bánh tét usually begins the day before Tết where the {{ingredients}} are prepared then cooked {{for at least six}} hours in a pot of boiling water. The first step is assembling the ingredients - glutinous rice, mung bean paste or soaked mung bean and pork belly. Next, the ingredients are layered on top of banana leaves before wrapped together tightly with strings. To prevent the banana leaf from coming apart during cooking, bánh tét are usually wrapped again several times with a length of plastic ribbon before boiling in a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> photo ...|$|E

For a change we {{sometimes}} chopped it up finely, mixed {{it with a little}} pemmican, and brought all to the boil in a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> We were exceedingly hungry, but there was nothing to satisfy our appetites. Only a few ounces were used of the stock of ordinary food, to which was added a portion of dog's meat, never large, for each animal yielded so very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs. They crunched the bones and ate the skin, until nothing remained.|$|E

The army went to the village acting on information provided by Maoist cadre Bimala BK who was arrested by police in the Palanchok area and told the army in course of interrogation that Debi Sunar and her daughter Maina Sunuwar were in contact with the Maoist party. At the Training Centre, she was brutally tortured in the presence of seven officers and soldiers, including two captains. Under the orders of the then Lt. Col.

5000|$|Phillip Hamman, Sr. (c. 1753 - August 3, 1832), {{known as}} [...] "The Savior of Greenbrier", was an American {{frontier}} hero who was commended for bravery in the defence of Fort Donnally of Greenbrier County, West Virginia from a Shawnee attack in 1778. Hamman and John Pryor volunteered {{to go to}} Greenbrier County and warn the people of an impending Indian attack by two-hundred warriors. Chief Cornstalk's sister Nonhelema, {{a friend of the}} white people, painted Pryor and Hamman's faces as Indians. Even though the Indians had several days' head start, the two were able to get ahead of the Indians and warn the inhabitants of the fort. During the attack Hamman killed one man with his tomahawk as the Indian tried to force his way through the door of the fort. Dick Pointer, an African slave of Col. Andrew Donnally, loaded a musket and shot at the invading Indians until he and Hamman could shut the door, saving the inhabitants of the fort. Later Philip shot another Indian that had been underneath the flooring, trying to start a fire to burn down the building. The women had a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on the fire in case of wounds, Philip raised a board in the floor and the women poured boiling water onto the Indian, causing him to run to the stockade fence, and in trying to climb the wall, Philip shot him.|$|E

50|$|Almost all of {{the objects}} are {{hammered}} into shape from a single piece or block of copper, including details like handles and decorative figures which are shaped along with the main body. This {{eliminates the need for}} soldering. The embossing, also called repoussé and chasing, is a form of decorating the basic shape of a vessel or other piece. It consists of hammering the piece from the inside to push the shape outwards. After this shape is made, details are added by chiseling and engraving. Then the copper pieces are put into a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>water</b> in order to give them their distinctive color. To give pieces an added shine, they are treated with sulfuric acid, soap, water and steel wool.|$|R

60|$|We {{have said}} that all fires had been extinguished, {{but this is not}} {{strictly}} correct, for in the room where the two maidens watched there was an iron stove so enclosed that the fire inside did not show, and as it was fed with charcoal there were neither flames nor sparks to betray its presence.

He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|R

2500|$|Epiphany is the [...] "water sanctification" [...] {{the dive}} of the Cross in {{imitation}} of the Baptism of Christ. But in Greek ethimology, that Sanctification {{is the notion of}} expiation, purification of the people and the exemption from the influence of demons. The most recently this concept is certainly not strictly Christian, but has roots in ancient worship. In most parts of Greece sanctification for the first time (in those days) the eve of Epiphany called [...] "small sanctification" [...] or [...] "Protagiasi" [...] or [...] "Enlightenment". By protagiasi the priest turns all the houses and the Cross and one strand royal [...] "sanctifies" [...] or [...] "brighten" [...] (sprinkling) rooms of houses. The protagiasi is the effective means by which permitted in wild flight goblins except the lighting of a large outdoor fire. The Great Blessing however is the day of the Epiphany in the Churches in a special rig embellished upon which brought <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> full <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Then, a dive of Cross Sea or nearby river or lake or the need to tank (as in Athens). Diving the Cross, according to popular belief gives the water cleansing and sanitizing capabilities. The inhabitants of many areas after diving run on sea beaches or along rivers or lakes and wash their agricultural tools and even icons. In common folk belief even the icons {{with the passage of time}} lose their original strength and value to the gain but again the holy water. It is this process not only exactly true survival of ancient beliefs. The ancient example Athenians had the ceremony (procedure) of known [...] "Wash" [...] as it was called at that carried [...] "in procession" [...] on the Faliro coast of the statue of Athena. There, they washed with salt water to cleanse from Fmoc and renewed the sacred powers of the statue. At Delphi the Theophania was an annual festival celebrating the return of Apollo from his winter quarters in Hyperborea.|$|R

6000|$|The Somal hold {{mainly to}} the Shafei school of El Islam: their {{principal}} peculiarity is that of not reciting prayers over the dead even in the towns. The marriage ceremony is simple: {{the price of the}} bride and the feast being duly arranged, the formula is recited by some priest or pilgrim. I have often been requested to officiate on these occasions, and the End of Time has done it by irreverently reciting the Fatihah over the happy pair. [18] The Somal, as usual amongst the heterogeneous mass amalgamated by El Islam, have a diversity of superstitions attesting their Pagan origin. Such for instance are their oaths by stones, their reverence of cairns and holy trees, and their ordeals <b>of</b> fire and <b>water,</b> the Bolungo <b>of</b> Western Africa. A man accused of murder or theft walks down a trench full of live charcoal and about a spear's length, or he draws out of the flames a smith's anvil heated to redness: some prefer picking four or five cowries from a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> full <b>of</b> boiling <b>water.</b> The member used is at once rolled up in the intestines of a sheep and not inspected for a whole day. They have traditionary seers called Tawuli, like the Greegree-men of Western Africa, who, by inspecting the fat and bones of slaughtered cattle, [...] "do medicine," [...] predict rains, battles, and diseases of animals. This class is of both sexes: they never pray or bathe, and are therefore considered always impure; thus, being feared, they are greatly respected by the vulgar. Their predictions are delivered in a rude rhyme, often put for importance into the mouth of some deceased seer. During the three months called Rajalo [19] the Koran is not read over graves, and no marriage ever takes place. The reason of this peculiarity is stated to be imitation of their ancestor Ishak, who happened not to contract a matrimonial alliance at such epoch: it is, however, a manifest remnant of the Pagan's auspicious and inauspicious months. Thus they sacrifice she- camels in the month Sabuh, and keep holy with feasts and bonfires the Dubshid or New Year's Day. [20] At certain unlucky periods when the moon is in ill-omened Asterisms those who die are placed in bundles of matting upon a tree, the idea being that if buried a loss would result to the tribe.
