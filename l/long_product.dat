5000|$|Product {{development}} {{within the}} telecommunication industry has traditionally followed rigorous standards for stability, protocol adherence and quality, {{reflected by the}} use of the term carrier grade to designate equipment demonstrating this reliability.

The rise of significant competition in communication services from fast-moving organizations operating at large scale on the public Internet (such as Google Talk, Skype, Netflix) has spurred service providers to look for ways to disrupt the status quo.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the plant}} was highly successful, but {{numerous}} factors contributed to {{a sharp decline in}} sales of the cars manufactured at Westmoreland and the factory's ultimate demise: increased competition in the North American small car market, easing of the period's fuel crisis, poorly received changes to the character of the cars, VWoA's <b>long</b> <b>product</b> life-cycle, the internal economics of the plant itself, persistent labor unrest at the plant and poor networking between Westmoreland and Volkswagen headquarters in Germany. The factory operated at less than half its design capacity and VWoA suffered operating losses during the last five years of its operation. Sales of Volkswagen's U.S.-built cars plummeted by nearly 60 percent between 1980 and 1985.|$|E

5000|$|When Nucor—now one of {{the largest}} steel {{producers}} in the U.S.—decided to enter the <b>long</b> <b>products</b> market in 1969, they chose to start up a mini-mill, with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern US, the companies that followed them into mini-mill operations concentrated on local markets for <b>long</b> <b>products,</b> where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for <b>long</b> <b>products,</b> while integrated mills, using blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, cornered the markets for [...] "flat products"—sheet steel and heavier steel plate.

50|$|The {{contemporary}} e-commerce trend recommends {{companies to}} shift the traditional business model where focus on “standardized products, homogeneous market and <b>long</b> <b>product</b> life cycle” to the new business model where focus on “varied and customized products”. E-commerce requires the company {{to have the ability}} to satisfy multiple needs of different customers and provide them with wider range of products. With more choices of products, the information of products for customers to select and meet their needs become crucial. In order to address the mass customization principle to the company, the use of recommender system is suggested. This system helps recommend the proper products to the customers and helps customers make the decision during the purchasing process. The recommender system could be operated through the top sellers on the website, the demographics of customers or the consumers’ buying behavior. However, there are 3 main ways of recommendations: recommending products to customers directly, providing detailed products’ information and showing other buyers’ opinions or critiques. It is benefit for consumer experience without physical shopping. In general, recommender system is used to contact customers online and assist finding the right products they want effectively and directly.|$|E

Capacity of this plant is planned to be doubled to 1 million TPA. The company plans to integrate backwards to the mining of iron ore, chrome ore and coal. Captive iron ore mining leases in Odisha are under the process of allotment by the Government. A chrome ore deposit in Odisha is being developed through Ghotaringa Minerals Limited, {{a subsidiary of the}} company. VISA Steel also plans to set up a fully integrated 2.5 million TPA Steel Plant with 500 MW captive power plant at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh.

Lisco produced over 574 kn of finished {{products in the}} first half of 2005, increasing 65% over the first half of 2004. The company also increased liquid steel production 52%. Rebar was 57.3% of finished products, hot-rolled coils was 39.3%. Sponge iron production was 579.407 tons, 348.243 tons of HBI, 376.239 tons of billets and blooms and 281.832 tons of slabs. During the first nine months of 2005, Lisco reached its highest production ever; 1 million tons of liquid steel. This was confirmed by Secretary of the Popular Committee, Dr. Mohammad Abu Ojeila Al-Mabrouk at celebrations in September 2005 on the occasion of the passage of 15 years since the company’s mills began production, which concurs with the anniversary of the Al-Fatah Revolution in Libya. In 2005, Lisco achieved the highest rate of increase in steel production among Arab companies, which amounted to 34.8%. Its production increased by 65% in the period from January to June 2005 compared with the same period of 2004. Production of both long and flat products was 1.070 tons in 2006.
