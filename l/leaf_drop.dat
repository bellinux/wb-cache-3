5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles and <b>leaf</b> <b>drop.</b> As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{females and}} nymphs suck sap with their {{piercing}} mouthparts. This leads to plant {{damage in the}} form of wilting and chlorosis of the foliage, <b>leaf</b> <b>drop,</b> stunted growth, and sometimes the death of the plant. Fruits such as oranges become lumpy and discolored when the insect feeds on them, and they may fall off the tree. Insects packed with harvested fruits continue to feed, causing more losses during shipping. The mealybug secretes honeydew, which coats leaves and fruits and causes the growth of sooty molds. A layer of mold can reduce the ability of a leaf to perform photosynthesis, and makes fruit unmarketable. The citrus mealybug is also a vector for plant viruses.|$|E
25|$|This {{class of}} PGR is {{composed}} of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought {{to play a role}} in the processes of natural <b>leaf</b> <b>drop,</b> but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as gibberellin levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.|$|E

40|$|Leafcutting ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) {{sometimes}} form piles or caches {{of leaves}} on foraging trails. Laboratory experiments {{have shown that}} leaf caching at the nest entrance by Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica is adaptive because it occurs when a colony's leaf delivery rate exceeds its leaf-processing rate and serves to increase {{the probability that a}} <b>dropped</b> <b>leaf</b> is eventually recovered. We examined the occurrence and adaptive value of leaf caching on foraging trails in field colonies of A. colombica in Panama. The probability of leaf caching was positively related to trail traffic with cache locations being frequently associated with changes in gradient or terrain along the trail. Artificially blocking foraging trails resulted in caching behaviour but only when the blockage was near the leaf source or the nest entrance. This mirrors individual <b>leaf</b> <b>dropping</b> on trails and bottleneck-induced nest entrance caching in the laboratory. Leaves were recovered more rapidly from caches but because leaves were not selected according to forager size they were transported back to the nest more slowly than normally foraged leaves. Thus, whilst caching provides benefits, by increasing the likelihood of leaf recovery, it imposes a cost through mismatching forager and load size. Leaf caching is an example of an organizational shift (from direct foraging to foraging with task partitioning) and we provide a minimum estimate of the cost of this shift. Leaf caching encompasses two behaviours, <b>leaf</b> <b>dropping</b> and cache formation. <b>Leaf</b> <b>dropping,</b> and therefore the switch to task partitioning, is not in itself adaptive and cache formation has costs as well as benefits. We propose that leaf caching is making the best of a bad job if for some reason it is necessary for foragers to put down their leaf...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Task {{partitioning}} in eusocial {{animals is}} most likely an evolutionary adaptation that optimizes {{the efficiency of the}} colony to grow and reproduce. It was investigated indirect task partitioning in two castes sizes; this involves task partitioning in which the material transported is not transferred directly from one individual to another, but where it is dropped by one ant to be picked up by another. In two separate approaches, it was confirmed previous results pertaining to leaf caching activities among Atta colombica with task partitioning activities involving <b>leaf</b> <b>dropping</b> among Atta sexdens rubropilosa, {{in which there is a}} correlation between the size of an individual ant and the leaf fragment it transports. It was also suggested that this correlation exists only in individual ants that cut and transport (CaT) the same fragment to the nest. When task partitioning occurs and individual ants transporting (T) leaf fragments cut by other ants, the correlation becomes looser or disappears.
