40|$|Oxytocin is a peptide drug used {{to induce}} labor and prevent {{bleeding}} after childbirth. Due to its instability, {{transport and storage}} of oxytocin formulations under tropical conditions is problematic. In a previous study, {{we have found that}} the stability of oxytocin in aspartate buffered formulation is improved by the addition of divalent metal ions (unpublished results). The stabilizing effect of Zn 2 + was by far superior compared to that of Mg 2 +. In addition, it was found that stabilization correlated well with the ability of the divalent metal ions to interact with oxytocin in aspartate buffer. Furthermore, <b>LC–MS</b> (<b>MS)</b> measurements indicated that the combination of aspartate buffer and Zn 2 + in particular suppressed intermolecular degradation reactions near the Cys 1, 6 disulfide bridge. These results lead to the hypothesis that in aspartate buffer, Zn 2 + changes the conformation of oxytocin {{in such a way that}} the Cys 1, 6 disulfide bridge is shielded from its environment thereby suppressing intermolecular reactions involving this region of the molecule. To verify this hypothesis, we investigate here the conformation of oxytocin in aspartate buffer in the presence of Mg 2 + or Zn 2 +, using 2 D NOESY, TOCSY, 1 H– 13 C HSQC and 1 H– 15 N HSQC NMR spectroscopy. Almost all 1 H, 13 C and 15 N resonances of oxytocin could be assigned using HSQC spectroscopy, without the need for 13 C or 15 N enrichment. 1 H– 13 C and 1 H– 15 N HSQC spectra showed that aspartate buffer alone induces minor changes in oxytocin in D 2 O, with the largest chemical shift changes observed for Cys 1. Zn 2 + causes more extensive changes in oxytocin in aqueous solution than Mg 2 +. Our findings suggest that the carboxylate group of aspartate neutralizes the positive charge of the N-terminus of Cys 1, allowing the interactions with Zn 2 + to become more favorable. These interactions may explain the protection of the disulfide bridge against intermolecular reactions that lead to dimerization...|$|E
40|$|The Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) protein regulates {{numerous}} nuclear {{events such}} as transcription, mitosis and meiosis and DNA repair. These processes are critical to the programmed nuclear events of conjugation in ciliates and provide the potential to investigate developmentally regulated SUMOylation. We predicted a developmental increase in SUMOylation during late conjugation based on the extensive genome remodeling in the developing macronucleus (anlagen) of Tetrahymena thermophila. Immunoblotting of cell lysates from vegetative and mating cells using anti-SUMO antibodies revealed distinct developmental differences and an increased signal correlated with formation of the anlagen. Immunofluorescence of mating Tetrahymena cells with the same antibody revealed an increase in staining of the parental macronucleus until the signal shifts to the anlagen at 7 hours post-mixing. This along with the finding that GFP-Uba 2 fusion proteins localize to the anlagen {{is consistent with a}} major nuclear role for SUMOylation during conjugation. Germ-line knockout mutants of SUMO (SMT 3) and UBA 2 are vegetative lethal and conditional mutants dependent on a cadmium-inducible metallothionein promoter exhibit reduced cell growth and increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents upon cadmium withdrawal. Interestingly, mating of Uba 2 p conditional lines leads to a cadmium-dependent delay after meiosis but prior to macronuclear development predicting a SUMOylation-dependent event. Additionally, in an effort to provide further insight into the various processes affected by SUMO modification, we utilized a proteomics-based approach to generate an unbiased spectrum of SUMO protein substrates from vegetative Tetrahymena. We used a two-step affinity purification scheme to isolate SUMO substrates from a tagged Tetrahymena strain. Proteins from the purification were then identified by subsequent <b>LC-MS.</b> <b>MS</b> analysis using a QuadTOF mass spectrometer. We identified 110 candidate proteins that were identified by 2 or more peptides. The nature of the protein substrates that were identified is consistent with roles of SUMOylation in modulating diverse cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, protein folding and translation, metabolism and crosstalk with other post-translational modifications. These results support multiple roles of SUMOylation in regulating various cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. Taken together, our findings provide the foundation for additional studies of SUMOylation during conjugation in Tetrahymena. ...|$|E
