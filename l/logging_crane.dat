2500|$|Early Elkmont was {{a typical}} {{temporary}} logging camp. [...] These camps bore a resemblance to later Depression-era shanty towns. [...] Shanty houses (or [...] "set off" [...] houses), a post office, a transient hotel, a commissary, and sheds critical to railroad maintenance were the town's only buildings. [...] Many loggers lived in boarding houses, and some crossed Sugarland Mountain via a trail connecting Elkmont to the Sugarlands. [...] As logging operations progressed, it became necessary to move the camp higher up the mountain slopes to the south. [...] The company managed this by loading the shanties onto railroad flatcars and moving them to pre-constructed foundations using a <b>logging</b> <b>crane.</b> Although the logging camps moved, Elkmont remained the company's primary base of operations in the upper Little River valley.|$|E
40|$|The {{awareness}} and concern of our environment together with legislation have set {{more and more}} tightening demands for energy efficiency of non-road mobile machinery (NRMM). Integrated electro-hydraulic energy converter (IEHEC) has been developed in Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). The elimination of resistance flow, and the recuperation of energy makes it very efficient alternative. The difficulties of IEHEC machine to step to the market has been the requirement of one IEHEC machine per one actuator. The idea is to switch IEHEC between two actuators of <b>log</b> <b>crane</b> using fast on/off valves. The control system architecture is introduced. The system has been simulated in co-simulation using two different software. The simulated responses of pump-controlled system is compared to {{the responses of the}} conventional valve-controlled system...|$|R
5000|$|The {{usefulness}} of the shed and log handling machinery declined in the late 1950s, and White's Shed {{was no longer in}} operation after the bulk sugar terminal was established at Portsmith in 1964. At this new terminal, huge volumes of sugar could be stored and delivered directly into the holds of ships, without needing to be packed into bags or other containers. This new method of sugar handling reduced significantly the wharf labour force for sugar. The sinker <b>log</b> <b>crane</b> {{on the west side of}} the shed was sold in 1959 and was later used at Rankine's Peeramon Mill, near Lake Eacham on the Atherton Tablelands, where it currently resides. The disused White's Shed was subsequently leased to mining companies, perhaps as early as the 1960s. The shed was used to store copper concentrate from the Red Dome mine between 1993 and 1997, and was leased to the Dianne Copper Mine prior to this. The name [...] "White's Shed" [...] derives from this period.|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} {{of the dynamics of}} flexible manipulators like <b>log</b> <b>cranes</b> often requires advanced control methods. This thesis discusses the vibration problems in the cranes used in commercial forestry machines. Two control methods, adaptive filtering and semi-active damping, are presented. The adaptive filter uses a part of the lowest natural frequency of the crane as a filtering frequency. The payload estimation algorithm, filtering of control signal and algorithm for calculation of the lowest natural frequency of the crane are presented. The semi-active damping method is basedon pressure feedback. The pressure vibration, scaled with suitable gain, is added to the control signal of the valve of the lift cylinder to suppress vibrations. The adaptive filter cuts off high frequency impulses coming from the operatorand semi-active damping suppresses the crane?s oscillation, which is often caused by some external disturbance. In field tests performed on the crane, a correctly tuned (25 % tuning) adaptive filter reduced pressure vibration by 14 - 17 % and semi-active damping correspondingly by 21 - 43 %. Applying of these methods require auxiliary transducers, installed in specific points in the crane, and electronically controlled directional control valves...|$|R
50|$|Washington Iron Works was {{a company}} in Seattle, Washington, founded by John M. Frink, that built these steam skidders. The company was active from 1882 until the 1980s when its various {{divisions}} - manufacturing <b>cranes,</b> <b>logging</b> equipment, and presses - were gradually sold off. The Works closed in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The mill is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a steam driven hardwood sawmill of the 1930s with associated staff accommodation. The site includes the main sawmill shed housing the saws, benches and trolleys, the boiler and engine sheds, staff housing, <b>log</b> yard, <b>crane</b> and a creek from which water was drawn for the steam engine. Within the sawmill shed, the original layout of the mill has been largely preserved and follows the basic design principles for steam powered sawmills of the era. A saw sharpening room remains extant within this shed.|$|R
50|$|Members of the {{community}} made furniture and donated relics and memorabilia to furnish the <b>log</b> cabin. Andirons, <b>crane</b> and lug hooks were donated for the fireplace. A museum collection located {{in the lobby of}} the court house was moved to the log cabin and incorporated into the display there. The museum opened on June 18, 1924.|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{environments and}} {{real-time}} simulators (VERS) {{are becoming more}} and more important tools in research and development (R&D) process of non-road mobile machinery (NRMM). The virtual prototyping techniques enable faster and more cost-efficient development of machines compared to use of real life prototypes. High energy efficiency has become an important topic in the world of NRMM because of environmental and economic demands. The objective of this thesis is to develop VERS based methods for research and development of NRMM. A process using VERS for assessing effects of human operators on the life-cycle efficiency of NRMM was developed. Human in the loop simulations are ran using an underground mining loader to study the developed process. The simulations were ran in the virtual environment of the Laboratory of Intelligent Machines of Lappeenranta University of Technology. A physically adequate real-time simulation model of NRMM was shown to be reliable and cost effective in testing of hardware components by the means of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. A control interface connecting integrated electro-hydraulic energy converter (IEHEC) with virtual simulation model of <b>log</b> <b>crane</b> was developed. IEHEC consists of a hydraulic pump-motor and an integrated electrical permanent magnet synchronous motorgenerator. The results show that state of the art real-time NRMM simulators are capable to solve factors related to energy consumption and productivity of the NRMM. A significant variation between the test drivers is found. The results show that VERS can be used for assessing human effects on the life-cycle efficiency of NRMM. HIL simulation responses compared to that achieved with conventional simulation method demonstrate the advances and drawbacks of various possible interfaces between the simulator and hardware part of the system under study. Novel ideas for arranging the interface are successfully tested and compared with the more traditional one. The proposed process for assessing the effects of operators on the life-cycle efficiency will be applied for wider group of operators in the future. Driving styles of the operators can be analysed statistically from sufficient large result data. The statistical analysis can find the most life-cycle efficient driving style for the specific environment and machinery. The proposed control interface for HIL simulation need to be further studied. The robustness and the adaptation of the interface in different situations must be verified. The future work will also include studying the suitability of the IEHEC for different working machines using the proposed HIL simulation method...|$|R
