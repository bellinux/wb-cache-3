40|$|Abstract: Lead is {{a highly}} toxic heavy metal. The {{investigation}} was conducted to remove Pb(II) from <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> industry wastewater by using electrodialysis (ED) in laboratory. The <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> industry wastewater has an initial Pb(II) concentration of 8. 5 mg/L. The performance of ED is determined {{by a set of}} fixed and variable process parameters such as inlet concentration, operating current density, and operating flow rate. Like all the efficient ED operations, the process has to be optimized in terms of overall costs considering cell component designs and properties as well as all operating parameters. Under the conditions of operating current density at 3 A/cm 2, liquid flow rate of 300 L/h and circulation time of 5 ~ 6, the Pb(II) concentration of <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> industrial outlet wastewater can be reduced to below 0. 01 mg/L and the conductivity could be reduced below 10 µs/cm.

The work develops a condensation-mass method of determination of organic gummy substances in gases and dust of the secondary lead production and adds new findings to the methods of investigation of the physicochemical properties of gases and dust. Use was made of the thermo-gravimetric method of investigation of the burning and pyrolisis processes of the <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> scrap organic mass and of methods of spectral and chemical analysis in studying the properties of the substances under investigation. The work offers a mechanism and a method of calculation of the <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> scrap organic mass transformation processes under the conditions of the blast smelting.
