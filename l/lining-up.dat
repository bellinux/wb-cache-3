50|$|At the Munich Olympics, Taylor {{was second}} in the 100 m. On {{the way to the}} final, Taylor was unwittingly a {{participant}} in the first athletics controversy of his career. Unlike his teammates Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson, Taylor was narrowly able to reach the start of his quarter-final race, when their coach Stan Wright unknowingly used an outdated Olympic schedule and failed to deliver his athletes to the track in time. As Taylor told it in a 2000 interview with the Tyler Morning Telegraph, the three athletes and Wright had left the Olympic village for their quarter-final runs. Whilst waiting for the bus to transport them, they wandered into the ABC-TV headquarters where they saw to their utter horror the athletes <b>lining-up</b> for the first heat, Robinson's heat. A frantic dash to the stadium ensued in a car driven by the ABC-TV employee Bill Norris. Both Robinson and Hart, who was scheduled to run in heat 2, were too late. Taylor, who was scheduled to run in heat 3, only had time to rip-off his sweats, put on his running shoes, and do a couple of knee bends before running.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for <b>lining-up</b> of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E

In Study 1, most participants spontaneously produced deictic terms, often in conjunction with pointing. Yet only among children with autism were there participants who referred to a location that was distal to themselves with the terms ‘this’ or ‘here’, or made atypical points with unusual precision, often <b>lining-up</b> with an eye. In Study 2, participants with autism were less accurate in responding to instructions involving contrastive deictic terms, and fewer responded accurately to indicative head nods...|$|E

40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been made}} {{during the past year}} in research on interwell partitioning tracers tests (PITTs). These advances include: (1) progress on the inverse problem of how to estimate the three-dimensional distribution of NAPL in aquifers from the tracer data, (2) the first ever partitioning tracer experiments in dual porosity media, (3) the first modeling of partitioning tracers in dual porosity media, (4) experiments with complex NAPLs such as coal tar, (5) the development of an accurate and simple method to predict partition coefficients using the equivalent alkane carbon number approach, (6) partitioning tracer experiments in large model aquifers with permeability layers, (7) the first ever analysis of partitioning tracer data to estimate the change in composition of a NAPL before and after remediation, (8) the first ever analysis of partitioning tracer data after a field demonstration of surfactant foam to remediate NAPL, and (9) experiments at elevated temperatures. The authors have developed a new analytic approach that has several advantages over existing approaches for inversion of tracer data. First, the technique utilizes an extremely efficient three-dimensional multiphase streamline simulator as a forward model. Second, the parameter sensitivities are formulated in terms of one-dimensional integrals of analytic functions along the streamlines. Thus, the computation of sensitivities for all model parameters requires only a single simulation run to construct the velocity field and generate the streamlines. The inversion of tracer data is then performed using a two-step iterative linearization that involves first <b>lining-up</b> the breakthrough times at the producing wells and then matching the production history. Their approach follows from an analogy between streamlines and ray tracing in seismology. The inverse method is analogous to seismic waveform inversion and thus, allows them to utilize efficient methods from geophysical imaging. The new approach has been applied for estimating permeability distribution based on conservative tracer tests (D. W. Vasco and A. Datta-Gupta: ``Asymptotic Solutions for Solute Transport: A Formalism for Tracer Tomography,'''' Submitted to Water Resources Research, December 1997), and is currently being extended for analysis of partitioning tracer data. ...|$|E
