5|$|Bicycle kicks {{can be used}} defensively {{to clear}} away the ball from the goalmouth or offensively to strike at the opponent's goal {{in an attempt to}} score. The bicycle kick is an {{advanced}} football skill that is dangerous for inexperienced players. Its successful performance has been limited <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the most experienced and athletic players in football history.|$|E

5000|$|The {{direction}} of flow changes gradually from <b>largely</b> south <b>to</b> north <b>to</b> <b>largely</b> west <b>to</b> east. Shortly after crossing into Morgan County it receives {{the flow of}} Daddys Creek, {{which is a good}} whitewater rafting stream. Downstream from this is the mouth of Clear Creek. This stream is also part of the Obed River [...] "Wild and Scenic" [...] designation; like Daddys Creek, it too is a premiere whitewater stream during periods of high flow.|$|R

5|$|Far {{from being}} extinct, {{in recent years}} the Carménère grape has been {{discovered}} to be thriving in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers almost inadvertently preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years, due <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> its similarity to Merlot.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{terrestrial}} locomotion of Pteranodon, especially {{whether it was}} bipedal or quadrupedal, {{has been the subject}} of debate.

5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} Discworld novels {{were written}} <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series evolved into straightforward (though still comedic) satire.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) {{requires}} {{its members}} to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. However, the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, due <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> pressure from the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the airframe was fairly conventional, with a semi-monocoque frame and multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> {{the area around the}} engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine.|$|E

5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E

Since then, he has founded a center for alternative medicine and is a noted advocate of health freedom. Due <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> his friendship with Tom Harkin, he remains an important political figure in Iowa, with politicians such as Howard Dean meeting him in their trips to the state. Also, the Elinor Bedell State Park was established in 1998 on land donated by Berkley and Elinor Bedell. The park is named after the Congressman's wife.|$|E
5|$|Bessas first sent an {{expeditionary force}} to {{suppress}} a rebellion among the Abasgians, who neighboured Lazica to the north. The expedition, under John Guzes, was successful, and the Abasgian leader Opsites {{was forced to}} flee across the Caucasus to the Sabir Huns. In spring 551, after a long siege and thanks <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> his own perseverance and bravery, the Byzantines and their Sabir allies (some 6,000 troops) captured Petra. A few Persians continued to resist from the citadel, but Bessas ordered it torched. Following his victory, he ordered the city walls razed to the ground.|$|E

If this trend continues, Žirmūnai's crime rate for 2006 would decrease to about 37.2 crimes per 1,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Country Grammar {{became the}} ninth hip hop album to be {{certified}} Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of 10 million copies in the US. Its commercial success secured Nelly's status {{as one of the}} most successful hip hop acts of the 2000s decade. On Billboard decade-end chart, Nelly ranked as the third most successful act of the 2000s decade, due <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the success of Country Grammar and his follow-up album Nellyville (2002).|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this emerging threat, Brock moved quickly to bolster Canadian defences. He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery. Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position due <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> his military reading, which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery. He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine (responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers). He ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes. This was to be pivotal during the war. But Brock's appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn.|$|E
