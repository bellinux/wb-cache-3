In addition, {{the effects of}} these phytosterols on cell growth and mitochondrial activity were evaluated on 158 N murine oligodendrocytes, C 6 rat glioma cells, and SK-N-BE human neuronal cells with the crystal violet test and the MTT test, respectively. The effects of spinasterol and schottenol were compared with 7 -ketocholesterol (71 CC) and ferulic acid, which is also present in argan and cactus <b>pear</b> <b>seed</b> oil. Whatever the cells considered, dose dependent cytotoxic effects of 71 CC were observed whereas no or slight effects of ferulic acid were found. With spinasterol and schottenol, no or slight effects on cell growth were detected. With spinasterol, reduced mitochondrial activities (30 - 50 %) were found on 158 N and C 6 cells; no effect was found on SK-N-BE. With schottenol, reduced mitochondrial activity were revealed on 158 N (50 %) and C 6 (10 - 20 %) cells; no effect was found on SK-N-BE. Altogether, these data suggest that spinasterol and schottenol can modulate mitochondrial activity and might therefore influence cell metabolism...|$|R

30|$|The {{application}} of economical and environment-friendly waste materials in production of biodiesel will {{play an important}} role in economizing the process and consequently expand the use of biodiesel all around the world. In this study, acid-activated clay (AAC) catalyst was used for producing biodiesel from African <b>Pear</b> <b>Seed</b> oil (APO) with methanol and compared with standard quality of biodiesel. The reaction was promoted by the large surface area and acidity of the catalyst and the biodiesel produced has qualities within the acceptable limits for biodiesel. The kinetics study showed that the transesterification of APO with AAC catalyst suits Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) with surface reaction between adsorbed triglyceride and adsorbed methanol as rate determining step (RDS). The rate constant increased as temperature increase show that the reaction was endothermic and preceded at higher temperature below the boiling point of methanol. Therefore, the production of quality biodiesel from APO with synthesized clay catalyst will make biodiesel production economical and affordable because the raw materials are cheap and easily available. The kinetic parameters will assist in design of reactors for biodiesel production.|$|R
30|$|Acid {{solutions}} generally {{used for}} the removal of rust and scale in industrial processes and the deterioration of metal due to these processes are very significant. Inhibitors are used in these processes to control metal dissolution. Hydrochloric acid is widely used in the pickling of steel and different steel-based alloys[1, 2]. One way of protecting steel from corrosion is to use corrosion inhibitors. Organic compounds containing heteroatoms are commonly used to reduce the corrosion attack on steel in acidic media[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The recent trend is towards environmentally friendly inhibitors. Most of the natural products are non-toxic, biodegradable, and readily available in plenty. These advantages have incited us to draw a large part of our laboratory program to examine natural substances as corrosion inhibitors such as fennel oil[17], prickly <b>pear</b> <b>seed</b> oil[18], argan extract[18, 19, 20, 21], argan oil[19, 22], rosemary oil[23, 24, 25], Thymus oil[26, 27], pennyroyal mint oil[28], lavender oil[29], jojoba oil[30], and Artemisia[31, 32, 33].|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the optimal ultrasound conditions (amplitude level and time) for the extraction of cactus <b>pear</b> <b>seed</b> oil with the highest antioxidant activity using a closed system. Seed oil was analyzed for yield, antioxidant activity by ABTS and DPPH, and antimicrobial activity. Conventional extraction methods were assessed for comparison. Amplitude level significantly affected antioxidant activity in linear terms (p < 0. 0001 DPPH and p < 0. 001 ABTS, resp.) so, at lower amplitudes, the higher antioxidant activity was achieved. The optimum ultrasound extraction conditions were of 78 % amplitude for 10 [*]min and yielded antioxidant activity values of 66. 25 [*]mg AAE/ 100 [*]g and 289 [*]µmol TE/ 100 [*]g for ABTS and DPPH, respectively. Compared with conventional extraction methods, ultrasound exhibited lower oil yield and antioxidant activity but had the potential to achieve comparable results if multiple ultrasound extractions are performed in the time needed by conventional methods. Seed oils showed similar antimicrobial activity despite the extraction method and were more effective against Escherichia coli.

40|$|Recently, an {{increased}} interest in antioxidant activity and health-improving capacity of cactus pear has been registered. The antioxidant capacity of the pulp of cactus-pear fruits has been previously assessed.

Tannins were the major phenolics in cactus <b>pear</b> <b>seeds</b> accounting for almost fifty percent for all cultivars. Analysis of variance revealed that ripeness, cultivar, and its interaction had highly significant effect on the total phenolics, tannin, and flavonoid contents of cactus pear peel. With regard to the seeds, only the stage of ripeness and interaction (ripeness stage x cultivar) were significant on total phenolics and tannins contents. The flavonoid content in seeds was not affected by any of the factors or their interactions. The antioxidant capacity was higher in the peel than in the seeds. Generally, fruits with light-green or yellow-brown peel have higher antiradical activity and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values compared with those with red-purple peel.

30|$|Kinetics and {{mechanism}} of heterogeneous transesterification reaction of African <b>pear</b> <b>seed</b> oil (APO) catalyzed by phosphoric acid-activated kaolin clay to produce biodiesel were investigated. Heterogeneous catalyst synthesized by activating clay with phosphoric acid {{was used to}} examine the effect of time, temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration and agitation speed on the production of biodiesel. The kinetics was studied using two elementary reaction mechanisms: Eley–Rideal (ER) and Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW). The results obtained showed that the clay belongs to kaolinite group and acid-activated clay catalyst, AAC was able to convert APO to standard biodiesel with the variation of catalyst concentration, temperature methanol, speed and reaction time having significant effect in the production. About 78 – 80 % biodiesel production was obtained with 10 : 1 methanol/oil molar ratio, 3  wt% AAC catalyst concentration, time 3  h, speed 300  rpm and at 60  °C temperature. The kinetics result revealed that the LHHW is the most reliable representation of the experimental data using acid-activated clay catalyst with surface reaction between adsorbed triglyceride and adsorbed methanol as rate determining step (RDS). The activation energy for the forward reaction was determined to be 10.08  kJ/mol. Hence, the production of biodiesel from non edible oil APO with cheap and available heterogeneous catalyst (AAC) is achievable.|$|R
40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} by {{animals is}} a key interaction, with effects on the population ecology and evolution of many plant lineages. Despite the fact that infrequent seed dispersers can potentially provide important services to plant populations, {{little attention has been}} paid so far to scarce mutualists. We assessed different aspects of quantity and quality of seed dispersal from fruit removal to seed germination in the Iberian pear, Pyrus bourgaeana, finding that fruit consumers markedly differed in the nature of their interaction with the tree. Whereas the abundant rodents, rabbits, and deer damaged all seeds eaten, the uncommon carnivores badger and fox and the abundant boars dispersed a large fraction of ingested seeds as viable propagules, acting as legitimate seed dispersers. Despite low rates of visitation by badgers to fruiting trees, they transported more viable seeds than the abundant boars, due to better seed treatment and a higher feeding rate on <b>pears.</b> <b>Seed</b> dispersal by all 3 legitimate dispersers, especially the badger, enhanced post-dispersal P. bourgaeana seed survival, supporting the “escape” predation hypothesis. Pyrus bourgaeana showed relatively high frequencies of visits by a myriad of frugivores; however, it relied on the dispersal service provided by an infrequent carnivore, the badger, rather than on those provided by the abundant mammalian herbivores. Therefore, under some circumstances, uncommon animal counterparts play major roles in their mutualistic interactions with flowering plants. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} storage and deep {{desiccation}} on structural changes of DNA in orthodox seeds are poorly characterized. In {{this study we}} analyzed the 5 -methylcytosine (m 5 C) global content of DNA isolated from <b>seeds</b> of common <b>pear</b> (Pyrus communis L.) that had been subjected to extreme desiccation, and the seedlings derived from these seeds. Germination and seedling emergence tests were applied to determine seed viability after their desiccation. In parallel, analysis of the global content of m 5 C in dried seeds and DNA of seedlings obtained from such seeds was performed with a 2 D TLC method. Desiccation of fresh seeds to 5. 3 % moisture content (mc) resulted in a slight reduction of DNA methylation, whereas severe desiccation down to 2 – 3 % mc increased DNA methylation. Strong desiccation of seeds resulted in the subsequent generation of seedlings of shorter height. A 1 -year period of seed storage induced {{a significant increase in}} the level of DNA methylation in seeds. It is possible that alterations in the m 5 C content of DNA in strongly desiccated <b>pear</b> <b>seeds</b> reflect a reaction of desiccation-tolerant (orthodox) seeds to severe desiccation.

We conducted a survey in order to characterize the relationships between the age of prickly pear orchards and argan tree regeneration. We also explored facilitating factors, such as soil organic matter and mycorrhiza. Results showed a high positive correlation (r(2) = 0. 75, p < 0. 001) between the age of prickly pear orchards and argan tree resprouts, but with differences depending on a continentality gradient.
