5000|$|Neottia cordata (L.) Rich. - {{widespread}} across Europe, northern Asia, Canada, US - <b>lesser</b> <b>twayblade,</b> heartleaf twayblade ...|$|E
50|$|Rocky {{outcrops}} on the site, when {{accompanied by}} free draining soil, provide habitat for heather, bilberry and bell-heather (Erica cinerea), with local dry-heath cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and petty-whin (Genista anglica). <b>Lesser</b> <b>twayblade</b> (Listera cordata) {{is found in}} association with old collapsing heather bushes.|$|E
50|$|Neottia cordata, <b>lesser</b> <b>{{twayblade}}</b> or heartleaf twayblade is an orchid of upland bogs and mires {{that rarely}} exceeds 15 cm in height. It was formerly {{placed in the}} genus Listera, but molecular phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} Neottia nidus-avis, the Bird's-nest Orchid, evolved within the same group.|$|E
50|$|Orchids in this coppiced wood include early-purples, <b>lesser</b> <b>twayblades,</b> common spotteds {{and greater}} butterflies. There are many birds, badgers and deer.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common <b>Twayblade,</b> <b>Lesser</b> Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} has been formed to protect {{an area of}} old-growth forest, springs, coastal meadows and a karst area. It is notable for its {{abundance}} of different species of orchid; around 15 are known {{to grow in the}} nature reserve, including <b>lesser</b> <b>twayblade,</b> lady’s slipper, fly orchid and musk orchid. It is also known as a breeding spot and stopover for migratory birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} protects {{an area of}} virgin forest in a hilly landscape, and also {{contains}} the Lake Gråssjön. Some parts of the forest is almost completely unaltered by human activity; for example, one tree in the nature reserve {{has been found to}} be 580 years old. The forest is mixed coniferous, and contains a lot of coarse woody debris. The unspoilt area is an important habitat for several unusual species, including <b>lesser</b> <b>twayblade,</b> heath spotted orchid and northern coralroot. It is also a preferred habitat for several birds, like osprey, red-throated loon and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker; the latter two are on the national Swedish red list.|$|E
50|$|On {{the pass}} summit, {{there is a}} {{transitional}} mire: in the mud sedge bog (Caricetum limosae plant community) grow, {{in addition to the}} mud sedge (Carex limosa, endangered) which gives the name of the plant community, also the <b>lesser</b> <b>twayblade</b> (Neottia cordata) and the dwarf birch (Betula nana). In the fen south of the Schwarzsee, a brown sedge marsh (Caricetum fuscae subalpinum community) with the endangered species common sedge (or brown sedge, Carex nigra), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) and bastard sundew (D. x obovata), as well as dwarf birch. There is a vale mire on the Kornock. Aside from the dominant deer-hair sedge (Trichophorum cespitosum), there are alpine bartsia (Bartsia alpina), alpine butterwort (Pinguicula alpina) and bog-bean (Menyanthes trifoliata).|$|E
