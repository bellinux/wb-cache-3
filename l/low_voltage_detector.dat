40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a 0. 6 V input, 0. 3 – 0. 55 V output buck converter in 40 nm CMOS, for low-voltage low-power wire-less sensor network systems. A low power CCM/DCM controller of the buck converter enables automatic selection of DCM or CCM operation depending on load situation, therefore improving the power efficiency. A dual-mode-body-biased (DMBB) zero-crossing detector with both forward body bias mode and zero body bias mode {{is designed to}} enable DCM operation with both <b>low</b> supply <b>voltage</b> and normal supply voltage. An ultra-low-power hysteresis <b>voltage</b> <b>detector</b> is proposed for body bias modes selection. The proposed buck converter achieves a peak efficiency of 94 % with an output current range of 50 µA to 10 mA. Thanks to the DCM operation, the efficiency at an output current of 10 µA is improved by 20 % and 9 %, with an output voltage of 0. 35 V and 0. 5 V, respectively.

40|$|Surfaces of hemp fibers with {{different}} treatments: (1) as received; (2) water washed; and (3) treated with NaOH, were examined {{using a combination}} of conventional Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), lignin staining and a novel <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in-lens <b>detector</b> SEM technique which provides compositional contrast between polymeric materials on the surface. Surface composition determined using quantitative X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the surfaces of the as received fibers and the water washed fibers were predominantly lignin and extractives and only after NaOH treatments was there sufficient oxygen on the surface to allow for the presence of polysaccharides. Using the in-lens backscattered SEM technique, spatial distribution of polymeric materials on the surface was shown to be highly non-uniform.

40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read "SAFETY AND HEALTH " in Section F of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The procedures to be used for determining holidays in epoxy coatings on ferrous materials are described in this method. This method uses an electrical current flow through a low resistance path to trigger an alarm (buzzer) to indicate to the operator the presence of a holiday. Holidays are defined as pinholes and voids in non-conductive coatings that allow current to pass through the protective coating to the metal base material. These discontinuities are such that they may not be visible to a person with normal or corrected vision. B. APPARATUS 1.

40|$|Most of the arc {{fault that}} occur in the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> {{switchboard}} starts at the joint. This paper presents a fundamental concept of using an alternative and simple approach to detect the series arc that occurs in the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> switchboard. The <b>voltage</b> <b>detector</b> is designed based on the voltage drop at the joint when the series arc occurs. Since non-linear loads produce harmonics and the harmonic content at the point of coupling varies from time to time, thus it is difficult to detect the arc in frequency domain. Therefore, the current detector is designed based on the shoulder and asymmetry properties of the arc fault current in time domain. Various arc models are investigated and the suitable models are implemented. The simulation result reveals that the circuit breaker is able to isolate the main supply from the load when all the relays from the detectors are energized {{in order to avoid the}} possibility of arc flash...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports a}} current {{mirroring}} integration (CMI) CMOS readout circuit for high-resolution infrared {{focal plane array}} (FPA) applications. The circuit uses a feedback structure with current mirrors to provide stable bias voltage across the photodetector diode, while mirroring the diode current to an integration capacitor. The integration capacitor can be placed outside of the unit pixel, reducing the pixel area and allowing to integrate the current on larger capacitance for larger charge storage capacity and dynamic range. The CMI unit cell allows almost rail-to-rail voltage swing on the integration capacitance for <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> operation. The <b>detector</b> bias <b>voltage</b> can be adjusted independently for various detector re-quirements. By virtue of current feedback in the CMI structure, very low (ideally zero) input impedance is achieved. The unit-cell contains just nine MOS transistors and occupies 20 m 25 m area in a 0. 8 - m CMOS process. The CMI circuit provides a maximum charge storage capacity of 5. 25 10 electrons and a maximum transimpedance of 6 10 for a 5 V power supply and 2 pF off-pixel integration capacitance.

40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage circuits on SiC has profound applications. SiC power devices have proved their superiority {{in terms of}} high temperature operation, faster switching frequencies and larger power densities when compared with Si power devices. The control of SiC power devices however, lies {{in the hands of}} <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> circuits built on Si. Thus, there exists a separation in the overall system between the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage side, which increases system cost, weight and reduces efficiency. With the advancement in <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> SiC processing technology, <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> control circuits can be made on the same die as power devices, and power systems will become compact, robust and more efficient. A new <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> process in 4 H-SiC has been characterized and modeled.
