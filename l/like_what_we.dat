25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
500|$|Astronomers {{sometimes}} use {{the alternative}} name Edgeworth–Kuiper belt to credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally {{referred to as}} EKOs. Brian G. Marsden claims that neither deserves true credit: [...] "Neither Edgeworth nor Kuiper wrote about anything remotely <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are now seeing, but Fred Whipple did". David Jewitt comments: [...] "If anything... Fernández most nearly deserves the credit for predicting the Kuiper Belt." ...|$|E
500|$|... s {{it happens}} {{in most of the}} author's works, there is not only the utmost keeping in each {{separate}} character; but in the casting of the different parts, and their relation to one another, there is an affinity and harmony, <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> may observe in the gradations of colour in a picture. The striking and powerful contrasts in which Shakespear abounds could not escape observation; but the use he makes of the principle of analogy to reconcile the greatest diversities of character and to maintain a continuity of feeling throughout, has not been sufficiently attended to.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} novel, Chase {{knew that her}} female protagonist had to {{be strong enough to}} equal Dain's {{forceful}} personality. Chase admits that because the novel is set in the period leading up to the Victorian era, a woman like Jessica could not have dealt with Dain, writing that [...] "if Jessica were <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> assume to be the typical young lady of her time, she could never handle Dain, and he’d think her too boring to live". Chase instead modeled Jessica after the type of women who lived a few generations previously and who had [...] "a more practical, frank attitude toward sex".|$|E
500|$|The UANC {{delegation}} was led, as expected, by Muzorewa {{and included}} Sithole representing ZANU, Nkomo for ZAPU and James Chikerema, the former ZAPU vice-president, {{for a third}} militant party, the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe. According to Rhodesian intelligence, the various nationalist factions had not patched up their differences, were not prepared to accept Muzorewa as their leader and, to this end, were hoping that the conference failed to produce an agreement. The Rhodesians relayed these concerns to Pretoria, which told them firmly that the UANC would surely not risk losing the support of Kaunda and the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere by deliberately sabotaging the peace process. When the Rhodesians persisted in their complaints, citing evidence of nationalist infighting in Lusaka, the South Africans were terser still, eventually wiring Salisbury: [...] "If you don't <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are offering, you always have the alternative of going it alone!" ...|$|E
500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where we were at the time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E

His revolutionary philosophies found adherents in the Shining Path of Peru, the Naxalite insurgency in India, various political movements in Nepal, the U.S.-based Black Panther Party, and the 1960s counterculture movement in general. In 2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang remarked that the Cultural Revolution represented the 'dangers of democracy', remarking [...] "People can go to the extreme <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> saw during the Cultural Revolution , when people take everything into their own hands, then you cannot govern the place". The remarks caused controversy in Hong Kong and were later retracted with an accompanying apology.|$|E

It sounded <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to be, kinda classy!". [...] The Svelts rehearsed {{initially}} in Terry's living room in Sacramento.

While on the Asian {{leg of the}} Back to Basics Tour, {{during the summer of}} 2007, Aguilera said that her upcoming album would be, [...] "short, sweet and completely different" [...] from its predecessor. After the birth of her son Max, Aguilera stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a completely new aspect of herself as an artist, because of the pregnancy with her son. In a February 2008 interview with People, Aguilera stated {{that she was going to}} start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her Beverly Hills, California residence. DJ Premier, who, at the time, was working on projects for his record label Year Round Records, shared plans to head back into the studio with Aguilera, and stated: [...] "She's doing an all pop album again, but she wants me to keep the tone <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did before.
