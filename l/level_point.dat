25|$|One {{important}} {{topographic feature}} is the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a low plateau that breaks up the Sierra Madre chain between the Sierra Madre del Sur {{to the north and}} the Sierra Madre de Chiapas to the south. At its highest point, the Isthmus is 224m (735ft) above mean sea level. This area also represents the shortest distance between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean in Mexico. The distance between the two coasts is roughly 200km (120mi). Although the northern side of the Isthmus is swampy and covered with dense jungle, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as the lowest and most <b>level</b> <b>point</b> within the Sierra Madre mountain chain, was nonetheless a main transportation, communication, and economic route within Mesoamerica.|$|E

50|$|MorgenGrauen has {{introduced}} a distinctive level system in May 1996, where the normal fighting experience points became {{only a small part}} of a player character's total level. Since then, PCs get additional <b>level</b> <b>points</b> for solving official and mini-quests, exploring areas, killing strong monsters the first time, guild skills and magic potions. For each 100 <b>level</b> <b>points</b> PCs may advance one level; the current maximum is about level 160. As an example, a high-level player may have about 5% of his points from fighting experience, about 5% from magic potions, 5% from guild skills, 30% from quest points, 20% from first-kill points and 35% from exploring. To prevent making exploring point locations known the <b>level</b> <b>points</b> lacking to the next advance are displayed only as approximate value.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the global power {{function}} of any nonparametric test is flat on balls of alternatives except for alternatives coming from a finite dimensional subspace.
