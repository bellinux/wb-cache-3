5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) {{is a process that}} is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, <b>levetiracetam</b> and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with <b>levetiracetam</b> and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, <b>levetiracetam</b> and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and <b>levetiracetam</b> from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child {{and his or her}} family, antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, <b>levetiracetam</b> and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E
25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant <b>levetiracetam,</b> and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{cure for}} HCP caused by the {{deficient}} activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase. [...] Treatment of the acute symptoms of HCP {{is the same as}} for other acute porphyrias. [...] Intravenous hemin (as heme arginate or hematin) is the recommended therapy for acute attacks. [...] Acute attacks can be severe enough to cause death if not treated quickly and correctly. [...] Hospitalization is typically required for administration of hemin, and appropriate drug selection is key to avoid exacerbating symptoms with drugs that interact poorly with porphyrias. [...] Proper drug selection is most difficult when it comes to treatment of the seizures that can accompany HCP, as most anti-seizure medications can make the symptoms worse. [...] Gabapentin and <b>levetiracetam</b> are two anti-seizure drugs that are thought to be safe.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{effective}} anti-epileptic medication for JME is valproic acid (Depakote). Women are often started on alternative medications due to [...] valproic acid's {{high incidence of}} fetal malformations. Lamotrigine, <b>levetiracetam,</b> topiramate, and zonisamide are alternative anti-epileptic medications with less frequent incidence of pregnancy related complications, and they are often used first in females of childbearing age. Carbamazepine may aggravate primary generalized seizure disorders such as JME. [...] Treatment is lifelong. Patients should be warned to avoid sleep deprivation.|$|E
2500|$|By 1994, {{primidone}} was {{no longer}} {{one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. Phenytoin was still regarded as the drug of choice for partial seizures due to its long half-life and low cost; but for children, carbamazepine was seen as the best one due to phenytoin's effects on physical appearance. Topiramate was approved two years later. It, along with the others, was mainly used in patients refractory to carbamazepine and valproate. These new agents were often described as having [...] "innovative" [...] and [...] "selective" [...] mechanisms of action; in reality, most of them also worked similarly to older agents. On February 28, 1998, Élan Corporation, plc, bought the trademark and exclusive product distribution rights for Mysoline from Wyeth in Canada and the United States at a cost of $46 million and a royalty on future sales. The actual manufacture and distribution was done by Athena Neurosciences; their name appeared on a Mysoline package information sheet dated June 1998. On November 30, 1999, <b>levetiracetam</b> was approved for the adjunctive treatment of partial epilepsy in adults in the United States.|$|E

50|$|<b>Levetiracetam</b> is {{eliminated}} from the body primarily by the kidneys with about 66 percent of the original drug passed unchanged into urine. The plasma half-life of <b>levetiracetam</b> in adults is about 6 to 8 hours.|$|E
50|$|No {{significant}} pharmacokinetic {{interactions were}} observed between <b>levetiracetam</b> or its major metabolite and concomitant medications. The pharmacokinetic profile of <b>levetiracetam</b> is not influenced by phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, digoxin, oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol, or warfarin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levetiracetam,</b> {{along with}} other anti-epileptic drugs, can {{increase}} the risk of suicide behavior or thoughts. People taking <b>levetiracetam</b> should be monitored closely for signs of worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or tendencies, or any altered emotional or behavioral states.|$|E
5000|$|Brivaracetam — an {{analogue}} of piracetam {{with the}} same additional side chain as <b>levetiracetam</b> and a three-carbon chain. It exhibits greater antiepileptic properties than <b>levetiracetam</b> in animal models, but with a somewhat smaller, although still high, therapeutic range.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levetiracetam</b> {{does not}} undergo {{extensive}} metabolism, and the metabolites formed are not active {{and do not}} exert pharmacological activity. Metabolism of <b>levetiracetam</b> is not by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, but through other metabolic pathways such as hydrolysis and hydroxylation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Levetiracetam</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} in the United States as add-on treatment for partial (focal), myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. <b>Levetiracetam</b> {{has been approved}} in the European Union as a monotherapy treatment for epilepsy {{in the case of}} partial seizures, or as an adjunctive therapy for partial, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. [...] <b>Levetiracetam</b> has been shown to reduce partial (focal) seizures by 50% or more as an add-on medication. It is also used in veterinary medicine for similar purposes.|$|E
50|$|Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam {{family that}} is {{structurally}} related to <b>levetiracetam</b> (trade name Keppra).

50|$|<b>Levetiracetam</b> is an {{anti-epileptic drug}} {{than can be}} used to treat partial and {{generalized}} seizures. <b>Levetiracetam</b> inhibits P/Q channel-mediated glutamate release and decreases the excitatory post synaptic currents of both AMPA and NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, specifically the dentate gyrus, which is known to propagate seizure activities. The inhibition of glutamate release results in an anti-epileptic response in patients because it decreases the excitatory postsynaptic current. There are many different types of calcium channels, so to prove that the P/Q type calcium channels are directly involved, a P/Q type voltage gated calcium channel inhibitor, omega-agatoxin TK, was used to block the channel. When blocked, patients no longer benefited from the anti-epileptic effects from the drugs. When blockers for L type and N type calcium channels were used, the effects of <b>Levetiracetam</b> were still seen. This is strong evidence that the P/Q type calcium channels are involved in the <b>Levetiracetam</b> treatment which allow for relief from seizures.|$|E

50|$|Brivaracetam is {{believed}} to act by binding to the ubiquitous synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), like <b>levetiracetam.</b> but with 20-fold greater affinity. There {{is some evidence that}} racetams including <b>levetiracetam</b> and brivaracetam access the luminal side of recycling synaptic vesicles during vesicular endocytosis. They may reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release and enhance synaptic depression during trains of high-frequency activity, such as {{is believed}} to occur during epileptic activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levetiracetam</b> is {{sometimes}} used off-label to treat status epilepticus or to prevent seizures associated with subarachnoid hemorrhages.|$|E
50|$|Compared to <b>levetiracetam,</b> which binds at {{the same}} site, seletracetam binds to SV2A with ten times higher affinity.|$|E
50|$|Brivaracetam (trade name Briviact), a {{chemical}} analog of <b>levetiracetam,</b> is a racetam derivative with anticonvulsant (antiepileptic) properties. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company UCB.|$|E
50|$|Phenytoin {{may be used}} {{concurrently}} {{to prevent}} the seizures. <b>Levetiracetam,</b> has shown efficacy for the prophylaxis against busulfan-induced seizures. Benzodiazepines {{can also be used}} for busulfan-induced seizures.|$|E
