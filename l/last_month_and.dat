Sexual contacts within the <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> {{people who live in}} the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} {{disorders are}} caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Surveys from the United States have found about 10% of pregnant women have drunk alcohol in the <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> 20% to 30% drank {{at some point during}} the pregnancy. About 4.7% of North American women who are pregnant are alcoholics. The risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as when during pregnancy the alcohol is consumed. Other risk factors include an older mother, smoking, and poor diet. There is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy. While drinking small amounts of alcohol does not cause abnormalities in the face, it may cause behavioral issues. Alcohol crosses the blood brain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing baby. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in the person.|$|E

500|$|New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer {{described}} helping Brown win the Mayoral race as his [...] "biggest campaign priority" [...] in the <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> a {{half before}} Primary Day. Buffalo, which had an 8:1 Democrat to Republican ratio and a 38% black population, was 75% contained in Brown's State Senate district. Brown carried 59% {{of the vote in}} the September 13, 2005 Democratic primary, and faced Kevin Helfer, a former City Council colleague, in the general election. Brown was the sixth African-American to win the Democratic Mayor Primary since the 1960s, but all before him had failed to win the general election, even though the city had not elected a Republican since 1961. His Republican opponent, Helfer, beat him in the Conservative Party Primary as a write-in candidate, although Brown had been endorsed by that party. Brown raised more than five times as much money as Helfer, however, and defeated him 64% to 27% in the general election.|$|E

2500|$|A {{second study}} in 2014 was {{conducted}} to examine the health of women who had read the series, compared with a control group that had never read {{any part of the}} novels. The results showed a correlation between having read at least the first book and exhibiting signs of an eating disorder, having romantic partners that were emotionally abusive and/or engaged in stalking behaviour, engaging in binge drinking in the <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> having 5 or more sexual partners before age 24. The authors could not conclude whether women already experiencing these [...] "problems" [...] were drawn to the series, or if the series influenced these behaviours to occur after reading by creating underlying context. The study's lead researcher contends that the books romanticise dangerous behaviour and [...] "perpetuate dangerous abuse standards." [...] The study was limited in that only women up to age 24 were studied, and no distinction was made among the reader sample between women who enjoyed the series and those that had a strong negative opinion of it, having only read it out of curiosity due to the media hype or other obligation.|$|E
2500|$|The supply {{situation}} in Kharkov was now catastrophic; artillerymen after firing their last rounds, were abandoning their guns to fight as infantrymen. The army's supply depot had five trainloads of spare tank tracks {{left over from}} [...] "Zitadelle" [...] but very little else. The high consumption of ammunition in the <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> a half had cut into supplies put aside {{for the last two}} weeks of August and {{the first two weeks of}} September; until the turn of the month the army would have to get along with fifty percent of its daily average requirements in artillery & tank ammunition. XI Army Corps now had a combat strength of only 4,000 infantrymen, one man for every ten yards of front. General Erhard Raus explains the intensity of the constant Russian attacks: [...] Wöhler, recognizing the hopelessness of the situation, did not prove anymore resolute, in view of the harsh realities facing the defenders of Kharkov, he knew that the depleted Infantry regiments could not hold their positions without copious artillery support. Two days after taking command of 8th Army, Wöhler also asked Manstein for permission to abandon the city. Regardless of Hitler's demand that the city be held, Wöhler and Manstein agreed that the city could not be defended for long, given the diminishing German strength and the overwhelming size of Soviet reserves.|$|E
