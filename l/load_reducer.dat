30|$|Therefore, we have {{achieved}} the theory and the technology of the application of <b>load</b> <b>reducer.</b> At present, the <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> was an effective technology to reduce the load of deep well pumping. However, the problems are that when the pumping system pumped the high pour point oil, the sucker rod did not move downward because {{of the effect of}} paraffin wax. When the oil fluid contained sand, there would be a little sedimentary sand in the dead water zone locating at the discharge of <b>load</b> <b>reducer.</b> When more sedimentary sand appeared, that would lead to the death of the piston card.|$|E
30|$|The <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> for the {{sucker rod}} could {{decrease}} the suspension load {{and increase the}} pumping system efficiency, and could increase {{the depth of the}} pump by the same type beam pumping units. Guo (2014) proposed a design method of the sucker rod string with <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> in oil pumping system. Zhao et al. (2012) established the simulation model of the longitudinal vibration of the sucker rod string with a <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> according to the wave equation (Gibbls 1963) and the hydraulic feedback balance model (Guo 2014), and built the difference scheme method to achieve the numerical results.|$|E
30|$|Rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> is a {{downhole}} device {{installed at}} certain depth between the well {{head and the}} pump. With dual solid plungers, it can produce a hydraulic feedback force to reduce the polished rod load.

40|$|International audienceMapReduce is {{a design}} pattern for {{processing}} large datasets distributed on a cluster. Its performances {{are linked to}} the data structure and the runtime environment. Indeed, data skew can yield an unfair task allocation, but even when the initial allocation produced by the partition function is well balanced, an unfair allocation can occur during the reduce phase due to the heterogeneous performance of nodes. For these reasons, we propose an adaptive multi-agent system. In our approach, the reducer agents interact during the job and the task reallocation is based on negotiation in order to decrease the workload of the most <b>loaded</b> <b>reducer</b> and so the runtime. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two negotiation strategies. Finally, we experiment our multi-agent system with real-world datasets over heterogeneous runtime environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{direct-drive}} robotic manipulator (CMU DD Arm) {{is being}} developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. This paper describes the design concept and theory of this new mechanical arm based on the direct-drive method using rare-earth DC torque motors. Because these motors have high torque, light weight and compact size, we can construct robots with far better performance than those presently available. For example, we can eliminate all the transmission mechanisms between the motors and their <b>loads,</b> such as <b>reducers</b> and chain belts, and construct a simple mechanism (direct-drive) where the arm links are directly coupled to the motor rotors and stators. This elimination can lead to excellent performance: no backlash, low fraction, low inertia, low compliance and high reliability. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a fault {{detection}} and isolation model based for backlash phenomenon is presented. The {{aim of this}} contribution {{is to be able}} to detect then distinguish the undesirable backlash from the useful one inside an electromechanical test bench. The dynamic model of the real system is derived, using the bond graph approach, motivated by the multi-energy domain of such mechatronic system. The innovation interest of the use of the bond graph tool, resides in the exploitation of one language representation for modelling and monitoring the system with presence of mechanical faults. Fault indicators are deduced from the analytical model and used to detect and isolate undesirable backlash fault, including the physical system. Simulation and experimental tests are done on electromechanical test bench which consists of a DC motor carrying a mechanical <b>load,</b> through a <b>reducer</b> part containing a backlash phenomenon...|$|R
30|$|Rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> is {{a device}} {{installed}} on the sucker rod, so instead of changing the pump’s structure, it just creates an additional force to counteract {{a part of the}} polished rod load. Therefore, we just need to analyze the reduction force and then add it to the conventional polished rod load calculation model. In this case, the casing pressure is neglected.|$|E
30|$|When using a side-flow pump, the {{resistance}} on the plunger {{caused by the}} liquid pressure would increase. This resistance may cause the sucker rod to bend in downstroke.

40|$|For power, cost, and pricing reasons, datacenters are {{evolving}} towards heterogeneous hardware. However, MapReduce implementations, which power a representa-tive {{class of}} datacenter applications, were originally de-signed for homogeneous clusters and performed poorly on heterogeneous clusters. The natural solution, rebal-ancing <b>load</b> among the <b>reducers</b> running on heteroge-neous nodes has been explored in Tarazu, but {{shown to be}} only mildly effective. In this paper, we revisit the key design challenge in this important optimization for MapReduce on hetero-geneous clusters and make three contributions. (1) We show that Tarazu estimates the target load distribution too early into MapReduce job execution, which results in the rebalanced load far from the optimal. (2) We articu-late the delicate tradeoff between the estimation accuracy versus wasted work from delayed load adjustment, and propose a load rebalancing scheme that strikes {{a balance between the}} tradeoff. (3) We implement our design in the PIKACHU task scheduler, which outperforms Hadoop by up to 42 % and Tarazu by up to 23 %. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an optimal randomized MapReduce algorithm {{for the problem}} of triangle enumeration that requires $\BO{E^{ 3 / 2 }/(M\sqrt m) }$ rounds, where $m$ denotes the expected memory size of a reducer and $M$ the total available space.

40|$|We {{consider}} the enumeration of maximal bipartite cliques (bicliques) {{from a large}} graph, a task central to many practical data mining problems in social network analysis and bioinformatics. We present novel parallel algorithms for the MapReduce platform, and an experimental evaluation using Hadoop MapReduce. Our algorithm is based on clustering the input graph into smaller sized subgraphs, followed by processing different subgraphs in parallel. Our algorithm uses two ideas that enable it to scale to large graphs: (1) the redundancy in work between different subgraph explorations is minimized through a careful pruning of the search space, and (2) the <b>load</b> on different <b>reducers</b> is balanced {{through the use of}} an appropriate total order among the vertices. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm scales to large graphs with millions of edges and tens of mil- lions of maximal bicliques. To our knowledge, this is the first work on maximal biclique enumeration for graphs of this scale.

30|$|To {{improve the}} system {{efficiency}} and working performance of beam pumping units, many production engineers devoted to research many energy-saving technologies for the beam pumping units {{based on the}} gearbox torque curve, and some technologies had achieved very good effects. This paper will introduce some technologies such as phased pumping units, dual-horsehead pumping units, shock absorber device, <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> device, lower barbell pumping units, multi-balance device, flywheel-energy-storage device, and variable speed drive device. Meanwhile, we also discuss their merits, demerits and the future research direction.|$|E
30|$|Polished rod load of the {{pumping system}} was {{induced by the}} sucker rod that drives the pump to reciprocate. The {{polished}} rod load included sucker rod and fluid weight load, inertial load, vibration load, friction load and elastic force etc. Polished rod load reduction was a very effective method to improve the working performance of pumping system. Many researchers devoted to design a shock absorber to reduce the dynamic load of the sucker rod, to design a rod centralizer for reducing the friction load, or to design a <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> for reducing polished rod load.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of these techniques}} are different. Side-flow pump mainly reduces the liquid pressure load by changing {{the structure of the}} conventional pump. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump also reduces the liquid pressure load by decreasing the cross-sectional area of the plunger in the pump. Fiberglass sucker rod mainly reduces the sucker rod gravity load because of its low density. However, rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer,</b> which {{is very different from the}} above three techniques, does not change the previous load; instead, it can create an additional reduction force to counteract a part of the polished rod load.|$|E
30|$|In deep-rod pumping wells, {{polished}} rod load {{tends to}} be very high and even exceeds the operating range of the pumping unit. To tackle the problem, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed till now. They are side-flow pump, rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer,</b> fiberglass sucker rod and deep pumping with small-diameter pump. However, some of them still cause certain problems when put into use. That indicates the fundamental mechanisms of these techniques {{have not yet been}} fully studied. In this paper, on the basis of conventional polished rod load calculation models, the new calculation models for these techniques are respectively established. The rod load reduction effects are comparatively analyzed by calculation. The results indicate that the differences in mechanisms lead to different reduction effects. Side-flow pump and deep pumping with small-diameter pump can largely reduce the liquid pressure load, but its reduction effect for the polished rod load is very limited. On the contrary, fiberglass sucker rod can greatly reduce the polished rod load by decreasing the weight of the sucker rod. Rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> does not change the previous load; instead, it can create an additional reduction force. The potential disadvantages are also discussed. When using a side-flow pump, the resistance on the plunger caused by the liquid pressure would increase. This resistance may cause the sucker rod to bend when it is moving downwards. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump needs to use very small pump {{in order to get a}} relatively good reduction effect, so its application is limited. These disadvantages should be considered in practical application.|$|E
30|$|The beam {{pumping units}} applied in {{oilfield}} {{for more than}} 150  years, because it had the advantages of simple structure, reliable and durable. At present, it {{is still one of}} the most important artificial lift methods in the world. Due to the inherent structure of the beam pumping units, the balanced torque curve of gearbox has a bigger fluctuation ratio and negative torque that results low motor efficiency and load impact. Because the motor efficiency is directly proportional to the fluctuation ratio of gearbox torque, many researchers designed many types of energy-saving devices to improve the system efficiency. Therefore, based on the balance theory of gearbox torque, we introduced and discussed some significant energy-saving technologies, such as phased pumping units, dual-horsehead pumping units, shock absorber device, <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> device, lower barbell pumping units, multi-balance device, flywheel-energy-storage device, variable speed drive device. Meanwhile, we also pointed out the future research direction.|$|E
30|$|Every {{technique}} has its limitations and disadvantages which may cause certain problems when put into use. When a side-flow pump is applied, the resistance on the plunger {{caused by the}} liquid pressure would increase. This resistance may cause the sucker rod to bend in downstroke. This problem may be the reason why side-flow pump has not been widely used yet. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump needs to use a small pump {{in order to get}} a relatively good reduction effect; however, small pump is not suitable for high production wells. So its application is limited. In spite of various advantages for fiberglass–steel composite sucker rod such as low density, good corrosion resistance and good elasticity, limitations also exist for example low compression and bending resistance. It cannot be applied to high temperature, heavy oil and deviated wells. Rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> may increase the energy consumption of the pumping system according to Cen et al. (2015).|$|E
30|$|Sucker rod pumping is a {{traditional}} and widely used method of artificial lifting in the world’s oil industry. In recent years, on the one hand, as the natural energy has been depleted and working fluid level is going down, most of old oilfields in the late development stage need deep pumping techniques to increase oil production; on the other hand, deep reservoirs are gradually being developed. For example, the average reservoir depth in Tahe oilfield of Northwest China is more than 6000  m. With the complex geological conditions and bad fluid properties, the working fluid level is very low and rapidly dropping to the limit depth of conventional sucker rod pumping system. The limit depth mainly depends on the polished rod load which increases with the pump depth. However, high polished rod load is disadvantageous to the whole system and even tends to exceed the operating range of the pumping unit. At present, aiming at the problem about how to reduce the polished rod load in the deep sucker rod pumping wells, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed. They are side-flow pump, rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer,</b> fiberglass–steel sucker rod and deep pumping with small-diameter pump.|$|E
30|$|The {{reduction}} {{effects of}} these techniques also vary greatly. Side-flow pump can largely reduce the liquid pressure load by more than 50 %, but its reduction effect for the polished rod load is very limited. When a conventional pump is substituted by a side-flow pump, both maximum and minimum polished rod loads are decreased by around 4 %. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump only reduces the liquid pressure load in upstroke, so only maximum polished rod load is decreased. The reduction effect depends {{on the size of}} the pump used. When a D 56  mm pump is replaced by a D 38  mm pump, the maximum polished rod load is decreased by about 11 %. Fiberglass sucker rod can greatly reduce the polished rod load in whole stroke by around 50 %. The reduction effect depends on the proportion of fiberglass sucker rod in a composite rod string. Rod <b>load</b> <b>reducer</b> creates a constant reduction force, which is determined by its installed depth and the depth of the working fluid level. In our case, both maximum and minimum polished rod loads are decreased by around 20 %.|$|E
