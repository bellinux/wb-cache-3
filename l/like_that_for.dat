5|$|The film's {{release was}} {{previously}} set for December 5, but hoping {{to gain a}} competitive edge amid a crowded playing field, Focus Features shifted the release date to November 1, believing the new date was ideal to launch a platform release in the awards season, and expecting to do a wide release for 5-day Thanksgiving weekend (November 27 – December 1). Because the film was an awards contender, Focus set the date in November for an Oscars strategy <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> 2013 Oscar winner Argo, which was released in October 2012.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{commercial}} domino {{sets are}} usually made of synthetic materials, such as ABS or polystyrene plastics, or Bakelite and other phenolic resins; many sets approximate {{the look and}} feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of card stock <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> playing cards. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.|$|E

500|$|To {{raise money}} for Sport Relief Paige danced the tango on Sport Relief does Strictly Come Dancing with Matt Dawson in March 2008, where they were voted second overall. In 2008, she opened the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and {{performed}} concerts in China, America and Australia featuring songs from her 40-year career. To further celebrate 40 years since her first performance on a West End Stage, in October 2008 Paige released a picture-based autobiography titled Memories. The book took around eight months to compile; [...] "Since Evita I suppose, I had kept a yearbook. My parents always kept cuttings and things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me.

500|$|Jenna Fischer {{found her}} character's {{break-up}} scene with Roy [...] "really dark," [...] {{as she is}} friends with David Denman outside of the show. She explained, [...] "To see him turn <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> me {{it was even more}} shocking because I know him as a big teddy bear. He played it so well and I think that cliffhanger of 'I’m gonna kill Jim Halpert' {{is one of the best}} last lines of our episodes ever." [...] "Cocktails" [...] included recurring guest star Michael Patrick McGill as Kenny Anderson, who called working on The Office [...] "a blast." [...] Other guest stars included Dan Cole as Dan Gore, Owen Daniels as the Wallaces' son, and Jean Villepique as Rachel Wallace.|$|E
500|$|Commented {{longtime}} former Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox on Bagwell – {{who opposed}} {{him from the}} dugout for the entirety of his career, including numerous times in the playoffs: [...] "Jeff Bagwell was [...] {{for so long and}} starred every year. [...] For me a guy that dominated <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> one team, even in the league stats through the years. [...] His are up there with anybody's. [...] I would put him in right away. [...] So he would get my vote on the first ballot." [...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the climactic}} battle, 150 extras stood {{in for the}} Narnians, while 300 extras {{were used for the}} Telmarines. These were {{digitally}} duplicated until there were 1,000 Narnians and 5,000 Telmarines onscreen. The animators found it easier to create entirely digital centaurs and fauns, rather than mix digital legs with real actors. The dryads were entirely computer-generated, whereas in the first film digital petals had been composited over actors. However, Adamson had chosen to make the centaurs not wear armour, meaning the animators had to make the human–horse join behave more cohesively. Combining digital characters with actors, such as when Lucy hugs Aslan, had become easier since the first film, as lighting had improved. To achieve Lucy hugging Aslan, Framestore even replaced Georgie Henley's arm with a digital version. For the gryphons, a motion control rig was created for the actors to ride on. The rig could simulate subtle movements such as wing beats for realism. Adamson cited the river-god as the character he was most proud of. [...] "It was a really masterful effect: to control water like that is incredibly difficult", he said.
