40|$|Reading {{a target}} {{language}} dictionary definition in a printed dictionary is one common way of {{learning a new}} word in foreign language. Digital dictionaries enable a learner not only to read {{the definition of a}} word but also to listen to its pronunciation, although digital dictionaries provide no definitions recorded in spoken sounds as yet. The definitions of words in dictionaries, however, may be too difficult for many learners to understand in speech. To modify the definitions so that the learners could understand them with ease in a listening context, the authors conducted word association research, obtaining associated words from EFL learners that could be cues for other EFL learners to accurately approximate the meaning of a new word. We will explore the effect of these cues on the learners 2 ̆ 7 listening comprehension. Word-association cues vs. dictionary-based cues were presented to subjects in both listening and reading comprehension tests. The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between the mean scores of dictionary-based definitions and <b>learner-based</b> definitions in the reading test and that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of dictionary-based definitions and <b>learner-based</b> definitions in the listening test. It was concluded that word-association explanations described with words of cues obtained from student-based word association tasks resulted in better comprehension than dictionary-based definitions for EFL learners in listening tasks. ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} an experiment {{designed to enhance}} the viewing comprehension {{of a group of}} advanced level ESL learners by means of the prior activation of text-relevant schemata. The subject population, Belgian university students of business administration, were divided into three groups, two receiving an experimental treat ment geared to the activation of either formal or content schemata, and a control group which received no pre-viewing treatment. The target video sequence was an off-air recording on an economic topic. The formal treatment involved the presentation of the problem- solution model (Hoey, 1979) and a <b>learner-based</b> practice activity in the use of this model on a topic other than that of the target se quence. The content treatment involved provision of information on culturally-specific referential elements occurring in the target se quence and a <b>learner-based</b> activity on the general topic of the se quence, privatisation. Experimental effect was monitored by means of summary writing and a set of comprehension questions, the latter being given directly after viewing and again a week later to monitor for recall. Both pre-viewing groups showed significant levels of com prehension facilitation on all monitoring measures. Levels of im provement attained by the formal schemata group were higher than those of the content schemata group, although the difference was less marked on the recall than on the immediate measures. © 1991, Sage Publications.

40|$|Educational {{psychologists have}} {{researched}} the generality and specificity of metacognitive monitoring {{in the context}} of college-level multiple-choice tests, but fairly little is known as to how learners monitor their performance on more complex academic tasks. Even lesser is known about how monitoring proficiencies such as discrimination and bias might be related to key self-regulatory processes associated with task understanding. This quantitative study explores the relationship between monitoring proficiencies and task understanding in 39 adult learners tackling ill-structured writing tasks for a graduate “theories of e-learning” course. Using learner as unit of analysis, the generality of monitoring is confirmed through intra-measure correlation analyses while facets of its specificity stand out due to the absence of inter-measure correlations. Unsurprisingly, <b>learner-based</b> correlational and repeated measures analyses did not reveal how monitoring proficiencies and task understanding might be related. However, using essay as unit of analysis, ordinal and multinomial regressions reveal how monitoring influences different levels of task understanding.

40|$|The article {{describes}} two related experiments into {{the effect of}} pre‐reading on the text comprehension of a population of L 2 learners at three proficiency levels. Four sets of pre‐reading materials were used, two in each experiment. All were geared to content‐schemata activation, but differed {{in terms of the}} type of stimulus provided. The materials used in experiment I (a text summary and a set of pre‐questions) involved the provision of a relatively elaborated set of interpretive cues; those used in experiment II (topic prediction and a vocabulary‐based task) were more open and allowed for a greater degree of <b>learner‐based</b> schemata activation. Two main lines of investigation were pursued: the first relates to the relative effectiveness of the different pre‐reading formats, and the second to the possibility of an interaction between pre‐reading format and L 2 proficiency level. Results indicated the more constraining, schemata‐provision formats used in experiment I to be more effective as aids to text comprehension. No level‐treatment interaction was observed, though comprehension facilitation was observed only among the lower proficiency groups — the higher proficiency group deriving no benefit from any of the pre‐reading formats used.

40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years the term “languages for special {{purposes}} ” has gained a prominent place in language teaching. English for Specific Purpose (ESP) is generally used to refer to the teaching/learning of a foreign language for a clearly utilitarian purpose of which there is no doubt (Mackay 1978 : 2). This purpose is most of the times occupational, vocational, academic or professional. It should be noted that whenever a syllabus is designed for any ESP course, a “Need Analysis” is desirable. This aids the ESP course designer in getting {{a clear view of the}} language needs of the learner which in turn helps in defining the goals and objectives of the course. However, before conducting any needs analysis, it is appropriate to ascertain first of all, what exactly is the meaning of “needs ” and secondly, what kind of information can be gathered through a needs analysis? Until the 1970 s, language teachers and educators played a major part in determining language needs. After the 1970 s, however, learners were seen as active participants in the course designing process and their views, opinions and needs were also given due importance. There have been number of theorists who contributed to the classification of language needs along <b>learner-based</b> lines and played a major role in the development of learner-centred instruction (Richterich, 1983; Munby...|$|E
40|$|While most “World Religions” {{curricula}} {{are employed}} in a wider view to liberal arts education, rather as specifically theological or religious-centered, there are several approaches which {{can be made to}} form a more constructive learning working with the existing “textbooks” circulating (treated here in English) in a kind of metaphysical way in diverse cultures whose needs are more concrete. This paper addresses two key ways in which the popular “World religions” curriculum can be, to paraphrase Tomoko Masuzawa, “re-invented” as an integral aspect of <b>learner-based</b> pedagogy. First, by taking the disembodied “text” and analyzing its role, content, and purpose as a learning object by situating it in the world of internet, online education, the context of learning will be seen to require what might be called energetic “points of reception”. Those points of reception can, in this second case, be seen as an individual and contextual reworking of the “world religions”, not by denying the content of the textbooks, but by subjecting its view to the actual societies, schools, and nations which employ them. While much scholarship has recently examined “religion”, “world religions”, and their definitions, this paper works on two broad themes (reception and contextualizing knowledge) to imagine avenues of engaging with what Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor calls “social imaginaries” in which students discern their own sociological, philosophical, and political imaginations on global and local religious cultures...|$|E
40|$|The aim in {{this study}} was to develop a way of {{identifying}} resilient and non-resilient middle-adolescents in a formerly black-only urban residential (township) school, in order to ultimately support the development of learners' resilience under stressful circumstances. A Resilience Scale was developed to screen for resilient and non-resilient learners by means of self-evaluation. A Learning Behaviour Scale was developed to examine the ability of the teachers to reliably recognise learners' resilient and non-resilient academic and social behaviours. As a control, in-depth interviews were conducted, to evaluate the construct validity of results on the two scales qualitatively and to identify themes signifying resilience and non-resilience in the coping behaviour of middle-adolescents in a township school. The participants were 190 learners in Grade 8 and 9 who all completed the Resilience Scale, 12 learners {{selected on the basis of}} their Resilience Scale scores who were interviewed, and eight curricular teachers who completed the Learning Behaviour Scale in respect o f the 12 s elected learners. All the items of the Resilience Scale proved statistically reliable. However, the interview data profile differed from the Resilience Scale profile in the lower range, suggesting that the scale failed to reliably reflect non-resilience in the context of a formerly black-only urban school.

40|$|The Microcosm of {{teaching}} and learning within the macrocosm of technological change and the challenges of a globalised world, what assessment strategies to adopt? Teaching and learning with the aims to promote social justice, to emancipate the academic community, and to build resilience in the future generation demand constant knowledge of the factors affecting each society in particular its new generation. Equally pertinent is the assessment modalities to adopt that best suits the expectations and challenges awaiting the 21 st century learner. Assessment techniques should spawn enthusiasm rather than apprehension in a teacher as the reality of which is anchored in best teaching practices and understanding the demands of the globalised world. Peeking in a pedagogical stance within the globalised world, contemporary educational ethics should rest on developing students who share, cooperate and contribute responsibly to a global society. Indeed, such ethics encompass the way students are assessed that will ultimately impact on reflecting a society of responsible citizens. What type of assessment then? The inevitable inclusion of technology in our lives has skewed the learning rate, the teaching methodologies and the assessment methodologies in a way unthought-of few years ago. Technology enhances teaching and learning but the application of technology is made devoid of meaning if there is absence of democratic ethics within the learning microcosm. <b>Learner-based</b> assessment can promote the adaptation to an ever-changing environment endorsing appreciation of values and diverse cultures.

The pace and extent of the transformation have varied according to cultural values {{in various parts of}} the world and over time. From the east to the west, there have been significant differences. There have been varying interpretations of user behaviour and needs. Different approaches to the philosophical basis of librarianship have also affected the views of library space. Also of significance is the view of pedagogy taken in individual institutions and regions. <b>Learner-based</b> approaches, the increased availability of learning management systems tailored to individual use, the importance of group learning, and the growth of social networks have led to fundamental re-thinking of all spaces provided in libraries and learning institutions. The increasing use of mobile technology is causing further re-examination of space design.

40|$|AbstractAs {{a complex}} {{cognitive}} skill involving {{a variety of}} processes working in concert, {{the ability to read}} along with the reading comprehension process and the factors affecting the nature of this process are continually drawing the attention of L 2 researchers. The intricate nature of reading comprehension emerges evidently especially in foreign language settings, in which the readers endeavor to extract meaning from texts laden with textual and syntactic structures somewhat foreign to them. Reading comprehension in an L 2 is characterized by its dynamic nature since it is affected by a combination of text-related and reader oriented variables. The present study aimed to examine L 2 reading comprehension in relation to vocabulary knowledge, topic familiarity, perceived situational interest, sources of interest and strategic reading behaviors. The study was carried out at a major state university in Turkey in the fall term of 2015 - 2016 academic year. A total of 83 freshman students enrolled in the department of English Language Teaching participated in the research. Data were collected by means of a reading comprehension test, a vocabulary test, a topic familiarity scale, a perceived interest questionnaire, a sources of interest questionnaire, and a reading strategies inventory. The data gathered through these instruments were subjected to statistical analyses. Contrary to expectations, the study did not reveal any significant correlations between L 2 reading comprehension and any of the aforementioned text- and learner-related factors. The study concluded that participants⿿ limited lexical coverage might have built on the linguistic difficulty of the text and overridden the influence of other text- and <b>learner-based</b> determiners of reading comprehension. Reading comprehension especially in a foreign language is undoubtedly under the impact of different textual and learner oriented factors. However, the findings attained through this study could not provide any evidence for such an interaction and added on the inconclusive results of several previous studies...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{modelling}} {{of physical}} and biochemical processes {{has emerged as a}} means of evaluating medical devices, offering new insights that explain current performance, inform future designs and even enable personalized use. Yet resource limitations force one to compromise with reduced order computational models and idealized assumptions that yield either qualitative descriptions or approximate, quantitative solutions to problems of interest. Considering endovascular drug delivery as an exemplary scenario, we used a supervised machine learning framework to process data generated from low fidelity coarse meshes and predict high fidelity solutions on refined mesh configurations. We considered two models simulating drug delivery to the arterial wall: (i) two-dimensional drug-coated balloons and (ii) three-dimensional drug-eluting stents. Simulations were performed on computational mesh configurations of increasing density. Supervised learners based on Gaussian process modelling were constructed from combinations of coarse mesh setting solutions of drug concentrations and nearest neighbourhood distance information as inputs, and higher fidelity mesh solutions as outputs. These learners were then used as computationally inexpensive surrogates to extend predictions using low fidelity information to higher levels of mesh refinement. The cross-validated, supervised <b>learner-based</b> predictions improved fidelity as compared with computational simulations performed at coarse level meshes—a result consistent across all outputs and computational models considered. Supervised learning on coarse mesh solutions can augment traditional physics-based modelling of complex physiologic phenomena. By obtaining efficient solutions {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost, this framework has the potential to transform how modelling approaches can be applied in the evaluation of medical technologies and their real-time administration in an increasingly personalized fashion.

The teacher's role underpinning this process was that of a facilitator or a learning counsellor with whom the learners could discuss, negotiate and consult in order to achieve their learning goal. The data from the pilot study, the main study and the follow-up studies showed that the implementation had a positive effect on the learners' actual achievements and their attitudes to and motivation for learning English. The improvement of their attitudes to and motivation for learning the language were not statistically significantly higher, as the learners were constrained by the adjustment needed to take on board a new method of teaching and learning for the first time within a very limited period. However, there was a clear indication as measured by both quantitative and qualitative research instruments such as questionnaires, participant observation and interviews that they welcomed this innovation in the highly significant improvement of their attitudes toward self-directed learning as the result of the intervention. The learners became willing to take responsibility for their own learning during the course through their active involvement in the learning process. The transfer’ of responsibility of learning from the teacher to the learners themselves took place gradually and continued after the course. The learners continued to pursue their self-directed learning after the course by transferring the learning strategies and language skills acquired during the course into their real world of communication. Despite the nonsignificant result of the pre/post test, almost all of the learners as measured by the participant observation and the interviews perceived an improvement in their reading, through a sense of achievement in reading authentic English materials ranging from general health sciences to semi-technical and technical texts, and they also felt they had gained more confidence in reading English. More importantly, they enjoyed reading English for both pleasure and academic purposes, both during and after the course. Most of them had not found reading pleasurable prior to TEP 41 1 236. Implications and recommendations of the research study arise from the findings of the pilot study and the main study and they became evident through the teacher’s awareness of the possibilities of their practical application. The implementation of PA methods to enhance learner centredness in order to achieve the ultimate educational goal (i. e. learner empowerment for greater independence), requires a high degree of effort on the part of the teacher both in terms of his/her knowledge and in terms of his/her commitment to malting the teaching far more responsive to learners' needs. However, our outcome fully justifies such an endeavour...|$|E
40|$|Hazards are an {{integral}} part of people-environment relationships. The impact of hazards locally and globally has become increasinglymore severe. particularly in the previous two decades. This is largely as a result of unwise human intervention in natural systems. The study of hazards at secondary school level affords valuable opportunities for learning about people-environment issues. This in turn, can promote a greater awareness of environmental problems. One of the most important current aims of Geographical Education is the development of critical thinking skills in pupils. Such skills are vital for equipping pupils with the necessary tools to understand and participate in solving the world's increasing human and environmental problems. The development of a critical faculty in pupils is best achieved by the use of <b>learner-based</b> participatory teaching strategies where pupils are involved in problem solving activities. Research has shown that British and South African Geography curricula reflect current thinking in Geographical education and learning theory. The 1992 Junior Secondary Geography Syllabus in line with these trends. includes a section for study on hazards. Hazards are presented primarily as case studies in modern Geographical texts. which is seen as one of the most effective ways of teaching hazards. Research however suggests that South African textbooks have certain shortcomings. notwithstanding the importance placed on textbooks by teachers in this country. This study investigated the extent to which case study teaching materials on hazards are optimising opportunities available for effective learning within an Environmental Paradigm. An evaluation methodology, which is believed to have value for use by other researchers, was developed to suit the specific requirements of the study. The study findings reveal a poor realisation of the current aims of Geographical Education and learning theory, regarding the South African teaching materials. Recommendations are made improvements in the development and use of local case teaching materials. Guidelines for the development of for study local materials are provided from case studies in British texts and from methods developed by the researcher. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{profession}} of agricultural and extension education {{has increased in}} complexity {{in response to the}} demands of the changing field of agriculture and the need for educators who are responsive to those demands. A standardization of the knowledge base of the profession is seen as necessary in light of geographic mobility, the nationwide emphasis on assessment, and the need for a public relations tool that clearly articulates the concepts forming the framework of agricultural and extension education. In this study a panel of experts consisting of agricultural and extension education leaders nationwide, responded to open-ended and Likert-type surveys online as part of a Delphi technique to establish the knowledge base for agricultural and extension education. Three rounds of the Delphi technique were used. A minimum of 13 of the 24 panel members were required to respond to each round. Ninety-five statements were initially generated by 16 panel members in response to an open-ended statement in Round I which asked the participants ??What are the articulated understandings, skills, and judgments that serve as the foundation of knowledge (??the body??) for professionals in agricultural and extension education??? These statements were presented to the panel members in Round II. Two-thirds of the panelists had to ??Strongly Agree?? or ??Agree?? with each item for it to be retained for Round III. Based on the responses of 14 panelists in Round II, 67 items were retained for Round III, and one item was added based on panel input. After Round III, three items were eliminated due to lack of twothirds achievement of ??Strongly Agree?? and ??Agree?? ratings by 17 respondents. Thus, 65 statements established the knowledge base of agricultural and extension education in this study. Among the knowledge base are concepts related to traits of effective educators; management issues; environmental impacts on instruction; curriculum development; <b>learner-based</b> contextual, applied pedagogical strategies; leadership development; communications; assessment strategies; community and collegial connections; integration of technology; critical thinking and problem solving; and teaching as a changing process grounded in sound theory...|$|E
40|$|Both the {{inadequate}} {{number of}} supervisors {{and the demands}} on supervisors presented by the latest <b>learner-based</b> conceptions {{both in and out}} of educational contexts have directed many to doubt about the quality of the supervision, actual time spent for the professional development of teachers and collaboration for better teaching and better learning. This research study attempts to explore the impact of the reflective coaching model developed by the researcher based on the principles of reflective teaching on the actual teaching performance of the would-be teachers. As the research design, one-shot case study design with one-group post-test only model was used. 30 student teachers from the primary school teaching department of a Faculty of Education at a university in Turkey were included. Student teachers were trained through a 15 -h orientation on reflective coaching program developed by the researcher on how to be a reflective coach and give formative feedback before the 10 -week research study. Participants were split into five reflective learning groups, each with six students. Every group was required to conduct a lesson led by a teaching representative. The researcher acted as a teacher trainer and coached them during the preparation of the lesson. Each lesson was videotaped for reflective conference sessions. Later participants were instructed to fill out a questionnaire with 26 open-ended questions including their opinions and ideas on the reflective approach (instrument 1). As the second instrument, evaluation checklists prepared by the researcher to assess their teaching were employed. Data were collected in both quantitive and qualitative methods including: (a) conducting and evaluating a sample lesson based on the principles of reflective teaching, (b) discussing based on videotaped lessons during reflective conference sessions, (c) expressing results with statistical data obtained from the pre/post-test application and, (d) employing open-ended surveys and sample dialogues, interviews, and anecdotal data. Findings showed significant differences in favor of the reflective coaching program implemented. The would-be teachers developed in their skills targeted after the reflective coaching program as compared with their performance before the implementation of the program. The findings also revealed that majority of respondents were satisfied with their progress. They stated that this model helped them identify their weaknesses in their teaching. Findings gained offer essential principles on how reflective coaching can be a implemented both in school-based contexts and teacher education...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three studies}} designed to elucidate {{the phenomenon of}} hunger and food insecurity among older adults of Mexican heritage in Texas-Mexico border colonias. First, a comprehensive background {{of the problem is}} provided to include theoretical frameworks and delineations of the significance of this research. Second, a review of extant literature will be presented to include (a) definitions of hunger and food insecurity, (b) discussions on measurement of hunger and food insecurity, (c) nutritional and non-nutritional factors affecting food security, (d) nutrition curricula and food insecurity, and (e) limitations of current research and practice. Senior focus groups illuminated the importance of centering interventions on the premises of coping strategies, resource management, and social capital. Many of the senior participants lacked adequate household resources, resource management skills, and coping strategies, and were disconnected from social networks that are evident in reducing barriers to food insecurity. These results spurred {{the development and implementation of}} our senior hunger curriculum, No M?s Hambre [No More Hunger], which introduced novel methods of providing nutrition education and skill building in effort to reduce the risk of hunger and food insecurity through resource maximization. By way of extensive formative and process evaluations, the senior hunger curriculum emerged as a complex framework of promotora-led lessons and discussions, <b>learner-based</b> tactile activities, and culturally-sensitive resources and lesson materials?all delivered within the home of each participant. To test the feasibility and acceptability of the No M?s Hambre curriculum, we engaged the promotoras and participants in process discussions and in-depth interviews. This feasibility and acceptability study is the first of its kind in that we examined perspectives and experiences of MH seniors who endure acute hunger and food insecurity through the use of a home-based nutrition education curriculum. Though we did not assess empirical outcomes, we determined through interpretive analysis that secondary outcomes (i. e., self-reported impacts), such as social bonding, learned knowledge and skills, and improved health beliefs and behaviors, were valued and the lessons were enjoyable and indispensable to all participants. This study represents the first of its kind to address hunger and food insecurity among seniors of Mexican heritage within a setting that has been under-utilized and under-studied. With an innovative, holistic, home-based approach, we addressed the burden of hunger and food insecurity within this population and created a sustainable solution to a global human rights issue...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the role of}} learner autonomy (LA) in language teaching and learning. Over the last twenty years, researchers have extensively explored LA in a range of settings and have developed various approaches to fostering it both as a means to language learning and as an end in itself. This study attempts to investigate LA in the Vietnamese EFL context, and to explore the relationship between LA and language learning results. In this study, LA was conceptualised and operationally defined as learner self-initiation and learner self-regulation. The research was composed of three phases. The pilot study looked at the range of activities, and the amount of time devoted to learning English by 388 Vietnamese English majors of different levels of academic achievement. It identified differences in LA among students of different year levels as well as LA at two types of tertiary institutions in Vietnam. In the first phase, an exploratory correlational study was conducted among 177 students to comprehend features of LA as demonstrated by these students, their preferred self-initiated activities {{both inside and outside the}} classroom, and the relationship between each aspect of LA and language proficiency. In the second phase, an intervention study was conducted with the participation of 37 students in an experimental group, and 54 students in two control groups. Phase two explored the efficacy of a <b>learner-based</b> approach to promoting LA with a focus on strategy-based instruction. The three phases revealed several important findings. The pilot study discovered that the level of autonomy was related to students' level of academic achievement but not to their year level. In addition, autonomy seemed to be affected by the social setting in which it was exercised. In Phase one, the findings revealed that Vietnamese learners' self-initiation efforts mainly concentrated on covert learning in class. Outside the classroom, these learners preferred to undertake receptive rather than productive activities, and tended to avoid social interaction. Moreover, most aspects of LA positively and significantly correlated with EFL proficiency measures. Lastly, the task-specific training of self-regulation in Phase two resulted not only in significantly improved writing scores but also in greater LA. However, these metacognitive skills in writing did not seem to transfer to other areas of language learning, although improvements in writing were maintained in a delayed test. Overall, the study suggests that LA appears to be linked positively to language proficiency. High achievers are more likely to be autonomous learners. Most importantly, training learners in metacognitive regulation improved learners' writing ability and their autonomy in learning...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{information}} accessibility-on-demand {{provided by}} the internet, education modes are changing from a teacher-led approach focused on content delivery and assessible outcomes, to a <b>learner-based</b> approach encouraging self-directed, peer-tutored, and cooperative learning. New pedagogies are required to extend learning beyond the classroom and traditional subject areas such as contemporary arts, in alignment with the cross disciplinary priorities of the Australian Curriculum {{and values of the}} International Baccalaureate Organisation. This research explores how partnerships with universities and cultural organisations are implicated in the generation of these new forms of pedagogy and contribute to the field of educational research within the context of Education Queensland’s Framework For Gifted Education. In particular, this paper explores a new pedagogical framework for highly capable year five to nine Queensland state school students at the intersection of arts, design and the sciences, which has arisen from an explicit secondary/ tertiary partnership between the Queensland University of Technology Creative Industries Faculty and Precincts and the Queensland Academies Young Scholars Program. The Young Scholars Program offers experiences in the International Baccalaureate and Australian Curriculum contexts to enhance outcomes via global understanding, unique industry partnerships and 21 st century pedagogical innovation based not on 'content' but tacit/experiential learning concepts including immersive, creative, intellectual and social strategies. These strategies for highly capable students are centred around authentic opportunities, primary resources, transdisciplinary learning and relationships with likeminded peers including tertiary arts, design and STEM educators and students, professionals and researchers. The presentation details case studies which are hands-on real time workshops involving inquiry based challenges in the arts, design and sciences, mathematics, history, creative writing and other disciplines, with content drawn from collections from public institutions, academic research and tertiary pedagogy. Both programs implicate student collaboration and creative production as methodology/data capture for ongoing action research, in alignment with the Framework For Gifted Education’s emphasis on evidence-based practices. They also challenge gifted students “to continue their development through curricular activities that require depth of study, complexity of thinking, fast pace of learning, high-level skills development and/or creative and critical thinking (e. g. through independent investigations, tiered tasks, diverse real-world applications, mentors) ”(Education Queensland, 2011 : 3). This presentation highlights the strengths of the ongoing collaboration between QUT Creative industries Faculty and Queensland Academies, which not only provides successful extra curricular activities for gifted students towards a place in the International Baccalaureate Program, but also provides mentoring opportunities for tertiary students in their field of endeavor to assist with their own learning, and unique research opportunities for the Faculty as it focuses on excellence in arts, design and creative education and research.
