40|$|Language and {{lifestyle}} changes experienced following {{the onset of}} aphasia extend beyond the individual to impact family members of persons with aphasia. Research exploring the meaning of <b>living</b> successfully <b>with</b> aphasia has explored the perspectives of individuals with aphasia and speech-language pathologists. Family members 2 ̆ 7 views of <b>living</b> successfully <b>with</b> aphasia may also contribute valuable insights into positive adaptive processes and factors that may influence clinical interventions and community-based services for individuals with aphasia and their families. Purpose: To explore, {{from the perspectives of}} family members of individuals with aphasia, the meaning of <b>living</b> successfully <b>with</b> aphasia. Method: Twenty-four family members (nominated by individuals with aphasia) participated in semistructured in-depth interviews about <b>living</b> successfully <b>with</b> aphasia. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify themes relating to the meaning of <b>living</b> successfully <b>with</b> aphasia. Results: Seven themes were identified from analysis of family member participant transcripts: getting involved in life, support for the person with aphasia, communication, family members 2 ̆ 7 own needs, putting life in perspective, focusing on and celebrating strengths and improvements, and experiences with services. Conclusion: Findings provide evidence to support previous research indicating that aphasia affects the whole family and not just an individual. The inclusion of family members as part of the rehabilitation team is indicated. Family members 2 ̆ 7 needs and priorities must be considered in conceptualizing <b>living</b> successfully <b>with</b> aphasia to ensure family members are included in intervention programs...|$|R
