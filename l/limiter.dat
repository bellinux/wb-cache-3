5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight <b>limiter</b> was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

For scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, new <b>limiters</b> for both upwind and centred numerical flux functions are proposed and compared with existing <b>limiters.</b> These <b>limiters</b> are also com-pared {{in the case of the}} computation of the two-dimensional inviscid flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil with particular attention to the issues of iterative convergence to steady state and monotonicity preser-vation of the computed solution.

Aftermarket ECUs have been developed to bypass the speed <b>limiter,</b> in addition to stand-alone speed-limiter defeaters. The GPS check will not be implemented in American models.|$|E

25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor.

25|$|The {{publicity}} surrounding automobile journey {{brought her}} to the attention of Jerome Fanciulli and Glenn Curtiss who agreed to provide her with flying lessons in Hammondsport, New York. She was the only woman to receive instruction directly from Curtiss. He fitted a <b>limiter</b> on the throttle of Scott's airplane to prevent it gaining enough speed to become airborne while she practiced taxiing on her own. On September 6 either the <b>limiter</b> moved or a gust of wind lifted the biplane and she flew to an altitude of forty feet before executing a gentle landing. Her flight was short and possibly unintentional but Scott is credited by the Early Birds of Aviation as the first woman to pilot and solo in an airplane in the United States, although Bessica Medlar Raiche's flight on September 16 was accredited as first by the Aeronautical Society of America at the time.|$|E

25|$|As an {{inrush current}} <b>limiter</b> device in power supply circuits, they present a higher {{resistance}} initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation.

50|$|In the article, Mike Russel, a {{spokesman}} for American Trucking Associations (ATA), is quoted saying that the ATA supports a national speed limit of 65 mph for all vehicles. Russell goes on to state that forcing trucks to drive slower than other traffic increases the accident rate. In 1991, speed <b>limiters</b> were considered and rejected by Congress. Despite claims that speed <b>limiters</b> would increase accident rates, Road Safe America petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to require manufacturers to install speed <b>limiters</b> on all trucks over 26000 lb GVW, to limit their speeds to 68 mph.|$|R

25|$|Any {{aircraft}} rudder {{is subject}} to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation. In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of rudder control or even destruction of the rudder, as on American Airlines Flight 587 (the same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, {{but it is more}} important for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins). Maximum rudder deflection is controlled by rudder travel <b>limiter.</b> The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its blowdown limit; it is achieved when the force from the air or blowdown equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{technique}} of (CH 4) -C- 13 tracer injection through test <b>limiters</b> {{was applied to}} study the influence of surface roughness and substrate material on the local C- 13 deposition. Spherically shaped graphite <b>limiters</b> with integrated gas injection were prepared with two different grades of surface roughness, similar to 0. 1 and similar to 1 mu m. In addition, tungsten <b>limiters</b> with a roughness of similar to 0. 1 mu m were used to study the substrate material effect.

The C- 13 deposition efficiency-the ratio of the locally deposited to the injected amount of C- 13 -and the deposition pattern were evaluated by post-mortem surface analysis. Surface roughness has a pronounced effect and increases the C- 13 deposition efficiency on graphite with rougher surface by a factor of 3 - 5 compared with smoother graphite. On tungsten a factor of 2 - 4 less carbon is deposited than on graphite with similar surface roughness. A systematically higher amount of C- 13 (by a factor 1. 5 - 2. 5) was deposited on <b>limiters</b> exposed to Ohmic compared with neutral beam heated plasmas...|$|R
