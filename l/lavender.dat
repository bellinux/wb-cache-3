5|$|Lavender's primary pitch was the spitball, and {{his method}} of {{preparation}} was to lick the ball. In a game on July19, <b>Lavender</b> was about to load the ball when he smelled a liniment on the ball. He reported this to the home plate umpire, who then ejected the Phillies manager, Red Dooin, from the game. Dooin had been caught doing this to another spitballer, Marty O'Toole, a few days earlier. On September26, <b>Lavender</b> and the Cubs were ahead 9–0in {{the top half of}} the ninth inning versus Cincinnati, when the Reds scored 10runs against <b>Lavender</b> and two other pitchers to take the lead 10–9. The Cubs ultimately prevailed and gained the victory by scoring two runs in the bottom half of the ninth. <b>Lavender</b> started just one more game in 1912, a 3–2victory on October5 against St. Louis. Following the season, the Cubs played a series of exhibition games with the Chicago White Sox of the American League called the City Series. <b>Lavender</b> started the first game against Ed Walsh, and the game ended after nine innings with a scoreless tie. <b>Lavender</b> gave six hits and Walsh just one. After the two teams played to a 12-inning tie two days later, <b>Lavender</b> pitched the Cubs to victory in game three. Two additional victories gave the Cubs a 3–0series lead, but the White Sox were able to win four straight games, twice defeating <b>Lavender,</b> including in the series finale. He completed his rookie season with his career-high 16victories, against 13losses, and a 3.04earned run average(ERA) in 251innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} on September1, 1911 that <b>Lavender</b> {{was drafted by}} the Chicago Cubs in the Major League Baseball(MLB) draft. Charles Murphy, the Cubs' owner, drafted him with intent of then trading him to a Montreal minor league team as compensation for an earlier trade that brought Ward Miller to the Cubs. The Providence team owner, Frank Navin (who also owned the Detroit Tigers of the American League(AL)), appealed the transaction to the National Commission, forerunner to the modern-day Commissioner of Baseball. The commission ruled that Murphy had to either keep <b>Lavender</b> for one year, or return him to Providence. Murphy chose to keep <b>Lavender,</b> and his contract was approved on February9, 1912 by NL president Thomas Lynch.|$|E

5|$|As Harry learns {{more about}} his great enemy, the love lives of the main {{characters}} start to become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her. Harry's attempts to repair things between the two fail, resulting in Ron going out with <b>Lavender</b> Brown and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and <b>Lavender</b> break up when <b>Lavender</b> sees {{the two of them}} walking out of the boys dormitories together. However, this was only because she hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Philadelphia {{planned to}} trade or sell <b>Lavender,</b> {{even though he}} had earlier {{announced}} his retirement from the game. Philadelphia's asking price for his rights was $1,000, but they received no offers. Christy Mathewson, manager of the Reds, was reported to have had interest in <b>Lavender,</b> the pitcher's success against the Giants still fresh in Mathewson's mind. Though Philadelphia had a meeting with Cincinnati, Mathewson was unable to attend, and no trade discussions materialized. The San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League expressed interest in <b>Lavender,</b> but he stressed that he was retired and that he would only consider a trade to Atlanta of the Southern Association so that he could be near his farm in Montezuma. In 1922, it was reported that he signed with Atlanta after playing well for an independent team in Dawson, Georgia.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lavender</b> {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. <b>Lavender</b> refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase <b>Lavender.</b> Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lavender</b> {{got off to}} {{quick start}} in 1915, {{pitching}} a complete game victory against St. Louis on April16. He then missed time due to suffering a broken rib attempting {{to climb out of}} a bathtub. His next appearance was not until May7, when he pitched two innings in relief. He regained his starting role on May21, hurling his second complete game victory of the season, this time against Boston. In the first game of a doubleheader on August31, <b>Lavender</b> threw a no-hitter against the New York Giants, a 2–0victory. He struck out eight batters and walked just one. At the conclusion of the season, the Cubs played the Chicago White Sox of the American League in an exhibition series. <b>Lavender</b> pitched a shutout in game two, but the White Sox were declared victors after winning four games to the Cubs' one. His totals for the 1915season included 41games pitched, a 10–16win–loss record, a career-low 2.58ERA, and a career-high 117strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|On December19, 1916, it was {{reported}} that during the NL meetings, Chicago had traded Lavender's rights to the Phillies for pitcher Al Demaree. However, it was not official until April2, 1917, with Chicago sending an additional $5,000 to complete the deal. In March, <b>Lavender</b> signed with Philadelphia. He made his Philadelphia debut on April27, pitching a complete game victory against the Giants, allowing five hits and one run. <b>Lavender</b> faced his former club, the Cubs, {{for the first time on}} May19, and pitched the last three innings for the victory. At this point in the season, he was pitching well, his ERA was 1.57 and he had a 2–1win–loss record.|$|E

5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea <b>lavender,</b> with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea <b>lavender</b> are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E

5|$|To {{begin the}} 1913season, <b>Lavender</b> was the team's opening day {{starting}} pitcher in a 5–3 loss to St. Louis on April 12. After his successful rookie season, he was largely ineffective {{in the first}} half of 1913season; so much so that manager Johnny Evers was contemplating putting <b>Lavender</b> on waivers if he had not regained his form from the previous season. <b>Lavender</b> showed signs of improvement, surrendering just three hits in a 12–2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on June30, followed by a 5–1win over the Reds on July3. This rebound was short-lived, however; Chicago lost his next four starts before a 6–5win over the Boston Braves on July27. He pitched in 40 games, half of which were in relief, and had a 10–14 win–loss record. His ERA increased to 3.66, and he led the NL in hit batsmen with 13.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust.

Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the <b>lavender</b> hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of <b>Lavender</b> and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E
