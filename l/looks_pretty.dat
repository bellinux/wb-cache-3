500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{is seen as}} a {{transitional}} stage for several characters in the series. The transformation of Rick Grimes to a dark character continues in the episode. He has changed from the person who wanted to save Merle Dixon (in Season 1) and find Sophia Peletier (first half of season 2), to the person who is willing to abandon any hope of finding Andrea. Furthermore, Rick yells at his group for being unappreciative of his sacrifices as a leader. This backlash and hostility has been interpreted as a foreshadowing event for future development for The Walking Dead. [...] "Rick is clearly in a much darker place now than he was {{at the start of the}} season," [...] concluded Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich. In a similar fashion, Lori Grimes is furious at Rick after he admits that he killed Shane Walsh. According to Kirkman, [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> clear that he has lost [...] by doing this" [...] at the end of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire." [...] In response to the interactions between Rick and Lori, he opined: [...] "I think he feels that he has sacrificed for this group, and that sacrifice hasn’t really been appreciated. His confession to Lori did not get the reaction that he had hoped. He thought she would be supportive. Instead, she reacts in a particular way that he feels is hatred and disgust. I think that’s really affecting him. Let's not forget: This is taking place hours after he murdered his best friend. So he is still reeling. He’s trying to keep that a secret. He opens his heart to his wife, and it doesn’t go well. So I think that he’s just done with these people. I think he doesn’t want to be the leader. As he says: If they don’t like it, they’re free to leave." ...|$|E

It was pretty well received but the prospect of having to make it ruined the preceding weeks and it was necessary to resort to considerable amounts of alcohol to quiet my nerves for the occasion. … My nervousness, moroseness and vacillation get worse as time goes on, and the frequent resort to drinking doesn't bring about any permanent improvement. 1932 <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> black to me just now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} his {{contract}} issues with Liverpool, Gerrard {{told the press}} after the final, [...] "How can I leave after a night like this?" [...] but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard's agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, [...] "Now {{we have to move}} on. We have done our best, but he has made it clear he wants to go and I think it <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> final." [...] The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one premier league medal than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.|$|E

2500|$|But younger architects in the 1930s {{criticized the}} style {{and size of the}} {{buildings}} at Federal Triangle for being [...] "elitist, pretentious, and anachronistic". Architecture critic William Harlan Hale strongly criticized the Neoclassical style for being unimaginative and anti-democratic: [...] "New Deal indeed! What was there new, or modern, or imaginative, or efficient, or economical in trying to give modern Washington the character of Imperial Rome? What was there either aesthetic or intelligent in cloaking the offices of a modern democracy as the temple of a classic tyrant, the gallery of a Renaissance prince, or the palace of a French monarch? ...we have learned quite a lot about the principles of modern architecture, just as we have learned a lot about some other things; and today, after so short a time, it <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> much like a relic out of the dim past." [...] By the 1940s, some critics said the buildings were too reminiscent of Nazi and Soviet architecture.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo.

I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last time we saw him. He <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> well put together. You know, he’s not talking to himself. I would say that, just laying eyes on him, it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 November 2015, Vote Leave {{called on}} the British Polling Council to {{investigate}} [...] "serious violations" [...] of the Council's rules by polling organisation YouGov in a survey conducted in 2013 for the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The poll appeared to show that 8 out of 10 businesses backed Britain's continued membership of the EU. Vote Leave claimed that the poll was [...] "wholly unrepresentative" [...] of Britain's businesses due to skewed sampling in the poll and alleged that the research had [...] "caused the public to be misled about the views of British businesses on the EU for nearly two years." [...] The British Polling Council's formal response concluded that YouGov had [...] "not provided an adequate explanation of the sampling procedures {{that had been used}} to conduct the survey" [...] at the time of publishing the survey, whilst a leaked email sent in response to the initial complaint by Nick Moon, secretary of the British Polling Council, stated: “Survey <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> dodgy but luckily we don’t need to rule on that. But my initial thought is that YouGov did not give as much info as they should have.” Vote Leave described the CBI as the [...] "Voice of Brussels" [...] and also published research allegedly showing that the CBI had received over £1million in funding from the EU over the previous six years.|$|E
