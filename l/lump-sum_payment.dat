5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose {{a danger to the}} young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half their pay when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payment</b> if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E
25|$|The United States and Germany {{signed an}} {{agreement}} on September 19, 1995, providing for reparations for certain U.S.-citizen survivors of the Holocaust, with compensation to be paid in two stages. The first stage provided for compensation for Hugo Princz and {{a small group of}} other known concentration camp survivors, through a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payment</b> to the United States of 3 million Deutsche Mark (about $2.1 million). The second stage was to provide for compensation for additional, similarly-situated claimants. Legislation passed in early 1996 authorized the Commission to receive and adjudicate cases of additional claimants, a process which it completed in March 1998. Following further negotiations, the German Government paid to the United States in June 1999 an additional lump sum of 34.5 million Deutsche Mark (about $18 million) in final settlement of any and all claims of United States citizens against Germany for Nazi persecution in concentration camps, {{whether or not they were}} adjudicated by the Commission. In the ensuing months, the Department of the Treasury completed the process of distributing the settlement fund to the claimants previously found eligible for awards.|$|E

This charter have veterans the option to select a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payment,</b> an annual installment over {{the number of years}} of a Veteran's choosing, or a combination of these two payment options. Under Harper, the Canadian government spent $700, 000 fighting a class-action lawsuit brought by a group of wounded Afghan veterans who argued that the new Charter was discriminatory.

[...] The Peruvian woman served as the nanny for Baird's son and the Peruvian man as a part-time driver. Furthermore, Baird had not paid Social Security taxes for the couple, until making a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payment</b> earlier in January 1993. Baird had brought forward this information willingly to transition officials and authorities performing background checks; {{she said that she}} had thought that {{the fact that they were}} sponsoring the couple for citizenship made the hiring acceptable, and that they could not pay the taxes for people who were not yet in the country legally. [...] (Baird's immigration lawyer would dispute some aspects of exactly when the sponsorship request took place.) ...|$|E
500|$|The queen was deposed on January 17, and the {{provisional}} government established under pro-annexation leader Sanford B. Dole was officially recognized by Stevens as {{the de facto}} government. She temporarily relinquished her throne to the United States, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would restore Hawaii's sovereignty to the rightful holder. The government under Dole began using ʻIolani Palace as its executive building. A delegation departed for Washington D.C. on January 19, to ask for immediate annexation by the United States. At the request of {{the provisional}} government, Stevens proclaimed Hawaii a protectorate of the United States on February 1, to temporarily provide a buffer against domestic upheaval and interference by foreign governments. The US flag was raised over the palace, and martial law was enforced. The annexation treaty presented to the US Senate contained a provision to grant Liliʻuokalani a $20,000 per annum lifetime pension, and Kaʻiulani a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payment</b> of $150,000. The queen protested the proposed annexation in a January 19 letter to President Benjamin Harrison. She sent Prince David Kawānanakoa and Paul Neumann to represent her.|$|E

[...] After selling the property, Buzzard moved to Chelan where he lived {{until his death in}} 1919. When Buzzard died, Buckner was only one payment short of completing the agreement so he used the final $50 payment to purchase a headstone for Buzzard, who was buried in the Old Fraternal Cemetery in Chelan.|$|E

The High Court ruled that Mui was of sound mind when she signed the will, and that she simply did not trust her mother with money.|$|E
2500|$|Percival Lowell died in 1916. He named Harcourt Amory (his cousin, college roommate {{and best}} friend) and his wife, Constance Lowell, executors of his estate. Although Constance Lowell {{received}} a $150,000 <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payment,</b> a generous yearly income, and her husband's personal property (including their opulent Boston home), the Lowell Observatory received {{the bulk of}} Lowell's money. [...] Amory, meanwhile, was also named the sole trustee of the Lowell Observatory. Constance Lowell felt the will was unfair and went to court to break it. [...] After convincing Amory to resign as trustee, Constance Lowell also induced George Putnam (Roger's older brother) to decline the position. Constance Lowell then named Guy Lowell, Percival Lowell's third cousin, as trustee—believing she could dominate him. But Guy Lowell fought Constance's attempt to break the will. The lawsuit was settled in Guy Lowell's favor in 1925, but not before the estate had spent {{more than half its}} $2.3 million trust fund.|$|E

2500|$|After the event, the Israeli Defense Ministry {{ruled that}} the four Arab {{citizens}} shot dead were not victims of terror because their killer {{was not part of}} a terrorist organization, and are thus not entitled to the usual compensation for life lost due to terror attacks. According to Mayan Malkin, a spokeswoman with the Israeli Defense Ministry, an attacker must {{be a member of the}} [...] "enemy forces" [...] against Israel to be considered a terrorist under the law. Instead, they received payment [...] "beyond the letter of the law," [...] as a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payment,</b> as opposed to the lifelong monthly annuity given to the families of terror victims. Representatives of the Arab community in Israel condemned the decision, with Mohammed Barakeh, an Arab member of the Israeli parliament, saying that the [...] "…decision raises a strong scent of racism, which distinguishes between a Jewish terrorist and an Arab terrorist." [...] On 19 July 2006, the Israeli government changed the [...] "Compensation Law for Victims of Hostile Acts" [...] to include anyone victimized by violence stemming from the Israeli-Arab conflict. As a result of this change, the victims and families of Natan-Zada became eligible for terror compensation.|$|E

40|$|We use {{information}} on monthly wage increases set by collective agreements in Italy and exploit their variation across sectors {{and over time}} in order to examine how household consumption responds to different types of positive income shocks (regular tranches versus <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payments).</b> Focusing on single-earner households, we find evidence of consumption smoothing in accordance with the Permanent-Income Hypothesis, since total and food consumption do not exhibit excess sensitivity to anticipated regular payments. Consumption does not respond at the date of the announcement of income increases either, as these are known to compensate workers for the overall loss in their wages' purchasing power. However, consumption responds, albeit a little, to transitory and less anticipated one-off payments, as the expenditures on clothing & shoes increase upon the receipt of the <b>lump-sum</b> <b>payments.</b> This behaviour is consistent with bounded rationality as consumers do not consider the lump-sum as part of the overall wage inflation adjustment...|$|R
