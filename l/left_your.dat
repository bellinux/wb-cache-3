500|$|At the First Battle of Bull Run, Alexander {{made history}} {{by being the}} first to use signal flags to {{transmit}} a message during combat over a long distance. [...] Stationed atop [...] "Signal Hill" [...] in Manassas, Alexander saw Union troop movements and signaled to the brigade under Col. Nathan [...] "Shanks" [...] Evans, [...] "Look out for your <b>left,</b> <b>your</b> position is turned". Upon receiving a similar message, Beauregard and Gen. Joseph E. Johnston sent timely reinforcements that turned the tide of battle in the Confederates' favor.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} five songs, The Revival {{features}} songs at a calmer tempo and more conventional style, with ballads that are more relaxed and low-key. [...] "It Never Rains (In Southern California)" [...] was titled after an oft-repeated phrase from one of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s attorneys, who used it {{in response to the}} group wearing heavy coats after returning from visits on the East Coast. Group drummer Timothy Christian played most of the song's instruments, and bassist Raphael Wiggins wrote its lyrics about a man longing for a woman who was in southern California. The ballads are followed by [...] "Those Were the Days", which features jouncing banjo, trumpet, and wistful lyrics reminiscing about simpler times [...] "when a dollar was worth a dollar, and you didn't have to carry a gun when you <b>left</b> <b>your</b> house." ...|$|E
500|$|A pop ballad, [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] was {{compared}} to the works of Johnny Mathis by Lenny Kaye of Rolling Stone and the editors at Playboy. Additionally, Lawrence Gabriel, author of MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide, described the track as a [...] "classic" [...] pop song. It is written in the key of D minor with Wonder's vocals ranging from C4 to A5; it is additionally accompanied by the instrumentation of a piano and a guitar. The lyrics of the composition describe a couple that is {{nearing the end of}} their relationship; Wonder purposely uses [...] "cliché lines" [...] to get his point across and to prove the clichés true. Janine McAdams from Billboard found [...] "dramatic intensity" [...] within the lyrics, [...] "I should have never <b>left</b> <b>your</b> side / The writer takes his pen / To write the words again / That all in love is fair". Author Herb Jordan included the track's lyrics in his book Motown in Love: Lyrics from the Golden Era; they were placed under the section for songs in which the lyrics detail [...] "lessons of love".|$|E

2500|$|She {{passed the}} time sobbing and sighing and nothing could take away her grief. As {{soon as she}} had done her {{household}} chores and taken care of her husband, 'Ali, and their sons, Hasan and Husain, she would continue weeping: [...] "O my beloved father! To whom have you <b>left</b> <b>your</b> Fatima?" [...] Less than six months went by in this fashion till Fatima got so thin {{that there was nothing}} left of her but skin and bones.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{neither the}} second album, Alpha (released in July 1983), nor any {{following}} Asia album could repeat the chart {{success of the}} first release. [...] "Don't Cry" [...] was a #1 Album Rock Track and Top 10 Pop hit {{in the summer of}} 1983, and the video received considerable attention on MTV, while [...] "The Smile Has <b>Left</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes" [...] was another Top 40 hit for the band. The video for [...] "Smile" [...] also scored heavy MTV play. However, Rolling Stone panned Alpha as an over-produced commercial album, while others lamented that Howe and Palmer were effectively reduced to session musicians. Alpha received indifferent reviews from various critics, while still attaining platinum status and reaching #6 on the Billboard album chart.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1173, Peter went to England {{to take up}} a post {{as chief}} letter-writer for Richard of Dover, Becket's {{successor}} as Archbishop. He also entered the service of Henry II, acting as a diplomat in his negotiations with Louis VII of France and the Papacy. His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the Angevin Empire, carefully fomented by the French monarchy. Peter wrote an open letter to the Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, to [...] "deplore publicly and regretfully that, while you are a most prudent woman, you have <b>left</b> <b>your</b> husband." [...] However, when in 1183 Henry the Young King died during the revolt against his father, Peter wrote to Eleanor a letter of reasoned consolation.|$|E

2500|$|Gardiner ruled Council {{meetings}} strictly. He controlled {{procedural questions}} strictly, challenging dissident members to appeal his decisions, something no-one {{was able to}} do throughout his term. Members were scolded for talking inaudibly. Meetings went through agenda items quickly. Often, he would not pause to ask for dissenting votes. Leslie Frost commended his performance in 1956 by that stating that the success of Metro to date [...] "has been very largely dependent upon your own personality." [...] Nathan Phillips described his style: [...] "When he really wanted something, he just came and beat it out of you." [...] Philip Givens, who was on several occasions brought to tears, described Gardiner's temper as [...] "He {{scared the hell out of}} you. If he cut you up, he did it thoroughly. He eviscerated you, he <b>left</b> <b>your</b> entrails all over the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The way I {{originally}} {{heard about}} (the reunion) was {{from one of}} the guys at Earache (Records), who called me up to ask me about it. I knew nothing about it so I called Martin to ask him about it. The conversation got a little heated and I explained they couldn't do it under the name SABBAT as both he and (bassist) Frazer quit, leaving me and (drummer) Simon (Negus) with a lot of debts and financial problems to clear up. This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left. If you <b>left</b> <b>your</b> employee, you couldn't go and start that business somewhere else under the same name." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{that stood}} {{in the path of}} the 20,000 Union {{soldiers}} converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan [...] "Shanks" [...] Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men. Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander, Beauregard's signal officer, observing from [...] southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of wig-wag semaphore signaling in combat, Alexander sent the message [...] "Look out for your <b>left,</b> <b>your</b> position is turned." [...] Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill, a low rise to the northwest of his previous position.|$|E

2500|$|Columnist Barbara Ellen of The Observer {{ridiculed}} the pomposity {{of some of}} the unfavourable {{reviews in}} her column on Sunday 28 March 2010, in a jokey [...] "Open letter to London's famous Adelphi theatre": [...] "Dear Mr Adelphi, Regarding the performance I viewed last week of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, Love Never Dies, ridiculed as Paint Never Dries. With regret, I must demand my money back; it simply wasn't bad or boring enough. My companions and I paid our money and went along in good faith, expecting a right old disaster. Imagine our disappointment when it was good. The phantom bore an eerie resemblance to Martin Amis sulking after his tiff with Anna Ford, but, sir, this was not enough. A catastrophe we were promised and a catastrophe we expected to see. One concedes that it is not all the production's fault. Negative reviews, the dark art of anti-hype, are a dangerous business. However, do fine feelings pay my babysitter? I feel that I, and several innocent coach parties, were tricked into going to Paint Never Dries, and, against our will, forced to endure an enjoyable evening. I'm sure I speak for many when I say I <b>left</b> <b>your</b> theatre wholly dissatisfied with how incredibly satisfied I felt".|$|E
