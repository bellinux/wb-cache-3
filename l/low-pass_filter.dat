5|$|The next {{component}} in an atomic line filter is the vapor cell; this {{is common to}} all atomic line filters. It either absorbs and re-emits the incident light, or rotates its polarization by the Faraday or Voigt effect. Following the vapor cell is a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> designed to block all of the light that the first filter did not, except the designated frequency of light which came from the fluorescence. In Faraday and Voigt filters, a second polarizing plate is used here.|$|E
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|A <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> can be {{implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E
50|$|One typical {{distortion}} {{that occurs}} during image and video capture or transmission applications is blur that {{is caused by}} a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> process. The introduced blur can be modeled using Gaussian <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Despite being {{analog in}} their {{representation}} of individual signal voltage samples, these devices are discrete {{in the time}} domain and thus are limited by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; both the input and output signals are generally <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered.</b> The input must be <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> to avoid aliasing effects, while the output is <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> for reconstruction. (A low-pass is used as an approximation to the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula.) ...|$|R
50|$|Common types include <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters,</b> which {{pass through}} {{frequencies}} below their cutoff frequencies, and progressively attenuates frequencies above the cutoff frequency. <b>Low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used in}} audio crossovers to remove high-frequency content from signals being sent to a low-frequency subwoofer system.|$|R
5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E
5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E
25|$|Gaussian blur is a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> {{attenuating}} {{high frequency}} signals.|$|E
25|$|In signal processing, the Gibbs {{phenomenon}} is undesirable because it causes artifacts, namely clipping from the overshoot and undershoot, and ringing {{artifacts from the}} oscillations. In the case of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering,</b> these can be reduced or eliminated by using different <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
30|$|Clearly, {{this type}} of wavelet filter banks are only {{determined}} the two <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> h, h̃, i.e., the high-pass filters can be determined by exchanging position and changing {{the sign of the}} two <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> Therefore, it can reduce the computational complexity and facilitate fast computation.|$|R
50|$|In {{composite}} video, {{the signals}} co-exist on different frequencies. To achieve this, the luminance signal must be <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered,</b> dulling the image. As S-Video maintains the two as separate signals, such detrimental <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> for luminance is unnecessary, although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video.|$|R
25|$|Butterworth {{also showed}} that his basic <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> could be {{modified}} to give low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop functionality.|$|E
25|$|The FDK AAC encoder {{employs a}} more {{aggressive}} default <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> than is used in other codecs. Higher frequencies are removed so that more bits are available to better describe sounds of lower frequencies, improving the overall quality for most combinations of recordings and listeners. In some, not completely rare, combinations the missing high frequencies are noticeable. The library allows overriding the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> setting, and in the highest VBR mode effectively applies no filter at all.|$|E
25|$|In signal processing, the {{oscillations}} of the sine integral cause overshoot and ringing artifacts {{when using}} the sinc filter, and frequency domain ringing if using a truncated sinc filter as a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> {{occur in}} acoustics, optics and electronics.|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} coding artifact reduction {{algorithm is}} proposed {{for a variety of}} artifacts, including blocking artifact, ringing artifact and mosquito noise. This algorithm does not require grid position detection and any coding parameters. All the filtering is based on local content analysis. Basically, the algorithm attempts to apply mild <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> on more informative regions to preserve the sharpness of the object details, and to apply strong <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> on less informative regions to remove severe artifacts. The size and parameters of the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> are changed continuously based on the entropy of a local region...|$|R
40|$|Low-cost and {{flexible}} {{first and second}} order <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> with adjustable cutoff frequency were designed and printed by inkjet printing technology. The all-inkjet-printed <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> were characterized and an adjustable cutoff frequency feature in form of an inkjet-printed organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) {{was added to the}} filters for application-oriented fine-tuning. The applicability of these small circuits was evaluated by signal filtering for sensor applications. As a result, <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> with an adjustable cutoff frequency ranging from 82 Hz to 740 Hz were obtained, demonstrating their suitability in signal filtering and their promising applicability for tactile sensing characterized by low frequency signals...|$|R
25|$|Like all filters, {{the typical}} {{prototype}} is the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> {{which can be}} modified into a high-pass filter, or placed in series with others to form band-pass and band-stop filters, and higher order versions of these.|$|E
25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that intermodulation distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound. One advantage of higher sampling rates {{is that they can}} relax the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> design requirements for ADCs and DACs, but with modern oversampling sigma-delta converters this advantage is less important.|$|E
25|$|Gaussian {{blurring}} {{is commonly}} used when reducing {{the size of an}} image. When downsampling an image, it is common to apply a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> to the image prior to resampling. This is to ensure that spurious high-frequency information does not appear in the downsampled image (aliasing). Gaussian blurs have nice properties, such as having no sharp edges, and thus do not introduce ringing into the filtered image.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{automatic}} methods for parametrization of the voice source signals. Representatives of the two types of methods that have been used most often for parametrization were tested and compared. For this purpose a novel evaluation procedure is proposed which makes it possible to perform the numerous tests needed for a detailed comparison of the methods. This evaluation procedure revealed that {{in order to reduce the}} average error in the estimated voice source parameters the estimation methods should be able to estimate noninteger values of these parameters. The proposed evaluation method was also used to study the influence of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> on the estimated voice source parameters. The factor <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> was chosen because <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> is probably used in all methods in which voice source parameters are estimated. It turned out that <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> causes an error in all estimated voice source parameters. On average, the smallest errors were found for a parametrization method in which a voice source model is fitted to the voice source signals, and in which the voice source model is <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> with the same filter as the voice source signals...|$|R
25|$|The {{application}} of the sampling theorem to images should be made with care. For example, the sampling process in any standard image sensor (CCD or CMOS camera) is relatively far from the ideal sampling which would measure the image intensity at a single point. Instead these devices have a relatively large sensor area at each sample point {{in order to obtain}} sufficient amount of light. In other words, any detector has a finite-width point spread function. The analog optical image intensity function which is sampled by the sensor device is not in general bandlimited, and the non-ideal sampling is itself a useful type of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> though not always sufficient to remove enough high frequencies to sufficiently reduce aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial anti-aliasing, a separate anti-aliasing filter (optical <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter)</b> is typically included in a camera system to further blur the optical image. Despite images having these problems in relation to the sampling theorem, the theorem can be used to describe the basics of down and up sampling of images.|$|E
25|$|High-pass filters {{have many}} applications. They {{are used as}} part of an audio {{crossover}} to direct high frequencies to a tweeter while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> for the woofer and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor and nothing else).|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} shown to the right in the brick patterns. The top image shows the effects when the {{sampling}} theorem's condition is not satisfied. When software rescales an image (the same process that creates the thumbnail shown in the lower image) it, in effect, runs the image through a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> first and then downsamples the image {{to result in a}} smaller image that does not exhibit the moiré pattern. The top image is what happens when the image is downsampled without low-pass filtering: aliasing results.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{images are}} often {{corrupted}} by noise. Therefore, {{a lot of}} methods were designed for the purpose of denoising images. This paper describes and compares three of these methods: <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters,</b> bilateral filter and wavelet thresholding. <b>Low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> are linear filters applied on image by convolution. Their disadvantage is making images smooth. Bilateral filter is an extension of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> It smooths images as well, however it preserves edges. Wavelet thresholding is a more complex method using wavelet transform for time-frequency representation of image whose coefficients are thresholded. The downside of this method is making artifacts in images. The PSNR and SSIM methods are used for measuring image quality...|$|R
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} the {{derivative}} term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process noise that can cause large amounts {{of change in the}} output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear median filter may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance. In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a PI controller.|$|E
25|$|A {{system with}} low quality factor (Q<nbsp&) {{is said to}} be overdamped. Such a system doesn't {{oscillate}} at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by exponential decay, approaching the steady state value asymptotically. It has an impulse response that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the quality factor decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system's response resulting in a slower system. A second-order <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> with a very low quality factor has a nearly first-order step response; the system's output responds to a step input by slowly rising toward an asymptote.|$|E
