Various <b>LEDs</b> are realized including the conventional red, orange, yellow-green light <b>LEDs</b> but also blue, blue-green, white light <b>LEDs.</b> Even though nearly all colors {{seem to be}} realized, brightpk(green <b>LEDs</b> are only left unrealized. GaP has the band gap of 2. 24 eV and therefore, {{is one of the}} candidates to fabricatepbr green <b>LEDs.</b> However, the band structure of GaP is of indirect and therefore, their brightness is limited. AlGaInP quaternarycomp ound semiconductors have been used to fabricate <b>LEDs</b> for the color dispb ys from green to orange. The brightness of the peb green InGaAlP <b>LEDs</b> isdrop ed because the indirect-direct cross-over of the energy-band structure occurs around thebandgap energy of the peb green wavelength [1].

30|$|GaN-based light {{emitting}} diodes (<b>LEDs)</b> fabricated on sapphire substrates were successfully transferred onto silicon substrates using a double-transfer technique. Compared with the conventional <b>LEDs</b> on sapphire, the transferred <b>LEDs</b> showed a significant improvement in the light extraction and thermal dissipation, which should be mainly attributed to the removal of sapphire and the good thermal conductivity of silicon substrate. Benefited from the optimized wafer bonding process, the transfer processes had a negligible influence on electrical characteristics of the transferred <b>LEDs.</b> Thus, the transferred <b>LEDs</b> showed a similar current–voltage characteristic with the conventional <b>LEDs,</b> which is of crucial importance for practical applications. It is believed that the double-transfer technique offers an alternative way to fabricate high performance GaN-based thin-film <b>LEDs.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{temperature}} dependence of optical and electrical characteristics of commercially available GaN light-emitting diodes (<b>LEDs)</b> grown on silicon and sapphire substrates. Contrary to conventional expectations, <b>LEDs</b> grown on silicon substrates, {{commonly referred to}} as GaN-on-Si <b>LEDs,</b> show less efficiency droop at higher temperatures even with more threading dislocations. Analysis of the junction temperature reveals that GaN-on-Si <b>LEDs</b> have a cooler junction despite sharing identical epitaxial structures and packaging compared to <b>LEDs</b> grown on sapphire substrates. We also observe a decrease in ideality factor with increase in ambient temperature for GaN-on-Si <b>LEDs,</b> indicating an increase in ideal diode current with temperature. Analysis of the strain and temperature coefficient measurements suggests that there is an increase in hole transport efficiency within the active region for GaN-on-Si <b>LEDs</b> compared to the <b>LEDs</b> grown on sapphire, which accounts for the less temperature-dependent efficiency droop...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the influence of narrow-spectrum red light-emitting diodes (<b>LED's)</b> on plant growth and seed production, wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Superdwarf) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh, race Columbia) plants were grown under red <b>LED's</b> (peak emission 660 nm) and compared to plants grown under daylight fluorescent (white) light and red <b>LED's</b> supplemented with either 1 percent or 10 percent blue fluorescent (BF) light. Wheat growth under red <b>LED's</b> alone appeared normal, whereas Arabidopsis under red <b>LED's</b> alone developed curled leaf margins and a spiraling growth pattern. Both wheat and Arabidopsis under red <b>LED's</b> alone or red <b>LED's</b> + 1 percent BF light had significantly lower seed yield than plants grown under white light. However, the addition of 10 percent BF light to red <b>LED's</b> partially alleviated the adverse effect of red <b>LED's</b> on yield. Irrespective of the light treatment, viable seeds were produced by wheat(75 - 92 percent germination rate) and Arabidopsis (85 - 100 percent germination rate). These results indicate that wheat, {{and to a lesser extent}} Arabidopsis, can be successfully grown under red <b>LED's</b> alone, but supplemental blue light is required with red <b>LED's</b> to sufficiently match the growth characteristics and seed yield associated with plants grown under white light...|$|R
