5|$|As Apollo 14 was {{an early}} Apollo mission, <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> were {{restricted}} to equatorial regions for technical reasons. After Apollo 12 demonstrated the ability to land at a pre-specified landing zone, mission planners considered landings in rough, but geologically interesting areas of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. <b>Landing</b> <b>sites</b> considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged {{the various}} Apollo <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> {{on the surface}} of the Moon, for the first time with {{sufficient}} resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.|$|E
40|$|It is {{a crucial}} matter to select a <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> for landers or rovers in {{planning}} the Mars exploration. The <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> must have not only a scientific value as a <b>landing</b> <b>site,</b> but also geographical features to lead a safe landing for Mars probes. In this regard, this study analyzed <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of Mars probes and rovers in previous studies and discussed {{the adequacy of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> to scientific missions. Moreover, this study also examined domestic studies on the Mars. The frameworks of these studies will guide the selection of exploration <b>sites</b> and a <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> when sending Mars probe to the Mars through our own efforts. Additionally, this paper will be used as the preliminary data for selection of exploration <b>site</b> and a <b>landing</b> <b>site...</b>|$|R
50|$|The program {{renders the}} rover in a 3D environment. The program {{features}} the Jet Propulsion Laboratory testing facility, Spirit’s <b>landing</b> <b>site,</b> or the Opportunity’s <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> to explore. Data from the Spirit and Opportunity’s <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> must be downloaded externally from the Maestro website and imported into the program.|$|R
50|$|Starting in {{the seventeenth}} century, maps {{identify}} Drakes Bay as Drake’s <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> George Vancouver studied Drake’s <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> and concluded it was in Drakes Bay.|$|R
5|$|Apollo 15 was {{the first}} mission in which <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> were not {{restricted}} to equatorial areas. The Hadley-Apennine site was chosen with the specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within the Moon than had been obtained from the Fra Mauro formation on Apollo 14 and investigating Hadley Rille, a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|The cutbacks forced mission {{planners}} {{to reassess}} the original planned <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> {{in order to}} achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions. Apollo 15 had been planned to be the last of the H series missions, but since there would be only two subsequent missions left, it was changed to the first of three J missions.|$|E
5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now be restricted to shallow, inshore waters in northwestern Borneo. Of the five earlier specimens, four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China, hinting at a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Landing</b> <b>site</b> of Mönkkössaari {{island is}} {{situated}} in {{the northern end of}} Kaavinjärvi. There are covered campfire site and toilet in the <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of the island.|$|R
5000|$|A {{possible}} <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> for the Mars 2020 rover {{mission is}} Jezero crater (at [...] ) within the region. The northeastern region of Syrtis Major Planum is also considered a potential <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R
50|$|SpaceX {{also has}} begun {{construction}} of a <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> at the former launch complex SLC-4W at Vandenberg Air Force Base. As of 2014, the launch site was demolished for reconstruction as a <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R
5|$|MRO {{contains}} {{a host of}} scientific instruments such as cameras, spectrometers, and radar, which are {{used to analyze the}} landforms, stratigraphy, minerals, and ice of Mars. It paves the way for future spacecraft by monitoring Mars' daily weather and surface conditions, studying potential <b>landing</b> <b>sites,</b> and hosting a new telecommunications system. MRO's telecommunications system will transfer more data back to Earth than all previous interplanetary missions combined, and MRO will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions.|$|E
5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 <b>landing</b> <b>sites,</b> where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{aerodromes}} that support GA in the UK {{is difficult to}} establish with certainty. Pooleys 2008 United Kingdom Flight Guide lists 355, and the Airplan Flight Equipment UK VFR Flight Guide 2008 lists nearly 500. Lockyears Farm 'Strips' and Private Airfields Flight Guide lists more than 300 <b>landing</b> <b>sites.</b> The GASAR study estimates 1,100 formal flying sites in England alone, a figure which includes 400 sites known to planning authorities but not included in flight guides. It estimates another 759 informal sites known only to land owners, customs, {{and members of the}} enthusiast group Air-Britain.|$|E

50|$|Approximately 40 km to the {{southeast}} of Lansberg is the <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of the Luna 5 probe, and a further 60 km {{in the same direction}} is the <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of Surveyor 3 and Apollo 12.|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} a landed space {{exploration}} mission depends largely on the final <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> Factors influencing site selection include safety, fuel-consumption, and scientific return. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the best available <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> based on these factors in real-time during autonomous spacecraft descent onto a planetary surface. The problem is modeled probabilistically using Bayesian Networks (BNs). BNs provide a means of representing the causal relationships between variables that impact {{the quality of a}} <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> The final <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> is determined via probabilistic reasoning based on terrain safety derived from on-board sensors, available fuel based on spacecraft descent dynamics, and regions of interest defined by mission scientists...|$|R
5|$|Apollo 14 {{had visited}} and sampled a ridge of {{material}} that had been ejected by the impact that created the Mare Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material {{in the region of}} Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.|$|E
5|$|As little {{opposition}} was expected at Morotai, Allied planners decided {{to land the}} invasion force close to the airfield sites on the Doroeba Plain. Two beaches in the south-west coast of the island were selected as suitable <b>landing</b> <b>sites,</b> and were designated Red Beach and White Beach. The Allied plan called for all three infantry regiments of the 31st Division to be landed across these beaches on 15 September and swiftly drive inland to secure the plain. As Morotai's interior had no military value, the Allies {{did not intend to}} advance beyond a perimeter needed to defend the airfields. Planning for the construction of airfields and other base installations was also conducted prior to the landing, and tentative locations for these facilities had been selected by 15 September.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
40|$|Telescopic {{studies in}} the early 1960 's pinpointed the future Apollo 15 <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> as a {{potential}} exploration site because it included {{one of the largest}} lunar sinuous rilles, Rima Hadley, and some of the highest mountains, Montes Apenninus. Additional targets were identified once Apennine-Hadley emerged as a potential <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> Site selection processes were discussed...|$|R

5|$|In Haiti, about 630,000 {{people were}} still living in tents across areas devastated by the January 2010 {{earthquake}} prior to Emily's arrival. Due {{to the lack of}} sturdy structure to ride out a storm, fears arose over how they would fare with a tropical cyclone passing through the country. Emergency officials in the country set aside 22 large buses to evacuate thousands of people at the risk of flooding. Additionally, residents were urged to conserve food and safeguard their belongings. The United Nations placed 11,500 troops in the country on standby to assist in recovery efforts should they be necessitated. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also put emergency teams on standby to deliver food support in addition to the 125,000 people already assisted. In advance of the storm, authorities closed all airports and <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> in country.|$|E
5|$|MRO science {{operations}} were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main {{goals is to}} map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras in order to choose <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E
5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is {{important}} to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E

25|$|A fourth <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> {{workshop}} {{was held}} in late September 2010, and the fifth and final workshop May 16–18, 2011. On July 22, 2011, {{it was announced that}} Gale Crater had been selected as the <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of the Mars Science Laboratory mission.|$|R
50|$|KSC's 2.9 mile (4.6 km) Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) was the orbiters' primary end-of-mission <b>landing</b> <b>site,</b> {{although}} the first KSC landing {{did not take}} place until the tenth flight, when Challenger completed STS-41-B on February 11, 1984; the primary <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> until then was Edwards Air Force Base in California, subsequently used as a backup <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> The SLF also provided a return-to-launch-site (RTLS) abort option, which was not utilized. The SLF is among the longest runways in the world.|$|R
5|$|RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command {{attempted}} to warn {{all of their}} airborne units of the potential danger and bomber units were ordered to plan alternate <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> {{in the event of}} an attack on their airfields. All bomber and fighter groups were linked by telephone and ground control passed on all details of intruder operations to pilots including height and heading when they occurred. Station Commands organised blackouts of airfields and pilots could be ordered to switch the navigation lights off at any time. Only the Mosquito groups remained active against intruders, though the majority of these units were supporting Allied operations on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{instrument}} packages {{were installed}} on the lunar surface during all the Apollo landings. Long-lived instrument stations, including heat flow probes, seismometers, and magnetometers, were installed at the Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 <b>landing</b> <b>sites.</b> Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 due to budgetary considerations, but as the stations' lunar laser ranging corner-cube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments, they are still being used. Ranging to the stations is routinely performed from Earth-based stations with an accuracy of a few centimetres, and data from this experiment {{are being used to}} place constraints {{on the size of the}} lunar core.|$|E
5|$|The {{contracted}} {{batch of}} 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned <b>landing</b> <b>sites,</b> {{with plans to}} increase {{the mass of the}} CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.|$|E
