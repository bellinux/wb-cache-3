5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E

He learns the truth about Margaret's brother from Nicholas Higgins, and comes to London to settle his business affairs with Margaret. When Margaret presents Thornton with a generous business proposal, he realises that {{she is no longer}} indifferent or antagonistic to him. He again proposes marriage and, since she has <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> him, she accepts him.|$|E
25|$|Just as the Imām {{is seen by}} Ismailis as {{the manifestation}} of the first-created Light, during the period between the Imāmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the {{relationship}} between the teacher and the student became a sacred one, and the Dai became a position much beyond a normal missionary. The Dai passed on the sacred and hidden knowledge of the Imām to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First the student loved the Dai, and from the Dai he <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> the Imām, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called the Pir.|$|E

25|$|In 1852 {{the family}} moved about a mile further along York Street to a more spacious home in a newly-built terrace, {{opposite}} St Luke's Church, with greater access to outdoor space. Barely a year later, with his wife pregnant for a fifth time, Hodgson died suddenly of a stroke, leaving the family without an income. Frances was cared for by her grandmother while her mother took over running the family business. From her grandmother, who bought her books, Frances <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> reading, in particular her first book, The Flower Book, which had coloured illustrations and poems. Because of their reduced income, Eliza {{had to give up}} their family home and moved with her children to live with relatives in Seedley Grove, Tanners Lane, Pendleton, Salford, where they lived in a house with a large enclosed garden in which Frances enjoyed playing.|$|E
500|$|When {{his brother}} Burnie {{returned}} to Davenport {{at the end}} of 1918 after serving stateside during World War I, he brought with him a Victrola phonograph and several records, including [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] and [...] "Skeleton Jangle" [...] by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. From these records, Bix first <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> hot jazz; he taught himself to play cornet by listening to Nick LaRocca's horn lines. Beiderbecke also listened to jazz music off the riverboats that docked in downtown Davenport. Louis Armstrong and the drummer Baby Dodds claimed to have met Beiderbecke when their New-Orleans-based excursion boat stopped in Davenport. Historians disagree over whether such an event actually occurred.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Chabon was mistakenly featured in a Newsweek article on up-and-coming gay writers (Pittsburghs protagonist has liaisons with people of both sexes). The New York Times later reported that [...] "in some ways, [...] was happy" [...] for the magazine's error, and quoted him as saying, [...] "I feel very lucky about all of that. It really opened up a new readership to me, and a very loyal one." [...] In a 2002 interview, Chabon added, [...] "If Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about anything {{in terms of human}} sexuality and identity, it's that people can't be put into categories all that easily." [...] In [...] "On The Mysteries of Pittsburgh," [...] an essay he wrote for the New York Review of Books in 2005, Chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel: [...] "I had slept with one man whom I loved, and <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> another man so much that it would never have occurred to me to want to sleep with him." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{surviving}} {{description of}} this lost film {{was published in}} The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Two men playing cards, the argument, flash of a revolver, and one lay dead. The murderer homeward fled, hurried his little girl baby into a west-bound train and was heard of no more. The years passed and boyish Jim Conway grew to manhood with {{the sole purpose of}} seeking out his father's murderer to deal justice to him. He went West and was one day lost in the mountains. He called for help and help {{came in the form of}} a sweet-faced woman who led him to her home. He spent the flying weeks with her and the aged father, <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> the mountain nymph for her beauty of soul and fair face. One day she asked him his reasons for being in the hill country, and he, lover-like, confided his secret. Behind the door, sat the white-haired father. He rose, shook himself like a leaf as be invited the young man into the house. And there he confessed the deed, baring his chest for the expected blow. But none fell for love had sweetened the poison of his thought." [...] This summary of the film was provided by the American Film Manufacturing Company.|$|E
500|$|Problems arose during Tilley's {{administration}} {{because of}} conflicting Samoan and American laws. In one case, a native had caught and eaten a skipjack, a sacred fish which {{could only be}} eaten {{with the permission of}} a local chief under Samoan law. Traditional punishment decreed that the offender's house should be burned down and his crops uprooted, and he should be exiled from the territory. The native challenged his punishment under the American legal system, however, resulting in the arrest of the chief responsible for ordering the destruction of his property. The chief was sentenced to a year of house arrest in a criminal proceeding, on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was ordered to pay compensation for the destroyed property. There were similar issues with Samoan customs not blending well with the newly introduced American political divisions in the territory. For example, the territory's three district governors had equal authority but they were of differing Samoan social status. This disparity made decision-making more difficult and caused social tensions. Despite these problems, Tilley was well-considered by the locals. On December 18, 1900, the local chiefs sent a letter of congratulations on the re-election of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, [...] "you gave us a leader, a Governor, a High Chief, whom we have <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> and respect".|$|E
500|$|In the 1963–64 NBA season, Chamberlain got {{yet another}} new coach, Alex Hannum, and {{was joined by}} a {{promising}} rookie center, Nate Thurmond, who eventually entered the Hall of Fame. Ex-soldier Hannum, who later entered the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach, was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing. Most importantly, he was not afraid {{to stand up to}} the dominant Chamberlain, who was known to [...] "freeze out" [...] (not communicate with) coaches he didn't like. Backed up by valuable rookie Thurmond, Chamberlain had another good season with 36.9 ppg and 22.3 rpg, and the Warriors went all the way to the NBA Finals. In that series they succumbed to Russell's Boston Celtics yet again, this time losing 4–1. But as Cherry remarked, not only Chamberlain, but in particular Hannum deserved much credit because he had basically had taken the bad 31–49 squad of last year plus Thurmond and made it into a NBA Finalist. In the summer of 1964 Chamberlain, one of the prominent participants at the famed Rucker Park basketball court in New York City, made the acquaintance of a tall, talented 17-year-old teenager who played there. Soon, the young Lew Alcindor was allowed into his inner circle, and quickly idolized the ten-year older NBA player. Unfortunately, Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as Alcindor would name himself later, would develop an intensely personal antipathy. In the following 1964–65 NBA season, the Warriors got off to a terrible start and ran into financial trouble. At the 1965 All-Star break Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, the new name of the relocated Syracuse Nationals. In return the Warriors received Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer (who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors), and $150,000 (equal to about $ today). When Chamberlain left the Warriors, owner Franklin Mieuli said: [...] "Chamberlain is not an easy man to love [...] the fans in San Francisco never <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> him. Wilt is easy to hate [...] people came to see him lose." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} animated film, the Beast does little singing {{apart from a}} brief solo during [...] "Something There" [...] because Menken and Ashman {{had not been able}} to agree upon a suitable moment within the film during which the Beast could have performed his own song. However, Menken considered it imperative that the character sing a solo in both the stage and live-action adaptations because he believes the Beast is actually the story's protagonist [...] "whose life has changed in the most dramatic way." [...] In the stage production, the Beast performs the ballad [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] after he frightens Belle away from the castle, wondering if he will ever be able to love anyone since he struggles to love her. Menken and Condon had deliberated whether or not the song should be re-used in the remake; despite Menken's strong attachment to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", the musical number was ultimately omitted because it had been written specifically to conclude the first act of a Broadway musical. Screenwriter Stephen Chbosky had originally suggested that the character receive a new song to perform some time after he has saved Belle from the wolves. Due to the remake's three-act structure, Menken and Condon concluded that it would be best to replace [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a song that better depicts the Beast's feelings for Belle after he has finally <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> her and realizes she is no longer his prisoner, while accepting the grimm reality that releasing her would ultimately decrease his chances of becoming human again. Rice, who co-wrote [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with Menken, further convinced the composer to substitute [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a more appropriate song, joking, [...] "it would be like writing 'Don't Cry for Me Brazil'," [...] referring to [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina", a song he famously wrote for the stage musical Evita.|$|E

2500|$|In tandem, {{echoes of}} Sămănătorist {{ideology}} were fueling {{some of the}} new movements aiming to reconfigure Romania's political scene. One such current was the version of agrarianism represented, in a post-land reforms age, by the Peasants' Party and the National Peasants' Party (both of which represented mutations of Poporanism). In tandem, the magazine was also a reference point for the far right or fascist movements which emerged during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The first among such groups was one formed around the poet-philosopher Nichifor Crainic, a sporadic contributor to Iorga's magazines, after he took over leadership of Gândirea journal. Crainic's main innovation was in linking ethnic nationalism and ethnocracy with the notion that the Romanian Orthodox Church was the guarantee of Romanian identity, therefore discarding the implicit secularism of Sămănătorist thought. Crainic's [...] "Orthodoxist" [...] views, Veiga notes, were closely related to the ideas of Russian émigré authors, from the Christian existentialism of Nikolai Berdyaev to the political radicalism of the Eurasianist theorists. Defining his group's exact relation to Sămănătorism in one of his Gândirea articles, Crainic stated: [...] "Over the land that we have <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> from Sămănătorul we see arching itself the azure tarpaulin of the Orthodox Church. We see this substance of this Church blending in with the ethnic substance." [...] His own literary style was seen as a more robust form of neo-Sămănătorism by Lovinescu, and deemed [...] "Orthodoxism with Semănătorist modulations" [...] by literary historian Mircea A. Diaconu. In tandem, Crainic's rival on the far right, Trăirist philosopher Nae Ionescu, paid homages to Sămănătorul and Iorga's thought.|$|E
