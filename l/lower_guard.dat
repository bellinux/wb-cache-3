When she went to her foul {{steerage}} bunk at last, between the clashing engines, it was not to sleep, but only to wait for the morning, and, waiting, grieve.|$|E

The bathhouse includes a front office where patrons can pay for memberships or one time visits to the beach, a manager’s office, showers, lockers, washrooms, changing rooms, and a <b>lower</b> <b>guard</b> house. The old side office of the bathhouse, which was removed after 2011 renovations, used {{to be used as}} a concession stand.|$|E
50|$|Rabbits do {{not possess}} the same allergy-causing qualities as many other animals. The average rabbit can live for about 7-12 years when kept indoors and well-cared for. However, many outdoor rabbits have a shorter lifespan. Maintenance is a must. The Satin Angora has a much <b>lower</b> <b>guard</b> hair count and their wool becomes easily tangled. Regardless of breed, all Angoras must be {{monitored}} to prevent wool block, a potentially lethal condition where their digestive tracts become clogged with hair. Proper diet is also crucial in lowering their susceptibility to the block.|$|E

5000|$|Pollington {{describes}} the sword as [...] "the most symbolically important weapon" [...] of the Anglo-Saxon period, and historian Guy Halsall {{referred to it}} as [...] "the most treasured item of early medieval military equipment." [...] In Old English, swords were termed sweord, although other terms used for such weapons included heoru or heru, bill or bile, and mēce or mǣce. Anglo-Saxon swords comprised two-edged straight, flat blades. The tang of the blade was covered by a hilt, which consisted of an upper and <b>lower</b> <b>guard,</b> a pommel, and a grip by which the sword was held. Pommels could be elaborately decorated with a variety of styles. Examples include the Abingdon Sword or the pommel found in the Bedale Hoard, which was decorated with unique inlaid gold. These Anglo-Saxon blades, the tang included, typically measured 86-94 cm (34-37 inches) in length, and 4.5-5.5 cm in width. Larger examples have been found, with some reaching up to 100 cm (40 in) in length and 6.5 cm in width.|$|E
40|$|The {{system and}} method for testing thermal {{insulation}} uses a cryostatic insulation tester having a vacuum chamber {{and a cold}} mass including a test chamber and upper and <b>lower</b> <b>guard</b> chambers adjacent thereto. The thermal insulation is positioned within the vacuum chamber and adjacent the cold mass. Cryogenic liquid is supplied to the test chamber, upper guard and <b>lower</b> <b>guard</b> to create a first gas layer in an upper portion of the <b>lower</b> <b>guard</b> chamber and a second gas layer in an upper portion of the test chamber. Temperature are sensed within the vacuum chamber to test the thermal insulation...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} art gallery {{problem for the}} special case that the domain (gallery) P is an m-polyomino, a polyform whose cells are m unit squares. We study the {{combinatorics}} of guarding polyominoes {{in terms of the}} parameter m, in contrast with the traditional parameter n, the number of vertices of P. In particular, we show that ⌊m+ 1 3 ⌋ point guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary to cover an m-polyomino, possibly with holes. When m ≤ 3 n 4 − 4, the sufficiency condition yields a strictly <b>lower</b> <b>guard</b> number than ⌊n 4 ⌋, given by the art gallery theorem for orthogonal polygons...|$|E
50|$|The {{upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>guards</b> are curved and contain various {{interlaced}} designs, including birds, animal and human figures, and foliated patterns. The {{figures on the}} upper guard {{have been identified as}} the four symbols of the evangelists. The style of leaf used next to the figure of the eagle on the upper guard has also been identified on early tenth century embroideries from Durham, on the back of the Alfred Jewel and a number of other objects dating to this period. The pommel incorporates two outward-looking animal heads, with protruding ears and round eyes and nostrils, now fragmentary.|$|R

40|$|A multi-purpose, {{cylindrical}} {{thermal insulation}} test apparatus {{is used for}} testing insulation materials and systems of materials using a liquid boil-off calorimeter system for absolute measurement of the effective thermal conductivity (k-value) and heat flux of a specimen material at a fixed environmental condition (cold-side temperature, warm-side temperature, vacuum pressure level, and residual gas composition). An inner vessel receives liquid with a normal boiling point below ambient temperature, such as liquid nitrogen, enclosed within a vacuum chamber. A cold mass assembly, including upper and <b>lower</b> <b>guard</b> chambers and middle test vessel, is suspended from a lid of the vacuum canister. Each of the three chambers is filled and vented through a single feedthrough. All fluid and instrumentation feedthroughs are mounted and suspended from a top domed lid allowing easy removal of the cold mass. A lift mechanism allows manipulation of the cold mass assembly and insulation test article...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to characterize blue light responses from chloroplasts of adaxial guard cells from Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and coleoptile tips from corn (Zea mays). The chloroplast response to blue light was quantified by measurements of the blue light-induced enhancement of a red light-stimulated quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence. In adaxial (upper) guard cells, low fluence rates of blue light applied under saturating fluence rates of red light enhanced the red light-stimulated fluorescence quenching by up to 50 %. In contrast, added blue light did not alter the red light-stimulated quenching from abaxial (<b>lower)</b> <b>guard</b> cells. This response pattern paralleled the blue light sensitivity of stomatal opening in the two leaf surfaces. An action spectrum for the blue light-induced enhancement of the red light-stimulated quenching showed a major peak at 450 nm and two minor peaks at 420 and 470 nm. This spectrum matched closely an action spectrum for blue light-stimulated stomatal opening. Coleoptile chloroplasts also showed an enhancement by blue light of red light-stimulated quenching. The action spectrum of this response, showing a major peak at 450 nm, a minor peak at 470 nm, and a shoulder at 430 nm, closely matched an action spectrum for blue light-stimulated coleoptile phototropism. Both action spectra match the absorption spectrum of zeaxanthin, a chloroplastic carotenoid recently implicated in blue light photoreception of both guard cells and coleoptiles. The remarkable similarity between the action spectra for the blue light responses of guard cells and coleoptile chloroplasts and the spectra for blue light-stimulated stomatal opening and phototropism, coupled to the recently reported evidence on a role of zeaxanthin in blue light photoreception, indicates that the guard cell and coleoptile chloroplasts specialize in sensory transduction...|$|E
