These composites show low levels of reinforcement, consistent <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> <b>alignment</b> of the nanosheets as-described by {{a modified version of}} Halpin-Tsai theory. However, drawing of the composites to 300 % strain results in a considerable increase in mechanical properties with the maximum composite modulus and strength both ?? 3 higher than that of the pristine polymer. In addition, the rate of increase of modulus with BN volume fraction was up to 3 -fold larger than for the unstrained composites. This is higher than can be explained by drawing-induced alignment using Halpin-Tsai theory. However, the data was consistent with a combination of alignment and strain-induced de-aggregation of BN multilayers...|$|R

40|$|Identifying shared {{sequence}} segments along {{amino acid}} sequences generally requires {{a collection of}} closely related proteins, most often curated manually from the sequence datasets to suit the purpose at hand. Currently developed statistical methods are strained, however, when the collection contains remote sequences <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> <b>alignment</b> to the rest, or sequences containing multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a completely unsupervised and automated method to identify the shared sequence segments observed in a diverse collection of protein sequences including those present in a smaller fraction of the sequences in the collection, {{using a combination of}} sequence alignment, residue conservation scoring and graph-theoretical approaches. Since shared sequence fragments often imply conserved functional or structural attributes, the method produces a table of associations between the sequences and the identified conserved regions that can reveal previously unknown protein families as well as new members to existing ones. We evaluated the biological relevance of the method by clustering the proteins in gold standard datasets and assessing the clustering performance in comparison with previous methods from the literature. We have then applied the proposed method to a genome wide dataset of 17793 human proteins and generated a global association map to each of the 4753 identified conserved regions. Investigations on the major conserved regions revealed that they corresponded strongly to annotated structural domains. This suggests that the method can be useful in predicting novel domains on protein sequences...|$|R

Lessons learned: Diverse models of integrated care have been established across Australia. The most promising initiatives include: Primary Care Partnerships, community-oriented primary health care centres, GP Super Clinics and comprehensive primary health care approaches. The key mechanisms underlying these initiatives are effective communication and support; appropriate structural arrangements, use of technology and tailoring of services to meet local needs.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen, in tumour angiogenesis and malignant progression, an expression vector harboring human VEGF cDNA was stably transfected into three human cancer cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> VEGF productivity. Though their in vitro growth rate and intrinsic productivity of another angiogenic factor, {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF), were not changed by transfection, those clones with higher VEGF production were endowed with tumorigenic and angiogenic potentials as follows: firstly, nontumorigenic, lung carcinoma QG 90 cells having lower bFGF productivity acquired tumorigenicity as well as significant in vivo angiogenesis-inducing ability, secondly, tumorigenic colorectal carcinoma RPMI 4788 cells having higher potency for bFGF production could form more vascularized solid tumour with faster growth rate and thirdly, oestrogen-dependent breast carcinoma MCF- 7 cells, which did not produce detectable bFGF, acquired tumorigenicity {{even in the absence of}} oestrogen and the solid tumour growth rate was remarkably enhanced, accompanied with increased vascularization, in the presence of oestrogen.

We compared PPA test performance between people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls, determined the fall-risk profile for people with MS and developed a reference database for people with MS. METHODS: For this study, 416 ambulant people with MS (51. 5 [*]±[*] 12. 0 years) and 352 controls (52. 8 [*]±[*] 12. 2 years) underwent the PPA (tests of contrast sensitivity, proprioception, quadriceps strength, reaction time and sway) with composite fall-risk scores computed from these measures. MS participants were followed prospectively for falls for 3 months. RESULTS: The MS participants performed significantly worse than controls in each PPA test. The average composite fall-risk score was also significantly elevated, indicating a "marked" fall risk when compared with controls. In total, 155 MS participants (37. 3 %) reported 2 [*]+[*]falls in the follow-up period. Frequent fallers performed significantly worse than non-frequent fallers in the contrast sensitivity, reaction time and sway tests and had higher PPA composite scores.

40|$|Global mature microRNA (miRNA) {{expression}} is downregulated in cancers, and impaired miRNA processing enhances cancer cell proliferation. These {{findings indicate that}} the miRNA system generally serves as a negative regulator during cancer progression. In this study, we investigated {{the role of the}} miRNA system in cancer cell invasion by determining the effect of damaging miRNA processing on invasion-essential urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression in breast cancer cells. Short hairpin RNAs specific for Drosha, DGCR 8, and Dicer, key components of miRNA processing machinery, were introduced into 2 breast cancer cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> high uPA expression and 2 <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> uPA expression. Knockdown of Drosha, DGCR 8, or Dicer led to even higher uPA expression in cells with high uPA expression, while it was unable to increase uPA level in cells <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> uPA expression, suggesting that the miRNA system most likely impacts uPA expression as a facilitator. In cells with high uPA expression, knockdown of Drosha, DGCR 8, or Dicer substantially increased in vitro invasion, and depleting uPA abrogated enhanced invasion. These results thus link the augmented invasion conferred by impaired miRNA processing to upregulated uPA expression. uPA mRNA was a direct target of miR- 193 a/b and miR- 181 a, and a higher uPA level in cells with impaired miRNA processing resulted from less mature miR- 193 a/b and miR- 181 a processed from their respective primary miRNAs. Importantly, the levels of mature miR- 193 a, miR- 193 b, and miR- 181 a, but not their respective primary miRNAs, were lower in high uPA-expressing cells compared to cells with low uPA expression, and this apparently attributed to lower Drosha/DGCR 8 expression in high uPA-expressing cells. This study suggests that less efficient miRNA processing can be a mechanism responsible for reduced levels of mature forms of tumor-suppressive miRNAs frequently detected in cancers...|$|R

Methods: Fifty-four aseptic tibial shaft nonunions for 1. 2 ~ 4. 3 (mean, 2. 4) years were treated with exchange nailing. Indications for this technique included an aseptic nonunion of the tibial shaft with an inserted intramedullary nail and < 2 cm of shortening.

40|$|Wounding is a {{prerequisite}} for tumor formation in v-jun transgenic mice. The progression from wound to dermal sarcoma is a multistep process which, at some stage, results in an increase in transgene mRNA expression in tumor tissue. However, transgene expression in individual sarcoma cells stained for Jun protein cultures is heterogeneous. We cloned several cell lines from wound-related v-jun transgenic tumors to determine whether a relationship existed between the cellular growth properties and structure, expression, or function of the transgene. Cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> very high v-jun expression had a high cloning efficiency in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. However, for cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> an intermediate or low level of transgene expression there was no correlation between transgene expression and the transformed phenotype. There was also no correlation between transgene expression and individual cell line morphologies, growth rates, transgene genomic DNA copy number, or mRNA expression of jun-related genes. The tumor cell subclones (1 - 20. 2, 3 - 24. 3) with very low transgene expression, very poor cloning efficiency, and low tumorigenicity also showed reduced activator protein 1 DNA binding activity and had an increased expression of endogenous c-jun when compared to other tumor cell lines. Transfection of a v-jun expression vector into cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> cloning efficiency and low tumorigenicity enhanced both in vitro cloning and in vivo tumor formation. However, such overexpressed v-jun had no effect on NIH 3 T 3 cells. Our studies show that expression of the v-jun transgene contributes to the transformed phenotype of tumor cell lines but that there are additional factors that determine growth properties in culture and in the animal.

40|$|Type 2 Diabetes (T 2 D) {{prevalence}} {{is growing}} to pandemic proportions worldwide. The link between genotype, environment and β-cell function {{is still being}} investigated. I have devoted the work presented in this thesis to attempt to elucidate the coupling of β-cell metabolism to insulin secretion and to look for casual mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations disturbing insulin secretion. In paper I, we showed that tight coupling between glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism is required for robust insulin secretion from β-cells by comparing two insulin secreting β-cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> good and <b>poor</b> glucose responsiveness, respectably. The cell <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> glucose responsiveness showed increased lactate production and glycolytic flux but decreased ATP production, suggesting a disturbed coupling between glycolytic flux and mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Several metabolic genes that differed between the cell lines were found to correlate with HbA 1 c in human islets, reflecting long term glucose control. In paper II, a metabolic profiling analysis showed that a metabolic shift towards less glucose responsiveness and more anaerobic metabolism was characteristic for cells <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> glucosestimulated insulin secretion. Also, the hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF- 1 α {{was found to be}} more stabilized in poorly responsive cells. A comparison between healthy and T 2 D human islets showed that this mechanism may be occurring in T 2 D humans as well. In paper III, we examined palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in β-cells and found that cellular stress introduced by lipotoxicity directs metabolism more towards metabolism of lipids than of glucose. Together with this, the cells exhibited poor glucose responsiveness in intracellular metabolic flux and insulin secretion. Changes in metabolic flux were accompanied by changes in gene expression and increased expression of genes in the pathways of steroid biosynthesis, cell cycle, fatty acid metabolism, DNA replication, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Histone-modifying enzyme activity and histone modifications on the genes Insig 1, Lss, Peci, Idi 1, Hmgcs 1 and Casr were found to be altered {{in a manner consistent with}} gene expression. This suggests the involvement of epigenetic regulations. In conclusion, this thesis suggests that the coupling between glycolytic and mitochondrial flux is essential for the glucose sensitivity of the β-cell. Alterations in transcription factors or gene expression could be underlying disturbances of this coupling. It also shows that a diabetogenic environment with increased concentrations of fatty acids affects metabolic flux in these cells, something that is paralleled by an altered expression of metabolic genes. Finally, it suggests that epigenetic mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of these alterations...|$|R

In parallel, the purchase of emission reductions through a voluntary carbon market {{has become a}} mainstream practice across business and individuals who, although not having any regulatory mandate, aim to offset their emissions. This voluntary market relies on mitigation projects {{which may or may}} not follow the standards of the CDM. This review compares these two instruments and traces similarities and differences in terms of project types, offset quality and contribution to sustainable development. It is shown that both mechanisms support a wide range of mitigation options and technologies, and differ considerably in the contribution of forestry and industrial gas offsets to their markets. There is not enough empirical data to assess the actual additionality and quality of produced offsets and their contribution to national and local sustainable development also requires further empirical assessment. Large scale mitigation options provide a substantial percentage of GHG reductions in both markets, with methane-based mitigation and fuel switching dominating over renewable investments such as solar and tidal. Africa remains the least benefited continent in both schemes. The review supports proposals towards reforming the CDM so that the least developed countries can also participate in a transition towards a decarbonised global society.

40|$|In this study, we {{established}} a computational framework of comparative network analysis {{to identify the}} conserved and species-specific functions of cell-wall (CW) related genes [1, 2], an important gene family related to plant bio-fuel productions across multiple tissue types between Arabidopsis and Poplar. The co-expressed genes are believed to coordinate in transcription {{so that they may}} have similar functions [3, 4]. Also, a comparative analysis across species for gene co-expression networks (GCNs) provides a systematic way to understand genomic conserved or species-specific functions [5]. Therefore, to understand the functions of CW genes in different tissue types, we integrated and compared the network characteristics of CW genes across GCNs from different tissue types including leaf, flower and shoot for Arabidopsis and Poplar [6]. First, by aligning the gene coexpression sub-networks associated with CW genes between two plants for each tissue type, we grouped the tissue types based on the alignment of the CW genes along with their neighboring orthologous genes. For those tissues with good alignments, it suggests that CW genes coordinate in a similar way for both plants, which may have involved in the conserved functions. For the tissues <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> <b>alignments,</b> however, CW genes may take part in species-specific functions. The gene ontology enrichment and signaling pathways of their co-expressed neighboring genes were identified to provide new insight for cell wall biology. Second, since the genes with high network centralities of a GCN, so called "hub" genes, are believed to have key functions [7], we investigated the network centralities for the CW genes between two plants to understand their functions in a global network point of view. The network centralities of GCN that we used are clustering coefficient (CC) for measuring gene's local cliqueness, and eigenvector centrality (EC) for measuring gene's global influence over the entire network. Besides finding hub genes for each tissue type within and across two plants, we also identified the conserved hub genes and tissue-specific hub genes in either local or global fashion. The CW genes that happen to become hub were particularly of interest to study. If many CW genes are global hubs in certain tissues, it implies that cell wall related activities may interact with the whole plant in those tissues, but if local hubs, they may coordinate with certain local activities only. Finally, we used the genomic variation data to identify the species-specific SNPs, especially in the promoter regions of the CW co-expressed neighboring genes across tissues, and associate them with corresponding species-specific functions. In summary, our comparative network analysis framework studied gene coexpression networks for the cell wall related genes across different tissue types in Arabidopsis and Poplar, and identified their conserved and species-specific functions and variations. This framework {{can also be used to}} study other gene families along with their functions across multiple species. Copyright © 2007 by the Association for Computing Machinery...|$|R

With breeding to homozygosity completed, we can now estimate the extinction rate at remarkable 95 % despite considerable efforts to maintain <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> reproductive performance. Thus, extinction in the CC represents a unique opportunity to investigate factors that contribute to infertility, often difficult to study because of fitness pressure to purge them from a population. Here we provide the first report of a large and logistically challenging collaboration to systematically phenotype and genotype males from the last generation of CC lines when there were deemed extinct due lack of productivity. We analyzed fertility and a large number of reproductive phenotypes on the last unproductive males from 347 independent CC funnels and performed a trait mapping with the largest number of CC lines to date. Extinction in the CC may be due largely to male infertility, since 47 % of males from extinct funnels were infertile. CC extinct fertile and infertile males had similar means and ranges for nearly every reproductive trait measured, suggesting that a single trait is unlikely to explain the observed infertility. We performed QTL mapping across 39 male reproductive traits and identified 9 genomic regions significantly associated with features such as reproductive organ size and sperm motility traits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of trait mapping in the population, we validated a QTL for sperm velocity in an independent population and confirmed the observed allelic effect in multiple generations. Additionally, we identified a large region on chromosome X for genetic infertility driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype, indicating that genetic incompatibility between founders might also cause CC strain extinction. The results from this study will help us understand genetic factors associated with mammalian infertility, and will also shed light onto reproductive concerns and problems with current breeding of extant CC strain...|$|R
50|$|Scott Mendelson of Forbes {{argued that}} a bag of mixed to {{negative}} reviews hindered the box office potential of the film. Unlike tentpole films which aren't as affected by critic reviews and fan reception, adult skewing drama films like Billy Lynn heavily depend on reviews which could either help or hinder the box office fate of a film. In this case, the bad reviews took a toll on the film. He {{also pointed out that}} the complex release format—which is the main focus of the whole film—failed to deliver its intended desired effect, which manifested in its poor box office performance. The Guardian cited different causes, saying that the Iraqi war settings—which don't usually resonate to American audiences—and the war genre itself as being tough-selling subject matter. War films in the United States are generally sold as action films, but Billy Lynn on the other hand is a drama piece. The film falls in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> previous <b>poor</b> showings of Iraqi war films, after Green Zone (2010), Body of Lies (2008), Rendition (2007) and Stop-Loss (2008). The only exception is American Sniper (2014).|$|R
40|$|This paper redeems the {{significance}} of the health reform movement and the municipal healthcare movement {{in the context of the}} 1970 s and 1980 s, and its social, politic and innovative power in the democratic reconstruction of the day. It then notes that the implementation of the constitutional guidelines, regulated in 1990 by Laws 8080 / 90 and 8142 / 90, has been characterized in the last 22 years by four major and mounting obstacles imposed by State policy on all governments: federal underfunding; federal subsidies to the private health plan market; resistance to reform of the State management structure of service provision; and the handing over of administration of public facilities to private entities. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) included half the population that was once excluded in the public health system, though these obstacles keep the coverage of primary care focused below the poverty <b>line</b> and <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> resolution. The conclusion drawn is that the real policy of the state for healthcare in the past 22 years has prioritized the creation and expansion of the private health plan market for consumer rights, and relegated the effectiveness of constitutional guidelines for civic human rights to second place...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we explore the {{implications}} of acquiring language when relying mainly or exclusively on input from a cochlear implant (CI), a device providing auditory input to otherwise deaf individuals. We focus on {{the time course of}} semantic learning in children within the second year of implant use; a period that equals the auditory age of normal hearing children during which vocabulary emerges and extends dramatically. 32 young bilaterally implanted children saw pictures paired with either matching or non-matching auditory words. Their electroencephalographic responses were recorded after 12, 18 and 24 months of implant use, revealing a large dichotomy: Some children failed to show semantic processing throughout their second year of CI use, which fell in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> their <b>poor</b> language outcomes. The majority of children, though, demonstrated semantic processing in form of the so-called N 400 effect already after 12 months of implant use, even when their language experience relied exclusively on the implant. This is slightly earlier than observed for normal hearing children of the same auditory age, suggesting that more mature cognitive faculties at the beginning of language acquisition lead to faster semantic learning...|$|R
50|$|Cats are {{commonly}} cow-hocked, with the hind legs angling inward {{at the knee}} and the feet splaying outward more than forward. Mild cow-hocking is negligible, and kittens often look a little cow-hocked, but if the defect is severe, the resulting <b>poor</b> <b>alignment</b> can damage the joints and spine. A similar deviation may occur in the vertical alignment of a dog's rear structure.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of corrosion inhibition of AA 2024 -T 3 by vanadates were studied using chronoamperometry, polarization curves and adsorption isotherms. The electrochemical behaviour of clear solutions containing metavanadates and orange solutions containing decavanadates was clearly distinctive. Metavanadates reduced the kinetics of oxygen reduction {{to an extent}} similar to chromates. Corrosion inhibition of AA 2024 -T 3 by metavanadates was very rapid and it might occur by {{the formation of an}} adsorbed layer. Reduction of clear metavanadate solution was very slow. Approximately 35 min were required to develop a monolayer of a reduced vanadate species. The adsorption of the inhibitor likely blocked reactive sites on intermetallic particles, discouraging the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Adsorption of the inhibitor on the Al matrix could also displace Cl- ions, increasing the stability of the passive film and reducing the breakdown of S-phase particles. In contrast, decavanadates were shown to be poor inhibitors of the ORR. A sharp current spike was observed after injection of decavanadates for both Cu and AA 2024 -T 3 at various applied cathodic potentials. Integration of the current peaks suggested the formation of several monolayers of a reduced vanadate species. The formation of several monolayers was in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> the <b>poor</b> performance of decavanadates as inhibitors of AA 2024 -T 3 corrosion...|$|R
