40|$|One of {{the promised}} methods for {{nanolithography}} is the tip-induced modification by a scanning probe microscopy, particular an atomic force microscopy (AFM). Also AFM becomes an important tool for the imaging surface down to the atomic scale even under the ambient condition. The advantage of an atomic force microscope is the possibility to modify the semiconductor or metal surface locally. The characteristic size of the nanomodification for this method varied from 10 to 100 nanometers at lateral directions. There are two basic methods of the nanofabrication with an AFM probe: the <b>local</b> anodic <b>oxidation</b> by applying oxidized potential [1] and “direct scratching ” of the surface by an AFM tip [2]. The both methods have been tested by the fabricating of nanostructure objects. Unfortunately the <b>local</b> anodic <b>oxidation</b> of semiconductor and metal surfaces demonstrates the small modification depth, generally not more than 10 nanometers [3]. Also the “nanoscratching ” allows to produce the modification only at 1 - 2 nanometers in the depth without observing changing in the tip shape [4]. We present {{results of the investigation}} of the simultaneous application of the <b>local</b> anodic <b>oxidation</b> and direct scratching to semiconductor surfaces by an AFM probe.

30|$|Due to its simplicity, flexibility, {{and high}} resolution, {{scanning}} probe microscope (SPM)-based techniques have been demonstrated to hold great potential in fabricating nanostructures [9 – 14]. Among various SPM-based techniques of silicon, <b>local</b> anodic <b>oxidation</b> [13] and friction-induced selective etching [14] have attracted much attention from researchers. However, <b>local</b> anodic <b>oxidation</b> process strongly relies on the experimental parameters such as voltage, humidity, tip dwell time, and gaseous ambient environment [15]. Compared to <b>local</b> anodic <b>oxidation</b> technique, the friction-induced selective etching method has a more straightforward process and a lower requirement to environment. Without any additional facility, patterns can be easily fabricated by directly scratching a diamond tip on silicon substrate along the target trace and post-etching [16]. In this method, an affected layer is formed on the scratched area. Due to its resistance to alkaline solution, the affected layer can serve as an etching mask (defined as tribo-mask) for fabricating protrusive structures [17, 18]. However, the etching selectivity of tribo-mask/Si(100) in KOH solution is low and uncontrollable [19]. When etching for a long time, the collapse may occur in {{the upper part of}} the structure [20]. Due to the restriction by the above factors, the maximum fabrication depth is generally less than 700  nm, which to some extent limits the application of the fabricated nanostructures [18]. To broaden the range of fabrication depth to micron scale, it is necessary to develop new fabrication methods with a high-quality mask. Since the etching selectivity of Si(100)/Si 3 N 4 in KOH solution is about 2, 600 : 1, the Si 3 N 4 mask may be a good candidate by virtue of its excellent resistance to chemical attack [21].|$|R
