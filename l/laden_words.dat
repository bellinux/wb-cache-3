40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse how Svenska Dagbladet and Hufvudstadsbladet framed Russia’s {{president}} Vladimir Putin during 2016 using framing theory. The study showed that the dominating overall frame was game framing in both publications. Putin, when mentioned, was often a side character. The descriptions of him were as a general rule free from value <b>laden</b> <b>words.</b> Nevertheless, they managed to frame him as dangerous and aggressive on a regular basis. This occurred much more frequently in Svenska Dagbladet than in Hufvudstadsbladet. Several other sub-frames were used to describe his person, but they appeared less frequently...|$|E
40|$|This article clarifies {{some of the}} paradoxes in Lope de Vega’s Arte nuevo de hacer comedias (1609) {{explaining}} them in {{the context}} of Lope’s literary career. In particular, we examine how Lope uses the heavily <b>laden</b> <b>words</b> ‘vulgo’ and ‘natural’ to obtain the benevolence of his audience, but also to use his success in the commercial theatres in a way coherent {{with the rest of his}} literary production. Specifically, the Isidro (1599) and the Rimas (1602, 1604, 1609) will provide useful analogies with the Arte nuevo’s rhetoric and logical construction, especially in relation to Lope’s ideas of imitation and literary creation. These ideas fill the words ‘vulgo’ and ‘natural’ with connotations that contribute greatly to understanding the Arte nuevo...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{investigate}} whether a brief induction of compassion meditation would affect memory for emotionally <b>laden</b> <b>words.</b> One group of participants listened to twenty-five minutes of compassion meditation instructions while another group listened {{for the same amount}} of time to relaxation music. Both groups were given a verbal learning test composed of words which were positive, neutral and negative in valence, and then asked to recall those words in a free-recall test. Results revealed that while the number of negative and neutral words recalled did not differ between the groups, the compassion meditation group tended to recall more positive words. This small effect was perhaps not due to an improved mood in the meditation group. Results are discussed in terms of the effects of compassion meditation on memory for emotional stimuli...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to {{investigate}} a specific area of cognitive functioning to determine if any differences exist between adult children of alcoholics and controls in the processing of emotionally <b>laden</b> <b>word</b> cues. Of secondary importance was the investigation of group differences in self-esteem, extroversion, neuroticism, and attentional control. A modified version of the Stroop Colour Naming Task was used to investigate selective processing of word cues in a sample of 37 adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs) and 37 adult children of non alcoholics (non ACOAs). All subjects were university students who volunteered for the study. The original form of this task required subjects to name the color of ink in which a word was printed while ignoring word content. Modified versions of this task substitute target words and control words for the words standardly used in order to investigate attentional bias for relevant word cues. As predicted, ACOAs were significantly slower than non ACOAs on this task. There was also a significant group x word type interaction. Compared to non ACOAs, ACOAs displayed a significant attentional bias in favor of alcohol and social threat words compared to neutral and positive words as evidenced by increased response times on the Stroop Task. There was also a significant main effect for word type with response time slowest for alcohol words and fastest for positive words. There were no significant group differences in self-esteem, extroversion, neuroticism, or attentional control. The results were discussed in terms of a generalized attentional deficit for the overall slower response time exhibited by the ACOA group. The more specialized Stroop effect of attentional bias for alcohol and social threat words was discussed in terms of the development of danger schemata based on previous life experiences perceived to be threatening...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of data {{suggests}} that the emotional dimension of a stimulus can be processed without conscious identification of the stimulus. The arousal system could be activated by unrecognised biologically significant stimuli through simple physical stimulus features related to threat, without any evaluation {{of the meaning of}} the stimulus. However, unconscious processing of emotionally <b>laden</b> <b>words</b> cannot rely only on perceptual features but must include some analysis of symbolic meaning. The first aim {{of the present study was}} to assess whether masked (unrecognised) aversive words can elicit enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs), a major autonomic index of emotional arousal, in normal participants. Our second aim was to determine whether any autonomic activation related to affective value of words is independent from access of this value to consciousness. Thus, the presentation duration of masked aversive and neutral words was determined, for each participant, in such a way that (1) identification was precluded, (2) valence discrimination was at chance, as indicated by performance in a forced-choice two-alternative task and by confidence ratings of the responses, and (3) emotional and neutral words were not detected differentially. SCRs were recorded during masked and unmasked presentations of both types of word. SCRs elicited by unmasked words, and also by masked words, were of greater magnitude when the words were emotional than when they were neutral. Consequently, in normal participants, autonomic activation can be a discriminative marker of the affective dimension of unrecognised verbal material in the absence of conscious valence identification...|$|E
40|$|Short-term sleep deprivation, or {{extended}} wakefulness, adversely affects {{cognitive functions}} and behavior. However, scarce research has addressed {{the effects of}} sleep deprivation (SD) on emotional processing. In this study, we investigated the impact of reduced vigilance due to moderate sleep deprivation {{on the ability to}} recognize emotional expressions of faces and emotional content of words. Participants remained awake for 24 h and performed the tasks in two sessions, one in which they were not affected by sleep loss (baseline; BSL), and other affected by SD, according to a counterbalanced sequence. Tasks were carried out twice at 10 : 00 and 4 : 00 am, or at 12 : 00 and 6 : 00 am. In both tasks, participants had to respond to the emotional valence of the target stimulus: negative, positive, or neutral. The results showed that in the word task, sleep deprivation impaired recognition irrespective of the emotional valence of words. However, sleep deprivation impaired recognition of emotional face expressions mainly when they showed a neutral expression. Emotional face expressions were less affected by the sleep loss, but positive faces were more resistant than negative faces to the detrimental effect of sleep deprivation. The differential effects of sleep deprivation on recognition of the different emotional stimuli are indicative of emotional facial expressions being stronger emotional stimuli than emotional <b>laden</b> <b>words.</b> This dissociation may be attributed to the more automatic sensory encoding of emotional facial content. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

25|$|Early on, he was courted by a Byzantium {{desperate to}} secure its eastern flank {{so as to}} direct its full {{strength}} against the Arabs; although Ashot avowed his loyalty to the empire, Byzantine leaders continued their long-standing demand that the Armenian Church make religious concessions to the Eastern Orthodox Church. A synod of Armenian church leaders was convoked and a letter <b>laden</b> with equivocal <b>wording</b> sent to Constantinople was able to sustain a temporary agreement between the two churches. In any case, religious differences mattered little to the Byzantines in consideration of the menace the Arabs continued to pose. In 884, the Caliph Al-Mu'tamid, reacting {{to the demands of}} Armenian princes and religious leaders and, more importantly, the security risks in allowing Armenia to fall under the Byzantine orbit, sent a crown to Ashot, recognizing him as king. This act was not lost on Basil who similarly sent a crown to Ashot. Ashot relocated his throne to the fortress-city of Bagaran and it was here where his coronation ceremony was held sometime in 884 or 885.|$|R
40|$|Although {{government}} {{regulation of the}} Internet has been decried as undercutting free speech, the control of Internet content through capitalist gateways???namely, profit-driven software companies???has gone largely uncriticized. The author argues that this discursive trend manufactures consent through a hegemonic force neglecting to confront the invasion of online advertising or marketing strategies directed at children. This study suggests that ???inappropriate content??? (that is, nudity, pornography, obscenities) constitutes a cultural currency through which concerns and responses to the Internet have been articulated within the mainstream. By examining the rhetorical and financial investments of the telecommunications business sector, the author contends that the rhetorical elements creating ???cyber-safety??? concerns within the mainstream attempt to reach the consent of parents and educators by asking them to see some Internet content as value <b>laden</b> (sexuality, trigger <b>words,</b> or adult content), while disguising the interests and authority of profitable computer software and hardware industries (advertising and marketing). Although most online ???safety measures??? neglect to confront the emerging invasion of advertising/marketing directed at children and youth, the author argues that media literacy in cyberspace demands such scrutiny. Unlike measures to block or filter online information, students need an empowerment approach that {{will enable them to}} analyze, evaluate, and judge the information they receive. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|For decades, emotion {{researchers}} have debated {{a series of}} {{issues related to the}} influence of emotionally laden information on the way in which people process and remember information. The present investigation was designed to experimentally test both general (Experiment 1 and 2) and person-specific (Experiment 3) influences of emotionally <b>laden</b> <b>words</b> on attention and memory using a digit-parity task in which participants were asked to make a speeded judgement about the parity of two digits flanking a to-be-ignored, centrally presented word. In Experiment 1, when a sexual, threat, school, or neutral word was presented between the digits, only the sexual words, rated high in arousal value by study participants, disrupted digit-parity performance producing longer digit-parity response times relative to all other word categories. Sexual words were also recalled more often by study participants in a surprise free recall task. Mirroring attention and memory results, an evaluation of skin conductance responses (SCRs) demonstrated that participants showed enhanced SCRs for the sexual words relative to all other word categories. Furthermore, when the sexual words were parsed into positive and negative word categories (Experiment 2), trials in which a sex-negative word was presented between the digits produced the longest digit-parity response times. Participants recalled more sex-negative words than any other word category. Importantly, participants’ taboo ratings predicted attention and memory results. Finally, when words relevant to participants’ fears were presented between the digits, digit-parity response times slowed relative to when a fear-irrelevant word was presented between the digits. Memory and skin conductance data provide converging evidence – participants recalled and produced larger skin conductance responses for fear-relevant words compared to fear irrelevant words...|$|E
40|$|In {{cognitive}} science, lexical decision task is used {{to investigate}} visual word recognition and lexical access. The {{issue of whether or}} not individuals who are depressed differ in their access to affectively <b>laden</b> <b>words</b> and specifically to words that have negative affect was examined. Based on some aspects of the Resource Allocation Model (Ellis), it was postulated that patients suffering from depression take more time to recognize items from an affective-loaded list. In order to compare their behavior in a lexical decision task, patients suffering from depression and healthy controls were studied. We hoped to find an interaction between the mood state of subjects and the categories (affective or neutral) of words. Two groups of right-handed adults served as subjects in our experiment. The first group consisted of 11 patients suffering from depression (mean age: 40. 2; sd: 6. 8). All of this group met the DSM-III-R and the Research Diagnostic Criteria for major depressive disorder. Severity of their disease was rated using the 24 -item Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale. All patients suffering from depression were without psychotropic medication. The control group was composed of 24 subjects (mean age: 32. 7; sd: 7. 9). A depressive word-list and a neutral word-list were built and a computer was used for the lexical-decision task. A longer reaction time to detect the non-word stimuli (F 1, 33 = 11. 19, p < 0. 01) was observed with the patients by comparison to the normal subjects. In the analysis of the word stimuli, a group by list interaction (F 1, 33 = 7. 18, p < 0. 01) was found. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} sentiments disseminated by traditional and social media {{and their impact}} on human societies including financial markets made the automatic detection and analysis of sentiments an important research area in academia and industry. In this thesis, techniques rooted in corpus linguistics and language for special purposes (LSP) have been used to develop a method for the automatic sentiment polarity analysis of financial news. Contrary to the existing practice in sentiment analysis where manual analysis is usually required to construct sentiment lexicons, the novelty introduced here is that the method can automatically extract a set of domain specific ke!W 0 rds and a set of polarity bearing words from training corpora comprising financial news across languages. The method requires only general news corpora for extracting keywords and historical market data time-series for extracting polar words. The method also automatically labels the extracted polar words as positive or negative and extracts the patterns in which these words are used. The language dependence of the use of polarity <b>laden</b> <b>words</b> was examined by looking at such patterns of usage in two typologically distinct languages: English and Arabic. Despite the cultural and linguistic differences, the patterns of words used in expressing sentiments have remarkable similarities. The method has been evaluated using two evaluation corpora comprising financial news in English and Arabic using a tri-partite strategy. First, human volunteers were asked to label the polarity of all the sentences in the evaluation corpora. Second, a widely used polarity lexicon, the General Inquirer, was used to automatically label the polarity ofthe same sentences. Third, LoLo, a system implementing the method, was used to label the polarity ofthe same sentences as well using automatically extracted polar words and patterns from training corpora. LoLo's results were closer to that of humans when analysing the full content of financial news items and when analysing only lead sentences, in both English and Arabic, than that ofthe General Inquirer based analysis.

60|$|I {{must confess}} {{that there is}} danger of this. To us the danger is very great. It cannot be good for us to send ships laden outside with iron shields instead of inside with soft goods and {{hardware}} to these thickly thronged American ports. It cannot be good {{for us to have}} to throw millions into these harbors instead of taking millions out from them. It cannot be good for us to export thousands upon thousands of soldiers to Canada of whom only hundreds would return. The whole turmoil, cost, and paraphernalia of such a course would be injurious to us in the extreme, and the loss of our commerce would be nearly ruinous. But the injury of such a war to us would be as nothing to the injury which it would inflict upon the States. To them for many years it would be absolutely ruinous. It would entail not only all those losses which such a war must bring with it, but that greater loss which would arise to the nation from the fact of its having been powerless to prevent it. Such a war would prove that it had lost the freedom for which it had struggled, and which for so many years it has enjoyed. For the sake of that people as well as for our own--and for their sakes rather than for our own-- let us, as far as may be, abstain from words which are needlessly injurious. They have done much that is great and noble, ever since this war has begun, and we have been slow to acknowledge it. They have made sacrifices for the sake of their country which we have ridiculed. They have struggled to maintain a good cause, and we have disbelieved in their earnestness. They have been anxious to abide by their Constitution, which to them has been as it were a second gospel, and we have spoken of that Constitution {{as though it had been}} a thing of mere words in which life had never existed. This has been done while their hands are very full and their back heavily <b>laden.</b> Such <b>words</b> coming from us, or from parties among us, cannot justify those threats of war which we hear spoken; but that they should make the hearts of men sore and their thoughts bitter against us, can hardly be matter of surprise.|$|R
40|$|Throughout Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad juxtaposes {{seemingly}} contradictory terms: {{light and}} dark, Europe and Africa, centrality and exteriority, morality and the immorality. In contrasting these various finite images, the author appears to mirror the “direct simplicity” in his word choice which he claims also punctuates {{the tales of}} seamen. However, by describing colonial endeavors using <b>words</b> <b>laden</b> with double and sometimes conflicting meanings, infusing the novel with repetition, and presenting characters alongside their doppelgangers, Conrad prompts readers to reconsider concrete standards {{of good and evil}} in regards to imperialism. Consequently, the text, refusing to elucidate Marlow‟s journey to the Congo, actually acts much like the haze of the moon, both illuminating and blurring the meaning of the tale. Arguably, the narrative structure also performs a similar function. Conrad deconstructs boundaries between the past and present and removes the distinction between missions of conquest and colonialism. Furthermore, the susceptibility of both the narrator and Marlow to human fallacy and the telling of lies make the structure of Heart of Darkness misleading. Thus, the author refuses to provide a consistent and reliable lens through which readers can interpret the plot. As the narrator states, following his description of the supposed simplicity within the tale, Marlow is not a typical representative of his profession. Here, by qualifying this simplicity with an exception, the narrator suggests the very essence of imperialism: complexity. By utilizing a seemingly simplistic narrative structure and turning it on itself, Conrad challenges the reader to look beyond obvious standards of black and white...|$|R
