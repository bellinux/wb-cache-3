40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design and develop a {{prototype}} for an AIDS Print Media Resource Directory which catalogs AIDS related print media produced and distributed by the various social service agencies of Monroe County, New York. The prototype directory centralizes AIDS print media into a single re source directory considering the following factors: user population, print specifications, agency producer, year produced, availability and location of producer. The project considers expansion of the directory to a state and national level. The directory, if published, would benefit the social service agencies of Monroe County as well as individuals in need of AIDS print media for the following reasons: 1) research efficiency and organization, 2) elimination of duplicated print media information and 3) education regarding AIDS. AIDS print media was collected from the social service agencies of Mon roe County, New York. Various design styles, of the print media collected, were selected such as posters, brochures, and newsletters. A code system was developed to catalog the print media pieces.

40|$|Motivation: Properly drawn {{biological}} {{networks are}} of great {{help in the}} comprehension of their characteristics. The quality of the layouts for retrieved biological networks is critical for pathway databases. However, since {{it is unrealistic to}} manually draw biological networks for every retrieval, automatic drawing algorithms are essential. <b>Grid</b> <b>layout</b> algorithms handle various biological properties such as aligning vertices having the same attributes and complicated posi-tional constraints according to their subcellular localizations; thus, they succeed in providing biologically comprehensible <b>layouts.</b> However, existing <b>grid</b> <b>layout</b> algorithms are not suitable for real-time drawing, which is one of requisites for applications to pathway databases, due to their high-computational cost. In addition, they do not consider edge directions and their resulting layouts lack traceability for biochemical reactions and gene regulations, which are the most important features in biological networks. Results: We devise a new calculation method termed sweep cal-culation and reduce the time complexity of the current <b>grid</b> <b>layout</b> algorithms through its encoding and decoding processes. We con-duct practical experiments by using 95 pathway models of various sizes from TRANSPATH and show that our new <b>grid</b> <b>layout</b> algorithm is much faster than existing <b>grid</b> <b>layout</b> algorithms.

Group {{technology}} (GT) and a facility layout problem share a common factor to optimize, which is the Intercell Flow or Material Handling Flow. Most group technology-based approaches use binary part-machine incidence matrix for cell formation. Impacts of flow volume analysis between machine pairs have not been analyzed {{in the design of}} cellular manufacturing systems. It is important to analyze the placement of machine cells for reduced material handling costs at the grouping stage itself. This paper develops a method to integrate GT philosophy with a facility layout problem using From–Between relationship chart as a tool. A new optimization technique with a from–to chart as the primary input, is used to determine the cell formation. A modified grouping efficiency measure is used to determine the efficiency of grouping. A genetic algorithm-based approach is used for machine cell placement within a layout matrix. Cells formed using the proposed approach show reduced intercell flows, high grouping efficiencies and reduced material handling costs when cells are placed in a <b>layout</b> <b>grid</b> compared to existing cell formation approaches.

40|$|AbstractMany of the {{existing}} unreinforced masonry buildings are seismically vulnerable and require retrofitting. In this experimental study, the cyclic behavior of six, one-half scale, perforated unreinforced brick walls, before and after retrofitting, using Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRPs), is investigated. The walls were built using one-half scale solid clay bricks and cement mortar to simulate the traditional walls built in Iran during the last 40 years of the 20 th century. These walls had a window opening at their center. One brick wall was unreinforced and considered a reference specimen. Three walls were directly upgraded after construction using GFRPs. The fifth wall was first strengthened and tested. Then, the seismically damaged specimen was retrofitted, using GFRPs, and tested again. Each specimen was retrofitted {{on the surface of}} two sides. All specimens were tested under constant gravity load and incrementally increasing in-plane loading cycles. During the test, each wall was allowed to displace in its own plane. The key parameter was the strengthening configuration including the cross <b>layout,</b> <b>grid</b> layout, and combined layout. Strengthening by means of GFRPs significantly improved the strength, deformation capacity, and energy absorption of the brick wall.

40|$|The use of {{microfluidic}} {{chips for}} applications in biology {{to reduce the}} cost, time, and difficulty of automating experiments, while promising, has proven to have barriers to entry. In particular, {{the cost of the}} equipment required for manufacturing techniques like soft lithography, the difficulty in designing functional microfluidic chips, and the time associated with manufacturing them have made rapid production for prototyping and iterative design difficult. Our lab’s microfluidics design flow is capable of automating much of the design process of microfluidic chips using the paradigm of defining them as primitives placed on a <b>layout</b> <b>grid</b> and exporting standard formats for use in fabrication. 3 DuF, a design tool that allows the user to carry out the placement and connection of primitives through a browser-based GUI, simplifies the design process to specifying the primitives through parameters and using a pointer to connect them with channels. But this approach assumes that the designer knows exactly what physical dimensions the primitives need for the chip to perform adequately for experiments, which may not be the case if sufficient literature or a fluid dynamics expertise are not present. By communicating with DAFD, our lab’s currently in-development database and model-fitting framework, 3 DuF will be able to define microfluidic primitives for placement on chip layouts not only through physical dimensions, but also by specific performance metrics desired of the primitives’ functions, which will result in automatically generated dimensions for those primitives. This will allow chip design through the simple paradigm of using a GUI to place primitives and connect them with channels, while also making a useful definition of those primitives for the designer’s needs less reliant on their fluid dynamics expertise...|$|E
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} of {{alternatives}} to optical lithography, block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) {{has emerged as a}} low-cost, high-throughput option. DSA uses small topographical templates to contain the block copolymer and create small clusters of holes useful for patterning vias [1]. However, issues of defectivity have hampered DSA's viability for large-scale patterning. Recent studies have shown polymer fill level to be a crucial factor in defectivity, as template overfill can result in malformed DSA structures [2]. The inherent density variations in via layouts, though, make regions of overfilled templates nearly inevitable, as templates in less dense regions will contain more polymer. For this reason, we develop a method to integrate sub-DSA resolution assist features (SDRAFs) into DSA template layouts. The SDRAFs divert excess polymer from the overfilled main templates but are themselves too small to form transferrable DSA patterns [2]. Thus, we can populate low-density regions with SDRAFs to make a layout more uniformly dense. To do this, we use SDRAFs with a set of lithography-based design rules dictating the minimum pitch and resist thickness between features (95 nm and 45 nm for 193 i, respectively). The SDRAF CD is also chosen to be as large as possible without forming a transferrable DSA pattern, setting it at 40 nm for an L 0 = 40 nm polymer and a PS wetting flow. With these rules, we set a flow for the assignment of each SDRAF according to the calculated density of templates in each block. We demonstrate the process on a 2. 5 x 2. 5 Î¼m section from V 23 (the via layer connecting metals 2 and 3) of a routed N 7 Cortex-M 0 processor scaled to a 24 nm via <b>layout</b> <b>grid.</b> We first overlay the template layout with a grid of SDRAFs spaced at 96 nm, allowing the SDRAFs to align with the via grid. We then remove the SDRAFs that violate the minimum resist or pitch rules and assess the density result. This is done by dividing the layout into blocks and calculating the percentage of area occupied by the main and assist templates in the blocks, using prior experimental data for template area [3]. The size of the blocks is set to the length over which the polymer reflows during the thermal anneal [4], assumed here to be about 500 nm. Finally, the SDRAF grid is shifted vertically and horizontally in increments of the via grid (24 nm) to achieve different density results, as each shift causes different SDRAFs to be in violation. We can then choose the shift that minimizes the density variation across the blocks as the final layout. In our test case, we found that the density range of the blocks changed from 2. 8 - 8. 6 % to 10. 9 - 12. 9 % post-SDRAF assignment. Here, the polymer film thickness can be adjusted to accommodate the higher overall density and the narrowed density range shows promise to reduce template overfill. Future work will incorporate methods of improving the layout's PV band to create an SDRAF design strategy that is more DSA- and lithography-friendly. [1] H. Yi et al., Adv. Mater 24, 23 (2012).

A typical search engine results page layout suffers from a hierarchical bias with higher fixations on the top and lower fixations on the bottom areas of interest (Granka et al., 2004; Joachims et al., 2005; Dumais et al., 2010; Curtell et al., 2007; Guan et al., 2007). This study compared the usability and eye movement data of participants searching a traditional SERP layout and two alternative <b>layouts,</b> <b>grid</b> and tabular. Results showed that while participants indicated a higher preference for the traditional layout, no differences in success, satisfaction, mental workload, or perceived difficulty were found across the 3 layouts for either informational or navigational tasks. Participants were found to look at the page more times and for longer when completing informational tasks compared to navigational tasks regardless of the layout presented to them. Participants looked at the top portion of the page more than the bottom when presented with the traditional or the tabular layout in both the task conditions. For the informational task condition, the top portion of the page was viewed for longer and for the navigational task condition, the bottom portion of the page was view for longer for both the traditional and the tabular layouts. When presented with the <b>grid</b> <b>layout,</b> participants were found to view the content vertically by column starting on the left column, then to the right: the left column was viewed more than the right column but the right column was viewed for longer than the left column regardless of the task condition. Moreover, it was found that participants fixated on the right column of the <b>grid</b> <b>layout</b> {{more than twice as much}} as they fixated on the bottom portion of the traditional layout. Compared to the bottom portion of the tabular layout, participants fixated 50 % more on the right column of the <b>grid</b> <b>layout.</b> This, along with its scroll-less interface, shows the advantage of the <b>grid</b> <b>layout</b> over both the traditional and the tabular layouts. In terms of layout preference, participants equally preferred the traditional and the <b>grid</b> <b>layout.</b> It was found that the tabular layout was the easiest for the participants to parse out what element of the search results they wanted to fixate to effectively complete the given task: this meant that participants could fixate on the title and the text snippet portion of the search result and ignore the URL portion while completing informational tasks and in the same manner participants could fixate on the URL and the title and ignore the text snippet more effectively than on the traditional or the <b>grid</b> <b>layouts</b> when completing navigational tasks. This shows the advantage of the tabular layout when the user is interested in a specific type of information.
