2500|$|Horseshoes are {{available}} {{in a wide variety}} of materials and styles, developed for different types of horse and for the work they do. The most common materials are steel and aluminium, but specialized shoes may include use of rubber, plastic, magnesium, titanium, or copper. Steel tends to be preferred in sports in which a strong, <b>long-wearing</b> shoe is needed, such as polo, eventing, show jumping, and western riding events. Aluminium shoes are lighter, making them common in horse racing, where a lighter shoe is desired; and often facilitate certain types of movement, and so are favored in the discipline of dressage. Some horseshoes have [...] "caulkins", [...] "caulks", or [...] "calks": protrusions at the toe or heels of the shoe, or both, to provide additional traction.|$|E
2500|$|Suits {{are made}} {{in a variety of}} fabrics, but most {{commonly}} from wool. The two main yarns produce worsteds (where the fibres are combed before spinning to produce a smooth, hard wearing cloth) and woollens (where they are not, thus remaining comparatively fluffy in texture). These can be woven {{in a number of ways}} producing flannel, tweed, gabardine, and fresco among others. These fabrics all have different weights and feel, and some fabrics have an S (or Super S) number describing the fineness of the fibres measured by average fibre diameter, e.g., Super 120; however, the finer the fabric, the more delicate and thus less likely to be <b>long-wearing</b> it will be. Although wool has traditionally been associated with warm, bulky clothing meant for warding off cold weather, advances in making finer and finer fibre have made wool suits acceptable for warmer weather, as fabrics have accordingly become lighter and more supple. Wool fabric is denominated by the weight of a one-square yard piece; thus, the heavier wools, suitable for winter only, are 12-14 oz.; the medium, [...] "three season" [...] (i.e., excluding summer) are 10-11 oz.; and summer wools are 7-8 oz. [...] (In the days before central heating, heavier wools such as 16 oz. were used in suits; now they are used mainly in overcoats and topcoats.) Other materials are used sometimes, either alone or blended with wool, such as cashmere. [...] Silk alone or blended with wool is sometimes used. Synthetic materials, while cheaper, e.g., polyester, are very rarely recommended by experts. At most, a blend of predominantly wool may be acceptable to obtain the main benefit of synthetics, namely resistance to wrinkling, particularly in garments used for travel; however, any synthetic, blended or otherwise, will always be warmer and clammier than wool alone. [...] For hot weather, linen is also used, and in (Southern) North America cotton seersucker is worn.|$|E
50|$|Mally Beauty is {{a makeup}} company founded by Mally Roncal, former makeup artist of many A-list celebrities. The makeup brand {{claims to be}} a <b>long-wearing</b> makeup line for the everyday, working woman. Since 2005, Mally Beauty has created a line of over 1,000 products, with the brand {{expanding}} to retailers, such as Ulta Beauty and QVC.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} the engine's sturdy design {{is the fact that}} no timing chain or timing belt (both of which can break, causing {{unwanted}} downtime or even engine damage) is used. This generation of Ford Six was designed with <b>long-wearing</b> gears for that purpose instead. Very few modern engines use timing gears; belts and chains are by far more common. Also these engines employed 7 main bearings.|$|E
5000|$|Double charge {{vitrified}} tiles are {{fed through}} a press that prints the pattern {{with a double}} layer of pigment, 3 to 4 mm thicker than other types of tile. This process does not permit complex patterns but results in a <b>long-wearing</b> tile surface, suitable for heavy traffic commercial projects. Design layer should not be more than 4mm thickness, which may weaken {{the strength of the}} tile.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to providing {{a wide range of}} engineering services, Geiger Engineers has been involved in developing new technologies. For example, in 2008 it was announced that the new Tensotherm composite fabric with Lumira aerogel (for insulation) would be used {{for the first time on}} the Dedmon Athletic Center’s new roof. “Working with Cabot and Geiger Engineers, we now have…a <b>long-wearing</b> insulated light transmissive fabric system that…meets performance standards and…provides higher energy-efficiency.” ...|$|E
50|$|Both tin {{and copper}} are {{relatively}} soft metals that will deform on striking (though tin {{to a lesser}} extent than copper), but alloying the two elements creates a metal which is harder and less ductile and also one with more elasticity than the use of just one of the metals alone. This metal combination produces a tough, <b>long-wearing</b> material that is resistant to oxidation and subject only to an initial surface weathering. Verdigris forms a protective patina on the surface of bells which coats it against further oxidation.Specifically, it is the combination of low internal damping and low internal sound velocity that makes bell metal specially suitable for resonant percussion instruments.|$|E

5000|$|The {{exterior}} of the building was clad in paving brick rejects. Walker & Weeks had used uniformly-colored paving brick on the Renkert Building, which it had designed shortly before beginning work on the W. Bingham Co. warehouse. Architect Harry Weeks recommended paving brick for the Bingham building because it was strong, <b>long-wearing,</b> and inexpensive. [...] "Seconds" [...] (bricks which were not uniform in color due to chemical differences, miscasting, or after {{spending too much time}} curing in the kiln) were recommended by Weeks because they created an aesthetically pleasing [...] "tapestry effect which might be assumed to have resulted from careful artistic design, rather than accident and economy." [...] Windows in the building all had steel sashes and wire mesh glass. The roofline was a simple concave cavetto cornice.|$|E
5000|$|Titanium carbide {{has proved}} to be {{possible}} to use combined with sintered polycrystalline diamond surface (PCD), a superhard ceramic which promises to provide an improved, strong, <b>long-wearing</b> material for artificial joints. PCD is formed from polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) through a process involving high pressures and temperatures. When compared with other ceramic materials such as cubic boron nitride, silicon nitride, and aluminum oxide, PCD shows many better characteristics, including a high level of hardness and a relatively low coefficient of friction. For the application of artificial joints it will likely be combined with certain metals and metal alloys like cobalt, chrome, titanium, vanadium, stainless steel, aluminum, nickel, hafnium, silicon, cobalt-chrome, tungsten, zirconium, etc. [...] This means that people with nickel allergy or sensitivities to other metals are at risk for complications due to the chemicals in the device.|$|E
5000|$|Anti-Friction (AF) {{coatings}} are [...] "lubricating paints" [...] {{consisting of}} fine particles of lubricating pigments, such as molydisulfide, PTFE or graphite, blended with a binder. After application and proper curing, these [...] "slippery" [...] or dry lubricants bond {{to the metal}} surface and form a dark gray solid film. Many dry film lubricants also contain special rust inhibitors which offer exceptional corrosion protection. Most <b>long-wearing</b> films are of the bonded type but are still restricted to applications where sliding distances are not too long. AF-coatings are applied where fretting and galling is a problem (such as splines, universal joints and keyed bearings), where operating pressures exceed the load-bearing capacities of ordinary oils and greases, where smooth running in is desired (piston, camshaft), where clean operation is desired (AF-coatings will not collect dirt and debris like greases and oils), and where parts may be stored {{for long periods of}} time.|$|E
5000|$|Functional bells, for the {{intention}} of producing sound, are usually made by casting bell metal, an alloy of bronze. Much experimentation with composition has existed throughout history; the bells of Henry II had nearly twice as much copper as tin, while much earlier Assyrian bronze bells had ten {{times the amount of}} copper to tin. The recognized best composition for bell metal though is a ratio of approximately 80 per cent copper and 20 per cent tin. Bell metal of these ratios has been used for more than 3,000 years, and is known for its resonance and [...] "attractive sound". Both tin and copper are relatively soft metals that will deform on striking. By alloying the two elements a harder and more rigid metal is created but also one with more elasticity than the use of one of the metals alone. This allows for a better bell resonance and causes the bell to [...] "vibrate like a spring when struck", a necessary quality as the clapper may strike the bell at speeds of up to 600 miles per hour. The forces holding the tin and copper together cause vibrations rather than cracks when the bell is struck which creates a resonant tone. This metal combination also results in a tough, <b>long-wearing</b> material that is resistant to oxidation and subject only to an initial surface weathering. Verdigris forms a protective patina {{on the surface of the}} bell which coats it against further oxidation.|$|E
