25|$|The four Druze {{villages in}} the Israeli-annexed portion of the Golan Heights have about 20,000 residents.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this unique status and of the complex {{political}} situation, in a city divided from 1948 to 1967 between Israel and Jordan, the Consul General had to cross Mandelbaum Gate on a daily basis to reach the new premises of the Consulate General situated in East Jerusalem - first in the French national domain of St Anne's church and later in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. The severance of diplomatic relations with Jordan from 1956 to 1962 made the situation yet more difficult to manage. King Hussein of Jordan questioned the status of French schools and religious congregations in Jordan, and the political and economic privileges to which they were entitled. He tried to end the duality of foreign diplomatic representation by removing <b>laissez-passer</b> for diplomatic missions.|$|E

60|$|So it was toward {{evening of}} the fourth day that the launch finally sighted the ship Arabella.

60|$|It {{had just}} come {{to him with a}} dismaying force that in the haste of his escape from Paris with the Vicomte he had {{forgotten}} to return to his lodging for a passport that he was fortunately possessed of. It was a <b>laissez-passer,</b> signed and left in blank, with which he had been equipped--against the possibility of the need for it arising--when he had started upon the Convention's errand to the Army of Dumouriez. Whilst on his way to Robespierre's house to secure the order of release, he had bethought him of filling in that passport for three persons, and thus, since to remain must entail his ruin and destruction, make his escape from France with Mademoiselle and the Vicomte. It was his only chance. Then in the hurry of the succeeding incidents, the excitement that had attended them, and the imperative need for haste in getting the Vicomte to Choisy, he had put the intended return to his lodging from his mind--overlooking until now the fact that not only must he go back for the valise which he had bidden Brutus pack, but also for that far more precious passport.|$|E

But [...] I am at my own lodging, and I have every hope that, either by [...] the use of my own wit, or else by the favour of my friend [...] Robespierre, I shall shortly be able to join you. I would [...] therefore ask you to wait a few days. But should I presently [...] send you word not to do so any longer, or should you hear of [...] events which will render it impossible for me to accompany you, [...] you can then set out with Ombreval, travelling under the guise [...] described in the passport, and informing any questioners that [...] the other person mentioned has been forced by ill health to [...] interrupt his journey. As I have said, I have every hope of [...] winning through my present difficulties; but should I fail to [...] do so, my most earnest prayer will be that you may make your [...] way out of France in safety, and that lasting happiness may be [...] your lot in whatever country you may elect to settle. You may [...] trust the bearer implicitly, patriotic though he may appear.|$|E
