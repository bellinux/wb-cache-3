25|$|Development {{of southeastern}} New Mexico {{in the late}} 19th century was fueled {{by the arrival of}} colonies of {{immigrants}} from England, Switzerland, France, and Italy. Located {{along the banks of the}} Pecos River, Carlsbad was originally christened the town of Eddy on September 15, 1888, and organized as a municipal corporation in 1893; the settlement bore the name of Charles B. Eddy, co-owner of the Eddy-Bissell <b>Livestock</b> <b>Company.</b> With the commercial development of local mineral springs near the flume for medicinal qualities, the town later voted to change its name to Carlsbad after the famous European spa Carlsbad, Bohemia (now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic). On March 25, 1918, the growing town surpassed a population of 2,000, allowing then-governor of New Mexico Washington Ellsworth Lindsey to proclaim Carlsbad a city.|$|E
25|$|While he {{was running}} for his second term in the senate, Thompson {{continued}} his trial work. This included a very important case, Bunting v. Oregon, that eventually was heard by the United States Supreme Court. In that case, Thompson's client was Frank Bunting, a sawmill employee, who was challenging Oregon's ten-hour workday law. Thompson presented Bunting's case to the Supreme Court in April 1916. Despite his arguments, the court ruled in favor of the State of Oregon. Another important case dealt with water rights in the Summer Lake valley and along the Chewaucan River near Paisley, Oregon. Thompson defended the water rights claim of the Chewaucan Land and <b>Livestock</b> <b>Company</b> against development companies and the settlers who bought land from those companies. Initially, the state water board ruled in favor of the developers. The cattle company appealed in state court, and the district judge, Bernard Daly, reversed the water board's decision. The developers then asked the legislature to overrule the district court, but Thompson successfully lobbied his former colleagues to prevent their intervention. This allowed the district court decision to stand.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, which {{pertains}} to the public stockyards market located at Omaha and the marketing of hogs produced in Nebraska is: first, to determine the supply area of this market {{in relationship to the}} production of hogs in this state; second, to determine the cost of transportation and marketing; third, to show the relationship of transportation and marketing costs to the price of hogs; fourth, to show the trend in transportation and terminal market costs and the volume of shipments by rail, commercial truck, and “other” or farmer owned truck. The data used in this study were obtained from the John Clay <b>Livestock</b> Commission <b>Company</b> and the Farmers Union <b>Livestock</b> Commission <b>Company</b> of South Omaha, Nebraska. The Information obtained from the John Clay <b>Livestock</b> Commission <b>Company</b> pertained to transactions occurring on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of each week for the years 1930 to 1935 inclusive. The Farmers Union <b>Livestock</b> Commission <b>Company</b> handles a larger volume of livestock and {{in order to reduce the}} size of the sample transactions occurring on Tuesday and Wednesday were recorded. Uniform charges are made for the services of the Union Stock Yards Company and the various <b>livestock</b> commission <b>companies</b> so there was no need to obtain a representative sample for each commission company for the purpose of making a comparison of services or costs. It was of greater importance to secure a sample representative of all sections of the supply area of this market. Records were obtained on 235, 547 head of hogs consigned from various counties in Nebraska to the Omaha Market. The number of sales was not determined but each record represented on consignment and included the following information: date, point of origin, number of head, total weight, total amount received, each item of expense, and the total expenses. In some instances supplementary information has been obtained from the U. S. Census, Nebraska Agricultural Statistics, and other publications. Although this study covers sales of livestock for every week for a six year period there are definite limitations to the uses that can be made of some of the data. No more than 3 per cent of the total movement of hogs from Nebraska to Omaha was included in the sample for any one year. A larger sample would provide better information on average weights and prices for counties contributing relatively few hogs to this market. Also, weights and prices vary over a wide range and a large number of records is required if reliable results are to be obtained. Advisor: L. F. Gare...|$|R
