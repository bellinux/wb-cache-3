The tangential, radial and longitudinal anisotropy directions of timber correspond respectively to the thickness, width and <b>length</b> <b>directions</b> of the leaf.

30|$|In the {{extrusion}} stable stage, {{the average}} grain sizes {{of the whole}} pipe are inhomogeneous. In the <b>length</b> <b>direction,</b> part A are the biggest and part B are the smallest, in the cross section, the middle part are smaller than the two sides. The main reason is the nonuniform deformations during the extrusion. In the <b>length</b> <b>direction,</b> the billet is under the constraint pressure and external friction from the die, the outer surface is under the additional shear deformation, therefore the materials flow out of the extrusion die in a nonuniform speed. Similarly, in the {{cross section of the}} pipe, the materials in outer and inner surface are under the shear deformation. Although the extrusion ram moves in a uniform velocity, but the flow speed of the materials during extrusion is nonuniform. In addition, another nonuniform factor is the temperature gradient of the billet during hot extrusion, and it is higher in the middle and lower in the two sides due to the heat exchanges with die and extrusion needle.|$|E

40|$|The {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} fully lamellar binary γ-TiAl alloys is extremely anisotropic {{with respect to}} the lamellar orientation. For the fully lamellar Ti- 46 Al- 0. 5 W- 0. 5 Si alloy, the existence of silicide clusters plays a critical role on the fracture behavior. In the present study, tensile test and three point bending test were performed at room temperature with the loading axis parallel and perpendicular to the lamellar orientation, respectively. To investigate the influence of silicide clusters on the initiation and propagation of cracks, the fracture surface and the cracks adjacent to the fracture zone of the specimens have been analyzed. Results show that the fracture process is related to the morphology and distribution of the silicide clusters. Crack preferentially initiates at and propagates along the interface of silicide and α 2 /γ lamellar with the loading axis perpendicular to the <b>length</b> <b>direction</b> of silicide. While the silicide can prevent the propagation of cracks from running across with the crack growth direction perpendicular to the <b>length</b> <b>direction</b> of silicide...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a micro-coordinate measuring machine (micro-CMM) for large-scale dimensional measurement of a micro-slit on a precision die coater {{by using a}} shear-mode micro-probe. A glass micro sphere with a nominal diameter of 52. 3 μm was attached {{on one end of}} a tapered glass capillary tube as a probe tip ball. The micro-slit width of a slot die coater with a nominal slit width of 85 μm was measured by the micro-CMM. The probe tip was placed in the slit for the measurement. The effective working length of the probe was confirmed experimentally to be at least 1 mm. In order to measure the gap width uniformity over the entire slot die length of 200 mm, an air-bearing linear slide with a travelling stroke of 300 mm was employed in the micro-CMM to position the probe along the <b>length</b> <b>direction</b> of the slot die.
