50|$|A new bridge {{having a}} 6 lane divided {{carriageway}} {{and length of}} 1837.35 m (30 m down stream) was constructed from 1987 to 1997 with several unique features in the construction and design with emphasis on durability and a formal QA/QC programme. Proof Consultants were appointed to oversee each aspect of planning, design and construction. Open foundations were taken into the bedrock with foundation concrete being laid in the dry, with the sea water being pumped out using submersible pumps. The piers in the intertidal zone were protected by epoxy coal tar paint painted on 6 mm thick m.s. plate which was considered as a <b>lost</b> <b>shuttering.</b> The superstructure was a P.S.C. box girder, one for each carriageway, constructed using balanced cantilever cast-in-situ segments. The new bridge (also the Vashi Bridge) has performed without any problems whatsoever. This bridge was constructed by U.P State Bridge Corporation Ltd. {{for which it was}} awarded the most outstanding concrete structure award.|$|E

5|$|L.F. Wade International Airport {{sustained}} some {{roof and}} runway lighting damage, and the Bermuda Weather Service building <b>lost</b> a storm <b>shutter</b> and saw water forced inside a communications room. A restaurant {{at the site}} of the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement. The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage to the safety walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs. However, one of two lanes remained shut down for several days. Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm, and other vessels tipped over in boatyards. According to preliminary estimates, properties in the Dockyard alone incurred US$1 million (2014 BMD) in damage.|$|R
