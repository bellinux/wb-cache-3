25|$|Nogueira faced Frank Mir in {{a rematch}} on December 10, 2011, at UFC 140. After close early exchanges {{and a lot}} of work against the cage, the two separated, and Nogueira rocked Mir with a hard {{overhand}} right, jab combo. After Mir fell to the ground, Nogueira continued with ground and pound before attempting a guillotine choke. Mir was {{able to get out of}} this and during a scramble, ended in side control and locked up a kimura. Nogueira managed to roll Mir, only to be reversed himself. Mir stepped his right <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> the face of Nogueira and cranked the kimura, causing Nogueira's right humerus to break, thus ending the fight at 3:38 of round 1.|$|E
25|$|When {{band members}} are marching in one {{direction}} but want to focus their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces {{in the direction of}} play. This is known as lateral marching, but is more commonly known as either shifting, traversing, or sliding. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a crab step when moving sideways. During a crab step, the musician crosses one <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.|$|E
25|$|As {{the second}} verse begins, the singer {{is seen in}} an African hut lying on the floor, {{surrounded}} by female dancers. She performs on the floor, in one moment managing to put her <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> her head, before standing up and again, performing a dance routine. The performers are seen to make {{the shape of an}} eye, with Rihanna in the centre as the pupil. In this scene she wears a black lace ensemble with a new wild curly hairstyle. This is followed with the singer lying in a large birds' nest and then goes back to the singer with her previous wild hairstyle, performing a complex dance routine with female dancers, this time with fluorescent green effects. The penultimate scene shows Rihanna in a long dress which lights up neon red, while the singer has sequins across her face. She then appears to channel Hindu god Shiva as multiple arms surround her body. In the final scene, Rihanna and her male background dancers seen previously, slowly descend back underwater into the swamp; Rihanna's head completely submerges below the water.|$|E

500|$|The {{vignette}} {{opening with}} the words [...] "We were in a garden at Mons" [...] is equally understated; the narrator writes, [...] "The first German I saw climbed up over the garden wall. We waited till he got one <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> then potted him. He... looked awfully surprised". The description repeats images, is dispassionate and warps logic, according to Strychacz.|$|E
500|$|... "Sorry" [...] was {{performed}} on the 2006 Confessions Tour as part of the bedouin themed segment. Madonna was dressed in a Jean-Paul Gaultier kaftan with pants and high heeled boots. As Madonna finished the performance of the song [...] "Isaac", she took off the kaftan and wore a jacket given to her by the dancers and greets them one by one. The Pet Shop Boys music for the song's remix start in the background. Madonna and her female dancers take to one side of a giant cage and start singing the song. As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her bending her body and putting her <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer's back.|$|E

60|$|Instead of {{applying}} the brake, however, young Welland, in the exuberance of his joy, threw his long <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> the handles, {{and went down}} the slope at railway speed, ready, as he remarked, for a jump if anything should go wrong.|$|R

50|$|This {{variation}} of the cloverleaf sees the wrestler, after crossing one of the opponents <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> {{the other in a}} figure four shape, lock the <b>over</b> <b>leg</b> behind their near knee before placing the straight leg under their armpit and turning over. The wrestler proceeds to lean back pulling on the leg under the armpit. This keeps the <b>over</b> <b>leg,</b> now under, locked while putting pressure on the leg and stretching the legs and back. This variation is also used by Tyler Breeze as the Figure Four Sharpshooter.|$|R

40|$|During the Deep Propagating Gravity Wave Experiment (DEEPWAVE) {{project in}} June and July 2014, the Gulfstream V {{research}} aircraft flew 97 <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> the Southern Alps of New Zealand and 150 <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean, {{mostly in the}} low stratosphere at 12. 1 -km altitude. Improved instrument calibration, redundant sensors, longer flight legs, energy flux estimation, and scale analysis revealed several new gravity wave properties. Over the sea, flight-level wave fluxes mostly fell below the detection threshold. Over terrain, disturbances had characteristic mountain wave attributes of positive vertical energy flux (EFz), negative zonal momentum flux, and upwind horizontal energy flux. In some cases, the fluxes changed rapidly within an 8 -h flight, even though environmental conditions were nearly unchanged...|$|R

Bucks rub-urinate more frequently during the breeding season.|$|R
