5|$|Some historians {{allege that}} Jinnah's courting {{the rulers of}} Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh are {{evidence}} of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation by religion, yet tried to gain the accession of Hindu-majority states. In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped for a plebiscite in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would <b>lose,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope the principle would be established for Kashmir. However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all the princely States where the ruler did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir), the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference {{to the will of}} the people', Jinnah rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|Born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Kirchner studied {{law at the}} National University of La Plata. He met {{and married}} Cristina Fernández at this time, {{returned}} with her to Río Gallegos at graduation, and opened a law firm. Commentators have criticized him {{for a lack of}} legal activism during the Dirty War, an issue he would involve himself in as president. Kirchner ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987 and for governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. He was reelected governor in 1995 and 1999 due to an amendment of the provincial constitution. Kirchner sided with Buenos Aires provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde against President Carlos Menem. Although Duhalde lost the 1999 presidential election, he was appointed president by the Congress when previous presidents Fernando de la Rúa and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned during the December 2001 riots. Duhalde suggested that Kirchner run for president in 2003 in a bid to prevent Menem's return to the presidency. Menem won a plurality {{in the first round of}} the presidential election but, fearing that he would <b>lose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> required runoff election, he resigned; Kirchner became president as a result.|$|E
