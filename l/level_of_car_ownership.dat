40|$|The {{story of}} {{transport}} and accessibility problems in rural Australia {{is very similar}} to other wealthy countries with low rural densities and long distances such as the US and Canada &# 150; little or no public transport, very high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> and poor service provision. During the past two decades rationalisation and privatisation of services has led to the closure of many basic services in rural Australia. The withdrawal of services has necessitated longer distance travel for many rural residents &# 150; a problem which has been exacerbated by the rationalisation of public transport services. As a result there have emerged severe accessibility and mobility problems in rural areas, despite the presence <b>of</b> high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> in such areas. In terms of rural transportation, the situation in Australia is characterised by two different features; first, poor public transport provision (or non-existence). Second; high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> among rural residents. However, high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> do not reflect high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> prosperity; this is likely to indicate a situation of 'enforced ownership' in response to declining <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> public transport provision. Furthermore, many rural residents neither own a car nor have access to a reliable public transport system due to socio-economic and location-based circumstances. Previous research has shown that these residents generally belong to groups who include the elderly, teenagers, students, Indigenous residents, unemployed persons and low-income households. Such groups have been termed transport-disadvantaged. The contention of this thesis, however, is that such groups {{are in a state of}} transport need given their range of transport related problems. This is one dimension of the accessibility problem in rural Australia, which has yet to be investigated. This thesis is concerned with the measurement of transport need through the development of several transport need indices using available census data. The key objective of this thesis is to investigate the relevance and suitability of need indices for identifying the relative spatial distribution of transport needs in rural areas. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is used for the development, analysis and visualisation of the transport need index. This thesis examines transportation needs in rural NSW simply by measuring 'demand' and 'supply' components of transport. To measure the demand index, some socio-economic characteristics of population are involved including: the elderly, no or low car owning households, Indigenous people, students, children, unemployed persons, low-income households, and accessibility. A weight has been assigned to each component based on its relative importance among the other components. Weighted values are then standardised based on 100. To measure the supply index, six components, which represent the availability of various kinds of transport in rural NSW are involved and have been calculated by assigning weights and standardising to 100. These are: CountryLink rail services, CountryLink coach and bus services, Regional Services, Community Transport Program, Wheelchair taxi services, and School Buses. The final transport need for rural NSW is calculated by dividing demand index by supply index. It simply quantifies transportation needs across the rural Statistical Local Areas (SLAs) of NSW. In addition, this thesis discusses the potential and limitations of GIS and our transport need indices to be used as input to decisions about improvements in provision of services, and coordination of existing services to better meet identified needs, for the transport disadvantaged in rural NSW. In essence, this thesis is an attempt to make Australian transport and social services planners aware of the value of a need based transport-planning methodology...|$|R

40|$|With {{the use of}} 1971 journey-to-work {{census data}} for London, thespatial {{distributions}} of home and workplace locations at different distances from the city centre were analysed for the main modes of transport. The relationships among the fundamental quantities such as density, trip length, modal split, and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> were also investigated. These analyses were {{compared with those of}} corresponding 1966 data. The comparisons show that although the home density in 1971 within the first 2 km from the city centre decreased by approximately 21 %, while the workplace density decreased only by approximately 4 %, the actual number of workplaces within this range of distance fell by about 2. 5 times that of the homes. The overall decrease in homes and workplaces resulted in a 9 % drop in the total number of internal trips for London as a whole. Resolving these trips by modes of transport shows that rail, bus, and walk trips had decreased while car trips had increased. As a result, the most common mode of transport to work switched from bus in 1966 to car in 1971. This also contributed to the overall increase in the average trip length in 1971. The analysis on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> for 1971 shows that more than 50 % of the households located more than 12 km from the city centre had at least one car.

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{a geographical}} {{analysis of the}} role of unconventional public transport in selected rural areas of Scotland, with special reference to the Highland and the Borders Regions. The terra "unconventional public transport" has been defined, for the purpose of the thesis, as including all forms of public passenger transport other than regular conventional bus, rail and ferry services. The terra, in this context, applies to the use of smaller vehicles whose operation is wholly or partially financed or supported by the Local Authority. The forms of unconventional public transport investigated include Postbus Services, Community Bus Services, Voluntary Social Car Schemes, Dial-a-Ride, Courier Services and the use of school vehicles by fare paying passengers. A geographical analysis of the distribution of these supported schemes and their role is undertaken with special reference to the Highland and Borders Regions but set within the context of Rural Scotland and the network of conventional bus and rail services. These two regions of mainland Scotland are characterised by low population densities, a spatially dispersed settlement pattern and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> where the opportunities for the development of unconventional modes are considerable. The advantages of innovatory public transport in the Highland and Borders Regions have been demonstrated to be as a supplementary service, in many cases as an emergency service, as a lower cost alternative to tendered conventional bus services, as a more flexible and convenient service and in areas with relatively high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> as a standby facility when the family car is not available. The effects of the Transport Act 1985 are also considered but found to be of relatively little significance in influencing the number and distribution of unconventional modes despite the availability of new forms of finance from Central Government. Future prospects for unconventional public transport seem to be good especially in the field of development of the use of school transport by fare paying passengers and of courier-type services...|$|R

40|$|As {{environmental}} concerns mount alongside increasing auto dependence, {{research has been}} devoted to understanding the number of automobiles households own. The 2000 US census public use micro sample is used to demonstrate the importance of preference formation in auto ownership by studying auto ownership among recent movers. Using a multinomial probit model, the paper demonstrates that residents in the US transit cities who moved from major metropolitan areas are more likely to own fewer vehicles than counterparts who moved from smaller metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan areas. It is concluded that these results are due to learned preferences for <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership.</b> Once the self-reinforcing 'cultural knowledge' <b>of</b> living without <b>cars</b> is lost, it could be difficult to regain. A focus on children and young adults, familiarising them with alternatives to the car may be an important approach to developing collective preferences for fewer cars. ...|$|R
