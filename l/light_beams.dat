5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of <b>light</b> <b>beams.</b> Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties of the shadow produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing is an e cient {{rendering}} algorithm for simulating caustics, {{the envelopes}} {{of light that}} are scattered from shiny curved surfaces and focussed into lines or spots of concentrated <b>light.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing is e cient for rendering caustics because the algorithm is able to exploit the coherency of the transport paths within an envelope of <b>light.</b> However, <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing rendering algorithms {{found in the literature}} only support mirror-like specular surface interactions. Therefore, there is motive for extending <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing to include more realistic roughened specular and other glossy surfaces while maintaining the e ciency of the rendering algorithm. This thesis rst o ers a conjecture on how to extend <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing to include glossy surface interactions. The glossy bidirectional re ectance distribution function (BRDF) that is required to support the conjecture is then derived and shown to be physically plausible. Following from the conjecture a new extension to <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing that allows glossy surface interactions for more realistic rendering of caustics is formulated. Gauss' divergence theorem is used to replace the irradiance surface integral of the lighting equation with a more e cient boundary line integral. This solution is also shown to be reusable for all-frequency interactions although more work is required to complete the derivations. Finally, multi-bounce glossy <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing is demonstrated which further extends the application domain of glossy <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> tracing. The new rendering algorithm is shown to be a good alternative for rendering single-bounce and multi-bounce caustics due to specular as well as glossy surfaces. The expectation is that the irradiance solution would also in future be useful for more general applications.
