Some have reported apparent associations with adiposity in childhood or early adulthood, but whether these associations are independent of recent adiposity is unknown. Birth weight, body size at age 10 years, clothes size at age 20 years, and recent body mass index (BMI) were recorded in 745, 273 UK women, mean age 60. 1 (SD 4. 9) at baseline, without prior cancer.

Using Cox regression, {{a higher risk of}} <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancy</b> was strongly associated with higher recent BMI (RR= 1. 33, 95 %CI 1. 17 - 1. 51, for BMI 35 + vs < 22. 5 kg/m(2)), and this association remained essentially unchanged after adjustment for birth weight and body size at 10. Higher <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancy</b> risk was also associated with large size at birth, at age 10, and at age 20 years, but after adjustment for recent BMI, the significance of the associations with large size at birth and at age 10 years was sufficiently reduced that residual confounding by adult BMI could not be excluded; a weak association with large size at 20 years remained (adjusted RR = 1. 17, 95 %CI 1. 10 - 1. 24 for large size at age 20 vs. medium or small size).

To better under-stand environmental contributions, we examined incidence patterns of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> among populations characterized by ethnicity, birthplace, and residential neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnic enclave status. Methods:We obtained data about all Asian patients diagnosed with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> between 1988 and 2004 from the California Cancer Registry and neighborhood characteristics from U.

Results: Although incidence rates of most <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> were lower among Asian than white populations, only follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), and nodular sclerosis (NS) HL rates were statistically significantly lower among foreign-born than U.

With this background {{this study was designed}} thus including all the <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> both NHL and HD. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted at a tertiary centre in Uttarakhand and included a total of 116 cases of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies.</b> Of these 41 cases were of Hodgkin disease and 75 cases were of NHL. These cases were initially diagnosed on morphology employing Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and special stains like Reticulin. Subsequently, a preliminary panel of monoclonal antibodies using CD 3, CD 15, CD 20, CD 30, and CD 45 were employed. All the cases were then classified using WHO classification. Results: HD- Of the 41 cases of Hodgkin’s disease the commonest subtype was Nodular Sclerosis seen in 26 cases (48. 78 %). Reed Sternberg in reactive milieu is diagnostic of Hodgkin disease. In all cases except one Reed Sternberg cells exhibited positivity for both CD 15 and CD 30. NHL – Of the 75 cases of NHL an initial classification based on morphology was done.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{suggested}} an association between exposure to solar UV radiation and the incidence of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies,</b> which has increased substantially worldwide {{during the last two}} decades. Findings from animal studies have raised the question of whether UV radiation might influence the development of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> by means of its immunosuppressive effect. In this study, we examined the effect of UV irradiation on the development of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> in mice with no or only one functional copy of p 53. Mice that lack both copies of p 53 spontaneously develop high frequency of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> in the thymus and spleen. p 53 heterozygous mice with only one copy of the wild-type allele also develop <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies,</b> but with a much lower frequency and a long latent period. In our study using mice of the C 57 BL/ 6 background, only one of the unirradiated mice lacking one copy of p 53 (p 53 +/−) spontaneously developed a lymphoid tumor (6 %), whereas 88 % of UV-irradiated p 53 +/− mice developed lymphoid tumors in the spleen or liver. None of the control or UV-irradiated p 53 wild-type mice developed lymphoid tumors during the 60 -week observation period. Both UV-irradiated and unirradiated mice lacking both copies of p 53 (p 53 −/−) rapidly developed thymic lymphomas and/or lymphoid tumors in spleen or liver. All of the lymphoid tumors tested were of T cell type. The immune responses of the mice to contact sensitization were identical and were suppressed to the same extent by UV irradiation regardless of the genotype. These results indicate that differences in immune reactivity do not account for the different effects of UV radiation on <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> and, in addition, that p 53 is not required for generation of T cell-mediated immunity. Interestingly, whereas p 53 mutations or loss of heterozygosity did not account for the accelerated development of lymphoid tumors in UV-irradiated p 53 +/− mice, deletions in the p 16 INK 4 a gene were quite common. These data provide the experimental evidence that UV irradiation induces lymphoid neoplasms in genetically susceptible mice and support the hypothesis that extensive sunlight exposure contributes to the induction of lymphoma in humans...|$|R

This study aims to determine the prevalence of HTLV among patients with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> at a tertiary center in Lagos. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at the hematology clinic of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. After obtaining consent, approximately 5 mL of venous blood was collected from each subject. The serum was separated and stored at – 20 °C. Sera were assayed for HTLV by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the determination of antibodies to HTLV- 1 and - 2. Western blot confirmatory testing was done on reactive samples. All patients were also screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) by rapid kits. Results: A total of 39 patients with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> were enrolled, consisting of 24 (61. 5 %) with solid malignancies, while 15 (38. 5 %) had leukemia. Only two patients (5. 1 %) with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancies</b> were reactive on the ELISA test.

40|$|The TNF member LIGHT {{also known}} as TL 4 or TNFSF 14) can {{play a major role}} in cancer control via its two {{receptor}}s; it induces tumor cell death through lymphotoxin-P receptor (LT-beta R) and ligation to the herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) amplifies the immune response. By studying the effect of LIGHT in the transcriptional profile of a <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancy,</b> we found that HVEM, but not LT-beta R, stimulation induces a significant increase in the expression of chemokine genes such as IL- 8, and an unexpected upregulation of apoptotic genes. This had functional consequences, since LIGHT, or HVEM mAb, thus far known to costimulate T- and B-cell activation, induced chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell death. Many of the mediators involved were identified here, with an apoptotic pathway as demonstrated by caspases activation, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, but also a role of TRAIL. Moreover, HVEM induced endogenous TNF-alpha production and TNF-alpha enhanced HVEM-mediated cell death. HVEM function was mainly dependent on LIGHT, since other ligands like HSV-glycoprotein D and B and T lymphocyte attenuator were essentially ineffective. in conclusion, we describe a novel, as yet unknown killing effect of LIGHT through HVEM on a <b>lymphoid</b> <b>malignancy,</b> and combined with induction of chemokine release this may represent an additional tool to boost cancer immunotherap...|$|E
