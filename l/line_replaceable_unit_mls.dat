Higher levels of reasoning and data exploitation at each point offer continued assessment, improvement, and evolution of the system...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance {{intervention}} {{is necessary for}} the equipment, such as aircraft structures and systems, to maintain their operational performance status during their lifetime. Generally maintenance costs make a significant contribution to overall operating costs. Accordingly, developing an optimal maintenance strategy to minimize maintenance costs and total lifetime operating cost (TLOC) is a critical task. This article proposes a methodology for the optimization of a reliability-centred maintenance strategy based on maintenance-free operating period (MFOP) philosophy by considering the TLOC. The method can be used to evaluate the TLOC of alternative maintenance strategies and determine the optimal maintenance interval while meeting the proposed reliability requirements. The method is also suitable for evaluating and optimizing the MFOP-based reliability design of the products. An example based on <b>line</b> <b>replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> replacement strategy is introduced to illustrate the proposed maintenance strategy optimization approach. And a sensitivity analysis on the TLOC index for each of the two reliability requirement parameters is also performed...|$|R
40|$|Incipient fault {{detection}} in the Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU) can prompt early preparedness for replacement of <b>Line</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Units</b> (LRUs) {{thereby reducing the}} downtime of the aircraft. This paper describes a novel incipient {{fault detection}} and fault localization method of TRU {{in the context of}} an aircraft electrical system. Results from Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) study identified diode failure as the primary reason for failure of TRU. The incipient fault detection of TRU is done by applying data fusion algorithm. The algorithm uses Hilbert transform as one of the computing tools to derive Health Index Parameter (HIP). Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and wavelet transforms were used for fault localization of the component within the TRU. The developed incipient fault detection method is validated on a TRU test rig. Though the test rig is configured on 50 Hz supply the results can be read across on 400 Hz supply.

40|$|Maintenance {{decisions}} concerning {{repair of}} the <b>Line</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Unit</b> (LRU) of an aircraft fleet {{need to be}} considered carefully while deciding the phasing out of the fleet. This is important for achieving higher degree of cost effectiveness and fleet availability at desired level. Discard rate and phasing out period for an aircraft fleet are the critical parameters for determining optimum time to stop the maintenance of LRU. The economic value of remaining useful life of an aircraft fleet should be taken into consideration by salvaging the LRU {{at the end of the}} phasing out. The paper suggests a methodology to arrive the time that will minimize the total life cycle cost and provide us economic basis to withdraw the maintenance resources. A mathematical model has been developed for the discard rate of aircrafts based on failure rate, mission life and remaining useful life of the aircrafts in the fleet. This will assist in fulfilling the managing demand of LRU while phasing out of the aircraft fleet.
