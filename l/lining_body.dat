40|$|The proliferative {{behavior}} of the mesothelial cells <b>lining</b> <b>body</b> cavities of mice {{and some of the}} organs therein was investigated by radioautography of monolayer preparations following pulse labeling or continuous infusion of 3 H- thymidine. After pulse labeling, mesothelial cells from the seross lining gastrointestinal tract and spleen had higher labelling indices (0. 59 % ± 0. 16 % - 2. 98 % ± 0. 50 %), than those of the cavity walls (0. 10 ± 0. 09 - 0. 26 % ± 0. 07 %) and of liver and kidney (0. 30 ± 0. 03 % - 0. 46 % ± ± 0. 24 %.). After continuous infusion the labeling index increased with duration of infusion. Turnover rates calculated from regression equation for each region of the gastrointestinal tract were very low, ranging from 0. 05 % per day for the ileal serosa to 0. 31 % per day for the colon. Hence, mesothelial cell populations should be considered like the populations of internal organs which show low proliferative activity in adults (so called "expanding" populations). However, mesothelial cells are readily induced to divide by a variety of stimuli...|$|E

Fibroblasts can also migrate slowly over substratum as individual cells, again in contrast to {{epithelial cells}}.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{results of}} a 10 -year multi-selection {{experiment}} with White Leghorn and Fayoumi chickens are reported. The study includes 5 single-trait Leghorn lines, 3 single-trait Fayoumi lines and 2 two-trait Leghorn lines. The traits selected were high egg rate (2 <b>lines),</b> <b>body</b> size (2 up lines, 1 down line), egg size (2 up lines, 1 down <b>line),</b> high <b>body</b> weight—low egg weight (one <b>line)</b> and low <b>body</b> weight—high egg weight (one line). All lines were maintained by 8 sire matings except the high egg-rate lines maintained by 16 sires. Selection responses were measured as deviations from the Cornell Randombred Control. Even though full-sib and half-sib matings were avoided, inbreeding increased 1. 6 to 1. 9 % per generation in the 16 -sire lines and from 1. 6 to 2. 3 % in the 8 -sire lines. On the average, body weight declined 20 g, egg weight 0. 6 g. and rate of egg production 2. 3 % for each 10 % increase in inbreeding. Average selection differentials in each line were from 2 / 3 to one standard deviation per generation, and the response to divergent selection for body weight and egg weight was asymmetrical. Likewise, the correlated responses to selection were asymmetrical. The effective population numbers per line were large enough to give good realized heritability estimates except for the egg rate lines. The realized heritabilities were (1) for egg rate, 0. 07 ± 0. 0...|$|R
