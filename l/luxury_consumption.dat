Despite the global economic crisis in 2009, {{the growth rate of}} luxury market in China remains impressive. Chinese consumers, especially the Generation Y, have become the major contributor of such dynamic growth in luxury market. Without doubt, increasing consumers are engaging in the purchase of luxury products; however, {{little is known about the}} motivation behind their consumptions. This dissertation attempts to investigate the motivations of Generation Y and senior consumer toward <b>luxury</b> <b>consumptions,</b> in regarding to their changing attitudes, perceptions and intentions that affected by internal and external factors, in order to discover the reasons behind the purchase. Aggressive GDP growth in China has transferred into high purchase power and thus lead the country irrefutably become the most attractive market for global luxury brands. Culture factors such as individualism and collectivism are influential for consumers’ motivations from different aspects. Specifically, this study is designed to examine the effects of those drivers toward luxury purchase intentions. This study has conducted semi-structure interviews with 8 Generation Y and 5 seniors to identify and corroborate the motivating factors behind their <b>luxury</b> <b>consumptions.</b> The motivation between Generation Y and senior consumers are differ in the extent of their culture, values, and other factors, which will be addressed in this study...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{research into the}} global phenomenon of <b>luxury</b> brand <b>consumption,</b> but relatively few studies have empirically explored key relationships influencing purchase intention. This research aims to consider the respective roles of social context, individual perception, and vanity, and to set these relationships within a broader theoretical context {{of the literature on}} possession and consumer identity. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical study consisted of a large-scale survey conducted among Chinese luxury brand consumers in Taiwan. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression. Findings – The findings support the influence of the social context on purchase intention for luxury brands. There was weaker support for the role of perception. The experiential and functional aspects of luxury brand purchase were positively correlated with purchase intention, but symbolic value was not. Physical and achievement vanity had a positive impact on purchase intention while only achievement vanity had a moderating effect on perception. Practical implications – This study offers new empirical support for the proposition that vanity has a role in luxury brand purchase intention and thereby shades both theoretical and managerial understanding of <b>luxury</b> brand <b>consumption.</b> It also suggests that symbolic value, which is highly influential in western conceptualizations of luxury brand meaning, needs to be re-evaluated in the context of Chinese consumers. Originality/value – This study offers new empirical findings which contribute to a re-conceptualization of the antecedents of purchase intention in the area of <b>luxury</b> brand <b>consumption.</b> In particular, the study provides evidence of the roles of social context, perception and vanity in a Chinese consumption context to inform the primarily western models of luxury brand purchase intention...|$|R

50|$|Baran and Sweezy {{highlighted}} five {{aspects of}} the surplus absorption problem. First, that capitalist class <b>luxury</b> <b>consumption</b> could not rise {{as fast as the}} available surplus and monopoly conditions limited outlets for productive investment. Second, spending on the sales effort was an important outlet for surplus as large firms engaged in non-price forms of competition and sought to enlarge demand. However, such marketing expenditures (advertising, sales promotion, excessive model changes, etc.) do not provide any additional use-value and therefore may be treated as waste. Third, capitalist opposition to civilian spending as a threat to their class interests and class power limited the ability of such spending to provide effective demand. Fourth, military spending does not compete with capitalist interests {{in the same way as}} civilian spending and through imperialism serves to enhance those interests. Therefore, military spending is able to expand to a degree civilian spending is not, providing an important outlet for surplus absorption. Fifth, spending on finance can serve to absorb a portion of the surplus and boost the economy, at the expense of greater debt expansion and long-term instability.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to examine}} diners’ <b>luxury</b> {{restaurant}} <b>consumption</b> behavior by incorporating diner expectations into a modified Mehrabian–Russell model. Consumers dine at luxury restaurants for reasons beyond fulfilling basic needs. However, {{little is known about}} the factors that contribute to diners’ emotions and loyalty toward luxury restaurants. Design/methodology/approach: To examine the proposed six hypotheses, qualitative and quantitative studies were performed. Following exploratory qualitative research, 310 consumers who dined at Taiwan’s five-star hotel restaurants were recruited for the main study. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that restaurants’ stimuli influence diners’ positive and negative emotions (organisms), which, in turn, affect their loyalty toward luxury restaurants (responses). Furthermore, customers with different levels of expectation react differently to stimuli. Practical implications: This study offers new empirical support for the proposition that diner expectation plays a role in building customer loyalty and, thereby, shades both theoretical and managerial understanding of the <b>luxury</b> restaurant <b>consumption</b> process.

50|$|The {{consumer}} society {{emerged in}} the late seventeenth century and intensified throughout the eighteenth century. While some claim that change was propelled by the growing middle-class who embraced new ideas about <b>luxury</b> <b>consumption</b> and the growing importance of fashion as an arbiter for purchasing rather than necessity, many critics argue that consumerism was a political and economic necessity for the reproduction of capitalist competition for markets and profits, while others point to the increasing political strength of international working class organizations during a rapid increase in technological productivity and decline in necessary scarcity as a catalyst to develop a consumer culture based on therapeutic entertainments, home ownership and debt. The more positive, middle-class view argues that this revolution encompassed the growth in construction of vast country estates specifically designed to cater for comfort and the increased availability of luxury goods aimed at a growing market. This included sugar, tobacco, tea and coffee; these were increasingly grown on vast plantations (historically by slave labor) in the Caribbean as demand steadily rose.

50|$|Baran placed surplus {{extraction}} {{and capital}} accumulation {{at the center}} of his analysis. Development depends on a population's producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation - the purchase of new means of production - if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like <b>luxury</b> <b>consumption</b> does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in colonial times, most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items -automobiles, clothes, etc. - and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special tariff protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign shareholders as profit; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.|$|E

Furthermore, food quality can directly influence diners’ loyalty toward the restaurant. Third, diners’ product knowledge can moderate the relationships between restaurant stimuli and diners’ emotion.
