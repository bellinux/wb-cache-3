5|$|Many fans {{speculated that}} Hester’s speed and prior {{experience}} as a wide receiver would earn him {{a spot on the}} Bears' offense, similar to teammate Rashied Davis. While <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> dismissed the speculation, he played Hester as a wide receiver for one play against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 {{winning season}} would be {{followed}} by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith.</b> After starting the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North, Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him {{for a majority of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2012, nine-year {{head coach}} <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> was fired. After Smith's firing, the Bears {{requested}} interviews with thirteen coaches, twelve from the NFL and Montreal Alouettes (of the Canadian Football League) head coach Marc Trestman. The hunt later narrowed down to Trestman, Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and Indianapolis Colts offensive coordinator Bruce Arians. Ultimately, Trestman was hired on January 15.|$|E
50|$|He joined <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> {{staff at}} Tampa Bay for the 2014 season.|$|R
5000|$|On December 31, 2012, NFL.com {{reported}} that Armstrong {{was expected to}} be interviewed by the Chicago Bears for the head coaching position after <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> firing. He also met with the Philadelphia Eagles about possibly replacing Andy Reid.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> {{return to}} Chicago {{ended with a}} Tampa Bay loss. The Buccaneers blew a 10-0 halftime lead with three {{turnovers}} in the third quarter. The Bears scored two touchdowns off of turnovers, {{and a total of}} 21 points in the third quarter to take the lead and the win.|$|R
5|$|Hester {{missed the}} third {{game of the}} season after tearing {{cartilage}} in his ribs during the previous week. He returned to the field in the team's Week 4 contest against the Philadelphia Eagles, where he caught his first touchdown of the season. <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> gave Hester his first starting job as a wide receiver the next week, in place of the injured Brandon Lloyd. Hester went on to catch five passes for 66 yards and one touchdown. In the following week, Hester totaled 87 yards on six receptions.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after losing}} Super Bowl XLI, Hester and special teams coach Dave Toub spent a {{significant}} amount of time working on new return strategies and formations. Ultimately, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> converted Hester into a wide receiver in order {{to increase the number of}} opportunities he would receive during a game. Hester, who originally played as a wide receiver at the University of Miami, was initially hesitant about making the switch to offense, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of Deion Sanders. However, the Bears’ coaching staff eventually persuaded Hester to make the transition over the summer. During the 2007 off-season, Hester won the Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award.|$|E
5|$|This game {{featured}} {{two teams}} ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts. The Colts, who {{finished with a}} 12–4 regular season record, were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team's tenure in Baltimore; they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Meanwhile, the Bears, who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record, were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. In addition, the Bears' <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> and the Colts' Tony Dungy both became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl, with Dungy the first to win.|$|E
50|$|The St. Louis Rams drafted Archuleta as the 20th overall {{selection}} in the 2001 NFL Draft. He {{spent his first}} five years in St. Louis, where he excelled in <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> Cover 2 base defense. He signed a five-year $7 million contract with the Rams, with a signing bonus of $3 million.|$|R
25|$|Kyle Orton, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> third-choice QB, went 8-for-14 for 101 yards {{including}} a 3-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Desmond Clark in the third quarter. It was also {{a good day for}} LB Brian Urlacher who ran home an 85-yard interception early in the fourth quarter, the first of his career. Alex Brown, starting for the injured Mark Anderson, also got an interception which set up Clark's touchdown.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{signed with}} the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 10, 2014 after the team had waived rookie {{defensive}} end Scott Solomon. Since joining Tampa Bay Smith {{was able to go}} from a rotational Defensive lineman to beating out William Gholston for the starting Defensive End position. Under <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> Tampa 2 system Smith has recorded 17 combined tackles, 13 solo tackles, 6.5 sacks, and 1 forced fumble for the 2014 season in only 8 starts.|$|R
5|$|The Bears {{offense was}} led by quarterback Rex Grossman, the team's first round draft pick in 2003. Over the {{previous}} three seasons, Grossman had played in just 8 regular season games due to injuries, but he recovered to start in all 16 games in 2006. By {{the end of the}} season, he finished with 3,193yards and 23 touchdowns, the most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Grossman had difficulty avoiding turnovers, however, and threw 20 interceptions and lost five fumbles during the year. In the last seven games of the season, he turned the ball over 18 times. Many fans and sports writers expected head coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> to bench him at some point, but Smith insisted that Grossman would be the starter throughout the entire season.|$|E
25|$|With <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> (the former {{defensive}} {{coordinator for the}} St. Louis Rams) as their new head coach, the Bears made plans for their 2004 campaign. Since hiring Lovie, all personnel moves made by GM Jerry Angelo have had an overwhelming degree of success. Under <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith,</b> the Bears have a cumulative record of 63-49, including two playoff wins and two playoff losses, {{one of which was}} Super Bowl XLI.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{closed out}} {{the season with}} a 2–2 record. In Week 15, they won their last regular-season home game against the Atlanta Falcons with a final score of 16–3. During the game, head coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> {{replaced}} Kyle Orton with a fully healed Rex Grossman. In the following week, the Bears clinched the division with a dominant performance at Lambeau Field on Christmas Day (the first time the Bears ever played on Christmas). For the first time since 1991, they swept the Packers; they also secured the NFC North Division title. The Bears ended the regular season with an 11–5 record, enough for 2nd place in the NFC and a first-round bye in the playoffs. In addition, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> received NFL Coach of the Year honors.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Chicago Bears {{season was}} the franchise's 90th season {{overall in the}} National Football League. The Bears had looked to improve upon their 9-7 record from 2008 {{and return to the}} playoffs {{for the first time since}} the 2006 season, but failed to do so for the third {{consecutive}} season. The team finished 7-9, and third in the NFC North. This season is <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> sixth season as the team's head coach. The Bears played all their home games at Soldier Field.|$|R
5000|$|The Chicago Bears {{selected}} Harris in {{the first}} round (14th overall pick) of the 2004 NFL Draft, and he played for the Bears from [...] to [...] In 2004, he finished second in balloting for the Defensive Rookie of the Year award. In only his second NFL season, Harris was selected for the 2006 Pro Bowl for the first time. Harris was well suited for coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> version of the Tampa 2 defense, which relies on quick, mobile linemen to get pressure on the quarterback.|$|R
50|$|Lansanah got his 1st {{big break}} {{when he was}} {{promoted}} to starting Outside LB when injuries took LB Jonathan Casillas out action. Since becoming the starter Lansanah has thrived in <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> Tampa 2 Defense finishing the 2014 season with 81 combined tackles (61 solo), 1.5 QB Sacks, and 3 interceptions with 2 of those interceptions returned for touchdowns. He was highly praised by Lovie and the defensive coaching staff for his versatility as an Inside and Outside Line Backer when he filled in for 2 games for an injured Lavonte David.|$|R
25|$|Dungy {{stresses}} that coaches are essentially teachers who put faith and family ahead of football {{and do not}} belittle their players or scream at them. Also, like Dungy, they remain calm when things go badly. They guide instead of goad, and <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> found that perhaps the most instructive thing of all.|$|E
25|$|The Bears' {{coaching}} staff also saw significant changes during the off season. The team did not re-sign defensive coordinator Ron Rivera, whose contract expired {{at the end}} of the 2006 season. He was replaced by linebackers coach Bob Babich, who had followed head coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> from the St. Louis Rams. Eventually, five assistant coaches, including quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson, would leave the Bears for other teams. The team worked out a contract extension with <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith,</b> which extended his contract for four years to 2011. Smith will make a total of $22 million during the course of the deal. Jerry Angelo, the team's general manager, also signed a six-year deal on the same day. The Bears billed Pep Hamilton of the San Francisco 49ers as their new quarterback coach, and Charles London of Duke University as the team's offensive quality control coach.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{improved}} to 12–2 and secured home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs with an overtime victory over their former division rival Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bears entered the game without Pro Bowlers Mike Brown, Nathan Vasher and Tommie Harris. Additionally, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> deactivated defensive tackle Tank Johnson {{due to his}} legal issues.|$|E
5000|$|Abraham, guided Gibbs to {{its first}} {{district}} title in 2009 but resigned after a 3-7 season in 2010. He was Defensive Backs Coordinator (2011-2012) at Tampa Bay Storm and later (2012) at East Lake High School. In 2013, he was the Head Coach of the Clearwater High School football team and resigned in 2015. He was (2015-2017) the Defensive Coordinator IMG Academy, in Bradenton, Florida. In February 15, 2017, he was named Defensive Assistant Coach for the Illinois Fighting Illini football, joining Head Coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> coaching team.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Bears {{general manager}} Jerry Angelo was fired. During the team's search, Emery {{was one of}} the four candidates, and {{was one of the}} two finalists for the job, along with Arizona Cardinals {{director}} of pro personnel Jason Licht. After being hired, Bears chairman George McCaskey told Emery that though head coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> contract ran through 2013, and that Smith would be head coach in 2012, Emery would have the ability to make a change at the position after the end of the 2012 season. Smith was eventually fired on December 31, 2012 after the Bears missed the playoffs, despite having led the team to a 10-6 record.|$|R
500|$|On April 30, 2012, Bears {{offensive}} coordinator Mike Tice {{and general manager}} Phil Emery announced that Hester's role would be reduced down to at least 4th-string, and Tice mentioned that the Bears would utilize Hester {{in a series of}} plays called the [...] "Hester Package", instead of an every-down receiver. In the season, Hester caught 23 passes, a career low, while only catching one touchdown, which occurred in Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys. He also failed to return a kick/punt for a touchdown, and ranked 22nd in punt return average during 2012. After <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith's</b> firing on December 31, Hester stated that he considered retirement, though he tweeted that his consideration was not related to Smith.|$|R
25|$|Despite Revis' {{outstanding}} season, {{he was not}} {{an ideal}} fit for Tampa Bay's defensive system. When <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> was hired to replace Greg Schiano, he brought his Tampa 2 defense with him, a zone defense that is focused on an elite middle linebacker, not a shutdown corner. Revis, being an elite man-to-man cornerback, was rumored to be on the trading block because of his large $16 million salary for the 2014 season.|$|E
25|$|After signing {{several new}} {{defensive}} {{players in the}} off-season, and hiring new defensive coordinator <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith,</b> the Rams finished the 2001 season with the NFL's best regular season record at 14–2. They {{led the league in}} both total offensive yards (6,930) and scoring (503). This was the Rams' third consecutive season with over 500 points, an NFL record. On defense, they only allowed 271 points, improving their 31st ranking in 2000 to 7th in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Week 8 saw the Bears {{return to}} Soldier Field {{to play the}} San Francisco 49ers. Prior to the game, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> {{announced}} that the Bears would don their alternative orange jerseys to commemorate the upcoming Halloween holiday, and asked Bear fans to wear orange clothing to create an “orange swarm” at Soldier Field. The Bears' 41 point first half tied the franchise record for most points scored in one half, the other game being the 1940 NFL Championship, where the Bears defeated the Washington Redskins 73–0.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lovie</b> Lee <b>Smith</b> (born May 8, 1958) is an American {{football}} coach. He is {{the head}} football coach at the University of Illinois. He was previously the {{head coach of the}} Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) from 2004 to 2012, and the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2014 to 2015. Smith has been to the Super Bowl twice, as the defensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams and as the head coach for the Bears in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Smith, {{whose mother}} is blind because of diabetes, {{is an active}} {{supporter}} of the American Diabetes Association. He {{and his wife are}} also the founders of the <b>Lovie</b> and MaryAnne <b>Smith</b> Foundation, a program which provides educational and life skill opportunities to worthy young people who otherwise face barriers in reaching their educational goals. He was the Grand Marshal for the USG Sheetrock 400 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series race at Chicagoland Speedway on July 15, 2007.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} week, the Bears {{faced the}} New Orleans Saints at the NFC Championship, marking the Saints' first Conference Championship appearance. The Bears’ defense {{shut down the}} Saints’ top-ranked offense, while running backs Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson exploited the Saints’ run defense for nearly 180 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears defeated the Saints, 39–14. The win allowed the Bears to claim the George Halas Trophy {{and the right to}} represent the National Football Conference at Super Bowl XLI against the Indianapolis Colts. Also, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> became the first African-American coach to lead his team to a Super Bowl. This feat was matched hours later by his mentor and friend, Tony Dungy of the Colts.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> named Kyle Orton as the team's {{starting}} quarterback. The team parted with Cedric Benson, who was cut {{after two}} alcohol-related arrests. Benson was succeeded by rookie running back Matt Forte, who rushed for 1,238 yards and caught 47 receptions for 438 yards. The team recorded {{a major victory}} in Week 1 in a Super Bowl XLI rematch against the Colts in Lucas Oil Stadium 29–13. The Bears posted a winning record again, with nine wins and seven losses, however Chicago ended up being one game behind the eventual NFC North Champion Minnesota Vikings, and failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs after losing 31–24 to the Houston Texans in Week 17.|$|E
25|$|During Dungy's {{first season}} in 1996, the team {{continued}} to struggle, starting the season 1–8. But {{in the second}} half of the season they finished 5–2, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by Hardy Nickerson and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his Cover 2 defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin and linebackers coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith,</b> became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success. Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the Tampa 2. It has been brought to the Chicago Bears by Smith, Detroit Lions by Rod Marinelli, Kansas City Chiefs by Herman Edwards and to the Indianapolis Colts by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago Bears’ 2006 NFL Draft picks drew much {{criticism}} from various Bears’ fans and local sports critics. After injuries plagued the Bears’ offensive depth chart, the team finished the 2005 NFL season ranked 31st in passing yardage per game. Many fans {{assumed that the}} Bears would draft a tight end or wide receiver to improve the offense. However, Jerry Angelo and <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> surprised the media by trading away the Bears’ first round draft pick, and drafting five defensive players. Devin Hester was drafted {{to fill the void}} left by former cornerback Jerry Azumah and punt returner Bobby Wade, while Danieal Manning could provide additional depth to the Bears’ secondary while also being potentially available for punt and kick returns, as his highest prospect grade came in kick returning. Additionally, Anderson and Dvoracek were drafted to add depth to the Bears’ defensive line.|$|E
25|$|In {{his inaugural}} year, the Bears ended their 2004 {{campaign}} at 5–11. For the first goal, <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> aimed to defeat their historic rival, the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. However, by Week 7, the Bears recorded a poor starting record of 1–5, {{with the only}} win against Green Bay {{largely due to the}} Week 3 road game loss to the Minnesota Vikings. There, they lost starting quarterback Rex Grossman from a season-ending knee injury. From then on, they cycled through three different quarterbacks: Craig Krenzel, Jonathan Quinn, and Chad Hutchinson. After a modest three-game win streak from Week 8 to 10, the Bears capped the streak in their Week 10 (19–17) win over the Tennessee Titans in overtime with a safety. That was the second time in NFL history that a game ended in overtime on a safety. Afterwards, the Bears ended up losing six of the remaining seven games.|$|E
25|$|In the NFC Championship Game, Cutler {{completed}} 6-of-14passes for 80yards and an interception, {{before a}} knee injury sidelined him early {{in the third quarter}} of a 21–14 loss to Green Bay. The Bears did not make an immediate announcement about Cutler's condition, allowing speculation to grow. In possibly the NFL’s first player-on-player social media attack, Cutler was being criticized seconds after the injury by Maurice Jones-Drew, Darnell Dockett, Deion Sanders, and Mark Schlereth. Bears coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> later clarified that he, and not Cutler, made the decision after consulting the medical and training staff. The following day, an MRI revealed Cutler had sprained his MCL. Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman commented that the widespread reaction reflected hostility towards Cutler's career-long polarizing attitude. Bears teammates defended Cutler, and his critics themselves became the targets of insults from other players, including Packers Aaron Rodgers ("disrespectful"), LeRoy Butler ("stupid"), and B. J. Raji ("pretty wrong and a lot times it has a lot to do with jealousy").|$|E
25|$|The Bears entered week 15 of the NFL season {{hoping to}} secure a first-round bye and home-field {{advantage}} throughout the NFC playoffs. The Bears led 24–3 win 5:22 {{left in the third}} quarter and were en route to winning their third straight, but the Buccaneers had other plans. During the first quarter, the Bucs had only reached 80 yards in total offense. Coach Jon Gruden sent in back-up Tim Rattay who completed 20 of 35 for 268 yards with 3 touchdowns and one interception as the Bucs battled back to tie the game up at 31 during the 4th quarter. A controversial move was made by Chicago Bear's head coach <b>Lovie</b> <b>Smith</b> as he decided to let time expire during the 4th quarter and thus send the game into overtime. Tampa Bay won the coin toss, and both teams had three possessions in overtime. After missing earlier in the overtime period, Robbie Gould connected on a 27-yard field goal with 3:37 remaining to give the Bears the victory, 34–31. This loss sent the struggling Buccaneers to 3–11 which secured last place in the NFC South standings.|$|E
