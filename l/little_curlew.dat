50|$|Some species neither {{regularly}} breed nor {{winter in}} Great Britain, but pass through on migration often in large numbers. Arctic breeding waders {{are a good}} example, with species such as <b>little</b> stint and <b>curlew</b> sandpiper usually being fairly common on passage.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{important}} wetland for over 250 species of resident and migratory waterbirds. Most of the World's population of <b>little</b> <b>curlew</b> stage on the plains during migration. The area also provides habitat for birds-of-paradise and brolga.|$|E
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>curlew</b> (Numenius minutus) is a wader in {{the large}} bird family Scolopacidae. It {{is a very small}} curlew, which breeds in the far north of Siberia. It is closely related to the North American Eskimo curlew.|$|E
50|$|Wasur National Park is {{the habitat}} {{for a number}} of rare and endemic species. Red-listed species known to be present in viable populations are {{southern}} crowned pigeon and New Guinea harpy eagle, dusky pademelon, black-necked stork, Fly River grassbird and <b>little</b> <b>curlew.</b> Three trans-Fly endemic bird species have been recorded, including the Fly River grassbird and the grey-crowned munia.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} of {{international}} importance for migratory, over wintering and breeding wetland birds.

50|$|The 3400 km2 {{floodplain}} of {{the lower}} reaches of the Diamantina {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it has been estimated to support at least 450,000 waterbirds when in flood, as well as globally significant numbers of the nankeen night-heron, royal spoonbill, <b>little</b> <b>curlew,</b> Australian bustard, grey grasswren, inland dotterel, cinnamon quail-thrush and pied honeyeater.|$|E
50|$|Migrant {{waterfowl}} {{are common}} in the northern areas near the tundra; species include Melanitta nigra (Common scoter), Anser fabalis (Bean goose), and Anas formosa (Baikal teal). One the rocky coast of the Sea of Okhotsk are important breading areas for seabirds. Over one million individuals from 15 species are seen in the area, {{and is one of}} the only breeding grounds for the <b>Little</b> <b>curlew,</b> and the critically endangered Siberian crane.|$|E
50|$|A 1240 km2 {{tract of}} land, {{corresponding}} {{to the area of}} the lake when fully inundated, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported up to 116,000 waterbirds when flooded, including over 1% of the world population of plumed whistling-ducks. It also provides habitat for Australian bustards and yellow-tinted honeyeaters. Bird species recorded in substantial numbers include the Australian pelican, Oriental pratincole and <b>little</b> <b>curlew.</b> The IBA is the only known inland breeding site in the Northern Territory for great egrets.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} conservation {{value of}} Eighty Mile Beach {{lies in the}} presence of very large numbers of shorebirds, for which {{it is one of the}} most important non-breeding and migratory stop-over areas in the East Asian - Australasian Flyway, regularly supporting more than 400,000 birds and especially important as a landfall for birds migrating southwards from their high latitude breeding grounds in northern Asia and Alaska to spend the austral summer in Australia. It is one of the most important sites in the world for the migration of great knot and it supports at least 1% of the flyway population (or 1% of the national population for non-migratory species) of 17 waders and the Caspian tern. The most abundant shorebird species at the beach are the great knot (up to 169,000 counted), bar-tailed godwit (110,000), and red knot (80,000). Other notable species include curlew sandpiper (60,000), red-necked stint (60,000), large sand plover (64,000) and Oriental plover (57,000) on the beach, sharp-tailed sandpiper (25,000) at both the beach and floodplain swamps, and <b>little</b> <b>curlew</b> (12,000) on the floodplain.|$|E
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI), caused by infection with H 5 N 1 virus, is a transboundary disease {{which has had}} a significant socio-economic impact on the poultry production systems of Eurasia, and spillover events with mortality in humans and wild birds. In northern Australia, prior to the current study there was poor understanding of the ecology of avian influenza viruses (AIV) and the risks of H 5 N 1 transmission by wild birds. In this study, the biological pathways of risk for HPAI H 5 N 1 by migratory birds were estimated as a negligible to very low risk to the wild birds of northern Australia. Following stochastic modelling the highest mean frequency of outbreaks was 1 year in 36 years (range 1 in 25 - 53 years; annual incidence of 0. 028) for the <b>Little</b> <b>Curlew</b> (Numenius minutus), followed by the Sharp-tailed Sandpiper (Calidris acuminata) (1 in 56 years, range 36 to 91 years). Three species of wild birds were challenged with a H 6 N 2 low pathogenicity AIV (LPAIV). There was poor viral replication in the Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and Silver Gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) with mostly low titre oropharyngeal (OP) excretion [median titre at 4 days post inoculation (DPI) of 101. 43 and 102. 09 50...|$|E

40|$|The virologic {{surveillance}} of 4248 Charadriiformes since 1992 primarily from coastal northwest Australia did not detect {{any evidence of}} avian influenza virus (AIV) excretion (test prevalence = 0 %; 95 % confidence interval CI: 0 %- 0. 09 %). Past exposure to AIV was evident from serologic testing using nucleoprotein (NP) competitive-ELISA (c-ELISA) with an overall seroprevalence of 8. 8 % (95 % CI: 8 %- 9. 7 %). The c-ELISA seroprevalence of family Scolopacidae and genus Numenius was significantly higher when compared with other families and genera, respectively. Exposure risk profiles, based on c-ELISA seroprevalence, were compiled for 40 species with the following species having significantly higher values {{when compared with the}} combined value of all other species: eastern curlew (Numenius madagascariensis), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola), <b>little</b> <b>curlew</b> (Numenius minutus), red knot (Calidris canutus), sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata), and red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis). From hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing, the more prevalent HI reactions were against H 2, H 5, H 6, and H 9 subtypes, with no reactions against subtypes H 11, H 14, H 15, and H 16. Serologic testing using c-ELISA provided species risk profiles for optimizing a surveillance strategy for AIV in diverse populations of wild birds. The paucity of knowledge about the role of waders in the ecology of AIV and the overall very low to negligible virus prevalence reported globally, and in this study, suggests that waders are spillover hosts in shared ecosystems with a lesser role than previously considered...|$|E
