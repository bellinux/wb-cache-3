5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a <b>limited</b> <b>space</b> for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the <b>limited</b> <b>space</b> in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

Our key notion is that of a maximal <b>limit</b> <b>space,</b> a T 0 space (X, 				 					T 					 				) in which every net that has a limit point has a unique limit point maximal in the specialization order induced by 				 					T 					 				. Maximal <b>limit</b> <b>spaces</b> combine features of Hausdorff spaces and domains and form a bridge between those two categories. Every Hausdorff space is a maximal <b>limit</b> <b>space,</b> and maximal <b>limit</b> <b>spaces</b> are preserved under product, closed subspace, and function space constructions. A topological version of the lifting construction, familiar in domain theory, makes a maximal <b>limit</b> <b>space</b> into a compact maximal <b>limit</b> <b>space.</b> The upper powerspace construction makes a locally compact maximal <b>limit</b> <b>space</b> into a c. b. c. domain (continuous directed-complete partial order that is bounded-complete, i. e., any subset with an upper bound has a least upper bound) that is pointed (has a bottom element) if the original space was compact.

5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the <b>limited</b> <b>space</b> in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

5|$|While the 1976 renovations {{prolonged}} {{the life}} of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit. The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The walkways themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. Removable shutters used to secure the stalls overnight were stacked against the sides of the stalls during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the <b>limited</b> <b>space</b> inside the units. In addition, the floors of stalls followed the slope of the hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day.

The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the <b>limited</b> <b>space,</b> including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none {{of which could be}} achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|Typically, ice traders hired {{vessels to}} ship ice as freight, {{although}} Frederic Tudor initially purchased his own vessel and the Tudor Company later bought three fast cargo ships {{of its own}} in 1877. Ice was first transported in ships {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when it was occasionally used as ballast. Shipping ice as ballast, however, required it to be cleanly cut in order to avoid it shifting around as it melted, which was not easily done until Wyeth's invention of the ice-cutter in 1825. The uniform blocks that Wyeth's process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into the <b>limited</b> <b>space</b> of a ship's hold, and significantly reduced the losses from melting. The ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust, and the hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering; other forms of protective dunnage used to protect ice included hay and pine tree cuttings. This requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with the growth in the New England lumber industry in the 1830s; sawdust had no other use at the time, and was in fact considered something of a problem, so its use in the ice trade proved very useful to the local timber industry.|$|E
5|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, {{after leading}} the United States {{through much of}} the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt had {{suffered}} from polio since 1921 and had helped found and strongly supported the March of Dimes to fight that crippling disease, so the ten-cent piece was an obvious way of honoring a president popular for his war leadership. On May 3, Louisiana Representative James Hobson Morrison introduced a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. announced that the Mercury dime (also known as the Winged Liberty dime) would be replaced by a new coin depicting Roosevelt, to go into circulation {{about the end of the}} year. Approximately 90 percent of the letters received by Stuart Mosher, editor of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association), were supportive of the change, but he himself was not, arguing that the Mercury design was beautiful and that the <b>limited</b> <b>space</b> on the dime would not do justice to Roosevelt; he advocated a commemorative silver dollar instead. Others objected that despite his merits, Roosevelt had not earned a place alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, the only presidents honored on the circulating coinage to that point. As the Mercury design, first coined in 1916, had been struck for at least 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the Bureau of the Mint. No congressional action was required, though the committees of each house with jurisdiction over the coinage were informed.|$|E
