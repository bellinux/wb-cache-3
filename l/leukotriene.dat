5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and <b>leukotriene</b> B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E

Several terpenoids isolated from P.atriplicifolia have been investigated for potential inhibitory effects on the hepatitis B virus. Its traditional use as an anti-inflammatory {{has been attributed to}} the ability of the lignan (+)-taxiresinol and five other compounds to act as <b>leukotriene</b> antagonists. The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an anti-inflammatory effect as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Interaction with opioid and cannabinoid receptors has been proposed as the mechanism of traditionally reported analgesic effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is <b>leukotriene</b> B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrowth factor-induced stress fiber {{formation}} involves {{signal transduction}} through Rac and Rho proteins {{and production of}} <b>leukotrienes</b> from arachidonic acid metabolism. In exploring {{the relationship between these}} pathways, we found that Rac is essential for EGF-induced arachidonic acid production and subsequent generation of <b>leukotrienes</b> and that Rac V 12, a constitutively activated mutant of Rac, generates <b>leukotrienes</b> in a growth factor-independent manner. <b>Leukotrienes</b> generated by EGF or Rac V 12 are necessary and sufficient for stress fiber formation. Furthermore, leukotriene-dependent stress fiber formation requires Rho proteins. We have therefore identified elements of a pathway from growth factor receptors that includes Rac, arachidonic acid production, arachidonic acid metabolism to <b>leukotrienes,</b> and leukotriene-dependent Rho activation. This appears to be the major pathway by which Rac influences Rho-dependent cytoskeleton rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of <b>leukotrienes</b> C 4 and D 4, {{the products of the}} 5 'lipoxygenase pathway on prostaglandins and thromboxane release from rat peritoneal macrophages. Incubation of rat peritoneal macrophages with <b>leukotrienes</b> C 4 and D 4 enhanced the release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha and thromboxane B 2 (TxB 2) in a dose-dependent manner. The increase of PGE 2 was more pronounced than that of 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha and TxB 2. Lipopolysaccharide, a known stimulator of these cells elicited a similar pattern of increase of the arachidonate metabolites assayed. These results suggest that <b>leukotrienes</b> C 4 and D 4 are potential activators of macrophages. Since <b>leukotrienes</b> C 4 and D 4 are produced by these cells, it is suggested that endogenous <b>leukotrienes</b> may be involved in activation of macrophages...|$|R
5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to <b>leukotriene</b> B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E

This formation of hepoxilin A3-C appears analogous to the formation of <b>leukotriene</b> C4 by the conjugation of glutathione to <b>leukotriene</b> A4.

25|$|The {{correction}} of capsular contracture might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, {{of the breast}} implant.

Both products may be rapidly reduced by ubiquitous cellular Glutathione peroxidase enzymes to their corresponding hydroxy analogs, 15(S)-HETE (see 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 12(S)-HETE (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE bind to and activate the <b>Leukotriene</b> B4 receptor 2, activate the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and at high concentrations cause cells to generate toxic reactive oxygen species; one or more of these effects may be at least in part responsible for their ability to promote inflammatory responses, alter the growth of various times of human cancer cell lines, contract various types of blood vessels, and stimulate pathological fibrosis in pulmonary arteries and liver (see 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE are esterified into membrane phospholipids where they may be stored and subsequently released during cell stimulation. As one aspect of this processing, the two products are progressively esterified in mitochondria membrane phospholipids during the maturation of red blood cells (see erythropoiesis) and thereby may serve to signal for the degradation of the mitochondria and the maturation of these precursors to red blood cells in mice. This pathway operates along with two other mitochondria-removing pathways and therefore does not appear essential for mouse red blood cell maturation.|$|E

Either of the latter two enzymes act to attach the sulfur of cysteine's thio- (i.e. SH) group in the tripeptide glutamate-cysteine-glycine to carbon 6 of LTA4 thereby forming LTC4. After release from its parent cell, the glutamate and glycine residues of LTC4 are removed step-wise by gamma-glutamyltransferase and a dipeptidase to form sequentially LTD4 and LTE4.

40|$|Background: After {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage cysteinyl <b>leukotrienes</b> (C 4, D 4, E 4) are synthetisized in {{the contact}} brain parenchyma-extravasated blood {{and participate in}} producing of edema formation. The study aim is a 5 -days follow up (admittance/ 3 th day/ 5 th day) of urinary cysteinyl <b>leukotrienes,</b> hematoma and edema volume in patients with primary spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage and to determine the relationship: edema/haematoma and edema/leukotrienes. Methods: An enzyme immunoassay for <b>leukotrienes</b> measuring in the urine samples from 62 patients with hemorrhage during the first 5 days (admittance/ 3 th day/ 5 th day) and 80 health controls is used. Hematoma and edema volume is visualised and measured by computed-tomography. Results: Admission values of <b>leukotrienes</b> were significantly higher in the hemorrhagic patients (min = 268. 61; max = 5787. 36; mean = 1842. 20 ± 1413. 19 pg/ml/mg creatinine) versus control subjects (min = 297. 8; max = 1684. 2; mean = 918. 6 ± 332) (p 0. 05). The edema (mean: 12. 86 ± 13. 52; 22. 38 ± 21. 10; 28. 45 ± 29. 41 cm 3) showed very high significance (p 0. 05) of moderate strength is found between edema and hematoma; and significant positive correlation (r = 0. 6; p 0. 05) at admittance, r = - 0. 05 (p > 0. 05) on the 3 th day (nonexistence of linear correlation, the sign minus presents their tendency for the opposite movement in their values) and r = 0. 2 (p > 0. 05) on the 5 th day are found (positive linear nonsignificant correlation of slight strength). Conclusion: Significant urinary <b>leukotrienes</b> excretion (a brain capacity for significant leukotreienes synthesis) and significant edema progression versus constant haematoma are found. The edema size followed the hematoma size of moderate extent.
