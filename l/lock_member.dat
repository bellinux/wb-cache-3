40|$|A {{mechanical}} connection system comprises a first body {{defining a}} receptable {{and a second}} body defining a pin matingly receivable in the receptacle by relative movement in a first directional mode. A primary latch is engagable between the two bodies to retain the pin in the receptacle. The primary latch is reciprocable in a second directional mode transverse to the first directional mode. A <b>lock</b> <b>member</b> carried {{by one of the}} bodies is operatively associated with the primary latch and movable, transverse to the second directional mode, between a locking position maintaining engagement of the primary latch and a releasing position permitting release of the primary latch. The lock includes an operator portion engagable to move the <b>lock</b> <b>member</b> from its locking position to its releasing position. The operator is located internally of the first body. An actuator is selectivity insertable into and disengagable from the first body. The actuator is movable relative to the first body when it is inserted for engagement with and operation of the operator...|$|E
40|$|A {{tool for}} {{releasably}} holding an object includes a receptacle having an outer sleeve and a rotatable inner sleeve. The inner sleeve is coaxially positioned within the outer sleeve {{and includes a}} <b>locking</b> <b>member.</b> An insert which is adapted to be operably associated with the receptacle includes a cam. The cam includes a guide and a slot {{so that when the}} cam is inserted into the inner sleeve, the guide aligns the <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> with the slot allowing the <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> to engage the slot thereby holding the receptacle and the insert together...|$|R
40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a spring biased and movable <b>locking</b> <b>member.</b> The <b>locking</b> or latch <b>member</b> has ear parts received in locking openings where wedging surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> to retain the <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are placed under tension over annular rollers so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position. Novelty lies {{in the creation of a}} locking hinge which allows compact storage and easy assembly of structural members having a minimal number of parts...|$|R

40|$|A Shuttle type of {{aircraft}} (10) with an escape hatch (12) has an arcuately shaped pole housing (16) attachable to an interior wall and ceiling with its open end adjacent to the escape hatch. The pole housing 16 contains a telescopically arranged and arcuately shaped primary pole member (22) and extension pole member (23) which are guided by roller assemblies (30, 35). The extension pole member (23) is slidable and extendable relative to the primary pole member (22). For actuation, a spring actuated system includes a spring (52) in the pole housing. A <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> (90) engages both pole members (22, 23) through notch portions (85, 86) in the pole <b>members.</b> The <b>locking</b> <b>member</b> selectively releases the extension pole member (23) and the primary pole member (22). An internal one-way clutch or anti-return mechanism prevents retraction of the extension pole member from an extended position. Shock absorbers (54) (150, 152) are for absoring {{the energy of the}} springs. A manual backup deployment system is provided which includes a canted ring (104) biased by a spring member (108). A lever member (100) with a slot and pin connection (102) permits the mechanical manipulation of the canted ring to move the primary pole member. The ring (104) also prevents retraction of the main pole. The crew escape mechanism includes a magazine (60) and a number of lanyards (62), each lanyard being mounted by a roller loop (68) over the primary pole member (22). The strap on the roller loop has stitching for controlled release, a protection sheath (74) to prevent tangling and a hook member (69) for attachment to a crew harness...|$|R
40|$|Politicians and pundits alike {{regularly}} bemoan {{the lack}} of electoral competition in congressional races as incumbent reelection rates frequently soar to over 90 percent. Redistricting and gerrymandering are often blamed {{as a way to}} <b>lock</b> <b>members</b> into their seats for at least a decade. Jamie L. Carson, Michael H. Crespin and Ryan D. Williamson ask if there are ways to inject more competition into elections during the mandated redistricting cycles. Based on an analysis of redistricting cycles from 1972 to 2012, they show that commission and court-drawn districts experience marginally more competition than those drawn by state legislatures. These results provide additional support for the argument that one way to increase the competitiveness of congressional elections is to allow extra-legislative bodies to draw congressional district boundaries...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the achievements of}} the Master Thesis Work that has made at Volvo Truck Corporation. The task consists in developing a subframe that will be fitted on a rigid truck able to carry 20 feet ISO-Containers. The main purpose of the subframe is to support the truck chassis while attaching the container by <b>lock</b> <b>members</b> mounted on the subframe. The design criteria for the subframe are that the construction should prevent rattling, limit high torsion to the chassis, and withstand the forces created from a fully loaded container. The result of the thesis consists in four different solutions, two of which grew from a totally new design, while the other two are based on design ideas from an already existing solution used at Volvo Trucks for carrying swap bodies. The recommendation for the future is to choose for further develop the design concept based on the existing solution for swap bodies as a first step. In the next phase the concept based on totally new design should be fully developed and analysed from manufacturing aspects...|$|R

Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich sent a letter to Putin asking him to use military force in Ukraine to restore law and order.
