The family, which would grow with the births in Canada of two more children, claimed to be Israeli, but Baroud acknowledged his time in Fatah, noting that he had never been involved in any terrorism. He claimed to be defecting because he refused to follow an order to travel to Saudi Arabia's border with Iraqi-controlled Kuwait, where some allege he had been ordered to be killed by the PLO authorities.

He once hosted a section of his own named [...] "Cartas a Marito" [...] (Letters to Marito), in which fans would send letters mail to express their opinion on the show and its characters. He suffered a mysterious accident just before the beginning of a show which left him in a coma. He later reappeared again, but his section was canceled. He speaks with a common Mexico City accent. Like Don Polo (whose bombed jokes simply did not appeal to the producer of the show), he hosted the show while Mario and Bob were on vacation. He has managed to interview a couple of guests when Mario and Bob are not around, <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> On that same episode we got to meet his aunt, the psychic Madame Wendolyn (her real name is Anastasia).

5000|$|On May 29, 2004, Pachachi said, {{referring}} to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, [...] "The Americans thought they were marching into an underdeveloped country, expecting to face little resistance and be welcomed with flowers. The Americans quickly realized that the Iraqi is a patriot, one who defends his country, just as his ancestors have done for thousands of years. We are an educated people with a long history, and we are a cultured people. The Americans also did not expect the infrastructure they found in Iraq. They were surprised. They couldn't understand that a dictator <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> had invested {{a large share of}} oil revenues in infrastructure projects, such as highways, modern irrigation canals and industrial plants, which one doesn't find in just any country. The marines were confused by this new realization, as well as by their failure to achieve a swift victory and by the ongoing resistance. It also confounded the American concept, that is, if a sound and credible concept ever existed. No people in the world wishes to live with occupiers, and we Iraqis are no different." [...] Pachachi also commented on the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse [...] "What kind of reaction do you expect from the Iraqis? Regardless of age, profession and political affiliation, we are all horrified and furious about these atrocities. I had already heard about the brusque approach taken by the Americans during house searches early on. However, I was completely taken aback by the gruesome scope of the torture and human rights violations that have now come to light. Not just I, but all Iraqis demand a tough investigation and punishment of the perpetrators and the people behind them. We also need guarantees that such atrocities will cease once and for all. What has happened cannot be undone, and the long-term psychological consequences are unforeseeable." ...|$|E
50|$|Richard Engel begins {{talking about}} graduating from Stanford {{and wanting to}} become a {{reporter}} but not your typical reporter, he wanted to focus on something more than the stock market so {{he moved to the}} middle east in 1996, when people <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> Gadhafi, and Mubarak were the big leaders. At this time under the big men the middle east was angry, oppressed and rotten to the core. He lived in Cairo where he talks about how different it is from the US such as having no privacy and not speaking to a woman for two years. Engel talks about how everything in the media was heavily censored when he worked for the Middle East Times. The first attack he saw was a bus shooting and burning in Tahrir Square one of the busiest parts of downtown Cairo, he saw people shot and melted into their bus seats. He counts this and the attack in Luxor the first Al-Qaeda-style attacks. He talks about Islam and its origins- Islam's message- all men are equal in prayer, humbled together in communal submission, rich and poor side by side. Mohammad asked for 5 daily prayers, a weekly gathering with a short sermon, partial fasting for a month each year, and a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to Mecca, called the hajj, for those who could afford it. After World War I and the treaties and promises made by Europeans it left the middle east hopelessly divided. After World War II the US pretty much was the Middle East's guardian of stability. After 9/11 when Bush said he was launching a crusade many Muslims took that at face value. Engel started freelancing in 1998 for ABC, The World, and other news organizations. The hardcore Egyptian jihadists joined the holy wars in Afghanistan against the soviets then would return and get put in jail and murdered so they ran to the mountains where they would live and later form standing armies one of which is AL-Qaeda.|$|E
5000|$|I {{got married}} in 2005 and, for {{whatever}} reason, I made the absolutely horrible mistake of inviting The Iron Sheik to my wedding. And if you’ve seen the stuff on YouTube or the stuff on Howard Stern, that’s really him - he’s a freakin’ maniac.Here’s the thing: {{a big part of}} my family is Jewish. I have family members who married and converted Judaism. So, my fiancee at the time wasn’t really comfortable with coming to the wedding because she knows how the Sheik is and she’s seen the videos of him. And I {{had a lot of people}} in wrestling the wedding, and I guess I was thinking more about entertaining them and having a good time than I was thinking what was a good decision.She said, ‘Whatever you do, don’t let him get on the microphone.’ So, I tell my best man - and he’s a huge wrestling fan growing up - ‘Joe, man, don’t do it - don’t put the Sheik on the microphone.’ So, as he’s giving his best-man speech, wrestler Stevie Richards - who’s one of my closest friends but a helluva instigator … I see Stevie has Sheik by the arm and he’s walking him up to my best man with the microphone, and I’m like, ‘Oh, man. What’s going on?’My wife’s side of the family knows nothing about wrestling, they’re not into wrestling - so they’re very much normal. And the Sheik gets up there and says I’m one of his closest friends and what a great person I am and he loves me so much - “Danny McDermitt.” So, he calls me by the wrong name - and I think, ‘Oh, this is going to be good.’So, he’s drunk, and he says, ‘I just want to say to everybody, I have so much respect for Danny because he didn’t kill the Jews like Hitler. And he’s not <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> And he’s not a no good son-of-a-bitch like Osama bin Laden.’ And I’m sitting there thinking, ‘Man, to make me sound like a good guy, did you have to compare me to the three worst dictators in the world?’Meanwhile, my side of the place - the wrestling side - is going crazy, screaming and yelling. And my wife’s side of the family is absolutely horrified. Then Stevie comes running and pulls out a ‘Hulkamania‘ sign and Sheik goes into a tangent about - usual one you’ve heard on YouTube.Everybody on my side of the family is in tears; my wife’s side of the family is getting up and leaving, walking out of the hall. It was kind of just downhill from there - 10 months later I was divorced.I honestly don’t think marriage ever recovered after that. … It was a freakin’ disaster.He put the Camel Clutch on my marriage.|$|E

THE news that onetime strongman Saddam Hussein had been {{condemned}} to death by an Iraqi court hardly comes as a surprise. Anyone proven guilty of committing crimes against humanity cannot be allowed to go unpunished. Reportedly, in this case, witnesses testified how Saddam massacred their relatives and fellow villagers in northern Iraq during the 1988 Anfal campaign. Again, in 1982, he ordered another killing in Dujail. The judgement that Saddam is to die by hanging was received with mixed reactions, given the dire state of affairs in Iraq. Under the circumstances, there are those who long for the days of Saddam’s rule because, ironically as it seems, they could enjoy some form of security then, as compared to today...|$|E
40|$|The {{two main}} sources of Islam are the Quran and the Sunnah (the Prophetic precedent). Whether we look at each of them {{separately}} or together, {{it is difficult to}} escape the conclusion that Islamic values are not limited to what we delineate in the modern era as the private sphere. Islamic values extend their sway over the public sphere too. Additionally over the centuries, Muslim thinkers and scholars have developed a sophis-ticated discourse and culture of Islamic law, anchored around the idea of Shariah, often understood as divinely revealed legislative commands. The existence of this vast and deep corpus of legal tradition has created a strong culture of accepting Islam as a normative force in the public sphere. Whether it is the realm of spirituality, economics, culture or politics, many Muslims instinctively look to Islam for guidance. There are enough scriptural sources to defend this claim scholastically, and the history of the last ten years of the life of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and the era of the first four Caliphs also cement the idea that secu-larism is not an Islamic virtue. As a result of this inheritance, both political authority and political legitimacy in Muslim kingdoms, empires and coun-tries have always come from Islamic sources. In the modern age, in the Muslim world as it emerged after decolonization from Western colonial influence, political authority splintered, especially after the demise of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924, into three types, dictatorial, semi- democratic and monarchical. But, even in these countries, the dictators <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and Anwar Sadat, monarchs like the kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco, and elected presidents and prime ministers in Pakistan, Malaysia and Iran have all used Islam as a source of political authority and legitimacy. The Arab Spring, which has ended dictatorship in Egypt...|$|E
25|$|However, {{he and his}} {{government}} are generally excluded from academic typologies of fascism. Roger Griffin included Pinochet {{in a group of}} pseudo-populist despots distinct from fascism and including the <b>likes</b> of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> Suharto, and Ferdinand Marcos. He argues that such regimes may be considered populist ultra-nationalism but lack the rhetoric of national rebirth, or palingenesis, necessary to make them conform to the model of palingenetic ultranationalism. Robert Paxton meanwhile compared Pinochet's regime to that of Mobutu Sese Seko in the former Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo), arguing that both were merely client states that lacked popular acclaim and the ability to expand. He further argued that had Pinochet attempted to build true fascism, the regime would likely have been toppled or at least been forced to alter its relationship to the United States. Anna Cento Bull also excluded Pinochet from fascism, although she has argued that his regime belongs to a strand of Cold War anti-communism that was happy to accommodate neo-fascist elements within its activity.|$|R
