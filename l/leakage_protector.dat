With the unceasing {{development}} of national economy {{and science and}} technology, wireless data transmission is extensive used in many areas, basing on its characteristic of flexible and so on. Based on the SMS of GSM net, this article introduce an intelligentized surveillance system which is used for controlling the long-distance <b>leakage</b> <b>protector.</b> The current GSM system connects wireless data transmission system and the traditional <b>leakage</b> <b>protector,</b> and the control system detects <b>leakage</b> <b>protector</b> and communicates of the data, making the system more intelligent and practical. 1...|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of Earth <b>leakage</b> <b>protectors</b> is to prevent injury to humans and animals due to {{electric}} shock.|$|R
40|$|Short circuit, {{electrical}} overloads, {{power line}} losses and electrical injury, but also circuit breaker and fuse, <b>leakage</b> current <b>protector,</b> power transformation and protection against electric shock. All these terms are {{connected with the}} mystery of operation in eletric power distribution systems. Let us join electricity on its journey from power station to everyone's socket. What do we experience on this adventurous journey? Sometimes there may be even a risk of death! Fortunately, thanks to the sophisticated application of physical principles of electricity and magnetism, most of the threats are avoided. Will {{we be able to}} uncover the veil of physical electricity site or will it defend its secrets...|$|R
