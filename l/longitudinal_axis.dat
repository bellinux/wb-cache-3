5|$|The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follow trails laid by meat ants {{to locate}} them, and the snakes are also known {{to feed on}} the brood. Various species of spiders prefer to prey on meat ants, mainly {{attracted}} by the alarm pheromone the ants release. One spider, in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is a specialist predator against these ants and uses their alarm pheromones that are released during territorial disputes to locate them. These alarm signals are created by oscillating the body along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>axis,</b> which are mostly released when an ant encounters a nest mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>axis.</b> It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of different colors (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned by a massive dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{proposed}} that an internal representation of body vertical has {{a prominent role in}} spatial orientation. This investigation investigated the ability of human subjects to accurately locate their <b>longitudinal</b> body <b>axis</b> (an imaginary straight body midline running from head to toes) while free-floating in microgravity. Subjects were tested in-flight, as well as on ground in normal gravity in both the upright and supine orientations to provide baseline measurements. The subjects wore a goggle device and were in total darkness. They used knobs to rotate two luminous lines until they were parallel to the subjective direction of their <b>longitudinal</b> body <b>axis,</b> in the roll (right/left) and the pitch (forward/backward) planes. Results showed that the error between the perceived and the objective direction of the <b>longitudinal</b> body <b>axis</b> was significantly larger in microgravity than in normal gravity. This error in this egocentric frame of reference is presumably due to the absence of somatosensory cues when free-floating. Mechanical pressure on the chest using an airbag reduced the error in perception of the <b>longitudinal</b> body <b>axis</b> in microgravity, thus improving spatial orientation...|$|R

5|$|The first manned mission flown from an {{independent}} Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to Mir, docking on 19 March before {{the departure of}} Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-Mir programme, a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to Kristall and test the port which would later be used by US space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's <b>longitudinal</b> <b>axis,</b> in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called Rezonans conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.|$|E

40|$|A medial malleolar {{osteotomy}} {{is often}} indicated for operative exposure of posteromedial osteochondral defects and fractures of the talus. To obtain a congruent joint surface after refixation, the oblique osteotomy {{should be directed}} perpendicularly to the articular surface of the tibia at the intersection between the tibial plafond and medial malleolus. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine this perpendicular direction in relation to the <b>longitudinal</b> tibial <b>axis</b> for use during surgery. Using anteroposterior mortise radiographs and coronal computed tomography (CT) scans of 46 ankles (45 patients) with an osteochondral lesion of the talus, two observers independently measured the intersection angle between the tibial plafond and medial malleolus. The bisector of this angle indicated the osteotomy perpendicular to the tibial articular surface. This osteotomy was measured relative to the <b>longitudinal</b> tibial <b>axis</b> on radiographs. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess reliability. The mean osteotomy was 57. 2 ± 3. 2 ° relative to the tibial plafond on radiographs and 56. 5 ± 2. 8 on CT scans. This osteotomy corresponded to 30. 4 ± 3. 7 ° relative to the <b>longitudinal</b> tibial <b>axis.</b> The intraobserver (ICC, 0. 90 - 0. 93) and interobserver (ICC, 0. 65 - 0. 91) reliability of these measurements were good to excellent. A medial malleolar osteotomy directed at a mean 30 ° relative to the tibial axis enters the joint perpendicularly to the tibial cartilage, and will likely result in a congruent joint surface after reductio...|$|R
