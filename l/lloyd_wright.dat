5|$|Wright left Taliesin and the 600-acre Taliesin Estate to the Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright</b> Foundation (founded {{by him and}} {{his third}} wife in 1940) upon his death in 1959. This {{organization}} oversaw renovations to the estate until late 1992 upon the founding of Taliesin Preservation, Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the building and estate in Wisconsin. Taliesin mostly operates as a museum, however it is still occupied by former students of Wright's in addition to students at the Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright</b> School of Architecture on a seasonal basis. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and is being considered {{as part of a}} UNESCO World Heritage Site. In addition to the residence, there are four Frank Lloyd Wright-designed buildings on the estate: the Romeo and Juliet Windmill, designed by Wright in 1896; Tan-y-Deri, the home he designed for Jane and Andrew Porter, his sister and brother-in-law; the Hillside Home School, originally designed in 1901 for his aunts' school, and Midway Barns, a farming facility.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, the {{building}} underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright</b> was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago. Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.|$|E

5|$|Hotel Valley Ho is a {{historic}} hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. Also called the Valley Ho and, for 28 years, the Ramada Valley Ho, the hotel was originally designed by Edward L. Varney, a student of Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright.</b> It first opened in 1956 with a forward-looking and futuristic design. Movie stars and famous baseball players stayed, and the building quickly became known for its trendsetting guests and its fashionable atmosphere. The success of the venture resulted in expansion in 1958, with two additional two-story wings of guest rooms extending to the north. Though initially proposed by Varney, a central tower of guest rooms, rising over the lobby, was not built.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the Dammasch State Hospital mental {{hospital}} {{opened on the}} west side of the community. Gordon House, the only house in Oregon to be designed by architect Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright,</b> was built in 1963 near what became Charbonneau and moved to the Oregon Garden in 2001. Wilsonville was flooded in 1964 and the first fire station was built in 1966. Wilsonville was incorporated as a city in 1969 with a population of about 1,000. In 1971, the planned community of Charbonneau on the south side of the river was annexed into the city the year after development began.|$|E
5|$|The Isidore H. Heller House {{is a house}} {{located at}} 5132 South Woodlawn Avenue in the Hyde Park {{community}} area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright.</b> The design is credited {{as one of the}} turning points in Wright's shift to geometric, Prairie School architecture, which is defined by horizontal lines, flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, windows grouped in horizontal bands, and an integration with the landscape, which is meant to evoke native Prairie surroundings.|$|E

5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright</b> {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright</b> in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E
5|$|Wright {{was deeply}} in debt {{following}} {{the destruction of}} Taliesin II. Aside from debts owed on the property, his divorce from Noel forced Wright to sell much of his farm machinery and livestock. Wright was also forced to sell his prized Japanese prints at half value to pay his debts. The Bank of Wisconsin foreclosed on Taliesin in 1927 and Wright was forced to move to La Jolla, California. Shortly before the bank was to begin an auction on the property, Wright's former client Darwin Martin conceived a scheme to save the property. He formed a company called Frank <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Wright</b> Incorporated to issue stock on Wright's future earnings. Many of Wright's former clients and students purchased stock in Wright to raise $70,000. The company successfully bid on Taliesin for $40,000, returning it to Wright.|$|E
