The lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies, which is hoped will boost exports from the eurozone and further aid the recovery.|$|E
5|$|As {{concerns}} intensified {{in early}} 2010 and thereafter, leading European nations implemented {{a series of}} financial support measures such as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and providing cheap loans {{of more than one}} trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks. On 6 September 2012, the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, through some yield lowering Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of the price-based mechanism of market discipline indicates that banks showing a lower risk of insolvency (higher values of Z SCORE) pay <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on deposits, {{in accordance with the}} market discipline hypothesis. In addition, there are some findings suggesting that banks with good levels of capital, earnings, and liquidity pay <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> However, in opposition to the market discipline hypothesis, banks showing low administrative efficiency (MANAGEMENT 1 - 2) and low asset quality (RESERVE and DOUBTFUL) pay <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on deposits.|$|R

25|$|The rupee was pegged to the British pound until 1982, {{when the}} {{government}} of General Zia-ul-Haq changed it to managed float. As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982–83 and 1987–88 {{and the cost of}} importing raw materials increased rapidly, causing pressure on Pakistani finances and damaging much of the industrial base. The Pakistani rupee depreciated against the United States dollar until the turn of the century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar. The State Bank of Pakistan then stabilized the exchange rate by <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and buying dollars, in order to preserve the country's export competitiveness.|$|E
25|$|Monetarists {{follow the}} {{explanation}} given by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz. They {{argue that the}} Great Depression {{was caused by the}} banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction by 35%. This caused a price drop by 33% (deflation). By not <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling the Federal Reserve passively watched the transforming of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action.|$|E

50|$|In its {{original}} conception, a liquidity trap {{refers to the}} phenomenon when increased money supply fails to <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Usually central banks try to <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> by buying bonds with newly created cash. In a liquidity trap, bonds pay little or no interest, which makes them nearly equivalent to cash. Under the narrow version of Keynesian theory in which this arises, it is specified that monetary policy affects the economy only through its effect on <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, if an economy enters a liquidity trap, further increases in the money stock will fail to further <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and, therefore, fail to stimulate.|$|R

A similar imbalance exists in the US, which runs a large trade deficit (net import position) and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad. Ben Bernanke warned of the risks of such imbalances in 2005, arguing that a [...] "savings glut" [...] in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits, artificially <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and creating asset bubbles.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{discussing}} critically Persio Arida’s {{proposal of}} adopting currency convertibility in Brazil.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an adverse}} selection model which uncovers two mechanisms whereby Grameen-style peer grouping systems can trigger <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> In one extreme scenario, where participant borrowers {{do not have}} prior information about the type of their peers, <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> are triggered by a `collateral effect'. In the opposite scenario, where participant borrowers have perfect knowledge about their peers, <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are triggered by a `self selection' effect.

The existence of the former effect implies, however, that information extraction by banks necessary for peer grouping systems to succeed in reducing <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> and that peer grouping systems are potentially implementable beyond the sphere of village economies with perfect information.
