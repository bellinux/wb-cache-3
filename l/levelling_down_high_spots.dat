Its waters {{accumulate}} in southeast McLean County and northwest Champaign County and eventually empty into the Illinois River near Beardstown. Near its headwaters, the gathering Sangamon is scarcely a river at all. In its lower reaches, which have been straightened by engineers, it is scarcely a natural river. In between {{is the heart of}} the Sangamon, and from Gibson City to its meeting with Mosquito Creek near Illiopolis, the river retains much of its character from the days before settlement. The heart of the Sangamon drains 1, 220 square miles, most of it in Macon and Piatt counties. The countryside is part of a massive "till" plain that blankets most of east central Illinois. Till is the jumbled rock debris -mostly gravels, sands, and clays -left behind by glaciers. (Till can be seen locally along streams where erosion has exposed the subsurface.)

40|$|The {{so-called}} “Levelling Down Objection” {{is commonly}} believed {{to occupy a}} central role in the debate between egalitarians and prioritarians. Egalitarians think that equality is good in itself, and so they are committed to finding value even in such equality as may only be achieved by “levelling down”–i. e., by merely reducing the better off to the level of the worse off. Although egalitarians might deny that <b>levelling</b> <b>down</b> could ever make for an all-things-considered improvement, they cannot deny that it may make things better in at least one respect. Prioritarians, on the other hand, do deny this; according to them, <b>levelling</b> <b>down</b> cannot make things better in any respect. In this paper I argue that the <b>Levelling</b> <b>Down</b> Objection leans far too heavily on a heretofore unanalysed notion: namely, the notion of “being better in this or that respect. ” I propose what I take to be a plausible analysis of that notion, and show that, given the proposed analysis, the prioritarian is no less vulnerable to the <b>Levelling</b> <b>Down</b> Objection than is the egalitarian. I conclude that proponents of the <b>Levelling</b> <b>Down</b> Objection need either to suggest a better analysis or abandon the <b>Levelling</b> <b>Down</b> Objection altogether...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} PDR {{techniques}} utilize metal rods and body picks to push out the dents from {{the underside of}} the body panel. Glue and specially designed tabs may be used to pull out the dents from the outside of the panel. Fine tuning the repair often involves tapping down the repair to remove small <b>high</b> <b>spots.</b> Quality technicians can blend <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> to match the texture of the paint called orange peel. Pushing too hard can create <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> that cause the clear coat to split or crack. Experienced technicians can avoid cracking or chipping with the use of heat, although a re-painted surface most likely will crack. When damage is so great that body filler is necessary, a PDR technician may [...] "push to paint", resolving most of the damage before minor filling, sanding, and painting, thereby saving time and cost.|$|R
