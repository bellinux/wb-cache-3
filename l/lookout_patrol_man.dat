5000|$|In their {{argument}} challenging {{the constitutionality of}} these checkpoints on behalf of Ortiz, Mr. Charles M. Sevilla (the court-appointed attorney for Ortiz) argued that [...] "in comparing a roving to a fixed check, {{we have to look}} at the nature of the intrusion involved and each case were involved with a search, which takes place because of the unfettered exercise of discretion by Border Patrol officer at a checkpoint who decides without any criteria... that he is going to select a car, refer to secondary and conduct a full search of a car". [...] The attorney for Ortiz did not argue that checkpoints in general on the border were illegal, but that checkpoints that were located at a distance away from the border were in fact unconstitutional. The attorney for Ortiz also argued that a warrant should have been required for the search to take place, leaving the decision for probable cause up to a judicial officer, and not to a Border <b>Patrol</b> <b>man.</b> In his oral arguments, Sevilla stated [...] "There was warrant requirement because this is the concept where certainly a judicial officer should make the determination and not a Border <b>Patrol</b> <b>men</b> standing 66 miles north of a border determining a legal concept such as the functional equivalent of probable cause". [...] In summary, the attorney for Ortiz stated that because the checkpoint was 66 miles away from the border, the Border Patrol officers needed to have probable cause to search the vehicle along with a warrant.|$|R
