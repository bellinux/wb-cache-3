25|$|Goldman Sachs {{was one of}} the {{heaviest}} users of these loan facilities, taking out many loans between March 18, 2008 and April 22, 2009. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the first Fed facility ever to provide overnight loans to investment banks, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $589 billion against collateral such as corporate market instruments and mortgage-backed securities. The Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility</b> (TSLF), which allows primary dealers to borrow liquid Treasury securities for one month in exchange for less liquid collateral, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $193 billion.|$|E
25|$|The Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility</b> is a 28-day {{facility}} that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers {{in exchange for}} other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Like the Term Auction Facility, the TSLF was done {{in conjunction with the}} Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased.|$|E

These facilities were created in response to the financial crisis and have expanded the Fed's balance sheet by over $ 1 trillion in terms of total assets. This sum is larger than the total price tag of the recent federal stimulus as well as the bank bailout authorized by the TARP. Yet both of these government responses have received enormously more public scrutiny than any of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve.

2500|$|In {{order to}} address {{problems}} related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble, several new tools have been created. The first new tool, called the Term Auction Facility, was added on December 12, 2007.

Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility,</b> was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility</b> is used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008. The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now the Fed is able to lend directly to primary dealers, which was previously against Fed policy.

40|$|Following {{the current}} {{international}} financial and economic crisis the IMF reformed its <b>lending</b> <b>facilities.</b> Two new instruments {{are of particular}} importance: the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and the High Access Precautionary Arrangements (HAPA). The major innovation of the new facilities is that the traditional ex-post conditionality is replaced by an ex-ante qualification process. An ex-ante qualification process leads to a short-term availability of funds during the emergence of crises and avoids long negotiation processes during a crisis. Additionally, the FCL is high powered, amounting to 900 to 1000 % of the quota. It can therefore be expected that the programs have preventive effects. In difference to previous attempts to implement precautionary credit lines, the FCL and HAPA successfully created demand. First empirical observations show, that a stigmatization, {{which could have been}} expected from experience, did not take place. Countries who qualified for the FCL did rather well during the current crisis and did not face shrinking confidence due to expected crises. To be more efficient, the new <b>lending</b> <b>facilities</b> should be complemented be an international regulatory framework, which limits moral-hazard-induced higher risk taking. Additionally more members should be encouraged to demand the new instruments to increase its systemic importance. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general equilibrium currency crisis {{model of the}} "third generation", in which the possibility of currency crises {{is driven by the}} interplay between private firms' credit-constraints and nominal price rigidities. Despite our emphasis on microfoundations, the model remains sufficiently simple that the policy analysis can be conducted graphically. The analysis hinges on four main features: i) ex post deviations from purchasing power parity; ii) credit constraints a la Bernanke-Gertler; iii) foreign currency borrowing by domestic firms; iv) a competitive banking sector lending to firms and holding reserves and a monetary policy conducted either through open market operations or short-term <b>lending</b> <b>facilities.</b> We first show that with a positive likelihood of a currency crisis, firms may indeed find it optimal to borrow in foreign currency, following Chamon (2001). Second, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a sunspot equilibrium with currency crises. Third, we show that a reduction in the monetary base through restrictive open market operations is more likely to eliminate the possibility of currency crises if {{at the same time the}} central bank does not impose excessive constraints on short-term <b>lending</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|R
