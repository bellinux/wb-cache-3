2500|$|The Beta 1 was {{constructed}} predominantly from fiberglass, with the wing covered in plywood with a [...] <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> cloth and resin over that. The wing featured terminal velocity Schempp-Hirth style dive brakes and a Wortmann FX 61-184 airfoil becoming an FX 61-160 at the tip. The fuselage was a pod-and-boom design, with fully reclined pilot seating, a fixed monowheel landing gear and T-tail.|$|E
2500|$|The warhead {{was another}} source of troubles. The {{explosive}} employed was amatol 60/40 detonated by an electric contact fuze. Amatol {{had the advantage of}} stability and the warhead was protected by a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed [...] and contained [...] of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.|$|E
5000|$|Paper {{honeycomb}} is {{a building}} and packing material. One {{of the most}} commons uses of paper honeycomb is for standard doors inside houses. Typically a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> and then the enforced paper made into honeycomb shapes (hexagon tubes) and then another <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> Compared pound for pound, it is stronger than steel and costs substantially less to manufacture.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} {{building}} a deck in fiberglass {{is the same as}} {{for building a}} hull: a female mould is built, a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> gel coat is sprayed in, then <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> in resin are built up to the required deck thickness (if the deck has a core, the outer skin <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> and resin are laid, then the core material, and finally the inner skin layers.) The deck is removed from the mould and usually mechanically fastened to the hull.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the release}} agent and gelcoat are applied, <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{fiberglass}}</b> and resin are laid-up onto the surface. The fiberglass used will typically be {{identical to that}} which {{will be used in}} the final product.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the final}} <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> {{are applied to}} the mold, the resin is allowed {{to set up and}} cure. Wedges are then driven between the plug and the mold in order to {{separate}} the two.|$|R
50|$|The car's {{body was}} {{built at the}} factory and {{featured}} an unusual form of fiberglass construction. Instead of a single <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> as is common in other kit cars, the Bernardi body tub (the portion between the passenger compartment and the frame or road) and other body components used a composite sandwich consisting of one <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> one of stiff plastic foam, and finally a second <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> The result is a heavier body than usual for kit cars, but one with reputedly greater stiffness and sound absorption than the single-layer approach. The colors for the visible {{parts of the body}} are molded into the fiberglass body parts as Gelcoat and the cars often appear with two-tone color schemes where the body color contrasts with the fenders and running boards.|$|E
50|$|Pad {{cratering}} is a mechanically {{induced fracture}} in the resin between copper foil and outermost <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> of {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB). It may be within the resin or at the resin to fiberglass interface.|$|E
50|$|Chopped {{fiberglass}} strands {{embedded in}} the foam add to the structural integrity through physical support and shrapnel mitigation. The layer that strengthens the foam in turn strengthens the airframe. The <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> also prevents shrapnel and bullets from rupturing the foam. The fiber glass then allows {{the damage caused by}} projectile penetration to heal more effectively.|$|E
50|$|As in the mold-making process, {{release agent}} is first {{applied to the}} mold. Colored gelcoat is then applied. <b>Layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> are then applied, using the same {{procedure}} as before. Once completed and cured, the component is separated from the mold using wedges, compressed air or both.|$|R
40|$|New tool applies fragile layered {{insulation}} to cryogenic tubing. Used routinely {{to apply}} two <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> and one <b>of</b> aluminum foil on pipe used as inner line in vacuum jacketed cryogenic plumbing. Wrapper {{is easy to}} use and made from inexpensive, readily available parts. Wheeled to whatever location is convenient for wrapping...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{surfboards}} {{are made}} of polyurethane or polystyrene foam covered with <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> cloth, and polyester or epoxy resin. The result is a light and strong surfboard that is buoyant and maneuverable. Recent developments in surfboard technology have included the use of carbon fiber and kevlar composites. Each year, approximately 400,000 surfboards are manufactured.|$|R
50|$|Andy Lomnici used {{a frozen}} trout as a guide, {{and built the}} final work in {{fibreglass}} over mesh and a steel frame. The completed Big Trout stands at 10 m and weighs 2.5 t. The scales were produced by covering the work in mesh, adding a final <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> and then removing the mesh before it set.|$|E
50|$|The British-Iraqi {{architect}} Zaha Hadid {{constructed the}} Bridge Pavilion in Zaragoza. Spain {{for an international}} exposition there in 2008. The bridge, which also served as an exposition hall, is constructed of concrete reinforced with an external <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> in different shades of gray. Since the event closed, the bridge {{has been used to}} host expositions and shows.|$|E
5000|$|The Beta 1 was {{constructed}} predominantly from fiberglass, with the wing covered in plywood with a [...]030 in <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> cloth and resin over that. The wing featured terminal velocity Schempp-Hirth style dive brakes and a Wortmann FX 61-184 airfoil becoming an FX 61-160 at the tip. The fuselage was a pod-and-boom design, with fully reclined pilot seating, a fixed monowheel landing gear and T-tail.|$|E
50|$|The Alcor {{is named}} for the star in Ursa Major and was {{optimized}} for flight in weak mountain wave soaring conditions. The aircraft is constructed from Sitka spruce veneer, covered with <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> The wings and tail use foam sandwiches, covered in S-glass. The Alcor {{was one of the}} first gliders to be built from composites.|$|R
30|$|With {{the method}} described, Braun et al. (2001) {{attempted}} to liquefy a {{raw material for}} circuit boards covered with copper foil {{on both sides and}} reinforced with 59, 5 % of fiber glass sheets. It can be seen that {{it is not necessary to}} grind this material before hydrogenolysis. The <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> and copper foil were recovered with very little contamination.|$|R
50|$|Fiberglass {{cloth and}} mat {{replaced}} canvas as reinforcement {{and support for}} the colored resin (paint). They were painted with a brush face down on a waxed Formica table mold. The illusionary plane nearest the viewer was masked out with tape and painted first, the furthest away was painted last. <b>Layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> impregnated with resin were laminated {{to the back of the}} painting... The completed painting was peeled from the waxed mold and polished.|$|R
50|$|In the {{laying-up}} process, a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> mat {{is applied}}, and resin is applied over it. A special roller is {{then used to}} remove air bubbles. Air bubbles, if left in the curing resin, would significantly reduce {{the strength of the}} finished mold. The fiberglass spray lay-up process is also used to produce molds, and can provide good filling of corners and cavities where a glass mat or weave may prove to be too stiff.|$|E
50|$|The warhead {{was another}} source of troubles. The {{explosive}} employed was amatol 60/40 detonated by an electric contact fuze. Amatol {{had the advantage of}} stability and the warhead was protected by a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed 975 kg and contained 910 kg of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.|$|E
50|$|The wall {{elements}} were pre-fabricated at the MAN factory and then bolted to a {{steel frame construction}} which was erected on-site {{on top of a}} brick foundation and a thermal insulation <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> mats was located between the outer steel sheets and hardboard inside, with an insulation value similar to that of a 80 cm thick brick wall according to historic advertising brochures. The outside of the steel walls were painted with an solvent-based lacquer as a means of corrosion protection.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{printed circuit}} boards consist <b>of</b> {{alternating}} <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> copper and <b>fiberglass</b> FR-4 ...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} {{from a combination}} of wood, styrofoam, aluminium and fiberglass. The semi-tapered wing is built from wood and styrofoam, covered with stress-bearing fiberglass. The wing is tapered outboard of the mid-span point. The wing spar is built up from 14 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> and epoxy resin at the root and is a box-style spar that occupies 40% of the wing chord. The wing is constructed in three pieces, a center-section and wing tips and features Schempp-Hirth dive brakes. The wing is 15% thick and employs a NACA 64(3)-615 laminar flow airfoil.|$|R
50|$|Laminate: The snowboard's core is also {{sandwiched}} {{on the top}} {{and bottom}} by at least two <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> The fiberglass adds stiffness and torsional strength to the board. The fiberglass laminate may be either biaxial (fibers running the length of the board and more fibers 90 degrees perpendicular to it), triax (fibers running the length of the board with 45 degree fibers running across it), or quadax (a hybrid of the biax and triax). Some snowboards also add carbon and aramid (also known as Twaron or Kevlar) stringers for additional elasticity and strength.|$|R
5000|$|Galvanized {{mild steel}} is the {{standard}} and most common material used in fabricating ductwork because the zinc coating of this metal prevents rusting and avoids cost of painting. For insulation purposes, metal ducts are typically lined with faced fiberglass blankets (duct liner) or wrapped externally with fiberglass blankets (duct wrap). When called for, a double walled duct is used. This will usually have an inner perforated liner, then a 1-2" [...] <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> insulation contained inside an outer solid pipe.|$|E
50|$|The {{containers}} measure 3.5 × 3 × 2.5 m. One container {{is situated}} on the foredeck; the other three go on the quarterdeck behind the superstructure and funnel. Furthermore the ships are built using the sandwich principle - a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> {{either side of a}} core of PVC cell foam. This forms the structure from keel to top of mast. This building method reduces maintenance costs - so much so that 20 years later the new Diana and -Holm class have been built using the same materials.|$|E
50|$|An {{expansion}} joint {{is designed to}} allow deflection in the axial (compressive), lateral (shear), or angular (bending) deflections. Expansion joints can be non-metallic or metallic (often called bellows type). Non-metallic can be a single ply of rubberized material or a composite made of multiple layers of heat and erosion resistant flexible material. Typical layers are: outer cover to act a gas seal, a corrosion-resistant material such as Teflon, a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> to act as aninsulator and to add durability, several layers of insulation {{to ensure that the}} heat transfer from the flue gas is reduced to the required temperature and an inside layer.|$|E
5000|$|All Southports, {{like most}} other sport fishing boats, are made <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> The hull <b>of</b> the boat is made in a pre-fabricated mold, where the outer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> gelcoat is applied first, then the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> After the {{exterior}} hull is completed, the grid system is installed into the hull. A bonding agent called methacrylate is applied to ensure a complete bond with the grid system (the interior skeleton of the boat). The grid system {{is similar to the}} stringer system of older boats, but provides added strength because it is one integral piece including fore and aft as well as laterally running structural beams. The hull grid system, as well as any compartments not used for storage or fuel cells, are then completely filled with foam for basic flotation and vibration reduction., ...|$|R

50|$|On August 18, 1985, Trotter {{began his}} attempt from a {{location}} just upstream from the Horseshoe Falls. He survived the plunge uninjured. He {{became the youngest}} person to ever survive the stunt (age 22) and the first American in 25 years {{to go over the}} Falls in a barrel. He used two pickle barrels placed end-to-end. The exterior was reinforced with <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> balsa wood for flotation, and covered with truck tire inner tubes for shock absorption. Trotter was strapped into an automotive racing harness, and equipped with flashlights, lifejacket, two-way radio, and oxygen tanks. The ends of the barrel were sealed with submarine-style twist caps.|$|R
50|$|The lanes {{consist of}} steel pipes of 65 mm bore and wall {{thickness}} of 2.5-3 mm. The pipes are connected with tight couplers 14 cm long to ensure perfect coaxial alignment and then welded together, ensuring air-tightness. To prevent stray voltage from causing excess corrosion, ceramic insulators are inserted between the pipe segments at some places. Pipes buried underground are {{protected from the}} outside by a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> wound around at increased temperature and coated with hot asphalt. The pipeline is typically buried under the Prague sidewalks 80-120 cm deep. Inside buildings and in the Prague trunk conduit network the pipes simply are coated with anti-corrosive paint.|$|E
5000|$|Centaur uses {{so-called}} [...] "balloon tanks", made {{of stainless}} steel so thin they cannot support their own weight without pressurization. This tank design, with walls as thin as , allowed for an extremely high ratio of fuel to dry mass, maximizing the stage's performance. It uses a common double-bulkhead to separate the LOX and LH2 tanks. The two stainless steel skins are separated by a 0.25 inch (6.4 mm) <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> honeycomb. The extreme cold of the LH2 on one side creates a vacuum within the fiberglass layer, decreasing the bulkhead's thermal conductivity, and thus reducing heat transfer from the relatively warm LOX to the super cold LH2.|$|E
50|$|Strip-built {{designs are}} similar in shape to rigid {{fiberglass}} kayaks but are generally both lighter and tougher. Like their fiberglass counterparts the shape {{and size of the}} boat determines performance and optimal uses. The hull and deck are built with thin strips of lightweight wood, often cedar, pine or Redwood. The strips are edge-glued together around a form, stapled or clamped in place, and allowed to dry. Structural strength comes from a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> cloth and epoxy resin, layered inside and outside the hull. Strip-built kayaks are sold commercially by a few companies, priced USD 4,000 and up. An experienced woodworker can build one for about USD 400 in 200 hours, though the exact cost and time depend on the builder's skill, the materials and the size and design. As a second kayak project, or for the serious builder with some woodworking expertise, a strip-built boat can be an impressive piece of work. Kits with pre-cut and milled wood strips are commercially available.|$|E
40|$|Bolted {{connections}} {{often fail}} by a shear plug or a splitting beneath the bolt caused by tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses as the bolt wedges {{its way through}} the wood. Pre-venting this type of failure would enhance the capacity and reliability of the bolted connection, thus increasing the over-all integrity of a timber structure and enabling wood to compete favorably with other engineering materials. This research investigated the use <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> reinforcement to enhance the load-carrying capacity of bolted wood connec-tions. A series of specimens were prepared from standard 38 - by 89 -mm (nominal 2 - by 4 -in.) lumber from the Spruce–Pine–Fir lumber grouping. Matched specimens were reinforced with one, two, or three <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> bi-directional <b>fiberglass</b> cloth. Resulting test specimens were configured as a connection that was in accordance with current design specifications. A total of 80 single-bolt, double-shear connec-tions were tested; 40 parallel to grain and 40 perpendicular to grain. Results indicate that connection strength increases as the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> reinforcement increase. The largest in-crease occurred when adding the first layer to the nonrein-forced connection. Additional layers increased strength at a decreasing rate. The ultimate strength of a three-layer rein-forced connection was 33 percent greater than the nonrein-forced connection for parallel-to grain loading and more than 100 percent for perpendicular-to-grain loading. More impor-tantly for parallel-to-grain loading, the reinforcement changed the mode of failure from an abrupt, catastrophic type associ-ated with tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses to a ductile type associated with bearing stress...|$|R
40|$|Response <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> epoxy {{composite}} laminates under low velocity {{impact loading}} is investigated using LS-DYNA®, {{and the results}} are compared with experimental analysis performed using an instrumented impact test setup (Instron dynatup 8250). The composite laminates are manufactured using H-VARTM© process with basket weave E-Glass fabrics. Epon 862 is used as a resin system and Epicure-W as a hardening agent. Composite laminates, with 10 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> fabrics, are modeled using 3 D solid elements in a mosaic fashion to represent basket weave pattern. Mechanical properties are calculated by using classical micromechanical theory and assigned to the elements using ORTHOTROPIC ELASTIC material model. The damage occurred since increasing impact energy is incorporated using ADVANCED COMPOSITE DAMAGE material model in LS-DYNA®. Good agreements are obtained with the failure damage results in LS-DYNA® and experimental results. Main considerations for comparison are given to the impact load carrying capacity and the amount of impact energy absorbed by the laminates...|$|R
40|$|A fiber-coupled Terahertz {{time domain}} {{spectroscopy}} (THz-TDS) {{system based on}} photoconductive antennas, pumped by a 100 -fs fiber laser, {{has been used to}} characterize materials in transmission and reflection mode. THz images are acquired by mounting the samples under investigation on an x-y stage, which is stepped through the beam while the transmitted or reflected THz waveform is captured. The samples include a carbon fiber epoxy composite and a sandwich-structured composite panel with an aramid fiber honeycomb core in between two skin <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> reinforced plastic. The former has an artificially induced void, and from a comparison of recorded reflected time-domain signals, with and without the void, a simple model for the structure of the composite is proposed that describes the time-domain signals reasonably well. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
