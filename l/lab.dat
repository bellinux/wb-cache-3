5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the <b>lab</b> of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's <b>lab,</b> building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's <b>lab),</b> molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E

However, in this rather young research domain, there is no consensus yet regarding supporting theories and frameworks.

Within this research paper we propose a fourfold categorization of Living <b>Labs</b> based on a literature review and validated by an empirical investigation of the characteristics of 64 ICT Living <b>Labs</b> from the European Network of Living <b>Labs</b> (ENoLL). The four types are Living <b>Labs</b> for collaboration and knowledge support activities, original ‘American’ Living <b>Labs,</b> Living <b>Labs</b> as extension to testbeds and Living <b>Labs</b> that support context research and co-creation with users...|$|R
