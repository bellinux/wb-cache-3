5|$|The Occupiers' <b>Liability</b> Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' <b>liability.</b> The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' <b>Liability</b> Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the <b>liability</b> for visitors. The Act introduced an element of <b>liability</b> for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' <b>liability</b> in English law along with the Occupiers' <b>Liability</b> Act 1984.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that <b>liability</b> for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, <b>liability</b> comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop <b>liability</b> and social host <b>liability,</b> wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate <b>liability,</b> the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain <b>liability</b> insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit <b>liability</b> to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the <b>liability</b> of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E

5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees <b>liability</b> for their acts. This {{is an area that}} has long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no <b>liability</b> for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape <b>liability</b> for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E
5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved {{insufficient}} in its {{objective of}} encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors.

40|$|In Canada, {{appointed}} actuaries {{are required}} to opine on {{the adequacy of the}} policy <b>liabilities</b> for property-casualty insurers. Policy <b>liabilities</b> include both claims and premium <b>liabilities.</b> Several papers have been written and actuarial techniques have been developed to estimate claims <b>liabilities.</b> Premium <b>liabilities,</b> however, have received little, virtually no attention in the actuarial literature. To date, we believe that only Canadian actuaries have been evaluating these <b>liabilities.</b> However, other countries are following that lead. We understand that in some states, regulators will soon require actuarial opinions on the adequacy of unearned premiums for policies with terms exceeding twelve months. The evaluation of premium <b>liabilities</b> consists of examining all related assets and <b>liabilities</b> to ensure that the anticipated net costs to discharge an insurer's obligations with respect to its insurance and reinsurance contracts, except its claim <b>liabilities,</b> are provided for. This paper intends to provide the practicing actuary with some guidelines on the evaluation of the premium <b>liabilities.</b> We will review the individual components of the premium <b>liabilities</b> and the related regulatory requirements and CIA recommendations. Finally, we will present an actuarial approach to evaluate the equity in the unearned premium, the unearned premium deficiency and the deferred policy acquisition expenses.

5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the <b>liability</b> of {{trustees}} for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and <b>liability</b> occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' <b>liability</b> for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from <b>liability.</b> The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise <b>liability.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} environmental <b>liabilities</b> on risk assessment by investigating whether the markets consider these <b>liabilities</b> a form of corporate debt {{in the assessment of}} the firm's risk. A model developed by Rubinstein (1973) and further expanded and operationalised by Dhaliwal (1986) is used to examine whether the inclusion of environmental <b>liabilities</b> relating to Superfund sites has any incremental explanatory power. A positive association between the environmental <b>liabilities</b> and measures of firms' risk is expected. Such results should help policy-makers {{decide whether or not to}} require companies to disclose environmental <b>liabilities</b> in their financial reports. The empirical results weakly support the hypothesis that environmental <b>liabilities</b> relating to Superfund sites are considered corporate <b>liabilities</b> in assessing firm's risk. One possible explanation is that the problems in recognising and determining the exact amount of <b>liabilities</b> for the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) firms make it difficult for the investors to use this information for risk assessment. This paper addresses some important issues such as reporting environmental <b>liabilities</b> in the financial statements, their recognition and their roles in firm risk assessment. environmental liabilities; firm risk; accounting earnings; pension liabilities; financial leverage; risk assessment; Superfund sites; financial reporting. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Most {{models of}} {{intellectual}} capital measurment equal intellectual capital with intellectual assets. Nevertheless, companies sometimes must incur <b>liabilities</b> to make intellectual assets truly actionable. This fact suggests {{the existence of}} intangible <b>liabilities.</b> The aim {{of this paper is}} to refine the methods of assessment of intellectual capital by refining and extending the concept of intangible <b>liabilities.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper consists of a literature review of prior conceptualisations of intangible <b>liabilities,</b> and an empirical exploration of the employer-employee relationships that can originate intangible <b>liabilities.</b> Findings – The results of the empirical research show that a non-fulfilment of perceived obligations by the company might cause organisational members to refrain from deploying their organisational knowledge in organisational processes. Thus, these obligations can be conceptualised as intangible <b>liabilities.</b> Research limitations/implications – The research has only explored intangible <b>liabilities</b> related to organisational members. Future research should explore the intangible <b>liabilities</b> that an organisation can incur with other constituencies, e. g. suppliers and clients. Practical implications – Managers can improve their models of intellectual capital measurement taking into account not only the intangible assets, but also the intangible <b>liabilities.</b> Taking into account intangible <b>liabilities</b> should bring awareness of the conditions that might hinder the deployment of organisational knowledge. Originality/value – The study brings a more refined, theoretically- and empirically-based conceptualisation of intangible <b>liabilities</b> than those provided so far, aiding to develop a more robust theory of intellectual capital measurement.
