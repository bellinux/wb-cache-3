40|$|Eight men {{exercised}} at 66 % {{of their}} {{maximal isometric force}} to fatigue after prior decrease in the glycogen store in one leg (low-glycogen, LG). The exercise was repeated with the contralateral leg (control) at the same relative intensity and for the same duration. Muscle (quadriceps femoris) glycogen content decreased in the <b>LG</b> <b>leg</b> from 199 +/- 17 (mean +/- S. E. M.) to 163 +/- 16 mmol of glucosyl units/kg dry wt. (P less than 0. 05), and in the control leg from 311 +/- 23 to 270 +/- 18 mmol/kg (P less than 0. 05). The decrease in glycogen corresponded to a similar accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. Muscle glucose increased in the <b>LG</b> <b>leg</b> during the contraction, from 1. 8 +/- 0. 1 to 4. 3 +/- 0. 6 mmol/kg dry wt. (P less than 0. 01), whereas no significant increase occurred in the control leg (P greater than 0. 05). It is concluded that during exercise glucose is formed from glycogen through the debranching enzyme when muscle glycogen is decreased to values below about 200 mmol/kg dry wt...|$|E

40|$|Background. To {{investigate}} the climb stairs resistance exercise on nociception and axonal regeneration in the sciatic nerve of rats. Methods. 24 Wistar rats were divided: control group (CG—no injury), exercise group (EG—no injury with physical exercise), lesion group (LG—injury, but without exercise), and treated group (LEG—injury and physical exercise). <b>LG</b> and <b>LEG</b> {{were subjected to}} sciatic nerve compression with hemostat. From the 3 rd day after injury began treatment with exercise, and after 22 days occurs the removal of a nerve fragment for morphological analysis. Results. Regarding allodynia, CG obtained values less than EG (p= 0. 012) and larger than <b>LG</b> and <b>LEG</b> (p< 0. 001). Histological results showed that CG and EG had normal appearance, as <b>LG</b> and <b>LEG</b> showed up with large amounts of inflammatory infiltration, degeneration and disruption of nerve fibers, and reduction of the myelin sheath; however LEG presented some regenerated fibers. From the morphometric data there were significant differences, for nerve fiber diameter, comparing CG with <b>LG</b> and <b>LEG</b> and comparing axon diameter and {{the thickness of the}} myelin of the CG to others. Conclusion. Climb stairs resistance exercise was not effective to speed up the regenerative process of axons...|$|R
