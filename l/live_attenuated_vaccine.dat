5|$|The U.S. {{experienced}} {{an outbreak of}} 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year. Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York {{under the direction of}} H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950. His vaccine, however, being a live attenuated virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use. On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's <b>live,</b> <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine</b> was tested {{for the first time on}} an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York. After the child suffered no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> administered concurrently with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine to healthy children 12 to 15 months of age. METHODS: Children were assigned randomly to receive (1) measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, varicella vaccine, and intranasal placebo on day 0, followed by 1 dose of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on days 42 and 72; (2) measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccines</b> on day 0, {{followed by a}} second dose of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on day 42 and intranasally administered placebo on day 72; or (3) 1 dose of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on days 0 and 42, followed by measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines on day 72. Serum samples were collected before vaccination on days 0, 42, and 72. Reactogenicity events and adverse events were collected through day 41 after concurrent vaccinations and through day 10 after administration of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> or placebo alone. RESULTS: Among 1245 (99. 5 %) evaluable children, seroresponse rates and geometric mean titers for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine were similar with concurrent administration of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> or placebo (seroresponse rates of > or = 96 % for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and > or = 82 % for varicella vaccine in both groups). Hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates to influenza strains in <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza virus <b>vaccine</b> were similar after the vaccine was administered alone (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 92 %, and 44 % for H 3, B, and H 1 strains, respectively) or with measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 96 %, and 43 %). The incidences of reactogenicity events and adverse events were similar among treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent administration of <b>live</b> <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine provided equivalent immunogenicity, compared with separate administration, and was well tolerated.
