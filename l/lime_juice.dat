5|$|Cook {{attributed}} the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered {{that it be}} purified with <b>lime</b> <b>juice,</b> but this had little effect.

The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key <b>lime</b> <b>juice,</b> syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E

5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed <b>lime</b> <b>juice,</b> syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the {{expedition}} was estimated at £90,000 (2009 equivalent about £7.25 million), of which £45,000 was offered by the British Government provided that the two Societies could raise a matching sum. They achieved this, thanks largely to a donation of £25,000 from wealthy RGS member Llewellyn W. Longstaff. The RGS itself contributed £8,000, its largest single contribution to any expedition to that date, and £5,000 came from Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, who had earlier financed the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition to the Arctic, 1894–97. The rest was raised from smaller donations. The expedition also benefited from significant commercial sponsorship: Colman's provided mustard and flour, Cadbury's gave 3,500lb (1,600kg) of chocolate, Bird's donated baking and custard powders, Evans, Lescher & Webb provided all the <b>lime</b> <b>juice.</b> Jaeger gave a 40% discount on special clothing, Bovril supplied beef extract, and others made significant contributions.|$|E

50|$|In Indonesia, ayam kecap is {{pieces of}} chicken simmered in kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), spiced with shallot or onion, garlic, ginger, pepper, leek and tomato. Other version might add richer spices, {{including}} nutmeg and cloves. In Indonesia, the term ayam kecap is often interchangeable with ayam goreng kecap (a variant of ayam goreng in sweet soy sauce) and semur ayam, Indonesian sweet soy stew which uses chicken instead of beef. Since {{all of them}} are actually similar — if not almost identical, recipes of chicken cooked in sweet soy sauce. However, semur ayam often add richer spices, which includes clove, cinnamon and star anise. On the other hand, ayam goreng kecap has thicker sweet soy sauce and often added with slices of fresh lime or splash of <b>lime</b> <b>juices.</b> The main difference probably is its water content, despite quite moist, both ayam kecap and ayam goreng kecap are usually dryer and has thicker soy sauce compared to semur ayam which is more watery.|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: Acidic diet is {{one major}} cause of dentine hypersensitivity. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of different tropical fruit juices on dentine permeability and their erosive ability to remove the smear layer in extracted human teeth. Materials and methods: Thirty-six noncarious human premolars were used, and the dentine was exposed at the tip of the buccal cusp by cutting a cavity (diameter 3  mm, depth 3  mm). Permeability of the dentine was tested under different conditions: with a smear layer and 5  minutes after the application of freshly squeezed green mango, lime, tamarind, and starfruit juices. The smear layer was created before each treatment by gently cutting the dentine with a diamond bur. In the final treatment, the dentine was etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 30  seconds. The erosive ability of these fruit juices to remove the smear layer was also examined using a scanning electron microscope. Results: Results revealed that application of green mango, tamarind, <b>lime,</b> and starfruit <b>juices</b> for 5  minutes significantly increased dentine permeability by 128. 2 %, 73. 4 %, 80. 6 %, and 70. 4 %, respectively (P <  0. 05, Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance on ranks). The corresponding value of 37 % phosphoric acid was 125. 1 %. Scanning electron microscopy data showed that green mango and <b>lime</b> <b>juices</b> had very strong erosive ability to remove the smear layer, similar to 37 % phosphoric acid. Conclusion: We conclude that tropical fruit juices, especially green mango and lime, increase dentine permeability and have a strong erosive ability to remove the smear layer, which causes dentine hypersensitivity...|$|R
