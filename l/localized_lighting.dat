If a mesh covers more pixels in screen space than it has vertices, interpolating colour values from samples of expensive lighting calculations at vertices is less processor intensive than performing the lighting calculation for each pixel as in Phong shading. However, highly <b>localized</b> <b>lighting</b> effects (such as specular highlights, e.g. the glint of reflected light {{on the surface of}} an apple) will not be rendered correctly, and if a highlight lies {{in the middle of a}} polygon, but does not spread to the polygon's vertex, it will not be apparent in a Gouraud rendering; conversely, if a highlight occurs at the vertex of a polygon, it will be rendered correctly at this vertex (as this is where the lighting model is applied), but will be spread unnaturally across all neighboring polygons via the interpolation method.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a cascaded method for object detection. This approach uses a novel {{organization of the}} first cascade stage called “feature-centric ” evaluation which re-uses feature evaluations across multiple candidate windows. We minimize {{the cost of this}} evaluation through several simplifications: (1) <b>localized</b> <b>lighting</b> normalization, (2) representation of the classifier as an additive model and (3) discrete-valued features. Such a method also incorporates a unique feature representation. The early stages in the cascade use simple fast feature evaluations and the later stages use more complex discriminative features. In particular, we propose features based on sparse coding and ordinal relationships among filter responses. This combination of cascaded feature-centric evaluation with features of increasing complexity achieves both computational efficiency and accuracy.

In these experiments shoots for rooting were obtained by culturing shoot apices. The effect auxins (IAA,NAA,IBA), carbohydrate sources (glucose, fructose, sucrose), lighting conditions and dark treatment on rooting were tested. Dip treatment of shoots in 10 - 4 M IAA solution for three to seven days followed by transfer to auxin free medium produced the best rooting (62. 5 per cent). Addition of glucose at 60 g 1 - 1 into the culture medium as the carbohydrate source increased the rooting percentage (71. 4 per cent) nd stimulated secondary root formation. Sucrose at 60 gl- 1 produced a higher number of primary roots per shoot (4, 4) compared to roots per shoot inthe 60 gl- 1 glucose treatment (2. 3).

Around {{two thirds of the}} lighting systems nowadays are based on technologies developed before 1970, and they have lower performance that the current technology. A complete change of the lighting system and the implementation of control and regulation systems can provide relevant energy savings. This work presents a comparison about the energy efficiency of different control lighting systems applied to office spaces located in Spain. The work is based on DAYSIM and DIALUX calculations to perform daylighting, lighting systems and energy consumption derived from the use of lighting control systems. Different types of lighting systems and lighting controls are compared using fluorescent lamps to determinate what is the potential energy saving maintaining or increasing the quality of lighting level distribution on the workplane.

40|$|Use of {{lighting}} {{is crucial to}} make public urban places available during dark hours. Landscape architects participate in planning {{of lighting}}, but during our education {{there is very little}} taught on the subject. Through this study we approach the subject of lighting by looking into lighting methods for urban plant materials during winter. In this thesis we look into ways to emphasize the visible characters and experiences of urban plants during winter season using light. Target audience are landscape architect students and landscape architects without knowledge of lighting. The part of the thesis that describe basic conditions for, and visual characters of plants can be useful to lighting designers without knowledge in this subject. Working methods used were the following: • Pre-study about light and lighting techniques through literature and dialogues. • Compiling important visual winter plant characters through photography and literature. • Outdoor light experiments with plants. The plants were chosen on the premises that they are common in urban areas. Light sources and armatures were borrowed from companies. Methods for lighting were found in literature and through dialogues with lighting designers. The experiments were photographed and described in writing. • Interviews with people of different professions that {{in one way or another}} work with light design and through literature within the subject we ourselves set out to gain better knowledge. The result part of the thesis is divided into three sections: Light, Urban vegetation and Lighting of urban vegetation. In the first part, Light, we briefly describe what light is and how it allows us to see our surroundings and to understand what it is that we see. Light technique concepts that were important in this study are explained. These concepts are: Color temperature, color reprodution, colored light and luminous flux. The light sources used during light experiments are described. These light sources are: LED, Sodium-vapor lamp, Halogen lamp, Compact fluorescent lamp and Metal halide lamp. We also describe the impotance of avoiding glare and to consider surrounding elments such as weather and light from other light sources during the design process. In the second part the crucial factors for plants development and appearance are described. Among others these are: species, light conditions, water supply and conditions of soil. Visual characters among urban plants during winter time are presented. The characters are divided into following groups: architectural shape, cold colors, warm colors, wealth of details, shrubs and hedges, strong vertical form or prominent trunk and broad or hanging crown. A number of examples of species representing each character are presented. Their visual characters as well as their growing conditions are described. The third part discusses conflicts and possibilities when combining lighting and plants. Mechanical injuries, especially on the root system, as a result of careless installation of lighting occurs. To control lighting so that it adapts to the visual changes in vegetation over seasons. Urban vegetation that obscure safety lighting. Lighting’s influence on plants ability to enter a dormant phase. The light experiments are also presented here. A number of lighting methods, used to enhance a plants visual characters, are featured through photos and text.

In particular, the marginal and joint wavelet coefficient distributions, directional derivative distributions, and harmonic spectra of illumination maps resemble those documented in the natural image statistics literature. However, illumination maps differ from standard photographs in that illumination maps are statistically non-stationary and may contain <b>localized</b> <b>light</b> sources that dominate their power spectra.

Similar communications may operate between spatially distant chloroplasts in large cells where photosynthetic and respiratory activities are distributed unevenly under fluctuating patterned illumination. Microfluorometry of chlorophyll fluorescence in vivo in internodal cells of the alga Chara corallina revealed that a 30 -s pulse of <b>localized</b> <b>light</b> induces a transient increase (~ 25 %) in F′ fluorescence of remote cell parts exposed to dim background light at a 1. 5 -mm distance on the downstream side from the illuminated spot in the plane of unilateral cytoplasmic streaming but has no effect on F′ at equal distance on the upstream side. An abrupt arrest of cytoplasmic streaming for about 30 s by triggering the action potential extended either the ascending or descending fronts of the F′ fluorescence response, depending on the exact moment of streaming cessation. The response of F′ fluorescence to localized illumination of a distant cell region was absent in dark-adapted internodes, when the <b>localized</b> <b>light</b> was applied within the first minute after switching on continuous background illumination of the whole cell, but it appeared in full after longer exposures to continuous background light.
