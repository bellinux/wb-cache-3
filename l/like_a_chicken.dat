25|$|The Kushan Empire era {{statues of}} Kartikeya, dated to 1st and 2nd-century CE, {{have been found}} at various sites in the Indian subcontinent, {{particularly}} at Mathura and Gandhara. They show him as a warrior dressed in dhoti (sheet wrapped at waist, covering the legs), armour like a warrior, spear {{in his right hand}} and a bird (rooster) in his left. There is some difference between his ancient iconography in Mathura and Gandhara artwork. The Gandhara arts show him in more a Scythian dress, likely reflecting the local dress culture prevalent in those times. Further, it is in the oldest Gandharan statues where he is shown with a bird that looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>chicken</b> or cock. According to Richard Mann, the bird may symbolize Kartikeya's agility and maneuverability as a warrior god, and may be a Parthian influence. His iconography symbolizes his attributes as a hunter, warrior and philosopher.|$|E

[...] According to choreographer Hermes Pan, Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, [...] "came charging at him like a mother rhinoceros protecting her young." ...|$|E

500|$|Anbe Vaa was AVM Production's first {{colour film}} and {{was made in}} Eastmancolor. The film's {{principal}} photography began with a puja ceremony held on 12 August 1965. Although the story is set in Shimla, most of the film was shot in Ooty. Shooting in Shimla took place for only five days. For the sequences filmed in Shimla, P. N. Sundaram was hired as the cinematographer as Maruti Rao was taken ill at the time. The song [...] "Pudhiya Vaanam" [...] {{was shot in the}} small hill station of Kufri, located 13 kilometres from Shimla, as well as at Mall Road, Shimla. Portions of the film were also shot at a 200-year old bungalow covering 15 acres in Valparai. In a scene where T. R. Ramachandran's character eats chicken, Tirulokchandar requested his caterer to make a cake shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>chicken</b> for [...] T. R. Ramachandran to eat as the actor was a vegetarian.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of her 32 years as a jingle singer, November sang {{approximately}} 22,000 jingles which were played on the television and radio. [...] In the 1970s, it was estimated that 75% of the jingles that could be heard on the airways were sung by no more than 30 people, and November was known as the [...] "Jingle Queen". In several unusual jingles, she had to sing with different voices. She once sang as a person underwater, and for Chicken of the Sea, a brand of tuna, she sang <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>chicken</b> underwater. Her most notable [...] commercial was in an ad campaign for Meow Mix, where she was the voice ("Meow meow meow meow...") of a singing cat. The idea came from Ron Travisano at the advertising agency of Della Femina Travisano and Partners, who had the account with Ralston Purina in 1976. [...] Travisano put together film footage with editor Jay Gold, looping images of a cat {{to make it look like}} it was singing. Working from the film, Tom McFaul of the jingle house Lucas/McFaul composed music to fit, and Linda November sang the meowing melody. The campaign was a major success, spawned 81 other different commercials, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in residuals. Linda November was also one of the singers for Coca-Cola's [...] "Have a Coke and a Smile" [...] campaign, heard most famously on the 1979 Mean Joe Greene commercial, considered one of the top Super Bowl commercials of all time.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, Creme Eggs are advertised on {{television}} {{with a small}} white rabbit called the Cadbury Bunny (alluding to the Easter Bunny) which clucks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>chicken.</b> Ads for caramel eggs use a larger gold-coloured rabbit which also clucks, and chocolate eggs use a large brown rabbit which clucks in a deep voice. [...] The advertisements use the slogan [...] "Nobunny knows Easter better than him", spoken by TV personality Mason Adams. The ads have continued to air nearly unchanged into the high definition era, though currently the ad image is slightly zoomed to fill the screen. The majority of rabbits used in the Cadbury commercials are Flemish Giants.|$|E

2500|$|The band auditioned {{dozens of}} {{replacements}} for Criss in June 1980. One {{of the many}} who auditioned was Tico Torres (who would later be with Bon Jovi). They finally settled on a little-known drummer-guitarist-pianist-keyboardist-singer from Brooklyn named Paul Charles Caravello (born July 12, 1950) who adopted the stage name Eric Carr. His first make-up design was modeled on a hawk, though it was rejected as Stanley felt it looked more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>chicken.</b> Carr ultimately settled on a [...] "Fox" [...] persona. In his Fox make-up, he was introduced on ABC's Kids Are People Too!, and debuted with the group on July 25, 1980, at the Palladium concert hall in New York City. This was Kiss's only U.S. show in support of Unmasked. The band's 1980 tour of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, {{was one of the}} biggest in their history, as they played to sold-out crowds and received overwhelmingly positive press coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, due to Electronic Arts' {{increasing}} {{control over}} Bullfrog, others had similar feelings; Mark Healey (lead artist of Dungeon Keeper) {{stated that the}} company [...] "felt more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>chicken</b> factory" [...] after Electronic Arts' takeover, and also compared it to being assimilated by the Borg. Glenn Corpes (artist of Fusion and Populous) was not surprised at Molyneux's departure, and another employee believed that working for Bullfrog had become [...] "a job", and {{that the company had}} lost its innovation. In 2008, Electronic Arts' president John Riccitiello corroborated these sentiments by admitting that their [...] "dictatorial managerial approach" [...] had suppressed Bullfrog's creativity. Sean Cooper (designer of Syndicate) said that if he could travel back in time, he would probably force Molyneux to not sell Bullfrog to Electronic Arts, and described it as [...] "such a horrible time". Molyneux believed that Electronic Arts had good intentions with Bullfrog and said that [...] "they just wanted to make it nicer", and put their effects on the company down to [...] "love abuse".|$|E
2500|$|Foraging for {{invertebrate}} prey on {{the ground}} often involves gleaning the leaf litter of the forest floor, sometimes flicking, flipping, or scratching through dead leaves. Birds can use their bills to flick or toss dead leaves from the ground to reveal prey residing beneath. The leaftossers of Central and South America and the pittas and laughingthrushes of Asia do this. An example of a bird that employs flipping is the ovenbird, a species of North American wood-warbler. It deliberately turns over leaves {{on the ground}} to search for spiders, worms, and such underneath. [...] In other parts of the world, similar leaf-flipping behavior has been observed in unrelated birds, such as the jungle babbler of India. Some birds, such as hummingbirds, will use their wings to create a blast of air to roll leaves over. Other birds rake a foot through the leaf litter, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>chicken,</b> for the same purpose. This has been observed in buttonquails. Some American sparrows, such as the green-tailed towhee, perform a double-scratch by raking both legs simultaneously through the leaf-litter. They then catch prey items dislodged by the disturbance. Ground-foraging birds can be very hard for humans to observe, as they often occupy densely vegetated habitat, {{as in the case of}} the Bornean wren-babbler, which specializes in gleaning leaf litter in gullies in the forest of Southeast Asia.|$|E
