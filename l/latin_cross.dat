5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal cross on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple <b>Latin</b> <b>cross,</b> as {{is found in the}} arms of Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|In the Catholic Church, {{display of}} a cross behind the shield is {{restricted}} to bishops as a mark of their dignity. The cross of an ordinary bishop has a single horizontal bar or traverse, {{also known as a}} <b>Latin</b> <b>cross.</b> A patriarch uses the patriarchal cross with two traverses, also called the cross of Lorraine. The papal cross has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the <b>Latin</b> <b>Cross</b> shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a distinctly English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E
50|$|There is a Cornish {{cross on}} Laneast Down. It {{is unusual in}} being made of Polyphant stone rather than granite; {{the two sides of}} the head are {{elliptical}} and have <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The community’s arms {{might be}} {{described}} thus: Argent a bend wavy gules surmounted by a wheel spoked of six of the first, in chief an oak twig vert in bend, in base three <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> sable in bend.|$|R
50|$|Each {{of the two}} burial plots (Plot A and Plot B) contain 13 rows of headstones, which {{consist of}} either Stars of David or <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses.</b> There are 2,288 burials in the cemetery, 251 of which contain unknown remains.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} {{began in}} 1181. The monastic quarters {{and the church}} were built over the following three decades. The central cloister was bordered on the north by the church, on the west by a barrel-vaulted great nave, on the east by the sacristy, the priory cell, and the chapter house, and on the south by the kitchen, the pantry and the refectory (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2m) walls with slit windows, {{to serve as a}} refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built {{in the shape of a}} <b>Latin</b> <b>cross</b> with a nave divided into four sections, and a sanctuary with three square apses. Its presbytery had a central square topped by a pentagon.|$|E
5|$|Typically, cemeteries of {{more than}} 40 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice {{designed}} by architect Reginald Blomfield. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross. The cross is normally a freestanding four-point limestone <b>Latin</b> <b>cross,</b> mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet. A bronze longsword, blade down, is embedded {{on the face of}} the cross. This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, about 100 {{men of the}} 19th Infantry {{moved into}} the hills {{to the east of}} the town. They carried with them about 30 wounded, {{including}} several litter-bound patients too seriously wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the time they {{reached the top of the}} mountain, officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a Red Cross brassard identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white <b>Latin</b> <b>cross</b> brassard, identifying him as a military chaplain in the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. The two who remained and the wounded were non-combatants under international law, as they carried no weapons.|$|E
50|$|The church {{depends on}} the diocese of Novosibirsk. In 1999 the {{necessary}} procedures are carried out to obtain permission to build a church for the community. Work began in 2004 and took three years. The church combines the Byzantine style with modern contributions, as shown for example in the Gothic facade decorated with <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses.</b>|$|R
50|$|A tall {{cylindrical}} stone pillar {{with the}} top broken and missing. Three outline <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> are cut in, and a short inscription. The pillar is 1.14 m high, with a diameter of 0.38 m, tapering slightly towards the base. It was discovered 'under a hedge' at Cwrt Uchaf Farm in 1857, before being moved to join the Margam collection.|$|R
50|$|The {{memorial}} comprises {{a pedestal}} surmounted {{by a small}} concrete obelisk. It is surrounded by an octagonal enclosure of concrete kerbing with a decorative cast iron fence comprising thin pickets with fleur-de-lis finials. The posts are also cast iron and surmounted by <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses.</b> In front of the enclosure is a painted timber fence with a centrally placed cast iron gate.|$|R
5|$|The major {{exceptions}} to the common Greek cross plan are {{in the work of}} Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). The drive to Episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit at the end opposite the entrance. The <b>Latin</b> <b>Cross</b> form increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688–90), but the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before its completion and the chancel was blocked up, effectively transforming it into a T-plan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, in as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches. The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance. The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). The <b>Latin</b> <b>Cross</b> form, increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688–90), but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked up, making it, in effect, a T-plan.|$|E
25|$|On {{the reverse}} {{there is an}} {{octagonal}} ridge, which runs {{around the edge of}} the object. In the center of the octagonal ridge there is a <b>Latin</b> <b>cross.</b> There are four dots around the <b>Latin</b> <b>cross.</b> Similar dot markings are common on coins, even on coins from the late 900s.|$|E
50|$|In {{the centre}} of the four statues is a large obelisk sitting on a smooth-faced base capped with cyma recta mouldings. Bronze wreaths are located on the side and rear faces. <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> are {{attached}} to the front and rear faces, as are bronze letters forming the words LEST WE FORGET. Surmounting the obelisk is a larger than life-sized Winged Victory figure in Carrara marble.|$|R
50|$|The nationally renowned anti-Communist {{resistance}} shrine, the Hill of Crosses, {{upon which}} thousands of <b>Latin</b> Rite <b>crosses</b> {{of all sizes}} have been placed, is located {{near the city of}} Šiauliai. Erecting <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> on the hill was forbidden by the Czarist Russian Orthodox authorities in the 19th century. Later, in the 20th century, the Soviet authorities also forbade such explicit religious symbols. The crosses were removed in 1961 with tractors and bulldozers, but despite Soviet prohibitions, Catholics continued to put small crucifixes and larger crosses on the Hill of Crosses. Pope John Paul II visited the hill during his visit to Lithuania, primarily because it was a sign of anti-Communist Catholic resistance, as well as a Roman Catholic religious site. Lithuania was the only majority-Catholic Soviet republic.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "crucifer" [...] {{comes from}} the <b>Latin</b> crux (<b>cross)</b> and ferre (to bear, carry). It thus {{literally}} means [...] "cross-bearer".|$|R
25|$|Mother's Helper is a 16'-tall {{stainless}} steel highchair. The rockers on the highchair straddle a large {{stainless steel}} <b>Latin</b> <b>cross.</b> A bronze infant and dictionary are set {{on top of}} the cross.|$|E
25|$|Abbey and cathedral churches {{generally}} {{follow the}} <b>Latin</b> <b>Cross</b> plan. In England, the extension eastward may be long, while in Italy {{it is often}} short or non-existent, the church being of T plan, sometimes with apses on the transept ends {{as well as to}} the east. In France the church of St Front, Périgueux, appears to have been modelled on St. Mark's Basilica, Venice, or the Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles and is of a Greek cross plan with five domes. In the same region, Angoulême Cathedral is an aisless church of the <b>Latin</b> <b>cross</b> plan, more usual in France, but is also roofed with domes.|$|E
25|$|The {{design is}} {{ultimately}} derivative {{of the black}} cross used by the Teutonic Order. This heraldic cross took various forms throughout the order's history, including a simple <b>Latin</b> <b>cross,</b> a cross potent, cross fleury and occasionally also a cross pattée.|$|E
5000|$|Using a Christian cross as a {{memorial}} along a public highway {{can be seen as}} an illegal endorsement of religion and has been challenged in a growing number of lawsuits by secular groups concerned about {{the separation of church and}} state. [...] On August 18, 2010 the Tenth Circuit held that the State of Utah violated the Establishment Clause by constructing a series of 12-foot high <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> along the roadside to memorialize fallen state troopers. [...] In Lake Elsinore California, a personal roadside cross was removed following a complaint by the American Humanist Association.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of double diagonal and <b>cross</b> <b>Latin</b> squares for all order (except 2 and 3 {{in the first}} case) was shown by Hilton in 1971. Whereas a greatly simplified construction for double diagonal Latin squares was presented immediately afterwards by Gergely in 1972, it has apparently remained open to give simple methods for obtaining larger double diagonal or <b>cross</b> <b>Latin</b> squares for smaller ones. We show that for both types of Latin squares a Kronecker product construction can be devised, using an arbitrary (double-diagonal or <b>cross)</b> <b>Latin</b> square of order pq for any q>= 1. The construction is shown to require only linear time {{in the size of}} the constructed object in both cases. We also give a simple direct construction of <b>cross</b> <b>Latin</b> squares of all orders...|$|R
50|$|The World War I Cenotaph in Jubilee Park at Mackay is aesthetically {{significant}} for the accomplished composition of its design elements: the approach to a mausoleum-like pedestal representing the great loss of life incurred during this conflict and the wide-ranging grief expressed {{in response to the}} bodies of the fallen not being returned for local burial, its <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> and three-stepped base recalling Christianity, its Doric column evoking the architecture of classical antiquity, and the surmounting globe of white marble symbolising allegiance to the British Empire and pride in the sacrifices made on its behalf by a new nation.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} {{is occupied by}} a massive dome at the crossing of the <b>Latin</b> <b>cross</b> plan, creating a centralizing effect which contrasts the exterior impression of a linear or oblong building. Surrounding the main dome is a sophisticated system of barrel vaults and shallow, saucer-like secondary domes.|$|E
25|$|The Cathedral is {{a monumental}} neoclassical-style {{building}} designed in conformity to a <b>Latin</b> <b>cross</b> basilica plan — a departure on Latrobe’s part from previous American church architecture, but {{in keeping with}} longstanding European traditions of cathedral design. The plan unites two distinct elements: a longitudinal axis and a domed space.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1514 Arduino degli Arriguzzi {{proposed}} a revised {{plan in the}} form of a <b>Latin</b> <b>cross</b> with the intent to outdo even Saint Peter's Basilica of Rome, the greatest church of the Western Christian world even in its ancient version. According to tradition, Pope Pius IV halted such a majestic project.|$|E
60|$|He had {{scarcely}} {{been there}} a minute when he beheld a sort of procession advancing from the door in his front. It consisted first of Enoch the trapper, carrying a spade {{on his shoulder and}} a lantern dangling in his hand; then came Mrs. Day, the light of the lantern revealing that she bore in her arms curious objects about a foot long, in the form of <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> (made of lath and brown paper dipped in brimstone--called matches by bee-masters); next came Miss Day, with a shawl thrown over her head; and behind all, in the gloom, Mr. Frederic Shiner.|$|R
2500|$|The {{left field}} {{is charged with}} devices {{symbolic}} or significant of some fact connected {{with the history of}} Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. The rayed star, charged with the letter [...] "M" [...] in blue, is an emblem of Mary Mother of God, the Stella Matutina, under whose protection Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, represented by a tree, places all its hopes for growth and life. The <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> are emblems of Redemption and Catholicity. The crest is the count's coronet of the du Roscoat family and the motto [...] "Virtus cum Scientia," [...] is the one chosen by Mother Theodore Guerin, foundress of the Sisters of Providence in America.|$|R
50|$|The {{monument}} {{was designed}} by Hobart architectural firm Hutchinson and Walker, after their entry had won a public competition held in 1923 for the structure's design. Their original design was for an obelisk that was to stand 65 ft high, but {{it was decided to}} increase the height to 75 ft. The obelisk itself is stood upon a stepped plinth 8 m2 made from bluestone, and the obelisk is made from grey granite. The shaft of the obelisk is tapered with chamfered edges and is capped with a pyramidal cap. Directly beneath the cap on each side are back-lit red opaque glass <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses</b> that are illuminated constantly in remembrance of the dead.|$|R
25|$|Philip is {{commonly}} associated with {{the symbol of the}} <b>Latin</b> <b>cross.</b> Other symbols assigned to Philip include: the cross with the two loaves (because of his answer to the Lord in John 6:7), a basket filled with bread, a spear with the patriarchal cross, and a cross with a carpenter's square.|$|E
25|$|Most cathedrals {{and great}} churches have a {{cruciform}} groundplan. In churches of Western European tradition, {{the plan is}} usually longitudinal, {{in the form of}} the so-called <b>Latin</b> <b>Cross</b> with a long nave crossed by a transept. The transept may be as strongly projecting as at York Minster or not project beyond the aisles as at Amiens Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The {{third stage}} {{comprises}} the porch, including the west gable parapet wall surmounted by a <b>Latin</b> <b>cross</b> at its apex, the gable parapet {{wall to the}} nave also with a <b>Latin</b> <b>cross,</b> and the tiled roofs of the nave, apse and porch. The porch is {{to the west of}} the nave, its walls also constructed of random rubble with uncoloured concrete block quoins. The western porch facade has a rectangular window with three lights, the outer casements of which open outwards while the central light is fixed. There is a narrow, upright slit in the stone wall above the window. The western facade of the nave has a circular window in-filled with fixed louvers and topped by a stone drip moulding. Both gable parapets have moulded block-work coping. The northern elevation of the porch features a doorway now accessed by a ramp with a bell mounted to the right-hand side of the doorway that is framed in bevelled concrete.|$|E
50|$|Catholicism {{played a}} {{significant}} role in Lithuanian anti-communist resistance under the Soviet Union. Several Catholic priests were leaders of the anti-communist movements, and thousands of <b>Latin</b> rite <b>crosses</b> were placed on the Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai, despite its being bulldozed in 1961.|$|R
50|$|The English Place-Name Society {{gives the}} {{earliest}} {{reference to the}} village as Cruce Manus, the <b>latin</b> for <b>Cross</b> in Hand in 1547. The name {{is believed to be}} based on the legend that the Crusaders assembled here before sailing for the Holy Land from Rye to fight Saladin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{city has}} {{recently}} come under scrutiny {{as a result}} of this display. On October 19, 2015, the Freedom from Religion Foundation sent a letter to the City of Collins, on behalf of a local citizen, asking for displays of a religious nature to be removed from the Bettie D. Robertson City Park. The letter stated that, among other things, permanent displays of 3 <b>Latin</b> <b>crosses,</b> a statue of Jesus carrying a cross, and a globe with City of Collins displayed above Matthew 8:12 [...] "I am the Light of the World" [...] are unconstitutional and [...] "tremendously un-welcoming to non-Christians". It asks for immediate removal of the displays from Bettie D. Robertson park. The letter was met with great hostility from the citizens, with some calling for the complainant to leave the county.|$|R
