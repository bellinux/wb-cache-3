5|$|Heather has {{had enough}} of Will's pot-and-alcohol-fueled apathy. Despite Will's protestations, she takes the baby and walks out ("Too Much, Too Soon"). Around the same time, lying in a bed in an army {{hospital}} ("Before the Lobotomy"), Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness he has seen during wartime and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ("Extraordinary Girl"). He quickly {{falls in love with}} her. His hallucination disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ("Before the <b>Lobotomy</b> (Reprise)").|$|E
5|$|Lefante {{is found}} {{wandering}} on a roadside, but {{appears to have}} been given an improperly-performed <b>lobotomy.</b> Another woman, Alice Brandt, is later kidnapped. She wakes up bound to a dentist's chair, with her kidnapper brandishing an ice pick and speaking in German. Mulder returns to Washington, D.C. to digitally analyze the photos and finds no evidence that they were doctored. By closely examining the photos, he finds the face of an old man as well as the shadow of the kidnapper, who appears to be abnormally tall.|$|E
500|$|Lukather was {{a long-time}} {{member of the}} band Los <b>Lobotomys,</b> a {{collaboration}} of session musicians including jazz and be-bop player David [...] "Creatchy" [...] Garfield and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro, replaced after his death by Simon Phillips, who also replaced Porcaro in Toto. Los <b>Lobotomys</b> formed in the mid-1980s and played regular shows in the Los Angeles area, often inviting whatever session musicians happened to be available and in the area. They recorded an album under the Los <b>Lobotomys</b> name in 1989, and the band was heavily involved in the recording of Lukather's Candyman. Los <b>Lobotomys</b> recorded a live album in 2004 comprising several tracks from Candyman and from the 1989 album.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Lobotomies</b> were {{a common}} {{procedure}} during those years, but Crownsville Superintendent Dr. Morgenstern {{was opposed to}} them. In his 1950 Annual Report, he said that Crownsville has [...] "very few lobotomies". He also expressed {{his opposition to the}} trend [...] "to rely upon this operation to make the institutional case more manageable". In a report of March 1954, the Superintendent stated that <b>lobotomies</b> were not being done.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Karnaca, the player is tasked with rescuing Sokolov, who was kidnapped by the Crown Killer. Infiltrating Addermire Institute, where the Crown Killer is reportedly hiding out, the player discovers that the Crown Killer {{is in fact}} the alter ego of Karnaca's Chief Alchemist, Alexandria Hypatia (Jessica Straus). Hypatia accidentally created the Crown Killer persona when she tested an experimental serum on herself, and the Duke exploited her by using the Crown Killer to frame Emily. The player has the choice of either killing her or curing her condition. After investigating Addermire, it is made known that Sokolov was imprisoned by Kirin Jindosh (John Gegenhuber), the Duke's Grand Inventor and creator of the clockwork soldiers. The player enters Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion, kills him or performs an electrical <b>lobotomy</b> on him thus stripping him of his intellect, and frees Sokolov. Sokolov then directs the player to eliminate Breanna Ashworth (Melendy Britt), the curator of the Royal Conservatory and witch working for Delilah. The player enters the Royal Conservatory and discovers that after Delilah's defeat at the hands of Daud, who was responsible for assassinating Emily's mother, it was Ashworth who brought Delilah back from the Void. Ashworth is eliminated by way of a fatal attack or having her powers removed.|$|E
25|$|The American term <b>lobotomy</b> {{has never}} been used by medical writers in the UK to {{describe}} a psychosurgical operation on the frontal lobe. The standard Freeman-Watts operation, called a <b>lobotomy</b> in the USA, was called a leucotomy in the UK. Freeman later developed a psychosurgical technique in which an instrument is inserted through the eye-socket. It became known as a transorbital <b>lobotomy</b> in the USA and a transorbital leucotomy in the UK (where it was less popular). However the term <b>lobotomy</b> is occasionally used by British journalists synonymously with leucotomy, either to describe the standard operations of former decades or occasionally as a generic term for all psychosurgical operations.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 biopic film Frances depicts actress Frances Farmer (the {{subject of}} the film) {{undergoing}} transorbital <b>lobotomy</b> (though {{the idea that a}} <b>lobotomy</b> was performed on Farmer, and that Freeman performed it, has been criticized as having little or no factual foundation).|$|E

25|$|The <b>lobotomy</b> {{procedure}} {{could have}} severe {{negative effects on}} a patient's personality and ability to function independently. <b>Lobotomy</b> patients often show a marked reduction in initiative and inhibition.

50|$|In the 1940s the Burlingame Research Building was {{constructed}} {{on the northwest}} corner of the IOL grounds, which contained operating suites. <b>Lobotomies</b> were performed there until the 1960s. These operating rooms were constructed because neurosurgeons were not allowed to perform <b>lobotomies</b> at Hartford Hospital, which is located across Retreat Avenue. Special elevators were installed in the building to transport patients without jarring bumps from the operating rooms on one floor to the recovery rooms on a different floor. Today, no research is performed in the Research Building.|$|R

500|$|Candyman, {{recorded}} and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who {{were for the}} most part also in Lukather's band Los <b>Lobotomys.</b> Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John Peña, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. Some international fans were confused about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los <b>Lobotomys</b> album. The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los <b>Lobotomys</b> name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song [...] "Red House".

5000|$|The {{patients}} at the hospital {{were thought to be}} no longer human, and therefore, many were abused, and some even died.

5000|$|Neurologist Walter Freeman used medical {{instruments}} called leucotomes, {{and later}} orbitoclasts, {{both of which}} were essentially ice picks, to perform transorbital <b>lobotomies.</b> This operation was informally called [...] "ice pick lobotomy": the leucotome was hammered into the patient's brain with a rubber mallet via the eye's tear duct.|$|R
