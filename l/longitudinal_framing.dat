25|$|From 1912 Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila ("Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company") — {{founded in}} 1909 by Weetman Pearson {{to develop the}} newly found Mexican oil fields, nationalized in 1938 as Pemex — also had its own tanker fleet. They quickly adopted Isherwood's new <b>longitudinal</b> <b>framing</b> system that allowed much larger ships and a simpler {{construction}} process. Just before World War I it owned a fleet of 20 tankers. Standard Oil did not participate directly in the newly discovered oil fields in Texas — such as Spindletop — and Oklahoma, which gave opportunities for new oil companies as Gulf Oil and Texas Fuel Company, later Texaco. Avoiding the use of Standard Oil's pipe line system, they started using tankers to get their oil to the East Coast. In combination with the oil fields discovered in Mexico and Venezuela, this caused {{a rise in the}} demand for tankers, which gave opportunities for the first independents, such as the Norwegian Wilh. Wilhelmsen, that launched its first tanker in 1913.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>framing</b> was a known {{method of}} {{shipbuilding}} before Isherwood. Naval engineer J. Scott Russell, for instance, had built several longitudinally framed ships, including the SS Great Eastern. However, {{no one had}} made the process practical from a commercial standpoint, which was Isherwood's achievement. The first commercial vessel constructed with the Isherwood system, the oil-tank steamer Paul Paix, of some 6,600 tons deadweight in 1908, was scrutinized by other shipbuilders and owners. The success {{of it and the}} first general cargo liner to be constructed on the [...] "Isherwood" [...] system, the Gascony in early 1909, encouraged builders in a number of countries to use <b>longitudinal</b> <b>framing</b> as well.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{computational}} {{and experimental}} results, a simplified {{model of the}} progressive collapse resistance of a RC frame after a side column is removed {{was proposed in which}} frame beams and slabs are taken as the catenary mechanism and tensile membrane mechanism, respectively. In the catenary mechanism, the axes of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>frame</b> beams can be taken as straight. For the tensile membrane mechanism, the internal area of the frame slabs surrounded by the negative moment yield lines can be viewed as an analysis object, and its two areas of progressive collapse resistance were still in two different planes at the collapse limit state.|$|R

500|$|The {{design for}} the ships of the Magdeburg class was {{prepared}} in 1908–1909. The design incorporated a number of innovations, including a new <b>longitudinal</b> <b>frame</b> system in the hull, the development of which delayed construction by three to four years. The hull form was also redesigned to improve efficiency, and a new clipper bow was used instead of the old cruiser ram bow. They were the first German light cruisers to incorporate an armored belt at the waterline; this increased {{the strength of the}} hull and became standard practice in warship construction for decades. The quarterdeck was cut down to provide [...] a location to drop mines. All of these features became standard for subsequent German cruiser designs.|$|R
5000|$|There were twelve 'standard' vessels {{built to}} a common Admiralty design, and eight builders' {{specials}} that (except for Garland) had a shorter, less beamy hull; five of the latter were from Thornycroft with [...] (one of Thornycroft's ships, , was planned to diesel cruising motors, but these were not ready in time and Hardy was completed with Thornycroft's standard machinery). One by Parsons (...) had semi-geared turbines giving a speed of 31 kn on trials, with a seventh from Fairfields had a clipper bow. The eighth 'special' was [...] by William Denny, Dumbarton, which was built using <b>longitudinal</b> <b>framing</b> rather than conventional transverse framing.

50|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>framing</b> (also {{called the}} Isherwood system after British naval {{architect}} Sir Joseph Isherwood, who patented it in 1906) {{is a method}} of ship construction in which large, widely spaced transverse frames are {{used in conjunction with}} light, closely spaced longitudinal members. This method, Isherwood felt, lent a ship much greater longitudinal strength than in ships built in the traditional method, where a series of transverse frames were fit together closely from the keel upwards.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{outstanding}} example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type {{were based on a}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>frame,</b> with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting {{in much the same way}} as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.|$|R
