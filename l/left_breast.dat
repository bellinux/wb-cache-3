5|$|The {{star of the}} Order was an eight-pointed figure, {{with the}} four {{cardinal}} points longer than the intermediate points. Each point was shown as a cluster of rays.

5|$|CMDCM {{insignia}} {{are similar}} to the insignia for Master Chief, except that the rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (i.e., MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for Command Master Chief are silver, while stars for Fleet or Force Master Chief are gold. Additionally, CMDCMs wear a badge, worn on their <b>left</b> <b>breast</b> pocket, denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).|$|E
5|$|The uniform was regular SS M43 field-jacket issue, with a divisional collar patch {{showing an}} arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. On {{the left arm}} was a Croatian armshield (red-white {{chessboard}}) and on the right an Edelweiss flower patch. The chessboard armshield was controversial, especially with the imams, who, after crossing the Sava river, removed them.

5|$|Until 2009 {{the wearing}} of Boat Club Jackets (ivory with navy blue piping and cuff rings, bearing the three ostrich feather emblem on the <b>left</b> <b>breast)</b> {{was limited to the}} 1st and 2nd Summer VIII's and Torpids and the Oriel College Boat Club Committee.

5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her <b>left</b> <b>breast,</b> one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the <b>left</b> <b>breast,</b> which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In this study, our {{aim is to}} {{retrospectively}} evaluate, in {{the light}} of literature, mammographic find­ings of 5100 patients whose mammography imaging was performed from 2010 to 2015 in the Medical Faculty, Dicle University, and Children’s and Obstetrics Hospital, Diyarbakır. Methods: We retrospectively examined 5400 mam­mograms. Since the report and age data regarding 300 cases were missing, they were excluded from the study, and hence 5100 cases were included into the study. Each patient’s age, mammography findings were evaluated. Breast imaging results were categorized according to BI­RADS (Breast imaging reporting and data system) clas­sification. Results: The mean age of 5100 patients included into the study was 51. 0 years. The localization of the lesion was detected most in the upper outer quadrant in both right and <b>left</b> <b>breasts</b> (62. 9...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to analyze {{bilateral}} asymmetry in mammograms based upon systematic comparison of paired mammographic strips of the right and <b>left</b> <b>breasts</b> of a patient. Similarity between corresponding directional structures was quantified by applying measures of similarity to the masked strips. A novel application of Moran's index was designed to measure the angular covariance between rose diagrams related to the phase and magnitude responses of multidirectional Gabor filters. A set of 128 mammograms from the DDSM database, including 32 normal and 32 asymmetric pairs, was used to validate the procedure. The leave-one-patient-out method was used for cross-validation of the results. The best result, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 8435, was achieved using similarity measures on craniocaudal views and Fisher-linear discriminant analysis. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed techniques can be applied for computer-aided detection of bilateral asymmetry. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{this paper}} we compare a highly {{accurate}} supervised to an unsupervised technique that uses breast thermal images {{with the aim}} of assisting physicians in early detection of breast cancer. Methods: First, we segmented the images and determined the region of interest. Then, 23 features that included statistical, morphological, frequency domain, histogram and gray-level co-occurrence matrix based features were extracted from the segmented right and <b>left</b> <b>breasts.</b> To achieve the best features, feature selection methods such as minimum redundancy and maximum relevance, sequential forward selection, sequential backward selection, sequential floating forward selection, sequential floating backward selection, and genetic algorithm were used. Contrast, energy, Euler number, and kurtosis were marked as effective features. Results: The selected features were evaluated by fuzzy C-means clustering as the unsupervised method and compared with the AdaBoost supervised classifier which has been previously studied. As reported, fuzzy C-means clustering with a mean accuracy of 75...|$|R
