I-165 conducted another reconnaissance patrol off north western Australian between 31 May and 5 July 1944. This was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> Japanese submarine entered Australian waters.|$|E

Its legs are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 4 August 2004, marked the 90th anniversary of Britain's entry into the First World War. Allingham attended, together with three other First World War veterans, William Stone, Fred Lloyd and John Oborne. Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint-Omer on Armistice Day. That was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> First World War veteran marched past the Cenotaph and it {{marked the end of}} an era. No First World War veterans were present at the Cenotaph for the 2006 Remembrance Sunday Parade.|$|E

50|$|In {{its first}} four decades, the LPGA Tour was {{dominated}} by American players. Sandra Post of Canada became the first player living outside the United States to gain an LPGA tour card in 1968. The non-U.S. contingent is now very large. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>an</b> American player topped the money list was in 1993, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>an</b> American led the tour in tournaments won was in 1996, and from 2000 through 2009, non-Americans won 31 of 40 major championships.|$|R
5|$|In 1924–25, {{after the}} Metropolitans folded {{and the rest}} of the PCHA merged with the WCHL, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars. In his first season with the Cougars, Holmes posted a 16–12 regular season record, with three shutouts and a 2.25goals-against average. In the WCHL playoffs, Holmes was undefeated in four games. He had two wins and ties each, with one shutout and a 1.75goals-against average. In the Stanley Cup final, Holmes posted a 3–1 record with a 2.00goals-against average against the Montreal Canadiens. It was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup. It was Holmes' fourth and last Stanley Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{returned}} for the Europe/Africa Zone Group II tie versus Luxembourg. He beat Laurent Bram, a tennis coach, 6–0, 6–0, 6–0, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> Briton had achieved this score line in Davis Cup was Alan Mills defeating Josef Offenheim in 1959, also against Luxembourg. Andy and Jamie Murray teamed {{up for the}} first time in Davis Cup doubles for a straight sets win. In his second singles match, Andy then recorded a third straight sets victory, over world No. 81 Gilles Müller, with Great Britain eventually winning 4–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Holmes had a 15–11–4 {{regular season}} record, with four shutouts and a 1.68goals-against average. In the WHL playoffs, Holmes nearly duplicated his {{results from the}} previous season, posting a 2–0–2 record, with one shutout and a 1.45 goals-against average. In the 1926 Stanley Cup final, the Cougars lost the series 3–1 against the Montreal Maroons. That marked the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> non-NHL team appeared in the Stanley Cup finals, as the WHL folded after the 1926 Stanley Cup final, and its players were absorbed by the NHL. It was Holmes' seventh and final Stanley Cup final appearance.|$|E

5|$|The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> car had {{finished}} in first and second-place in its début rally was 20 {{years ago in}} the 1987 Monte Carlo Rally, when Miki Biasion and Juha Kankkunen came first and second in all-new Lancia Delta HF 4WDs. The Delta HF 4×4 also won two-thirds of all the stages of that 1987 rally, just like the C4 did this time around. Lancia also won both the Group A and Group N categories in the race, while Citroën won the 4-wheel drive WRC category and came first in the 2-wheel drive Super 1600 category.|$|E
5|$|For Germany, {{the final}} result meant that, for the fourth {{straight}} time, they were positioned among the tournament's top 3 teams; moreover, the victory allowed the Germans {{to become the first}} side to reach eight World Cup finals. The match was a record 12th time a German team played in a semi-final. Germany became the first team to score 7 goals in a World Cup semi-final. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> team scored six goals was West Germany in 1954 versus Austria, same as in both semi-finals in 1930. It was Germany's highest half-time lead in a World Cup match, with their previous best being 4–0 against Saudi Arabia in 2002, the match finished 8–0 which is Germany's biggest World Cup victory. Only two teams have previously trailed by at least five goals at half-time: Zaire (versus Yugoslavia in 1974) and Haiti (versus Poland in 1974). The seven goals scored by Germany reflected a better goal-scoring record in the World Cup Finals than that of 28 other nations in their respective history of the World Cup.|$|E
5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their sleeves and played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the entire team, and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; it was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|Shepard and Kasumi {{travel to}} the planet Bekenstein, where Hock is {{throwing}} a party at his mansion {{for some of the}} galaxy's richest people. After getting samples of Hock's DNA from his private quarters, recording a sample of his voice, and disabling the vault's defenses, Kasumi and Shepard infiltrate the vault. As Kasumi starts cracking the graybox, the pair is detected and attacked by Hock's forces. Kasumi and Shepard eventually manage to escape in a shuttle after destroying a gunship piloted by Hock. After the mission, Kasumi accesses the graybox and sees her partner one <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> hologram of Okuda reveals the data, saying that it would impact humanity's reputation if made public. He begs her to destroy the data along with his memories. Kasumi has trouble letting him go, showing that their relationship was much more than professional. Shepard can persuade Kasumi to follow Keiji's wishes or keep the data.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. The simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during a transit of Venus will be on 5 April 15,232. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> solar eclipse occurred during a transit of Venus was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|The two cruisers {{ordered in}} the 1905–1906 program {{represented}} a continuation in the slow, upward trend in displacement, {{though the two}} ships had the same top speed as the earlier Königsberg-class ships. Like the preceding classes, one ship was equipped with turbine engines, and one with reciprocating machinery; {{this was to be}} the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> German cruiser utilized the older triple-expansion engines. All subsequent designs adopted steam turbines universally. Dresden and Emden had very active and short careers. Both vessels served on foreign stations for the majority of their careers; Emden was assigned to the East Asia Squadron after she entered service, and Dresden spent much time off the North American Atlantic coast.|$|E

5|$|After embarking from Tynemouth, Harald and Tostig {{probably}} {{landed at}} the River Tees. They then entered Cleveland, and started plundering the coast. They encountered the first resistance at Scarborough, where Harald's demand for surrender was opposed. In the end, Harald resorted to burning down {{the town and}} this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. After further raiding, Harald and Tostig sailed down the Humber, disembarking at Riccall. News of the invasion soon reached the earls Morcar of Northumbria and Edwin of Mercia, and they fought against Harald's invading army two miles (3km) south of York at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September. This would be the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> Scandinavian army defeated English forces. The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig, Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in Tadcaster, just seven miles from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall. From there, he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet, preparing a surprise attack. As Harald had left no forces in York, Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to Stamford Bridge.|$|E
