50|$|Loop 12 is a {{state highway}} that runs mostly within the city limits of Dallas, Texas. The western segment of the loop is named after General Walton Walker who served and died in South Korea. During the 1950s and 1960s, Loop 12 was the outer beltway in the Dallas area, having since been supplanted by Interstate 635, which is itself being supplanted by the President George Bush Turnpike (SH 190). Loop 12 is, however, the only state highway in Dallas that forms a {{complete}} <b>loop</b> (<b>Belt</b> Line Road is also a complete loop but is not a state road except for a stretch as part of Farm to Market Road 1382).|$|E

He built a Renaissance staircase tower with a polygonal shaft topped by a terrace. The steps lead to an eight-wedged palmtree-shaped vault, quite similar to those found in Angers’ Barrault dwelling and Saumur’s town hall. The stairs are decorated by pilasters bordering the windows; medallions, putti and candelabra carried by lion’s paws.A central panel shows a helmet bearing the family’s motto [...] "Chambe Crie".

5000|$|Dart's {{elevator}} utilized a set {{of grain}} bins. On top {{of them was a}} cupola that had equipment for weighing. Incoming grain was taken to the top by the grain elevator vertical assembly and discharged by gravity to storage after being weighed. Then sold grain to be transferred was taken from the storage bins. It was elevated again to the cupola, weighed out and dispensed to a barge, train or grain carriage vehicle. The" [...] marine leg" [...] of the elevator was most important to these procedures and functions.

The [...] "loose leg" [...] was kept in a raised position within the grain elevator building when not in use. That required an unusual tower above the cupola roof.

40|$|AbstractAviation safety {{regulations}} permit the carriage {{of an infant}} passenger on the lap of an adult. This practice {{is known to be}} unsafe in emergency landing scenarios; however, no prior study has quantified the risk of injury associated with this seating configuration. Depending on the jurisdiction the flight is operating under, the infant must either be unrestrained or restrained by a supplementary <b>loop</b> <b>belt.</b> No prior study has compared the relative safety of these restraint conditions. A validated numerical model was used as an experimental platform for the prediction of occupant injury potential with a focus on head injury. Observations were used in three ways: to compare the relative safety of different configurations, to evaluate safety in terms of a published occupant protection standard and to predict the occurrence and severity of a particular injury. Analysis involving the lap-held infant demonstrated that this seating arrangement does not represent a means of protecting an infant from injury in an emergency landing scenario regardless of restraint condition. During the impact sequence an unrestrained lap-held infant is likely to be projected through the aircraft cabin, while a lap-held infant restrained by a supplementary <b>loop</b> <b>belt</b> is at risk of serious abdominal injuries...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a new {{continuously variable transmission}} (CVT) {{that may be used}} in a variety of machines and transport devices. Unlike many CVTs that are relatively heavy and bulky, the present CVT, named “eDrive”, is fairly small and lightweight. These attributes allow eDrive to be used in human-powered transport devices such as bicycles. The eDrive incorporates a sprocket able to vary its effective diameter via computer controlled actuation. The sprocket accommodates a rotational input and provides an output using a <b>loop</b> <b>belt</b> rotationally engaged with sprocket. The eDrive promises to increase a bicyclist's user experience, provide more efficient conversion of human energy to locomotion, and overall promote sustainable urban transportation. In addition, eDrive can be configured and scaled to provide CVT functionality for a variety of other vehicles and machines, such as wind or water turbines and electric vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Aviation safety {{regulations}} in Australia and overseas permit the carriage {{of an infant}} passenger on the lap of an adult; however, this practice {{is known to be}} unsafe in an emergency landing scenario. While automotive child restraint systems (CRS) have been found to provide adequate protection to infant passengers, safety issues associated with their use have been identified. Principally, they may interfere with the dynamic behaviour of the aircraft seat, increasing the risk of injury to an adult seated directly behind. This study compared and evaluated the safety of seating arrangements involving infant air transport passengers under emergency landing conditions. Two arrangements were considered: the infant was either held on the lap of an adult or seated in a forward-facing CRS. A partially validated numerical model was used to study seat behaviour and measure injury potential. Results were analysed to compare the safety of different configurations, to evaluate safety in terms of an occupant protection standard and to predict the occurrence and severity of a particular injury using existing biomechanical relationships. One of two practices applies to lap-held infants depending on the jurisdiction a flight is operating under: the infant is either unrestrained or restrained by a supplementary <b>loop</b> <b>belt.</b> This study found that an unrestrained infant is likely to be projected through the aircraft cabin during the impact sequence while a restrained infant is at risk of serious abdominal injuries. Though the adoption of an emergency brace position by an adult carrying a lap-held infant was found to be beneficial, infant injury potential remained high. Of the three brace positions studied, a modified position proposed by this study was the most effective in reducing head injury potential for the infant. Three CRS installation methods - the aircraft seat lap belt, ISOFIX and LATCH - were analysed in terms of CRS performance and behaviour. Each method adequately protected the CRS occupant. The ISOFIX method resulted in a small increase in head injury potential for an adult seated directly aft while in the lap belt and LATCH cases a significant increase was observed. Some airlines specifically prohibit the use of Australian-certified CRS, presumably due to a requirement for installation using a &lsquo;top tether&rsquo; strap. This study found that the use of a top tether does not present any benefit in terms of CRS motion or injury potential for the CRS occupant. This study makes four recommendations: 1. The practice of holding an infant passenger on the lap should be prohibited. Until this is the case, advice on emergency brace positions involving lap-held infants should be revised to include a lateral offset between the head of the infant and that of the adult. 2. The use of automotive child restraints to restrain infant passengers should be mandated. 3. &nbsp;Any requirement for the use of a top tether in aircraft CRS installations should be removed. 4. Child restraint systems should be installed in outboard seats directly forward of a bulkhead, unoccupied space or another CRS...|$|E
