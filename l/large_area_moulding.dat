40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} are fabricated structures {{composed of}} a periodic arrangement of materials with differing indices of refraction. This {{research has focused on}} the realization of two distinct photonic crystal structures in which <b>large</b> <b>area</b> has played a key role: 1) <b>large</b> <b>area</b> broadband saturable Bragg reflectors, and 2) <b>large</b> <b>area</b> 2 D photonic crystal devices. Saturable Bragg reflectors (SBRs) can be used to self-start ultra-short pulse generation in a variety of solid state and fiber lasers. To form shorter pulses, SBRs with broadband reflectivity and <b>large</b> <b>area</b> (100 's of [mu]m) are required. This thesis describes the design and fabrication of <b>large</b> <b>area</b> broadband saturable Bragg reflectors through the monolithic integration of semiconductor saturable absorbers with <b>large</b> <b>area</b> broadband Bragg mirrors. One of the key elements for realizing this device is the development of a wet oxidation process to create buried low-index [...] . layers over <b>large</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Large</b> <b>area</b> 2 D photonic crystals enable new methods for routing and guiding light with applications in compact integrated optical circuits. This research has explored the design and fabrication of two <b>large</b> <b>area</b> (centimeter-scale) 2 D photonic crystal devices: a superprism and a super- collimator. (cont.) A superprism is a photonic crystal device in which the direction of light propagation is extremely sensitive to the wavelength and angle of incidence. A super- collimator is a device in which light is guided by the dispersion properties of a photonic crystal slab without boundaries which define the light's path. Design, fabrication, and testing are discussed for both 2 D photonic crystal devices. bu Sheila N. Tandon. Thesis (Ph. D.)
