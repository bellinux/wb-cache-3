5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving drystone walls rise to about threemetres (10ft) and are more than fourmetres (13ft) thick in some places.|$|E

5|$|In rural Alberta, Canada, a {{telephone}} lineman is stung by a bee {{as he works}} {{at the top of}} a pole. Five identical boys approach and watch as the lineman adversely reacts to the sting, causing him to fall to the ground and die. The boys <b>look</b> <b>down</b> at his body, then walk off silently.|$|E
5|$|The two {{remaining}} brigades dug in along a ridge of high ground that, if lost, offered the Germans {{a position to}} <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on the British landing zone. The 1st Special Service Brigade was in the north on a line from Hameau Oger to Le Plain. In between the commandos and the airlanding brigade was the 3rd Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a <b>look</b> <b>down</b> capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You've come {{round to}} it, then?' he said, {{giving her a}} {{pleasant}} look from his twinkling, almost kindly eyes. She <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at him and turned aside. She <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on him both literally and figuratively. Still he persisted, and triumphed.|$|R
5000|$|Nir Lacost (ניר לה-קוסט) - A rich narcissist snob.

5|$|Matthews went on {{to release}} her first solo album, Cockahoop, in May 2003. Her second album Never Said Goodbye was {{released}} in August 2006. In November 2007 she released a mini-album of Welsh language songs Awyren=Aeroplane on the My Kung Fu label. Matthews returned in late 2009 as the first recording artist to release albums simultaneously in both Welsh and English (Paid Edrych I Lawr and Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Down,</b> respectively). Powell {{has gone on to}} write songs, including for Duffy, and from 2007 onwards has presented a Welsh language show on Radio Cymru. He also replaced drummer Stuart Cable from the Stereophonics, following his death, in the supergroup The Stand. They released a charity single in 2010 to fund construction of a statue of Welsh footballer Fred Keenor in Cardiff city centre.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on the Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless, {{and that he could}} not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

Coniston believes, and always will believe, that the social bars are strong enough. So Cynthia <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at the reins.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{products}} of snow aked Euclidean lines are not minimal for <b>looking</b> <b>down.</b> This question {{was raised in}} Fractured fractals and broken dreams, Problem 11. 17, by David and Semmes. The proof uses arguments developed by Le Donne, Li and Rajala {{to prove that the}} Heisenberg group is not minimal for <b>looking</b> <b>down.</b> By a method of shortcuts, we de ne a new distance d such that the product of snow aked Euclidean lines <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on (R N, d), but not vice versa...|$|R

5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E

25|$|Unlike many boxers, Norton {{would often}} {{not attempt to}} stare down an {{opponent}} while announcements were made before the match started. Instead, he'd often <b>look</b> <b>down</b> at the floor and gather his thoughts. He was also widely noted for his fine athletic build.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, a {{bronchoalveolar lavage}} may {{be carried out}} - an {{endoscope}} is used to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> the trachea, and mucus and cells are washed out of the lower airways for analysis.

Wealth is rushing in upon us like a freshet.|$|E
