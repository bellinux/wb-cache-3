5000|$|Lacrosse leg guards or [...] "irons" [...] {{have taken}} a massive {{evolution}} {{since the early days}} of the sport. Early goaltenders wore cricket pads made from thin but rigid padding and a thick cloth material. [...] Eventually these evolved into a cross between cricket and baseball catcher's <b>leg</b> <b>guard.</b> [...] Like cricket, the irons covered high above the knee, while having an exoskeleton of molded plastic caps and shin plates to deflect shots and leave less or no bruising like in baseball. In the 2000s and 2010s, the size rules for these pads were very much tested as a market emerged for new lacrosse goalie equipment. Irons grew in width until it was arguable that they were no longer designed to protect the shin, but largely to cover more net. Eventually there was a push back, the Canadian Lacrosse Association and its partners set limitations on shin guard wideness.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a novel force acquisition system capable of measuring the force profiles of high-energy short-duration impacts. This force acquisition system {{was used to}} test dynamically a cricket <b>leg</b> <b>guard</b> and to create a contour map of the peak transmitted forces across the garment’s surface. The cricket <b>leg</b> <b>guard</b> was found to provide most protection in the central shin and knee regions, areas most likely to be impacted normally and so to receive the highest-energy impacts. The use of this system will enable a dynamic test procedure to be developed to mimic impact conditions encountered during a game, allowing optimization of cricket pad designs for specific impacts...|$|E

A major reason for this is the tradition and conservative attitudes associated with many sports, although the absence of appropriate tools and techniques to assist the design and development process has also played a large part. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop the first stage of a method of identifying specific regions of the human anatomy that are at the greatest risk of sustaining injury during participation in sports in which the player is subjected to multiple ballistic impacts. It is proposed that the findings could be used to confirm future designs of sports PPE. Previous studies have identified the amount and the location of the protection provided by current commercially available products but, until now, no evidence has been reported to determine what protection is required based on an understanding of the likely impact and the anatomy of the athlete. Using the leg and cricket as examples of an anatomical feature and a sporting application respectively, the severity and probability of injury due to ball impacts typically observed in play are quantified, with respect to their location on the leg, to estimate the level of risk in that region. Results show that the level of risk is greatest in the shin regions of the front leg, suggesting that this region should be offered the greatest degree of protection, as is generally the case in commercially available <b>leg</b> <b>guard</b> designs. Conversely, however, the inner region of the mid shin of the back leg is at the lowest risk, suggesting that protection in this region might be substantially reduced, a feature which is certainly not included in current product; such a reduction may significantly enhance the ergonomic performance of the <b>leg</b> <b>guard</b> design. The findings of this preliminary study indicate that the method offers the potential to quantify the relative risk of sustaining injury, in a sports specific application, as a function of location on the body and is thus a potentially useful design tool for design engineers of sports PPE. Given the embryonic nature of this approach, however, a number of assumptions and additional considerations is presented which reveal that, whilst the technique offers additional design insight, further research is required before it should be applied to equipment design. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. During the design of sports equipment, the main focus is usually on physical performance attributes, neglecting key subjective factors such as feel and comfort. The personal protective equipment worn in sport is a typical example, where injury prevention has taken precedence over user comfort, but it is anticipated that with {{a new approach to}} the design process, comfort can be improved without sacrificing protection. Using cricket leg guards and taekwondo chest guards as an example, this study aimed to develop a systematic method for assessing user perceptions and incorporating them into the design process. Players perceptions of the factors that influence the comfort of cricket leg guards and taekwondo chest guards were elicited through the use of co-discovery sessions, focus groups and individual interviews, and analysed through an inductive process to produce a comfort model. The relative importance of each different comfort dimension was identified through the use of an online questionnaire utilising the analytical hierarchy process method. Through the combination of these methods, six general dimensions were identified with a weighting regarding the amount to which each one determines a user's perceived comfort. For both cricket and taekwondo, the majority of players ranked Fit as the most important factor affecting comfort. Experimental procedures were developed to objectively test the Fit of cricket leg guards, with regards to batting kinematics, running performance and contact pressure. These methods were combined with subjective assessments of <b>leg</b> <b>guard</b> performance, to determine if there was a relationship between users perceived comfort and objective test results. It was found that shot ROM and performance were not significantly affected by cricket leg guards, despite perceptions of increased restriction whilst wearing certain pads. Wearing cricket leg guards was found to significantly decrease running performance when compared to running without pads (p< 0. 05). In addition, {{it was found that the}} degree of impedance depended on pad design and could not solely be attributed to additional mass. These results correlated with the subjective assessment of three different leg guards, with respondents identifying the pad which had the largest influence on their running biomechanics and impeded their performance the most, as the most restrictive pad. Contact pressure under the pad and straps was also measured for four different leg guards whilst running. The results found that the top strap applied the greatest amount of pressure to the leg, especially at the point of maximum knee flexion. The peak pressure under the top strap was found to reach up to three times that of any other area of the pad. These results were reflected in the subjective assessment of the leg guards, with all nine subjects identifying the top strap as an area of discomfort for certain pads. The results also suggested there was a preference for pads with a larger more consistent contact area, as pad movement was perceived to increase when contact area variation was greater. Finally the results from this research were used to develop a product design specification (PDS) for a cricket <b>leg</b> <b>guard,</b> specifying size, mass, contact pressure and shape. The PDS was used to develop a concept design which would maximise comfort, whilst maintaining protection...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Sports Sciences and the definitive version is available at: [URL] cricket has experienced a shift towards limited over games, where the emphasis is on scoring runs at a rapid rate. Although the use of protective equipment in cricket is mandatory, players perceive that <b>leg</b> <b>guards,</b> in particular, can restrict their motion. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of cricket <b>leg</b> <b>guards</b> on running performance. Initial testing revealed that wearing pads significantly increased the total time taken to complete three runs by up to 0. 5 s compared with running without pads (P < 0. 05). In addition, we found that the degree of impedance was dependent on pad design and could not be solely attributed to additional weight. To assess possible causes of reduced running performance, a biomechanical analysis was performed, investigating running kinematics, stride parameters, and ground reaction forces. The results revealed that the widest pad had the greatest effect on running kinematics, increasing hip abduction and decreasing hip extension, resulting in a shortened stride length (by 0. 10 m) and increased stride width (by 0. 12 m) compared with running without pads. Wearing pads also significantly increased peak braking force (by up to 0. 3 times body weight [BW]), braking impulse (by up to 0. 012 BW · s− 1), peak mediolateral force (by up to 0. 17 BW), and mediolateral impulse (by up to 0. 016 BW · s− 1) compared with running without pads, which resulted in reduced force applied in the direction of locomotion. The consequence of this reduction in running performance is an increased risk of being run-out or a reduction in the number of runs that could be scored from a particular shot...|$|R
