She returned to Australian Idol for seasons six and seven, as a presenter and reporter alongside James Mathison and Andrew Günsberg. It earned her a nomination at the 2009 Logie Awards for Most Popular New Female Talent. Coulter became a full-time radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9 breakfast show in 2010, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley.

50|$|The {{salt and}} fresh water marshes {{used to be}} very well protected. However the cost of {{replenishing}} the shingle spit grew {{too much for the}} village to sustain. Once the repairing stopped, it became easier for waves to get through; in 1953 a large storm, measured at 5.12 m above ordnance datum (see North Sea flood of 1953) hit the North Norfolk coast and the shingle ridge was mostly destroyed. A further storm surge in 1978 measured 4.19 m above ordnance datum and the protection measures confined flooding to the marshes and A149 coast road. The North Norfolk Shoreline Management Plan introduced by the Environment Agency has proposed a number of strategies in the light of continual erosion and predicted rising sea levels caused by global warming: these include Advance the <b>line,</b> <b>Hold</b> the line, Managed retreat and Do nothing. Even after extensive public consultation there is widespread local concern that the marshes will be lost to the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|The Western Electric Company {{produced}} a multi-line telephone during the 1940 s- 1970 s using a six-button interface design that provided robust tactile, haptic and auditory cues regarding the "state" {{of the communication}} system. This multi-line telephone {{was used as a}} model for a trade study comparison of two interfaces: a touchscreen interface (iPad)) versus a pressure-sensitive strain gauge button interface (Phidget USB interface controllers). The experiment and its results are detailed in the authors' AES 133 rd convention paper " Multimodal Information Management: Evaluation of Auditory and Haptic Cues for NextGen Communication Dispays".

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of the rst accelerator experiment of the neutrino oscillation with 250 km long base line. Muon neutrinos are generated by 12 GeV proton synchrotron, travel 250 km, and are detected in Super-Kamiokande, to measure reduction during the travel. From June 1999 to June 2000, 2 : 291019 protons on target have been accumulated. The distribution of produced pions is measured by a gas Cherenkov detector. The measurement provides the neutrino energy spectra and the ux ratio at far/near site. The direction of the neutrino beam and the stability of the ux are monitored by a near neutrino detector. Measurements of the secondary muon and the proton prole in beam <b>line</b> <b>hold</b> the stability on spill-by-spill basis. These measurements conrm that the neutrino beam is stable enough to extrapolate the number of neutrino events from near to far detector. The absolute value of the event rate is derived from the measurements at 1 kt water Cherenkov detector in the near site. The extrapolation shows the expected number of events in Super-Kamiokande is 37 : 8 + 3 : 84 : 0...|$|E

40|$|Kilohertz {{quasi-periodic}} oscillations (kHz QPOs) {{and broad}} iron emission lines {{are thought to}} be produced at the inner edge of an accretion disk around neutron stars in low mass X-ray binary systems (LMXBs). The frequency of kHz QPOs and the width of iron lines strongly suggest that these phenomena take place just few kilometers above the surface of the neutron star and hence they should probe the strong gravitational field around these stars. Both QPO variability and iron <b>line</b> <b>hold</b> the promise of searching for signatures of strong-field general relativity, e. g. the ISCO or Lense-Thirring precession. Here I present new results of the kHz QPOs in the transient neutron star LMXB XTE J 1701 - 462, and the kHz QPOs and the broad iron line in the persistent neutron star LMXB 4 U 1636 - 53. In XTE J 1701 we find that, contrary to previous claims, properties of the kHz QPO are probably not uniquely determined by the geometry of the space-time. In 4 U 1636 we find that there is a complex relation between kHz QPOs and properties of the iron line, which is difficult to explain if both phenomena reflect properties of the same region in the accretion disk...|$|E
