40|$|Printing {{electronic}} components on plastic foils with functional <b>liquid</b> <b>inks</b> {{is an attractive}} approach for achieving flexible and low-cost circuitry for applications such as bendable displays and large-area sensors. The challenges for printed electronics, however, include characteristically slow switching frequencies and associated high supply voltages, which together impede widespread application. Combining printable high-capacitance dielectrics with printable high-mobility semiconductors could potentially solve these problems. Here we demonstrate fast, flexible digital circuits based on semiconducting carbon nanotube (CNT) networks and high-capacitance ion gel gate dielectrics, which were patterned by jet printing of <b>liquid</b> <b>inks.</b> Ion gel-gated CNT thin-film transistors (TFTs) with 50 μm channel lengths display ambipolar transport with electron and hole mobilities > 20 cm 2 /V·s; these devices {{form the basis of}} printed inverters, NAND gates, and ring oscillators on both polyimide and SiO 2 substrates. Five-stage ring oscillators achieve frequencies > 2 kHz at supply voltages of 2. 5 V, corresponding to stage delay times of 50 μs. This performance represents a substantial improvement for printed circuitry fabricated from functional <b>liquid</b> <b>inks...</b>|$|R

50|$|In ink wash paintings, as in calligraphy, artists usually grind inkstick over an inkstone {{to obtain}} black <b>ink,</b> but {{prepared}} <b>liquid</b> <b>inks</b> (墨汁 in Japanese, bokuju) are also available.

An artist puts {{a few drops of}} water on an inkstone and grinds the inkstick in a circular motion until a smooth, black ink of the desired concentration is made. Prepared <b>liquid</b> <b>inks</b> vary in viscosity, solubility, concentration, etc., but are in general more suitable for practicing Chinese calligraphy than executing paintings. Inksticks themselves are sometimes ornately decorated with landscapes or flowers in bas-relief and some are highlighted with gold.|$|R

50|$|Dye {{sublimation}} {{offers some}} advantages over inkjet printing. For one, the prints are dry {{and ready to}} handle {{as soon as they}} exit the printer. Since the thermal head doesn't have to sweep {{back and forth over the}} print media, there are fewer moving parts that can break down. The whole printing cycle is extremely clean as there are no <b>liquid</b> <b>inks</b> to clean up. These factors make dye-sublimation generally a more reliable technology over inkjet printing.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Conventional ways {{of making}} bio-electrodes are {{generally}} complicated, expensive and unconformable. Here we describe {{for the first time}} the method of applying Ga-based <b>liquid</b> metal <b>ink</b> as drawable electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes. Such material owns unique merits in both liquid phase conformability and high electrical conductivity, which provides flexible ways for making electrical circuits on skin surface and a prospective substitution of conventional rigid printed circuit boards (PCBs). METHODS: Fundamental measurements of impedance and polarization voltage of the <b>liquid</b> metal <b>ink</b> were carried out to evaluate its basic electrical properties. Conceptual experiments were performed to draw the alloy as bio-electrodes to acquire ECG signals from both rabbit and human via a wireless module developed on the mobile phone. Further, a typical electrical circuit was drawn in the palm with the ink to demonstrate its potential of implementing more sophisticated skin circuits. RESULTS: With an oxide concentration of 0. 34 %, the resistivity of the <b>liquid</b> metal <b>ink</b> was measured as 44. 1 µΩ·cm with quite low reactance in the form of straight line. Its peak polarization voltage with the physiological saline was detected as - 0. 73 V. The quality of ECG wave detected from the liquid metal electrodes was found as good as that of conventional electrodes, from both rabbit and human experiments. In addition, the circuit drawn with the <b>liquid</b> metal <b>ink</b> in the palm also runs efficiently. When the loop was switched on, all the light emitting diodes (LEDs) were lit and emitted colorful lights. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>liquid</b> metal <b>ink</b> promises unique printable electrical properties as both bio-electrodes and electrical wires. The implemented ECG measurement on biological surface and the successfully run skin circuit demonstrated the conformability and attachment of the liquid metal. The present method is expected to innovate future physiological measurement and biological circuit manufacturing technique in a large extent...|$|R

50|$|A second {{aspect of}} printer {{technology}} that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: <b>liquid</b> <b>ink,</b> such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with <b>liquid</b> <b>ink</b> {{are more difficult to}} alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.|$|E

50|$|Gel inks usually contain {{pigments}}, while liquid inks {{are limited}} to dyestuffs, as pigments will sink down in <b>liquid</b> <b>ink</b> (sedimentation). The thickness and suspending power of gels allows the use of pigments in gelled ink, which yields {{a greater variety of}} brighter colors than is possible in <b>liquid</b> <b>ink.</b> Gels also allow for the use of heavier pigments with metallic or glitter effects, or opaque pastel pigments that can be seen on dark surfaces.|$|E
40|$|The {{controlled}} {{deposition of}} attoliter volumes of <b>liquid</b> <b>inks</b> may engender novel {{applications such as}} targeted drug delivery to single cells and localized delivery of chemical reagents at nanoscale dimensions. Although the deposition of small organic molecules from an atomic force microscope tip, known as dip-pen nanolithography (DPN), has been extensively studied, the deposition of <b>liquid</b> <b>inks</b> is little understood. In this work, {{we have used a}} set of model ink-substrate systems to develop an understanding of the deposition of viscous liquids using an unmodified AFM tip. First, the growth of dot size with increasing dwell time is characterized. The dynamics of deposition are found to vary for different ink-substrate systems, and the change in deposition rate over the course of an experiment limits our ability to quantify the ink-transfer dynamics in terms of liquid properties and substrate wettability. We find that the most critical parameter affecting the deposition rate is the volume of ink on the cantilever, an effect resulting in a 10 -fold decrease in deposition rate (aL/s) over 2 h of printing time. We suggest that a driving force for deposition arises from the gradient in Laplace pressure set up when the tip touches the substrate. Second, the forces acting upon the AFM cantilever during ink deposition were measured in order to gain insight into the underlying ink-transfer mechanism. The force curve data and simple geometrical arguments were used to elucidate the shape of the ink meniscus at the instant of deposition, a methodology that may be used as an accurate and real-time means of monitoring the volume of deposited dots. Taken together, our results illustrate that liquid deposition involves a very different transfer mechanism than traditionally ascribed to DPN molecular transport...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} metal patterning technique on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using inkjet printed silver nanoparticles with a (3 -mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) adhesion promoter to form silver microelectrodes for microfluidic systems is presented. Inkjet printing {{is an alternative}} additive microfabrication technique enabling the possibility of direct metal patterning on PDMS from metal bearing <b>liquid</b> <b>inks.</b> However, the hydrophobic nature of PDMS was found to inhibit pattern formation of ink on as-fabricated substrates due to droplet coalescence. Both O 2 plasma and silane adhesion treatment were explored to overcome this limitation and were evaluated using soak testing and ultrasonication. MPTMS, applied in a two-step immersion process, was found to promote PDMS surface wettability while maintaining silver adhesion with a usable working time. The resulting printed silver patterns exhibit good compactness and continuity, and were used to fabricate three-electrode electrochemical sensors directly on PDMS successfully. © 2014 IEEE. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} {{the development of}} a biobased hybrid material made from a mechanically stable, paper-like fleece combined with a hydrogel, which mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM) of soft tissue.

For stabilization of the hydrogels we used fleece substrates produced from the biodegradable polymer poly (L-lactide) (PLA) and the modified biopolymer gelatin by electrospinning.
