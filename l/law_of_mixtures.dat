Evaluated properties for pastes and mortars include compressive strength {{and a variety of}} early-age properties that can influence cracking, specifically isothermal and semi-adiabatic calorimetry, chemical shrinkage, setting times (Vicat needle) and autogenous deformation.

40|$|International audienceIn {{numerous}} industrial fields, {{materials are}} manufactured from powders. The most classical process consists in pouring the powder into a die and pressing in between two punches. The resulting component {{can be used}} in this state, as in the pharmaceutical industry. But, most often, for example in powder metallurgy or ceramic processing, it is submitted to a thermal treatment, called sintering, during which the particles are welded together. These two stages, compaction and sintering, have been extensively investigated in the last decades. The main physical mechanisms arising during both stages have been identified and more or less sophisticated models have been developed. However most of these studies have concerned single-component powders whereas industrial processes more frequently use <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> powders with different physical and mechanical. The interest <b>of</b> using <b>mixtures</b> instead <b>of</b> single-component powders may be to facilitate the compaction or the sintering or to create alloys or composite materials with outstanding features. Understanding and modelling the behavior <b>of</b> powder <b>mixtures</b> require taking into account the mechanical and chemical interactions between both phases. Concerning mechanical problems, in most cases, a simple <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixture</b> is not appropriate. Classical models of multiphase materials hardly give better results. Accounting for the granular nature of the material is thus absolutely necessary. Relevant issues are interparticle contacts, particle rearrangement, agglomeration, phase percolation.

Tension-tension fatigue tests on notched unidirectional FMLs have shown that these laminates offer fatigue lives up to fifty times greater than those offered by a notched monolithic titanium alloy.

40|$|Duplex austenitic/ferritic {{stainless}} steels are increasingly {{used as an}} alternative to conventional austenitic grades. Main advantages of the duplex grades are good resistance to corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue in environments that contain chloride. One drawback of the duplex material is the susceptibility of the ferritic phase to a spinodal decomposition in the temperature range 250 - 500 o C. The decomposition of the ferrite leads to a significant hardening and embrittlement of this phase. This thesis treats the deformation properties of duplex stainless steel and particular attention is paid to the influence of the spinodal decomposition of ferrite. Evaluation of cyclic and monotonic deformation behaviour, fatigue crack growth and low cycle fatigue properties and impact toughness is included. Duplex {{stainless steels}} with different amounts of austenite and ferrite were studied and compared to single-phase austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. By including single-phase materials, understanding of the properties of the duplex stainless steel was facilitated. The monotonic yield stress of the investigated steels clearly deviate from the classic linear <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixture,</b> a <b>law</b> predicting a linear change in yield stress with increasing ferrite content. The explanation for the deviation is partly {{to be found in the}} presence of internal stresses, allowing early yielding of the duplex grades. A marked anisotropy of the mechanical properties is evident from the tensile tests. Further, annealing at 475 o C that hardens the ferritic phase leaves the austenite unaffected. The results from the tensile tests are discussed in terms of phase and grain distribution, contiguity and load/strain transfer. The influence of grain size and nitrogen content has been studied on two austenitic stainless steels. The grain size dependence of the yield stress was found to obey the well-known Hall-Petch relation. The cyclic yield stress of the investigated steels follow the classic linear <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixture,</b> i. e. vary linearly with increasing ferrite content. The austenite cyclically softens at low plastic strain amplitudes and hardens at higher. The duplex and ferritic steels show no or only little cyclic hardening/softening. Low cycle fatigue properties of the austenitic single-phase steel and a duplex steel having 25. alfa. / 75. gamma. have been determined. The austenitic grade shows better fatigue properties at high plastic strain amplitudes as compared to the duplex grade. It was found, in conjunction with earlier observations in the literature, that cracks initiated in the ferritic phase of the duplex material at high strains. Near-threshold crack growth properties were investigated, including crack closure measurements and quantitative fractography of the fracture surfaces. The duplex steels exhibit higher effective crack growth threshold levels. DELTA. K th,eff, while the single-phase materials have higher crack closure levels K cl. These results are discussed in terms of phase boundary interaction and fracture surface roughness. The monotonic and cyclic plastic zones accompanying fatigue cracks in austenite and ferrite were measured by stylus profilometry (monotonic zone) and nanoindenter technique (cyclic zone). The measured plastic zone sizes were rationalised by using cyclic stress-strain data of the bulk material and models on strain distribution ahead of a fatigue crack. A duplex grade with 25. alfa. / 75. gamma. showed a technically useful toughness still after 100 hours of annealing at 475 o C.

This paper presents the results of the investigations on a wear resistant coating made by alternate layers of TiN and Ti(CxN 1 -x) (nominal 0. 5 mum each), deposited on S 600 tool steel by reactive cathodic arc evaporation using a reactive gaseous <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> methane and nitrogen. Microstructural and compositional characterisation were carried out using ball crater tests, Optical Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy associated with Energy Dispersive Microanalysis and Image Analysis. Micro hardness measurement were evaluated by means of the Chicot and Lesage volume <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>mixture</b> model to cope with the problem of the multiple influence of the different layers and the substrate on the real multilayer surface hardness. In order to predict the surface hardness, the model needs the knowledge of the properties of each type of layers and of the substrate (Young modulus, H- 0 = hardness at infinitely small load and n = strain hardening coefficient, or ISE index), These properties were measured using microindentation tests from ad hoc samples of single TiN 0. 5 Vm layer film., single Ti(CxN 1 -x) 0. 5 mum layer film and the uncoated substrate. Young modulus for the TiN and TiCN were evaluated with load-displacement nanoindentation tests; Young modulus for the substrate is from manufacturer. Thickness, composition profiles and microstructure of each film were used to qualify the data input for the model. Experimental measurements on the composite surface hardness allowed then the verification of the predictions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
