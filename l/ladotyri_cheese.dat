50|$|The {{climate and}} terrain {{has tended to}} favour the {{breeding}} of goats and sheep over cattle, and thus beef dishes are uncommon. Fish dishes are common in coastal regions and on the islands. A great variety of cheese types are used in Greek cuisine, including Feta, Kasseri, Kefalotyri, Graviera, Anthotyros, Manouri, Metsovone, <b>Ladotyri</b> (<b>cheese</b> with olive oil), Kalathaki (a specialty from the island of Limnos), Katiki-Tsalafouti (both creamy cheeses, suitable for spreads) and Mizithra.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGiven that {{platelet}} activating factor (PAF) {{is a crucial}} inflammatory phospholipid mediator that is implicated in the mechanism of atherogenesis, the presence of PAF inhibitors in food reinforces their nutritional value in terms of protection against cardiovascular diseases. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the anti-atherogenic (anti-inflammatory) properties of two different types of Greek cheese: Kefalotyri and Ladotyri. Total lipids (TL) of both types of cheese samples were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer and separated into total polar lipids (TPL) and total neutral lipids (TNL) by countercurrent distribution. TPL were further separated by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC). TL, TPL, TNL and the obtained polar lipid fractions after TLC separation were tested to determine their biological activity towards atherosclerosis based on the in vitro inhibition of PAF-induced platelet aggregation. Both types of cheese samples exhibited strong biological activity, and their lipids were potent PAF inhibitors. Comparing the two types of cheese samples, <b>Ladotyri</b> <b>cheese</b> polar lipid fractions were found to exhibit stronger inhibitory properties than those of Kefalotyri cheese. The fact that both types of cheese were found to contain PAF inhibitors highlights their nutritional value in terms of cardio-protection...|$|E
50|$|Mantamados is {{very famous}} for the monastery of the Archangel Michael of Mantamados, popular among the believers of Greece, on the {{outskirts}} of the village. The island is also famous for its <b>cheese</b> (<b>Ladotyri)</b> and for its farms. It was also one of the few places in Greece to have a mayor belonging to the Greek Communist Party until 2000.|$|R
