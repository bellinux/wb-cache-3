Diet with 15 % cassava bagasse provided a 13. 2 % increase in production when compared to control. Feed conversion had a quadratic effect with minimum point at 4. 2 % of cassava bagasse inclusion. Crude protein, the only milk component that changed, increased linearly with the inclusion of cassava bagasse levels. Treatment with 15 % cassava bagasse caused a more effective operational cost (42. 8 % higher when compared to control) and the highest <b>leveling</b> <b>point</b> for milk production and price. The lowest leveling points were treatments with 5 and 10 % inclusion of cassava bagasse, which had the best economic results.

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), widely {{applied for}} the {{monitoring}} of land subsidence, {{has the advantage of}} high accuracy and wide coverage. High-resolution SAR data offers a chance to reveal impressive details of large-scale man-made linear features (LMLFs) with Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) analysis. Despite these advantages, research validating high-resolution MT-InSAR results along high-speed railways with high spatial and temporal density leveling data is limited. This paper explored the monitoring ability of high-resolution MT-InSAR in an experiment along Jingjin Inter-City Railway, located in Tianjin, China. Validation between these MT-InSAR results and a high spatial/temporal density leveling measurement was conducted. A total of 37 TSX images spanning half a year were processed for MT-InSAR analysis. The distance between two consecutive <b>leveling</b> <b>points</b> is 60 m along Jingjin Inter-City railway and the time interval of the study was about one month. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) index of average subsidence rate comparison between MT-InSAR results and leveling data was 3. 28 mm/yr, with 34 points, and that of the displacement comparison was 2. 90 mm with 464 valid observations. The experimental results along Jingjin Inter-City railway showed a high correlation between these two distinct measurements. These analyses show that millimeter accuracy can be achieved with MT-InSAR analysis when monitoring subsidence along a high-speed railway. We discuss the possible reason for the subsiding center, and the characteristics of both leveling and MT-InSAR results. We propose further planning for the monitoring of subsidence over LMLFs...|$|R

In this study, we investigated wide-area surface subsidence characteristics in Wuhan using 15 Sentinel- 1 A TOPS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from 11 April 2015 to 29 April 2016 with the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS InSAR) technique. The Sentinel- 1 A SBAS InSAR results were validated by 110 <b>leveling</b> <b>points</b> at an accuracy of 6 mm/year. Based on the verified SBAS InSAR results, prominent uneven subsidence patterns were identified in Wuhan. Specifically, annual average subsidence rates ranged from − 82 mm/year to 18 mm/year in Wuhan, and maximum subsidence rate was detected in Houhu areas. Surface subsidence time series presented nonlinear subsidence with pronounced seasonal variations. Comparative analysis of surface subsidence and influencing factors (i. e., urban construction, precipitation, industrial development, carbonate karstification and water level changes in Yangtze River) indicated a relatively high spatial correlation between locations of subsidence bowl and those of engineering construction and industrial areas. Seasonal variations in subsidence were correlated with water level changes and precipitation. Surface subsidence in Wuhan was mainly attributed to anthropogenic activities, compressibility of soil layer, carbonate karstification, and groundwater overexploitation.

40|$|Drilled {{foundations}} {{are often}} {{considered to be}} a standard method of installation of steel core piles and similar foundation components in sensitive environments such as urban areas where other common technologies such as stranding or diging cannot be applied. Much research has been made in the area of how the piles interact in the clay. BESAB, who are specialists within underpinning, have observed that it takes time for a house to settle after an underpinning. There are uncertainties when it comes to how the house adapts to an underpinning. During interviews experts have given many different possible explanations but {{it seems to be a}} lack of knowledge in the area. All agree that it takes a couple of years for a house to adapt to an underpinning. The recommendation is to wait at least 2 years before proceed with the work in the house. In the project that has been studied in this research, precision <b>leveling</b> <b>points</b> have been measured 2 - 3 times a week to monitor the settlements throughout the project. The measurements have shown a greater settlement on the street level than in the basement, 2 floors down from the street level during the same amount of time which lead to the question: What are the effects of underpinning in a house? The major reason for that settlement has occurred in the area is that the foundation, consisting of wooden piles, has lost its carrying capacity due to the lowered ground water level. During underpinning the house is mostly affected by dynamic forces. The structure gets temporary weakened when holes are made in walls for beams and drilling is made in already sensitive foundation. The fixated parts of the structure, where the load transferring elements are already installed between the pile and the structure, can get locally loaded when drilling is made in adjacent areas. After underpinning the house with its weight is settling on the piles. The house has to adapt to a new mode of action. This can be done either by just leaving the house and wait for the piles to take load and get compressed or by pre-load the piles with the expected final load of the house to avoid the time for the compression of the piles. The greatest risk linked to this phenomenon is that new cracks can occur due to post settlements and in worst case in an elevator shaft or in the water proofing in bathrooms or kitchen. If renovation work starts before the house have stopped settle than the risk is big that cracks will occur in the newly renovated areas resulting in that the renovation have to be re-done. 4 Effective communication is essential to assess risks involved with an underpinning and to avoid tensions between actors involved in an underpinning project if damage due to post settlement will occur. The problem investigated in this report is translated in to Kuhn’s theory on science the beginning of the crisis. Further research is required to develop the empirics in to theory. Accurate measurements must be collected and these must be processed in mathematical statistics. Models must be built and existing theories within structural- and geotechnical engineering must be studied in further depth to be able to state a new paradigm in this area...|$|R

40|$|When radiometers on a {{satellite}} are pointed towards the planet {{with the goal}} of understanding a phenomenon quantitatively, rather than just creating a pleasing image, the task at hand is often problematic. The signal at the detector can be affected by scattering, absorption, and emission; and these can be due to atmospheric constituents (gases, clouds, and aerosols), the earth's surface, and subsurface features. When targeting surface phenomena, the remote sensing algorithm needs to account for the radiation associated with the atmospheric constituents. Likewise, one needs to correct for the radiation leaving the surface, when atmospheric phenomena are of interest. Rigorous validation of such remote sensing products is a real challenge. In visible and near infrared wavelengths, the jumble of effects on atmospheric radiation are best accomplished over dark surfaces with fairly uniform reflective properties (spatial homogeneity) in the satellite instrument's field of view (FOV). The ocean's surface meets this criteria; land surfaces - which are brighter, more spatially inhomogeneous, and more changeable with time - generally do not. NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project has used this backdrop to establish a radiation monitoring site in Virginia's coastal Atlantic Ocean. The project, called the CERES Ocean Validation Experiment (COVE), is located on a rigid ocean platform allowing the accurate measurement of radiation parameters that require precise <b>leveling</b> and <b>pointing</b> unavailable from ships or buoys. The COVE site is an optimal location for verifying radiative transfer models and remote sensing algorithms used in climate research; because of the platform's small size, there are no island wake effects; and suites of sensors can be simultaneously trained both on the sky and directly on ocean itself.

These solutions were then computerized to evaluate the series line's availability trajectory. The limiting (<b>leveling</b> off) <b>point</b> for each trajectory provided the steady state availability.

40|$|Introduction: Automatic {{guidance}} of tractors in the mechanized farming practice {{has taken the}} attention of agricultural engineers {{in the last two}} decades. For this to be truly practical on the farm, it should be economical, simple to operate and entirely contained on the vehicle. Different types of steering systems such as leader- cable, laser- controlled, radio- operated and contactor- type have been developed for automatic guidance. The automatic leveling system is used on hillside machines to keep the separator level when operating on hillsides. This system has three parts: fluid level system, electrical system and hydraulic system. The fluid level system consists of fluid reservoir and a leveling control switch box. The fluid level system actuates the electrical system of the leveling unit. The electrical system which actuated by the fluid system consist of four micro switches in the leveling control switch box, two micro switches in the limit control box, a solenoid in the hydraulic control level, manual leveling control switch, and a leveling limit warning light. The hydraulic system maintains the level of the separator when the machine is operating on a hillside. The present study was aimed to develop a reliable, versatile and easy to maintain system to fit our economy and low technology level of farmers for hillside- range development or fallow farming. The automatic guidance system has been implemented successfully on agricultural vehicles on the basis of three components, i. e. sensors, processors and actuator elements. The study site (N, latitude; E, longitude; and 1810 m above sea level) was located at the Agricultural Research Center, Shiraz University, 15 km northwest of Shiraz, Fars Province, Iran. MF- 399 agricultural tractor manufactured by ITMCO, Tabriz, Iran was used for doing the experiments. Materials and Methods:The Level Sensing System: The biaxial tilt industrial sensor (ZCT 245 AL- China) with digital output can be connected to the computer and received angular position in x and y coordinates. An assumed degree could be considered as basis degree and the measured frequency was adjustable. The tilt sensor located along the axial length of tractor and leads the angles which are created by longitudinal axle transverse axle of the tractor in related to horizontal level. It was used for contour lines detecting. The potentiometer located on the steering wheel of the tractor and pressure sensor which used with goniometer sensor used keeping uniformly of <b>leveling</b> <b>points</b> in tractor motion. The pressure sensor (SN-SCP 1000 - South Korea) which is used in leveling system can detect the elevation changes. In this way, by defining a limitation of altitude for system, it would be able to stop steering turning motor which was coupled to tractor steering rod automatically. By resetting, the tractor could be able to live in a new level position. To avoid excessive left and right steering wheels deviation and interfering with other lines of travel, potentiometer was used. The deviation degree for steering rod from center to left or right was selected 120 degrees. Accordingly, the wheels {{would not be able to}} move more than 10 degrees to each direction. The Processing System: The electrical circuit graphically designed and simulated by software (Altium Designer, 2009) and installed on the tractor. The components of this circuit are as follows: Electrical board, two relays which control the electrical pathway in both directions, a battery with 12 volts of electric potential as electrical power supply, ATmeGA 32 microcontroller which was made by Atmel company as main core for information processing, RS 232 protocol was used for making correlation between serial port (COM) and the microcontroller and two capacitors for reducing noises. The Actuator System: The output signals from the a processing system, were lead in the actuator system would order and indicative of left- turn or right- turn command, were introduced to actuator- units include an electric- gearbox motor that stimulate the steering wheel shaft of the tractor by chain and sprocket and conduct the tractor in leveling traces at the desired speed.

40|$|One of the {{potential}} dangers that might arise {{as a result of}} bringing excessive amounts of groundwater {{to the surface of the}} Earth is land subsidence. Such surface deformations – these velocities may vary from a few millimetres to a few metres per year – do the greatest damage to infrastructure facilities and buildings in residential units.

There are three categories of robots: light, medium and heavy, with light robots generally being the smallest and fastest while being inexpensive, but also having weaker armament and fewest hitpoints, while heavy robots are the opposite, and medium robots are somewhat in-between. Some robots have special abilities, such as Jump or Assault Mode, {{which can be used}} to give the player an advantage, but have a cooldown before they can be used again. There are three types of weapon hardpoints: light, medium, and heavy, and each type of hardpoint can only equip certain weapons. Projectile weapons include miniguns, machine guns, tank guns, rockets, and guided missiles. Energy weapons include plasma pulses, beam lasers and lightning. Certain robots have or can equip a physical shield or an energy shield to augment the robots' hitpoints. Players can own an unlimited number of weapons. As players play the game, they can earn experience <b>points.</b> <b>Leveling</b> up unlocks new weapons and robots for the player to use. There are three types of currency: Silver, Gold, and Workshop Points. Silver and Gold can be earned through battles, though Gold requires players to have done three things: been in the top 3 of the winning team, won a battle with a friend, or have captured the most beacons in the winning team. The game allows you to purchase Premium or VIP, which will allow you to earn experience and Silver 50% faster, although this upgrade is not permanent. Gold and Workshop Points can also be earned by completing objectives (i.e. destroying a number of enemy robots or capturing a number of beacons). Once the player reaches level 20, they can earn Workshop Points or purchase them with Silver or Gold. Silver can be used to buy and upgrade most robots and weapons. However, certain robots and weapons can only be bought/unlocked with Gold or Workshop Points. Players can only upgrade one robot or weapon at a time, although the process can be speeded up with Gold, and the amount of Silver and time required for an upgrade increases exponentially for each subsequent level. Silver and Gold can also be purchased through the in-app purchases provided; Gold can be bought with money, while Silver can only be bought using Gold.|$|R
