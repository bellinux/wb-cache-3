It is also called Compton Place Lock or Twyford Lock, and the extra flow {{compared}} to other locks may explain the erosion that has taken place, resulting in a circular area of water between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>gates.</b> Just above Shawford Bridge, the river and navigation diverged, with Shawford Mill just below the junction. The building still stands. The bridge is a modern construction, and is located {{at a point where}} the towpath crosses to the western bank. Just to the south is a weir at the site of Shawford Single Gates, which probably ensured the mill had an adequate head of water. The village of Twyford lies to the east, and the Twyford Drain splits, with the western channel rejoining the river below the mill, and the eastern channel continuing as a relief channel. There are two more locks on the navigation, called Malm Lock and College Mead Lock, before the navigation rejoins the river. By the junction is the intake for Otterbourne Water Treatment Works.|$|E

25|$|The 1830 design {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} culverts in the masonry, and the upper gate is below the breast wall.

25|$|Some narrow locks (e.g. on Birmingham Canal Navigations) go even further. They have single gates at {{the lower}} end also. This speeds up passage, even though single <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> are heavy (heavier than a single upper gate, because the lower gate is taller) and the lock has to be longer (a lower gate opens INTO the lock, it has to pass the bow or stern of an {{enclosed}} boat, and a single gate has a wider arc than two half-gates).|$|E

These locks, as is usual on the BCN, have single <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> to reduce leakage. The Titford Locks (also known as Oldbury Locks) became derelict and were restored in 1973-4.|$|E

30|$|Similar {{to other}} TRP channel structures, the central ion {{permeation}} pathway of the TRPML 1 exhibits two major canonical constrictions gates. We {{have discussed the}} difference in <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> between state 1 mTRPML 1 channel and other TRPP 2 channels above. Measurement of the upper pore helix gate in three mTRPML 1 states shows that state 1 seems to adopt a narrow upper gate and state 2 has the widest upper gate. Continuing down the pore, when measured the distances between Cα-Cα in the same residue of the <b>lower</b> <b>gate,</b> state 1 still exhibit a narrow gate whereas state 3 has the widest <b>lower</b> <b>gate.</b> Taken together, state 1 {{seems to be the}} narrowest ion permeation state and represents the close state. State 3 has a wider <b>lower</b> filter <b>gate,</b> while state 2 has a wider upper pore restriction (Fig.  5 D). This comparison is consistent with the three states of TRPP 2, yet the more opened state TRPP 2 -SI has a wider <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> than TRPP 2 -MI but exhibits a narrow pore helix upper gate to TRPP 2 -MI (Grieben et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2016; Wilkes et al., 2017). Superposition of state 1 and 3 in the transmembrane helix region resulted in a conformational twist and shift in both VSD and filter region, and this swivel is accompanied with conformational change in the outer PMD (Fig.  5 C). In addition, comparison of the S 1 and α 1 helix region between all three states is consistent with our hypothesis that the continuous helix twist could mediate conformational change transduction through the outer PMD to the transmembrane region (Fig.  5 C).|$|R

There are eyes and mouths and ears and nostrils, besides the two <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> of the passionate body, and the closed but not locked gates of the breasts. Many gates.

60|$|Washington had {{projected}} {{two works}} also {{just below the}} Highlands, at Stony Point and Verplanck's Point, to serve as outworks of the mountain passes, and to protect King's Ferry, the most direct and convenient communication between the Northern and Middle States. A small but strong fort had been erected on Verplanck's Point, and was garrisoned by seventy men under Captain Armstrong. A more important work was in progress at Stony Point. When completed, these two forts, on opposite promontories, would form as it were the <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> of the Highlands. To be at hand in case of any real attempt upon the Highlands, Washington drew up with his forces in that direction; moving by the way of Morristown.|$|E
60|$|Then it was, coming hot-foot {{after so}} much sorrow, loss and doubt, that there {{followed}} the happiest event {{of all my}} life.

50|$|These locks are {{staircase}} locks, whereby inner {{lock gate}} pairs serve {{as both the}} upper <b>gate</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>gate.</b> The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable.

60|$|As my {{boy could}} {{remember}} very few incidents of this voyage afterwards, I dare say {{he spent a}} great part of it with his face in a book, and was aware of the landscape only from time to time when he lifted his eyes from the story he was reading. That was apt to be the way with him; and before he left the Boy's Town the world within claimed him more and more. He ceased to be that eager comrade he had once been; sometimes he left his book with a sigh; and he saw much of the outer world through a veil of fancies quivering like an autumn haze between him and its realities, softening their harsh outlines, and giving them a fairy coloring. I think he would sometimes have been better employed in looking directly at them; but he had to live his own life, and I cannot live it over for him. The season was the one of all others best fitted to win him to the earth, and in a measure it did. It was spring, and along the tow-path strutted the large, glossy blackbirds which had just come back, and made the boys sick with longing to kill them, they offered such good shots. But the boys had no powder with them, and at any rate the captain would not have stopped his boat, which was rushing on at the rate of two miles an hour, to let them pick up a bird, if they had hit it. They were sufficiently provisioned without the game, however; the mother had baked bread, and boiled a ham, and provided sugar-cakes in recognition of the holiday character of the voyage, and they had the use of the boat cooking-stove for their tea and coffee. The boys had to content themselves with such sense of adventure as they could get out of going ashore when the boat was passing through the locks, or staying aboard and seeing the water burst and plunge in around the boat. They had often watched this thrilling sight at the First Lock, but it had a novel interest now. As their boat approached the lock, the <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> were pushed open by men who set their breasts to the long sweeps or handles of the gates, and when the boat was fairly inside of the stone-walled lock they were closed behind her. Then the upper gates, which opened against the dull current, and were kept shut by its pressure, were opened a little, and the waters rushed and roared into the lock, and began to lift the boat. The gates were opened wider and wider, till the waters poured a heavy cataract into the lock, where the boat tossed on their increasing volume, and at last calmed themselves to the level within. Then the boat passed out through the upper gates, on even water, and the voyage to the next lock began. At first it was rather awful, and the little children were always afraid when they came to a lock, but the boys enjoyed it after the first time. They would have liked to take turns driving the pair of horses that drew the boat, but it seemed too bold a wish, and I think they never proposed it; they did not ask, either, to relieve the man at the helm.|$|E

25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the <b>lower</b> <b>gate's</b> height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|R
