In fact, one report states, “Many men were amazed that women could make adequate gunners despite their excitable temperament, lack of technical instincts, their lack of interest in aeroplanes and their physical weaknesses”. While women still faced discrimination from some of the highly stereotypical older soldiers and officers who did not <b>like</b> <b>women</b> “playing with their guns”, women were still given rifle practice and taught to use anti-aircraft guns while serving in their batteries. They were told that this was in case the Germans invaded…however if that were to ever happen, they would be evacuated immediately.).|$|E

500|$|The {{localization}} team faced {{some issues}} when localizing the character Jean Armstrong: in the Japanese version, he {{is portrayed as}} an okama character, {{which at the time}} of the game's development was a general word for effeminate men, often implying homosexuality, but also used for biologically male persons who do drag or speak <b>like</b> <b>women,</b> regardless of their sexuality and gender, and even including trans women. Because of this, they only had a vague concept of [...] "gay", and had to make it understandable for English-speaking players. Hsu looked through all information that is given about Jean in the game, and came to the conclusion that he is a gay cis man who likes to perform non-passing drag. Looking back at the game in 2014, Hsu said that she still thought Jean caused confusion due to the general public having a less informed and nuanced understanding of gender and sexuality {{at the time of the}} game's release.|$|E
500|$|Manning {{was educated}} privately {{at a small}} dame school {{before moving to the}} north of Ireland in 1916, the first of several {{extended}} periods spent there while her father was at sea. In Bangor she attended Bangor Presbyterian School, and while in Portsmouth Lyndon House School, and subsequently Portsmouth Grammar School, developing, as she recalled, [...] "the usual Anglo-Irish sense of belonging nowhere". Schoolmates described her as shy and prone to tantrums; her tendency to tell boastful tall-tales about her family led to ostracism by her peers. Supported by her father, Manning read and wrote extensively, preferring novels, especially those by H. Rider Haggard. Her mother discouraged such pursuits, and confiscated material she thought unsuitable; when she found her daughter reading the Times Literary Supplement she scolded that [...] "young men do not <b>like</b> <b>women</b> who read papers like that", and that Manning should focus on marketable job skills, such as typing.|$|E

According to Josephine Yun, [...] "like its music, X's look was individualistic. Square-shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime Gundam. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata's sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox all his own, bewtichingly effeminate one moment — and a full-force, wrist-breaking (literally) hurricane in concert the next." [...] Will Hodgkinson of The Times described X Japan as having, [...] "the grandiosity of Queen, the heavy-metal hysteria of Iron Maiden and the symphonic sophistication of classical music, all tied up with {{a healthy dose of}} melodrama." ...|$|E
