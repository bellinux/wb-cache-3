The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50mph and a pressure of 1002.7mbar and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the <b>last</b> <b>report</b> received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.|$|E
