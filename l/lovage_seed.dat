40|$|Three {{fractions}} of lovage seed: small size 2. 5 mm, medium size 3. 0 mm, and large size 3. 5 mm were analyzed in this paper. Contents of small fraction were 23 %, medium 46 %, and large 31 %. The infraction seed {{was used as}} standard. The indicators: germination energy, total germination and seed weight were investigated. The best results had the broadest fraction of 3. 5 mm concerning all indicators. The temperature of 20 °C constant proved the most optimum when all indicators had the highest values, and the most unfavorable was the temperature between 5 / 15 °C 12 / 12 h alternately. Due to conducted investigation, {{it can be concluded}} that the contents of the broadest fraction of <b>lovage</b> <b>seed</b> is the most important for production and seed multiplication...|$|E
50|$|The {{beans are}} soaked {{in water for}} three to four days until they have sprouted. They are boiled with various spices to make a thick soup. <b>Lovage</b> <b>seeds</b> are bloomed in oil and added to it as the special seasoning. Flatbread cut into one-and-a-half-inch squares can be boiled with the kwāti for variety.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pressure}} alterations on the yield of CO 2, extracts from different anatomical parts of lovage (Levisticum officinale Koch.) and celery (Apium graveolens L.) was studied. It {{was found that}} by applying frequent pressure changes in the extraction vessel {{it is possible to}} increase the rate of the isolation of CO 2 soluble materials from <b>lovage</b> <b>seeds</b> and leaves, <b>lovage</b> and celery roots. However, after passing a sufficient amount of the supercritical solvent, the yields were similar both for constant and pulsing extraction pressures. The composition of the extracts was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and {{it was found that the}} phthalides were very important constituents in the extracts from all the anatomical parts of lovage, while linoleic acid was the most abundant component in the celery root extracts.

5000|$|The Romans were {{probably}} the first to experiment with the preparation of mustard as a condiment. They mixed unfermented grape juice (the must) with ground mustard seeds (called sinapis) to make [...] "burning must", mustum ardens — hence [...] "must ard". A recipe for mustard appears in De re coquinaria, the anonymously compiled Roman cookbook from the late 4th or early 5th century; the recipe calls for a mixture of ground mustard, pepper, caraway, <b>lovage,</b> grilled coriander <b>seeds,</b> dill, celery, thyme, oregano, onion, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, and oil, and {{was intended as a}} glaze for spit-roasted boar. (Mustard was being used in curries in Asian countries well before Romans started using it. Romans experimented with using mustard paste) ...|$|R
