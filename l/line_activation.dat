Using an in vitro model of MR 1 -mediated activation of primary human MAIT cells, we investigated the mechanisms by which it is regulated. Uptake of intact bacteria by antigen presenting cells (APCs) into acidified endolysosomal compartments was required for efficient MR 1 -mediated MAIT cell activation, while stimulation with soluble ligand was inefficient.

Upregulation by Mas- 7 was blocked by GF 109203 X, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC). Phorbol ester also upregulated FAK-YP, verifying a role for PKC in the transduction cascade. Upregulation of FAK-YP by activation of G-proteins and PKC was dependent upon intact F-actin, as cytochalasin D abolished stimulation by Mas- 7 and by phorbol ester. The relatively slow increase in FAK-YP evoked by chronic exposure to Aβ also was abolished by GF 109203 X and by cytochalasin D. The results show that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in neurons is regulated positively by PKC, functioning down-stream from G-proteins through an F-actin-dependent mechanism.
