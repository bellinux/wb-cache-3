40|$|To {{study the}} quality of Litchi (Litchi chinensis sonn.) fruit as {{affected}} by exposure to sunlight and fruit orientation on the tree, five cultivars viz; Purbi, Bedana, Bombai, Serai and Gola were collected. Fruits of each cultivar were picked from exposed, unexposed, upper <b>half</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> portions <b>of</b> the trees. The unexposed fruits were found heavier in weight, stone, peel and pulp. The fruits at <b>Lower</b> <b>half</b> were found heavy in weight, pericarp and flesh. However, stone weight {{was found to be}} more in fruits collected from upper <b>half</b> portion <b>of</b> the tree. As unexposed fruits were massive therefore, it is advisable to pick these fruits first if chemical parameters are not included in selection. Hence it is concluded that picking should be started from those fruits which are positioned at the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> portion <b>of</b> the tree in order to collect fruits of superior quality first. ...|$|R

By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000.

Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended.
