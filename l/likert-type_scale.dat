2500|$|The {{most widely}} used {{questionnaire}} to measure locus of control is the 23-item (plus six filler items), [...] of Rotter (1966). However, {{this is not the}} only questionnaire; Bialer's (1961) 23-item scale for children predates Rotter's work. Also relevant to the locus-of-control scale are the Crandall Intellectual Ascription of Responsibility Scale (Crandall, 1965) and the Nowicki-Strickland Scale. One of the earliest psychometric scales to assess locus of control (using a <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale,</b> in contrast to the forced-choice alternative measure in Rotter's scale) was that devised by W. H. James for his unpublished doctoral dissertation, supervised by Rotter at Ohio State University; however, this remains unpublished.|$|E
2500|$|The Duttweiler (1984) Internal Control Index (ICI) {{addresses}} perceived [...] {{problems with}} the Rotter scales, including their forced-choice format, susceptibility to social desirability and heterogeneity (as indicated by [...] factor analysis). She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, [...] "they appear {{to be subject to}} many of the same problems". Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter's scale, Duttweiler's 28-item ICI uses a <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale</b> in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of gratification. A small (133 student-subject) validation study indicated that the scale had good internal reliability (a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85).|$|E

30|$|Section 1 of the {{questionnaire}} measured three types of CSR practices with 10 -point <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales</b> ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). In particular, we measured recycling convenience with three items from Pickett-Baker and Ozaki (2008), e.g., easiness to recycle the product’s container. We measured eco-friendly practices with four items from Webb et al. (2007), e.g., manufacturing the product with a minimum use of resources and energy. Finally, we measured ethical behavior with two items based on Schmeltz (2012), e.g., manufacturing the product under socially responsible conditions. Similarly, section 2 of {{the questionnaire}} measured customer satisfaction and customer loyalty through multi-item scales with 10 -point <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales</b> from Fornell (1992), e.g., overall satisfaction with the product.|$|R

5000|$|A Likert scale ( [...] {{but more}} {{commonly}} pronounced [...] ) is a psychometric scale commonly involved in research that employs questionnaires.

The questionnaires produced by SurveyAuthor can also be customized to meet specific user requirements.|$|E
50|$|The Test Anxiety Inventory for Children and Adolescent (TAICA) {{is a way}} {{to measure}} and assess test anxiety in {{children}} and adolescents in Grades 4 through 12. Those individuals who are being assessed rate their responses on a 5-point <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale</b> ranging from 1 (never true about me) to 5 (always true about me). The TAICA is a 45-item self-report measure which consists of four sub scales.|$|E
40|$|Sample {{coefficient}} alpha is commonly reported for psychological measurement scales. However, how {{to characterize the}} distribution of sample {{coefficient alpha}} with the <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales</b> typically used in social and behavioral science research is not clear. Using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the authors compare three characterizations {{of the distribution of}} the sample coefficient alpha: the existing normal-theory-based distri-bution, a newly proposed distribution based on fourth-order moments, and the bootstrap empirical distribution. Their study indicates that the normal-theory-based distribution has a systematic bias in describing the behavior of the sample coefficient alpha. The dis-tribution based on fourth-order moments is better than the normal-theory-based one but is still not good enough with finite samples. The bootstrap automatically takes the sam-pling distribution and sample size into account; thus it is recommended for characteriz-ing the behavior of sample coefficient alpha with <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales...</b>|$|R
30|$|The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS: Diener et al. 1985) assesses respondents’ current {{satisfaction}} with their life in general. The SWLS consists of five questions which are rated on <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales</b> from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The Brazilian version of the SWLS also presents evidences of validity and reliability (Zanon et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|Compared to positivist instruments, such as <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales,</b> {{sentence}} completion tests tend to {{have high}} face validity (i.e., {{the extent to which}} measurement items accurately reflect the concept being measured). This is to be expected, because in many cases the sentence stems name or refer to specific objects and the respondent provides responses specifically focused on such objects.|$|R
5000|$|While {{mean scores}} from Likert-type scales can be {{compared}} across individuals, scores from an ipsative measure cannot. To explain, if an individual was equally Extroverted and Conscientious and was assessed on a <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale,</b> each trait would be evaluated singularly, i.e. a respondent would see the item [...] "I enjoy parties." [...] and {{agree or disagree with}} it to whatever degree reflected his/her preferences.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of personality tests. The most common type is the self-report inventory, also commonly referred to as objective personality tests. Self-report inventory tests involve the administration of many questions/items to test-takers who respond by rating the degree to which each item reflects their behaviour and can be scored objectively. The term 'item' is used because many test questions are not actually questions; they are typically statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (using a Likert scale or, more accurately, a <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale).</b>|$|E
50|$|The RSES is {{designed}} similar to social-survey questionnaires. It is a ten-item <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale</b> with items answered on a four-point scale - from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Five {{of the items}} have positively worded statements and five have negatively worded ones. The scale measures state self-esteem by asking the respondents {{to reflect on their}} current feelings. The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 5,024 high-school juniors and seniors from 10 randomly selected schools in New York State. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is considered a reliable and valid quantitative tool for self-esteem assessment.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to compare and discuss the use of <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales</b> and Q-methodology to examine {{perceptions}} and attitudes in nursing research. This article provides a brief review of each approach, and how they have been used to advance our knowledge in health-related perceptions and attitudes. Although <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales</b> are economical, efficient, and easy to analyze, the results can be difficult to interpret or translate into meaningful practice. In contrast, Q-methodology yields holistic and in-depth information on what the prevailing perceptions and attitudes are, but its conduct is logistically challenging and the results' generalizability can be limited. The appropriate uses of either or both approaches to answer different research questions will be discussed. Nurse scientists are called upon to continue our exploration, utilization, and expansion of unique methodologies that directly speak to a meaningful examination of these important constructs in nursing research.

50|$|Just {{like the}} SSS-IV, the SSS-VI {{measures}} the same four subgroup. There are {{a total of}} 128 items that are divided between experience scales and intentions scales, where each items falls into a 3-point <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale.</b> The newly update form, Form V (SSS-V) of the Sensation Seeking Scale is the most used scale when measuring sensation seeking. This scale is a 40-item self-report that measures all four components. It was meant to shorten the test and is estimated to take about 20 minutes to complete. Each subgroup is presented with 10 items and the SSS Total score is used to measure sensation seeking as an overall score.|$|E
50|$|The future time {{perspective}} (FTP) {{scale was}} developed by Carstensen and Frieder Lang. The FTP scale includes ten items answered by indicating agreement on a 7-point <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale</b> (from 1= very untrue, to 7 = very true). The last three items of the future time perspective scale (#s 8-10) are reverse coded. When scoring the measure, researchers calculate the participant’s mean score. Prior research shows a linear relationship between chronological age and time horizons. The strength of the relationship varies {{as a function of}} the age range in the sample: nearly always, the relationship is positive, with high scores indicative of long time horizons.|$|E

50|$|PTSD Symptom Scale - Self-Report Version (PSS-SR) is a 17-item {{self-reported}} {{questionnaire to}} assess symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Each of the 17 items describe PTSD symptoms which respondents rate {{in terms of}} their frequency or severity using a <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale</b> ranging from 0 (not at all or only one time) to 3 (almost always or five or more times per week). Ratings on items are summed to create three subscales, including re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal, as well as a total score (that ranges from 0 to 51). All items of the PSS-SR should be answered and assessment is done by total score. The total score higher than 13 indicates on likelihood of PTSD.|$|E
