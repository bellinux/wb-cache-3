50|$|To combat these effects, side <b>lobe</b> <b>suppression</b> (SLS) is used. SLS {{employs a}} third pulse, P2, spaced 2μs after P1. This pulse is {{transmitted}} from the omnidirectional antenna (or the antenna difference channel) by the ground station, {{rather than from the}} directional antenna (or the sum channel). The power output from the omnidirectional antenna is calibrated so that, when received by an aircraft, the P2 pulse is stronger than either P1 or P3, except when the directional antenna is pointing directly at the aircraft. By comparing the relative strengths of P2 and P1, airborne transponders can determine whether or not the antenna is pointing at the aircraft when the interrogation was received. The power to the difference antenna pattern (for systems so equipped) is not adjusted from that of the P1 and P3 pulses.

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{provides}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the design of}} nonuniform planar circular antenna arrays for achieving maximal side <b>lobe</b> level <b>suppression</b> and directivity. The current excitation amplitudes and phase perturbations of the array elements are determined using an Adaptive Memetic algorithm resulting from a synergy of Differential Evolution (DE) and Learning Automata that is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches to the design problem. Moreover, existing literature considers the design problem as a singleobjective optimization task that is formulated as a linear sum of all the performance metrics. Due to the conflicting nature of the various design objectives, improvements in a certain design measure causes deterioration of the other measures. Following this observation, the single-objective design problem is reformulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization task. The proposed memetic algorithm is extended to the multi-objective framework to generate a set of non-dominated solutions from which the best compromising solution is selected employing a fuzzy membership based approach. An instantiation of the design problem clearly depicts that the multiobjective approach provides simultaneous side <b>lobe</b> level <b>suppression</b> and directivity maximization in comparison to the single-objective scenario...|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} {{investigates the}} lobing and chatter behavior, and approaches to suppress lobing and chatter {{in order to}} improve the workpiece roundness in centerless grinding. The problem of workpiece out-of-roundness {{is one of the main}} limitations for the applications of centerless grinding as a high rate precision machining process. Lobing and/or chatter most often is the source of the problem. This work models the centerless grinding process as a causal system between the potential grinding disturbances and the resulting workpiece out-of-roundness, and develops approaches to set up a centerless grinding operation such that the workpiece out-of-roundness is kept minimum under the potential grinding disturbances. ^ A general centerless grinding process model is proposed. The model can be simplified for lobing and chatter analysis. A Bidiagrammatical method is proposed to investigate the lobing stability. It was found that the upper and lower lobing growth rate can be estimated through the Bidiagrammatical method, and the lobing growth exhibits periodicity over the lobing frequency. A relative stability diagram is thus developed to provide guidance such that a proper setup angle β can be selected to suppress lobing. ^ During grinding, two types of workpiece surface waves can be generated: (1) standing wave; and (2) precessing wave. It was found that the standing waves are less stable, therefore, often cause significant workpiece out-of-roundness problem. A work-speed regulation method is proposed such that only precessing waves are generated during grinding, therefore, reduce the workpiece out-of-roundness. ^ Chatter stability is investigated by using a similar Bidiagrammatical method. It was found that chatter stability can be approximately assessed through lobing stability. Therefore, approaches to <b>lobing</b> <b>suppression</b> can be equally applied to suppress chatter. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{details on}} both theoretical and experimental aspects of UV written fibre gratings. The {{main body of}} the thesis deals with the design, fabrication and testing of telecommunication optical fibre grating devices, but also an accurate theoretical analysis of intra-core fibre gratings is presented. Since more than a decade, fibre gratings have been extensively used in the telecommunication field (as filters, dispersion compensators, and add/drop multiplexers for instance). Gratings for telecommunication should conform to very high fabrication standards as the presence of any imperfection raises the noise level in the transmission system compromising its ability of transmitting intelligible sequence of bits to the receiver. Strong side <b>lobes</b> <b>suppression</b> and high and sharp reflection profile are then necessary characteristics. A fundamental part of the theoretical and experimental work reported in this thesis is about apodisation. The physical principle of apodisation is introduced and a number of apodisation techniques, experimental results and numerical optimisation of the shading functions and all the practical parameters involved in the fabrication are detailed. The measurement of chromatic dispersion in fibres and FBGs is detailed and an estimation of its accuracy is given. An overview on the possible methods that can be implemented for the fabrication of tunable fibre gratings is given before detailing a new dispersion compensator device based on the action of a distributed strain onto a linearly chirped FBG. It is shown that tuning of second and third order dispersion of the grating can be obtained by the use of a specially designed multipoint bending rig. Experiments on the recompression of optical pulses travelling long distances are detailed for 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s. The characterisation of a new kind of double section LPG fabricated on a metal-clad coated fibre is reported. The fabrication of the device is made easier by directly writing the grating through the metal coating.

40|$|This work seeks {{designs of}} novel antennas, {{such as the}} {{rectangular}} waveguide narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture antenna arrays for S band high power applications. This antenna is designed to perform as a uniform array with minimum power reflected into the feed-waveguide. Based on the configuration, the double-narrow-wall-slot-array design is proposed for higher gain and grating <b>lobes</b> <b>suppression.</b> This work also deals with the S band compact narrow-wall slot-array proposed to be rendered as a conformal antenna structure. Moreover, this work proposes a circularly polarized narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design to produce both vertically and horizontally polarized radiated power. In the end, this work presents and discusses a couple of mechanisms for beam-steering of S band narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array designs. The S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design consists of four narrow wall longitudinal-slot radiators and one H-plane-bend-radiator. The design {{is a combination of}} computational and microwave network analysis techniques. First, HFSS is used to analyze the S-parameters, phases and radiated power of the narrow-wall longitudinal-slot radiators as well as the H-plane-bend radiator. Second the microwave network is applied to design a uniform linear array by neglecting the external coupling between the elements. Finally, Full-wave analysis is used to validate the array design from microwave network analysis. The double-narrow-wall slot-array design is the best narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array design with a peak gain of approximately 15 dB. It consists of two identical narrow-wall-slot-arrays with a common broad wall. It has a much more uniform aperture electric field distributuion than the single array design. As a result, a higher gain with suppressed grating lobes is achieved. The S-band curved rectangular waveguide narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture antenna is proposed to perform as a conformal antenna structure. It is based on a rectangular waveguide bend {{so that it can be}} mounted easily on vehicles. It also consists of four narrow-wall longitudinal radiators and one H-plane-bend-radiator similar to the narrow-wall longitudinal slot-array. A circularly polarized narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design is also discussed. It produces both vertically and horizontally polarized radiated power. The configuration verified by simulation places adjacent narrow-wall longitudinal radiators orthogonally and keeps the centers of all four narrow-wall longitudinal radiators at the same level. A study of beam-steering capability is also conducted. It is divided into two parts. One moves the main beam on the plane orthogonal to the narrow-wall and orthogonal to the broad-wall of the rectangular waveguide. The other moves the main beam on the plane orthogonal to the narrow-wall and parallel to the broad-wall of the rectangular waveguide. The S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array design works well both ways. Finally, the experiment is designed and conducted to validate the theoretical analysis results for the design of S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array. The results obtained lead to the conclusion that there is good agreement between the theoretical and experiment results. U. S.

In two temporal lobe epilepsy models, electrical kindling and kainate-induced seizures, vector-based transduction of Y 2 receptor complementary DNA in the hippocampus of adult rats exerted seizure-suppressant effects.

40|$|AbstractA key {{function}} of the prefrontal cortex is to support inhibitory control over behavior. It is widely believed that this function extends to stopping cognitive processes as well. Consistent with this, mounting evidence establishes {{the role of the}} right lateral prefrontal cortex in a clear case of cognitive control: retrieval suppression. Retrieval suppression refers to the ability to intentionally stop the retrieval process that arises when a reminder to a memory appears. Functional imaging data indicate that retrieval suppression involves top-down modulation of hippocampal activity by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but the anatomical pathways supporting this inhibitory modulation remain unclear. Here we bridge this gap by integrating key findings about retrieval suppression observed through functional imaging with a detailed consideration of relevant anatomical pathways observed in non-human primates. Focusing selectively on the potential role of the anterior cingulate cortex, we develop two hypotheses about the pathways mediating interactions between lateral prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal <b>lobes</b> during <b>suppression,</b> and their cellular targets: the entorhinal gating hypothesis, and thalamo-hippocampal modulation via the nucleus reuniens. We hypothesize that whereas entorhinal gating is well situated to stop retrieval proactively, thalamo-hippocampal modulation may interrupt an ongoing act of retrieval reactively. Isolating the pathways that underlie retrieval suppression holds the potential to advance our understanding of a range of psychiatric disorders characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts. More broadly, an anatomical account of retrieval suppression would provide a key model system for understanding inhibitory control over cognition...|$|R

Large areas of plate structures can be monitored using active arrays employing beamforming techniques. Dispersion and multiple propagating modes are issues {{that need to be}} addressed when working with Lamb waves. Previous work has mainly focused on standard delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming while reducing the effects of multiple modes through frequency selectivity and transducer design. This paper presents a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) approach for Lamb waves using a uniform rectangular array (URA) and a single transmitter. Theoretically calculated dispersion curves are used to compensate for dispersion.

40|$|Along {{with the}} current trend of {{wireless}} technology innovation, wideband, compact size, low-profile, lightweight and multiple functional antenna and array designs are becoming more attractive in many applications. Conventional wireless systems utilise omni-directional or sectored antenna systems. The disadvantage of such antenna systems is that the electromagnetic energy, required by a particular user located in a certain direction, is radiated unnecessarily in every direction within the entire cell, hence causing interference to other users in the system. In order to limit this source of interference and direct the energy to the desired user, smart antenna systems have been investigated and developed.

Firstly, a miniaturised microstrip-fed planar monopole antenna with Archimedean spiral slots to cover WiFi/Bluetooth and LTE mobile applications has been demonstrated. The fundamental structure of the proposed antenna element is a circular patch, which operates in high frequency range, for the purpose of miniaturising the circuit dimension. In order to achieve a multi-band performance, Archimedean spiral slots, acting as resonance paths, have been etched on the circular patch antenna. Different shapes of Archimedean spiral slots have been investigated and compared. The miniaturised and optimised antenna achieves a bandwidth of 2. 2 GHz to 2. 9 GHz covering WiFi/Bluetooth (2. 45 GHz) and LTE (2. 6 GHz) mobile standards. Then a four-element linear antenna array geometry utilising the planar monopole elements with Archimedean spiral slots has been described. All the relevant parameters have been studied and evaluated. Different phase shifts are excited for the array elements, and the main beam scanning range has been simulated and analysed. The second stage of the study presents several feeding network structures, which control the amplitude and phase excitations of the smart antenna elements. Research begins with the basic Wilkinson power divider configuration. Then this thesis presents a compact feeding network for circular antenna array, reconfigurable feeding networks for tuning the operating frequency and polarisations, a feeding network on high resistivity silicon (HRS), and an ultrawide-band (UWB) feeding network covering from 0. 5 GHz to 10 GHz. The UWB feeding network is used to establish the smart antenna array system. Different topologies of phase shifters are discussed in the third stage, including ferrite phase shifters and planar phase shifters using switched delay line and loaded transmission line technologies. Diodes, FETs, MMIC and MEMS are integrated into different configurations. Based on the comparison, a low loss and high accurate Hittite MMIC analogue phase shifter has been selected and fully evaluated for this implementation. For the purpose of impedance matching and field matching, compact and ultra wideband CPW-to-Microstrip transitions are utilised between the phase shifters, feeding network and antenna elements. Finally, the fully integrated smart antenna array achieves a 10 dB reflection coefficient from 2. 25 GHz to 2. 8 GHz, which covers WiFi/Bluetooth (2. 45 GHz) and LTE (2. 6 GHz) mobile applications. By appropriately controlling the voltage on the phase shifters, the main beam of the antenna array is steered ± 50 ° and ± 52 °, for 2. 45 GHz and 2. 6 GHz, respectively. Furthermore, the smart antenna array demonstrates a gain of 8. 5 dBi with 40 ° 3 dB bandwidth in broadside direction, and has more than 10 dB side <b>lobe</b> level <b>suppression</b> across the scan. The final stage of the study investigates hardware and software automatic control systems for the smart antenna array. Two microcontrollers PIC 18 F 4550 and LPC 1768 are utilised to build the control PCBs. Using the graphical user interfaces provided in this thesis, it is able to configure the beam steering of the smart antenna array, which allows the user to analyse and optimise the signal strength of the received WiFi signals around the mobile device. The design strategies proposed in this thesis contribute to the realisation of adaptable and autonomous smart phone systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a 112 -element millimeter-wave {{waveguide}} slot array antenna to reduce the grating lobe level is presented. A hybrid-phase feeding technique combining a cophase feed and an alternating-phase feed is applied to facilitate the suppression of grating lobes. In addition, a stepped feed waveguide and offset coupling slots aligned in a line are employed to realize a tapered aperture distribution. As a result, grating <b>lobe</b> <b>suppression</b> of 8. 1 [*]dB was achieved on the diagonal planes compared to a conventional alternating-phase-fed waveguide slot array antenna. A prototype of the proposed antenna was fabricated and measured. The measured {{results show that the}} proposed antenna exhibits a − 15 [*]dB reflection bandwidth of 3. 4 % and an average realized gain of 26. 72 [*]dBi within the measured frequency range. Good agreement between the simulated and measured radiation patterns is also observed...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{transducers}} {{have been}} widely used in the medical applications. High frequency array transducers have recently attracted many research interests, since it provides not only the electronic beamforming but also the very fine image resolution. The transducers are usually either annular or linear arrays. This study concentrates on the design of both types of array in high frequency applications. The annular array is firstly investigated, and an optimized design of array geometry is developed including the kerfs influence which is usually neglected in the design of high frequency arrays. The improved imaging performance is found by this optimized design. More interestingly, the conventional annular array with element having the same surface area has a relatively large sidelobe closest to the main lobe. Two methods are applied to suppress the sidelobe. The method of using high-impedance single matching to enlarge the element bandwidth only shows very limited <b>lobe</b> <b>suppression,</b> however, a novel matching approach is found. Another method of changing the array geometry from equal area elements to equal width ones successfully suppressed the sidelobe. The imaging results suggest that the novel equal width array shows a good improvement. The linear array is then analyzed. The kerfs influence again is found to be significant for the array especially for high frequency. It is essential to use a high attenuated kerfs material in the linear array design. More importantly, the limitation of current fabrication techniques forces the linear array to concede a high grating lobe in the imaging field if it operates in a relatively high frequency. A novel linear array is developed to suppress the grating lobe without using advanced fabrication techniques. The imaging results show that the novel linear array has a general reduction of - 6 dB for the <b>lobe</b> <b>suppression.</b> The novel design made the linear array operate in a very high frequency without strong grating lobe, and the array can be fabricated by current techniques.
