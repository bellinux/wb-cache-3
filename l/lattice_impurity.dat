In this regard, an important aspect of this program was a study of radiation damage and annealing in lithium doped silicon, which is useful in reducing solar cell degradation. Luminescence was used to study defects because this property reveals electron transitions through a number of defect energy levels at any given annealing stage; the luminescence spectra give excellent resolution of many defect energy levels, and these measurements can be used to give defect symmetry in the <b>lattice,</b> <b>impurity</b> dependence, and annealing properties...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} two specific models in which topology {{plays an important}} role. In the first part we study the Hofstadter model. This is a two dimensional lattice model exhibiting the quantum Hall effect. We investigate the role of impurities {{in the emergence of}} bound states in the material. Every <b>lattice</b> <b>impurity</b> causes a bound state to occur around the impurity. These bound states only occur in the band gaps. In the second part we investigate Weyl semimetals. These materials have linear band touching points to which a topological charge can be attributed. This gives rise to exotic boundary effects like the emergence of Fermi arcs on the surface between two band touching points and the anomalous Hall effect. The surface cannot be described by a two dimensional analytic theory, but instead the whole bulk has to be taken into account. We study the effect on the polarization function on the surface. This also turns out to be highly dependent on the full bulk...|$|E

Perovskite varieties and background properties are introduced. The chronology of development of the studies in this direction has been presented – structural aspects of these OHP perovskites, from early 2 D to recent 3 D MAPbI 3 perovskites and important technological aspects of smooth thin film structure creation by various techniques, such as solvent engineering, spin- and dip - coating, vacuum deposition, cation exchange approach, nanoimprinting (particularly, a many-sided role of polymers).

Mb, 75. 50. Gg The Kondo models, or single and <b>lattice</b> <b>impurity</b> models, {{are one of the most}} challenging subjects in strongly correlated systems 1 – 3. Recent developments of reflection positivity technique in the spin space make it possible to establish some rigorous results for the half-filled strongly correlated electron systems 4 – 9. Theory of reflection positivity in the spin space for the single- and multi-channel Kondo models with spin 1 / 2 was developed recently and a series of rigorous results on the ground state properties were proved 8, 9. However some materials are described by the Kondo models with large spin, such as (La 1 −xXx) MnO 3 with X = Ba, Ca, Sr etc. and the localised spin s = 3 / 2 10. Due to more degrees of freedom in the case of large spin than in the case of spin 1 / 2, usually it is very hard to extract rigorous results for those systems. As a generalisation of the theory for the Kondo model with spin 1 / 2, we will investigate the Kondo model with large spin and provide some rigorous results on the ground state of the Kondo model in the case of half filling.

40|$|Quantum spin-orbital liquids are elusive {{strongly}} correlated {{states of}} matter {{that emerge from}} quantum frustration between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. A promising route towards the observation of those states {{is the creation of}} artificial Mott insulators where antiferromagnetic correlations between spins and orbitals can be designed. We show that Coulomb <b>impurity</b> <b>lattices</b> on the surface of gapped honeycomb substrates, such as graphene on SiC, can be used to simulate SU(4) symmetric spin-orbital lattice models. We exploit the property that massive Dirac fermions form mid-gap bound states with spin and valley degeneracies in the vicinity of a Coulomb impurity. Due to electronic repulsion, the antiferromagnetic correlations of the <b>impurity</b> <b>lattice</b> are driven by a super-exchange interaction with SU(4) symmetry, which emerges from the bound states degeneracy at quarter filling.

40|$|Experimental {{apparatus}} {{has been}} developed to accurately measure the mutual inductance of two coils with a thin film of superconductor between them. This mutual inductance {{is dependent on the}} penetration depth of the superconductor; which is a direct measure of the superconducting order parameter. Converting mutual inductance into a penetration depth is not simple and we present a novel approach to achieving this. Incorporated into the apparatus is the ability to measure the critical current of the superconductor giving a second, indirect measure of the order parameter. Monitoring this order parameter allows the investigation of the interaction between a ferromagnetic layer in electrical contact with a superconductor. The magnetic state of the ferromagnet was altered and changes observed in the order parameter of the superconductor corresponding to disordering of the domains in the ferromagnet. This is attributed to a spin-dependent Inverse Proximity Effect. Spin-polarised electrons were injected into the superconductor from the ferromagnet by passing a current. A small suppression, equivalent to a spin diffusion length of 5 nm+/- 1 nm is observed in the superconducting order parameter in addition to the suppression observed when injecting electrons that are not spin-polarised.

40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{analyzing}} quartz lumps rejected {{from a major}} metallurgical grade silicon producer and at studying the effect of several processing techniques over its purification. The final objective was to enable {{the use of these}} lumps as a raw material for silica glass production. Chemical analyses using ICP-MS technique were conducted {{to understand the nature of}} the chemical impurities in the rejected lumps, aiming to identify rather if the impurity was inside or outside the quartz lattice. The processing procedures were divided in two steps, the first consisting of only a physical treatment and the second one consisting of a chemical treatment. The physical treatment consisted of washing, milling (and separating the material by its particle size) and magnetic separation. This treatment reduced most of the impurities present in quartz, purifying over 90 % of the Fe contamination and over 60 % of the Al contaminations, but it was incapable of producing a powder with similar chemistry to commercial raw materials. The chemical treatment was conducted using two different acid mixtures (dilute HC 1 and dilute HC 1 + HF). Interesting results were obtained using the HF containing mixtures.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effects of}} impurities on topological insulators and superconductors. We start by identifying the general conditions under which the eigenenergies of an arbitrary Hamiltonian H belonging {{to one of the}} Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes undergo a robust zero energy crossing as a function of an external parameter which can be, for example, the impurity strength. We define a generalized root of det H and use it to predict or rule out robust zero-energy crossings in all symmetry classes. We complement this result with an analysis based on almost degenerate perturbation theory, which allows a derivation of the asymptotic low-energy behavior of the ensemble averaged density of states ρ ∼ Eα for all symmetry classes and makes it transparent that the exponent α does not depend on the choice of the random matrix ensemble. Finally, we show that a <b>lattice</b> of <b>impurities</b> can drive a topologically trivial system into a nontrivial phase, and in particular we demonstrate that impurity bands carrying extremely large Chern numbers can appear in different symmetry classes of two-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors.

40|$|Momentum {{relaxation}} is an ever-present and unavoidable {{ingredient of}} any realistic condensed matter system. In real-world materials {{the presence of}} a <b>lattice,</b> <b>impurities</b> or disorder forces momentum to dissipate and leads to relevant physical effects such as the finiteness of the DC transport properties, i. e. conductivities. The main purpose of this thesis is the introduction of momentum dissipation and its consequent effects into the framework of AdS/CMT, namely the applications of the gauge-gravity duality to condensed matter. A convenient and effective way of breaking the translational symmetry associated to such a conservation law is provided by massive gravity (MG) bulk theories. We consider generic massive gravity models embedded into asymptotically Anti de Sitter spacetime and we analyze them using holographic techniques. We study in detail their consistency and stability. We then focus our attention on the transport properties of the CFT duals. A big part of our work is devoted to the analysis of the electric conductivity in relation to possible universal bounds and the existence of holographic metal-insulator transitions. We moreover initiate the study of the viscoelastic response and we consider the possible violation of the well known KSS bound. We finally describe the effects of momentum relaxation on the well known holographic models for superconductivity.
