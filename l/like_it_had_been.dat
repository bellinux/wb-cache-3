5|$|The 2009 Giro d'Italia {{began on}} 9 May, with Stage 11 {{occurring}} on 20 May. The first stage, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> since 2007, {{was a team}} time trial, a stage where {{each member of the}} team raced together against the clock. Like most cycling Grand Tours do, the beginning of the 2009 Giro included a string of flat stages that were contested by sprinters. These stages were contested by Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish, among others, with Petacchi in victory becoming one of the only riders to defeat Cavendish in a sprint in the 2009 season.|$|E
25|$|When Network Ten paid $15million for {{the first}} season of Australian Idol they {{anticipated}} {{it to be a}} critical and financial success <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in other countries such as the UK and the USA. When the show aired {{for the first}} time in August 2003 it was a ratings bonanza attracting diverse ranges of viewers, from people wanting the crazy auditions to people who wanted to hear great voices. The audition process went through several major cities in Australia including Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Darwin. Australian Idol became the most popular TV show in the country with more ratings than major events such as the AFL Grand Final. The Grand Final at the Sydney Opera House attracted more than 3million viewers. It was listed as the ninth highest rating TV show in Australia in the past century in 2007. The eventual winner of the competition was Guy Sebastian with Shannon Noll finished in 2nd place.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg {{was used for}} the {{interior}} of Neville's home, while Greenwich Village {{was used for the}} exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, [...] "I don't think anyone's {{going to be able to}} do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{reactions}} were unfavorable. Artist Kenyon Cox, {{one of the}} invited artists to the 1891 competition, stated, [...] "I think it disgraceful that this great country should have such a coin as this." [...] Harper's Weekly proclaimed, [...] "The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse." [...] Saint-Gaudens was also interviewed, and as author Moran put it, [...] "injudiciously ranted": [...] "This is inept; this looks <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> designed by a young lady of sixteen, a miss who had taken only a few lessons in modeling. It is beneath criticism... There are hundreds of artists in this country, any of whom, {{with the aid of}} a designer, could have made a very respectable coin, which this is not." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{material}} was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd, the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Thayil's only contribution to the album was the song [...] "Never the Machine Forever", for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and which was also the last song the band recorded. The song initially {{came out of a}} jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore. In the liner notes, Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that {{he had a lot of}} incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album. Thayil said, [...] "It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn't satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar." [...] Cornell said, [...] "By the time we were finished, it felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> kind of hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{worldwide}} tour {{in support of}} Superunknown, the band began working on what would become their last studio album for over 15 years, choosing to produce the record themselves. However, tensions within the group reportedly arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Cornell said, [...] "By {{the time we were}} finished, it felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> kind of hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." [...] The band's fifth album, Down on the Upside, was released on May 21, 1996. It was notably less heavy than the group's earlier albums, and marked a further departure from the band's grunge roots. At the time, Soundgarden explained that they wanted to experiment with other sounds, including acoustic instrumentation. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric." [...] The overall mood of the album's lyrics is less dark than on previous Soundgarden albums, with Cornell describing some songs as [...] "self-affirming". The album spawned several singles, including [...] "Pretty Noose", [...] "Burden in My Hand", and [...] "Blow Up the Outside World". [...] "Pretty Noose" [...] was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1997. Despite favorable reviews and modest sales, the album did not match the sales or critical praise of Superunknown.|$|E

500|$|Striking Thailand with {{unprecedented}} strength, Typhoon Gay caused damage {{across many}} of its provinces. Areas between Chumphon and Rayong Provinces were severely affected by heavy rains, high winds and large swells. Rainfall amounts peaked at Chumphon, where [...] fell during the cyclone's passage. Widespread disruption of communication and electricity occurred in most areas south of Bangkok; many households remained without power for weeks. Damaging winds uprooted numerous trees and power poles and toppled wooden houses built on stilts. Exacerbated by deforestation, flash flooding triggered by the storm damaged or destroyed thousands of homes and caused at least 365 fatalities. Several towns and villages across Chumphon province were devastated, {{and one of the}} destroyed villages [...] "looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> bombed" [...] according to the Bangkok Post. Entire districts were reportedly [...] "flattened" [...] in Chumphon and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces. The typhoon destroyed many schools across Chumphon and Surat Thani Provinces, many of which were constructed of wood. All structures close to the storm's path had their windows and doors blown out, and some multi-story buildings lost their upper floors. A few schools constructed from reinforced concrete sustained little damage. Over 1,000 roads and 194 bridges were damaged or washed away. At the height of the floods, over 250,000hectares (618,000acres) of land was under water. Onshore, 558 fatalities were attributed to the storm, and another 44 took place just offshore. Throughout Thailand, approximately 47,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and over 200,000 people were affected, of which about 153,000 were left homeless. Monetary losses reached 11billion baht (US$456.5million), ranking Gay as one of the costliest disasters in the country's history.|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} February 17, with Marvel confirming that Russell {{had joined the}} cast, and revealing that Elizabeth Debicki and Chris Sullivan had also been cast, all in undisclosed roles. The production used all 18 stages at Pinewood Atlanta, an increase in stage space from what {{was used for the}} first film. Gunn said the sequel required more sets than the first and [...] "our sets are very large, even though a lot of the film is CGI. I like to have as many practical sets as we can and make the environments as real as possible so it balances out the CGI elements." [...] Despite this, Gunn noted that there were less locations featured in the sequel, with the focus instead on being more specific and detailed with the fewer places shown. Sets constructed for the film included: several for the Sovereign planet, for which Chambliss used a [...] "1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s art deco design aesthetic"; the Ravager's main ship in the film, the Eclector, which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360-degree view of the ship as well as the ability to move sections around and portray different areas of the ship; and the Iron Lotus establishment on the [...] "pleasure planet" [...] of Contraxia, which Chambliss wanted to feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> put together from [...] "a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away and industrial materials that aren't of use anymore are just left to rot", creating a [...] "kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow." [...] Interiors for other ships were also constructed, to limit the amount of blue screen the actors had to interact with; this includes the cockpit of Quill's ship that had been built for the first film before being stored in London which was transported to Atlanta for the sequel.|$|E

The more Beaton thought of this, the more furious he became, and the more he was convinced that something <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unconsciously if not consciously in her mind. He framed some keen retorts, to the general effect that with the atmosphere of illusion preserved so completely at home, Miss Vance hardly needed it in her art studies.
