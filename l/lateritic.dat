5|$|The {{district}} geography {{consists of}} seashore {{in the west}} and Western Ghats in the east. The soil is mostly <b>lateritic</b> type, characterised by high iron and aluminium content.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa mainly occurs {{from west}} of Yandanooka in the north, south to Badgingarra National Park, and east almost to Coorow. It grows in shallow sand over laterite, in deep sand, and {{occasionally}} atop <b>lateritic</b> rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among kwongan shrubland. Around 40% of plants occur on road verges.|$|E
5|$|M. nigriceps is a mound {{constructing}} species, although colonies can {{be found}} under logs. Workers decorate the nest {{with a variety of}} items, including <b>lateritic</b> pebbles and soil crumbs, in a similar fashion of meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) nests. Other items used for nest decorating include small stones and plant material.|$|E
5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly <b>lateritic</b> soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|The species tolerates a {{range of}} soils, {{requiring}} only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in <b>lateritic</b> soils and gravels, although this species {{is also found in}} deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over limestone. It also occurs in {{a range of}} vegetation complexes, including coastal and kwongan heath, tall shrubland, woodland and open forest. It is a common understorey plant in drier areas of Jarrah forest, and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. Banksia sessilis sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in the Darling Scarp.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, <b>lateritic,</b> black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of <b>lateritic</b> soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E

25|$|The Darling Plateau {{is covered}} by <b>lateritic</b> {{materials}} that cover the underlying geology.|$|E
25|$|The soil {{requirement}} is well-drained, weathered soil consisting of laterite, <b>lateritic</b> types, sedimentary types, nonlateritic red or alluvial soils.|$|E
25|$|It is {{restricted}} to the Jarrah Forest and Avon Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia, occurring between Woodanilling, Cranbrook and Collie. It grows in <b>lateritic</b> soils amongst Eucalyptus woodland, and also in sand in kwongan.|$|E
25|$|Banksia wonganensis {{is a large}} shrub {{endemic to}} Western Australia that, until 2007, was {{previously}} known as Dryandra wonganensis. It occurs within a small area {{in the vicinity of}} the Wongan Hills. It grows on <b>lateritic</b> soils in open woodland or amongst dense shrub. It is rare, but does not appear to be endangered.|$|E
25|$|Regolith may host many mineral deposits, {{for example}} mineral sands, calcrete uranium, and <b>lateritic</b> nickel deposits, among others. Elsewhere, {{understanding}} regolith properties, especially geochemical composition, {{is critical to}} geochemical and geophysical exploration for mineral deposits beneath it. The regolith {{is also an important}} source of construction material, including sand, gravel, crushed stone, lime, and gypsum.|$|E
25|$|Western Mallee is {{situated}} on south-eastern {{parts of the}} Yilgarn Craton. It has a gently undulating landscape, with somewhat more relief than eastern parts of the Mallee region. There {{are a variety of}} soils, including clays and silts over kankar; sand; <b>lateritic</b> pavements; and granite outcrops. Gypsum dunes also occur in the area. The subregion has occluded drainage, with a number of lakes, both saline and fresh.|$|E
25|$|The poorer, <b>lateritic</b> soils, about {{a quarter}} of the region, are vegetated by medium forest of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), which can grow up to 40m tall, and marri (Corymbia calophylla) (up to 60m). Other {{significant}} vegetation forms include low woodland of E.marginata and Banksia species (8%); Agonis flexuosa woodlands or scrub on Holocene marine dunes (5%); and swamps supporting sedges (5%) or low woodlands of Melaleuca (4%).|$|E
25|$|B.xylothemelia {{is rarely}} cultivated. It prefers <b>lateritic</b> and other heavy soils, and tolerates dry {{conditions}} and moderate frosts once established. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni {{suggest that it}} would be best suited to a small garden in a warm sunny area. Seed takes six to seven weeks to germinate; germination rates appear to be quite low, with most reports suggesting success rates of less than 30%.|$|E
25|$|Banksia nobilis {{occurs on}} <b>lateritic</b> rises from Eneabba {{in the north}} to Katanning in the south. Much of its {{distribution}} roughly follows {{the boundary between the}} Jarrah Forest and Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic regions, but at its northern limits it extends into the Swan Coastal Plain and Geraldton Sandplains. For most of its range it grows in eucalypt woodland and tall shrubland, but at its northern extents it grows among thick kwongan.|$|E
25|$|Ogbunike Caves, {{listed by}} UNESCO {{as a world}} Heritage Site {{is one of the}} most visited tourist sites in Anambra State. It is {{classified}} as a Sandstone cave (<b>Lateritic</b> sandstones of Campanian-Miocene age). It has very scenic vegetation with attractive waterfall. It is situated in the Ogba hills Ogbunike, across the Ugwu-Aga Escarpment Umunya by the Enugu/Onitsha Expressway and lies in the coordinates of N06 11 11 and E06 54 21.|$|E
25|$|Major {{part of the}} {{district}} comes under midland region with numerous hills and dales and it presents an undulating surface gradually ascending and merging into the slopes of Western Ghats. Soil is secondary and <b>lateritic</b> with underlying rock of laterite or disintegrated gneiss. Typical flora of this area is deciduous forest consisting of a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees. Undergrowth consists {{of a variety of}} annuals and perennials.|$|E
25|$|The Guinean forest-savanna mosaic belt extends {{across the}} middle of the country from east to west, and is the {{transition}} zone between the coastal forests and the interior savannas. The forest-savanna mosaic interlaces forest, savanna and grassland habitats. Northern Ivory Coast is part of the West Sudanian Savanna ecoregion of the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. It is a zone of <b>lateritic</b> or sandy soils, with vegetation decreasing from south to north.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} rare-earth elements are the minerals bastnäsite, monazite, and loparite and the <b>lateritic</b> ion-adsorption clays. Despite their high relative abundance, rare-earth minerals {{are more difficult}} to mine and extract than equivalent sources of transition metals (due in part to their similar chemical properties), making the rare-earth elements relatively expensive. Their industrial use was very limited until efficient separation techniques were developed, such as ion exchange, fractional crystallization and liquid–liquid extraction during the late 1950s and early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Warren has a hilly topography, {{caused by}} two factors: the {{underlying}} geology, {{which consists of}} infolded metamorphic rock of the Leeuwin Complex and Archaean granite of the Albany-Fraser Orogen; and the dissection of rivers such as the Blackwood, Warren, Shannon and Frankland. The western extent of the region takes in the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge, an 80 kilometre (50mi) long strip of coastal limestone {{on top of a}} ridge of granite, with an extensive cave system. There are a number of soil types, including hard setting loamy soil, <b>lateritic</b> soil, leached sandy soil and Holocene marine dunes.|$|E
25|$|Yves Tardy, {{from the}} French Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, {{calculated}} that laterites cover {{about one-third of}} the Earth's continental land area. <b>Lateritic</b> soils are the subsoils of the equatorial forests, of the savannas of the humid tropical regions, and of the Sahelian steppes. They cover most of the land area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn; areas not covered within these latitudes include the extreme western portion of South America, the southwestern portion of Africa, the desert regions of north-central Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the interior of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Banksia nobilis, {{commonly}} known as the golden dryandra, great dryandra or kerosene bush, is a shrub of the family Proteaceae which is endemic to Western Australia. It occurs on <b>lateritic</b> rises from Eneabba to Katanning in the state's Southwest Botanic Province. With large pinnatifid leaves with triangular lobes, and a golden or reddish pink inflorescence, it is a popular garden plant. It was known as Dryandra nobilis until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. There are two subspecies, B. nobilis subsp. nobilis and B. nobilis subsp. fragrans.|$|E
25|$|The seven hills {{are in the}} {{geological}} formation of the Deccan Trap comprising hard and amygdaloidal basalts, bole beds (red bole) and <b>lateritic</b> soils. The hill temple {{has been subjected to}} frequent damage from rockfalls in the last many years. Many pilgrims have also been injured during these rock falls; some injuries also turning fatal. The circumlocutory path around the hill has steep rock slopes and the instability of the rock formations is attributed to the fractured and columnar joints in basaltic rocks. Hence, this issue has been a subject of study by geologists to provide a solution to prevent damages to the temple and causing injuries to the pilgrims.|$|E
25|$|Landforms {{present in}} this region include the upland terra firme (non-flooded) mostly on nutrient-poor <b>lateritic</b> soils, ancient {{alluvial}} plains (mostly non-flooded) on nutrient-rich soils, and present alluvial plains (várzea, seasonally flooded) of super-rich sediments renewed with each annual flood. Floristically, distinct lowland humid forest types occur {{on each of these}} landforms with the terra firme mature forests and late successional, seasonally flooded forest being the two major types. Permanent swamp forests are common on the alluvial plains. Pockets of nutrient-poor white sand soils are found here that host forests of lower height, a more open forest canopy, and lower alpha diversity, but with many endemics. The forests are mostly dense tropical rain forest, but some patches of open forest exist.|$|E
25|$|Laterite soils {{have a high}} clay content, which {{mean they}} have higher Cation Exchange Capacity and water-holding {{capacity}} than sandy soils. However, if the structure of <b>lateritic</b> soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. They are good for tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes.|$|E
25|$|Mount Barker {{is one of}} the 5 {{nominated}} subregions of the Great Southern wine {{region in}} Western Australia, which is Australia's largest wine region with a rectangle 200 kilometres from east to west and over 100 kilometers from north to south. The area has been described as 'the birthplace of the Great Southern wine region' and has won numerous awards for a variety of wines. Situated {{as it is in the}} middle of the Great Southern, the continental aspects of the climate make this quintessential country for Riesling and Shiraz. While, as with the rest of the region, rainfall is winter-spring dominant, late vintage rains can create problems. Mount Barker's continentality also means greater diurnal temperature fluctuations and the occasional spring frost. The Plantagenet Plateau, with Mount Barker its centre point, is marked by its marri soils, <b>lateritic</b> gravelly/sandy loams coming directly from granite rock protusions. Lat: 34 36’S; Alt: 180–250 m; Hdd: 1488; Gsr: 287mm; Mjt: 19C; Harvest: Early March to mid-April; Chief Viticultural Hazard: Spring frosts; late vintage rain. Plantagenet Wines established in 1968 was one of the first wineries in the region and is located within the town boundary.|$|E
500|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{grows in}} tall closed kwongan heath in <b>lateritic</b> soils, {{sometimes}} with a sparse overstorey of wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) or Drummond's gum (E.drummondii). Other B.ser. Dryandra species that co-occur with it include B.stuposa, B.armata var. ignicida and B.nobilis.

500|$|Consistent {{with these}} edaphic preferences, A.obovatus is {{widespread}} and {{common in the}} scrub and heath commonly found on the sandplains of Southwest Australia, and is also common in the sedgelands that develop in moister areas of the region. It is uncommon in forest or woodland areas, because these are usually associated with <b>lateritic</b> soils; {{but it may be}} found in stands of jarrah or marri forest where these grow in laterite-free sand. The climate in its range is mediterranean, with annual rainfall from [...]|$|E
500|$|Hagley sits on mostly flat {{land near}} the Meander River at an {{elevation}} of [...] above sea level. The land formation is largely alluvial with <b>Lateritic</b> podzolic soils, classified as dermosol under the Australian Soil Classification system. These soils date from the Tertiary Period, with some from the more recent Quaternary. Hagley was founded, and remains, an agricultural centre. Dairy and pea-farming prior to World War II {{have given way to}} poppies as the principal crop. These poppies are opium poppies grown for Tasmanian Alkaloids, in nearby Westbury.|$|E
500|$|This {{species is}} {{restricted}} to siliceous sandplain soils and will not grow in [...] calcareous soils such as the limestone plains of the Nullarbor, or even siliceous dunes with limestone at little depth. This restriction explains the disjunctions east of Israelite Bay: the species occurs only in those few locations where the existence of cliff-top dunes of deep siliceous sand provide suitable habitat. Provided the soil is siliceous and fairly dry, A.cuneatus tolerates a range of edaphic conditions: it grows in both <b>lateritic</b> sand and sands of marine origin, and it tolerates pH levels ranging from 3.8 to 6.6.|$|E
500|$|Banksia lemanniana {{is found}} near the {{southern}} coast of Western Australia, most of its population protected within Fitzgerald River National Park. Outside the park, it reaches the Ravensthorpe Range to the northeast and the rabbit-proof fence to the east, as well as isolated populations westwards as far as Pallinup estuary. The annual rainfall is [...] It is found on the tops and slopes of hills as well as flatter areas on rocky or <b>lateritic</b> soil, as well as sand, in mallee scrubland or heath. Banksia lemanniana is relatively secure as much of its range lies within a National Park, {{and it is not}} a species collected for the cut flower industry. It is hence classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia.|$|E
500|$|Meat ants {{thrive in}} varied habitats, {{especially}} {{where it is}} open and warm. These ants are adapted to and thrive in warm climates and areas with constant high temperatures. The meat ant shares its distribution with many other animals and insects, {{some of which may}} cause harm to the ant or rival it, such as the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus). Nests are seen in box-pine scrubs, Callitris forests, dry and wet sclerophyll woodland, eucalypt open woodland, in farm pastures, flat savannah woodland, mallee woodland, heath, mulga, riparian woodland, around roads and cracks in sidewalks, and urban areas such as urban gardens and parkland. Nests are also common in <b>lateritic</b> ridges, granite outcrops and clay formations. Meat ants are able to survive in dry areas if there is a rich supply of water and food resources (such as honeydew and arthropod prey), especially along river banks, station properties and irrigated areas. Meat ants typically occur at altitudes of [...] above sea level, though at times they can be found at heights of [...] Those that are found at these altitudes are always associated with Eucalyptus rubida, and colonies situated in eastern New South Wales tend to nest near E. melliodora and E. blakelyi. In the south coast of New South Wales, meat ants are mainly found in heath shrubland, but are absent from heavily timbered slopes and cannot build nests in quartz. Other areas where the ants do not occur include dense pastures, dense bushes, tropical rainforests and treeless areas. For example, the Canberra suburb of Turner was constructed on subterranean clover pasture, which meat ants do not nest around. Their populations would later flourish and nests became numerous around houses after shrubs and trees were planted.|$|E
