5000|$|Listwashing is {{the process}} through which {{individual}} entries in mailing lists are removed. These mailing lists typically contain email addresses or phone numbers of those that have not voluntarily subscribed. An entry {{is removed from the}} list after a complaint is received. Only complainers are removed via this process. It is widely believed that only a small fraction [...] of those inconvenienced with unsolicited email end up sending a proper complaint. Because most of those that have not voluntarily subscribed stay on the list, and only the complainers stop complaining because they are removed, this helps spammers to maintain a [...] "complaint-free" [...] list of spammable email addresses. Internet service providers who forward complaints to the spamming party are often seen as assisting the spammer in list washing, or, in short, helping spammers. Most legitimate <b>list</b> <b>holders</b> provide their customers with listwashing and data deduplication service regularly for free or a small fee.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} Greek {{politics}} {{must begin with}} study of friendship in the Greek world as the two are inextricably intertwined. The first chapter devotes itself to considering what friendship was for the Greeks, and who they considered their friends to be, and this becomes the basis for considering friendships in political contexts. This thesis is concerned with Greek interstate affairs in the years between 435 and 336, and considers the Greeks and their friends in other states and the impact this had upon domestic and foreign policy. The role of the institution of πpoξɛvía is considered, as the official medium for liaison between poleis, {{as well as the}} unofficial contacts. Domestic appointments are also studied, and the effect that "foreign" friendships had on selection for magistracies. Yet the Greeks did not only deal with Greeks, but, within this century, were compelled to look outside their own world and interact with states outside Greece, such as the Persian Empire or Thrace, as well as those on the fringes of their world, particularly Macedon. But these other cultures did not always have the same understanding of what friendship was and what duties and rights were due to friends as the Greeks did, and this led to misunderstandings and difficulties in the relations between Greeks a-Greeks. The differences that could exist were exemplified by the Greeks’ dealings with Philip of Macedon, and the Greeks' failure to realise this contributed largely to their ultimate defeat at Philip's hands.
