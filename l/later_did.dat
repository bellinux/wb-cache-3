5|$|Matthew Bevan Cox (born July 2, 1969), {{commonly}} known as Matthew Cox, also sometimes known as Matthew B. Cox and Matt Cox, is an American felon and con {{man who has been}} convicted of conspiracy and grand theft. Cox, also an aspiring author, wrote an unpublished manuscript entitled The Associates in which the main character traveled the country committing mortgage fraud similarly as Cox <b>later</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East was confident of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals {{would have to come}} up with £100 million a year to better their offer. Parry was undecided as to which bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, he wanted the reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea of a football channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they <b>later</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1883 Messager and Chabrier {{gave the}} first {{performance}} of the latter's Trois valses romantiques at the Société Nationale de Musique. The concert also included the two-piano version premiere of España. A close friend of Chabrier from the 1880s until Chabrier's death, Messager had a great admiration for Chabrier's opera Gwendoline and swore that he would conduct it in Paris, which he <b>later</b> <b>did.</b> He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the published vocal score of the work.|$|E

5|$|Only <b>later</b> <b>did</b> Pflanz {{find out}} that it was Wick he saw bailing out. Göring had ordered Kriegsmarine torpedo boats on a night-long search-and-rescue mission for Wick. The next day, other naval vessels and the Seenotdienst (air-sea rescue) service, escorted by fighters of JG2, {{continued}} in vain to search for him. He was never found, however, and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action, presumed dead, on 4 December 1940, earning him his last reference in the daily Wehrmachtbericht. Wick, on his 168th combat mission, was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank loans in 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm <b>later</b> <b>did</b> in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term failures of strategy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the court}} in Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, {{which led to the}} formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to {{the court in}} 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only <b>later</b> <b>did</b> professionals replace these original singers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Smith's death, the fourteen-year-old Lennon was visiting members of the Stanley family in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, and was not {{informed}} until he returned home. Lennon's first reaction was to laugh hysterically, but then to privately grieve and cry, as he <b>later</b> <b>did</b> after hearing {{about the death of}} his mother three years later, and the death of Stuart Sutcliffe (The Beatles' first bass player) which were all major factors in Lennon's early life. In the same year as Smith’s death the McCartney family moved to 20 Forthlin Road, which is only ¾ of a mile (1.2km) from Mendips. Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney {{for the first time at}} St. Peter's Church, where Smith was buried.|$|E
5|$|It {{was very}} soon after their arrival that they {{learned of the}} death of Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would {{repudiate}} his father's banishment of the Bourbons (which he <b>later</b> <b>did).</b> Louis XVIII then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis to send his son, Louis Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but they did not at this time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and sent some money to Louis. Louis XVIII's court in exile was being spied on by French police. The court-in-exile was being financed mainly by interest owed from Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France and had to cut its expenses significantly.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's first {{work for}} the series was {{as part of the}} digital {{coloring}} team for the first Devil Summoner. He later had minor roles in artwork and character design in the first Persona and Soul Hackers. He <b>later</b> <b>did</b> the secondary characters for the Persona 2 duology, and was also part of the team checking over the PlayStation ports of the first three Shin Megami Tensei games, as well as minor work on Nocturne. Soejima was chosen as the lead designer for Persona 3 by Kaneko, as Kaneko wanted the younger staff members to gain experience. Persona 3 proved challenging for Soejima as he needed to refine his drawing style and take the expectations of series fans into account. He would go on to design for Persona 3 FES and Portable, Persona 4, and Persona 5. Soejima's drawing style is recognized as being lighter-toned than Kaneko's work on the Shin Megami Tensei games.|$|E

5|$|The {{only other}} {{astronomer}} from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived {{a century after}} Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus {{was the first to}} prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus <b>later</b> <b>did</b> in the 16th century. During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata, and by the Persian astronomers Albumasar and Al-Sijzi.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} civil {{disorder}} {{existed in the}} island's mountainous region after {{the invasion of the}} United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and <b>later</b> <b>did</b> the same to the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under the influence of alcohol, and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army.|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka <b>later</b> <b>did,</b> as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} events {{reported}} low spectator attendance despite having acceptable ticket sales.
