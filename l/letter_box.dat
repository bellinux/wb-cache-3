25|$|The first {{design for}} London, by Grissel & Son of Hoxton Ironworks was rather stubby and rectangular, {{although}} surmounted by a decorative ball. Erected in 1855, they were replaced because people {{complained that they}} were ugly. One survived and was earmarked for preservation {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. It was unfortunately stored in a contractor's yard in London which was subject to a direct hit from a German bomb during the Blitz, thus destroying forever some important boxes. A photograph of this Grissel box together with a Giant Fluted box and a Penfold in the contractor's yard appeared in The <b>Letter</b> <b>Box</b> by Jean Young Farrugia.|$|E
25|$|Rural {{and some}} {{suburban}} areas of North America may utilize curbside mailboxes, {{also known as}} rural mailboxes. These receptacles generally consist of a large metal box mounted on a support designed primarily to receive large quantities of incoming mail, often with an attached flag to signal the presence of outgoing mail to the mail carrier. In the US and Canada, rural curbside mailboxes may be found grouped together at property boundaries or road/driveway intersections, depending upon conditions. Although the United States Postal Service (USPS) has general regulations stating the distance a <b>letter</b> <b>box</b> may be from the road surface, these requirements may be changed by the local postmaster according to local environment and road conditions.|$|E

25|$|An avid gardener, {{she turned}} her {{attention}} to the grounds. Chester Holmes Aldrich first designed a swimming pool for the property, a raised structure enclosed on three sides by a pergola of stone piers and wooden trellises. After that came the Bait Box, a playhouse for the couple's son, Gifford Bryce Pinchot. Elliptical openings in the stone walls around the courtyard provide views over the surrounding landscape. Next, in the late 1920s, when her husband was serving his first term as governor, came the <b>Letter</b> <b>Box,</b> a small cottage intended both as an archive for his papers and an office for his political staff when he was in residence. In their last collaboration, Aldrich and Cornelia Pinchot added a moat, which finally gave the house the raised effect Hunt had originally intended. In building it became necessary to lengthen the east lawn and build a new stone wall to support the moat.|$|E
500|$|Cannons {{continued}} to be improved during the 15th and 16th centuries. Castle loopholes were adapted to allow cannons and other firearms {{to be used in}} a defensive role, but offensively gunpowder weapons still remained relatively unreliable. England had lagged behind Europe in adapting to this new form of warfare; Dartmouth and Kingswear Castles, built in the 1490s to defend the River Dart, and Bayard's Cover, designed in 1510 to defend Dartmouth harbour itself, were amongst the few English castles designed in the continental style during the period, and even these lagged behind the cutting edge of European design. Scottish castles were more advanced in this regard, partially {{as a result of the}} stronger French architectural influences. Ravenscraig Castle in Scotland, for example, was an early attempt in the 1460s to deploy a combination of [...] "letter box" [...] gun-ports and low-curved stone towers for artillery weapons. These <b>letter</b> <b>box</b> gun-ports, common in mainland Europe, rapidly spread across Scotland but were rarely used in England during the 15th century. Scotland also led the way in adopting the new caponier design for castle ditches, as constructed at Craignethan Castle.|$|E

2500|$|New {{post box}} designs were ordered in 1887 for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. For {{the first time}} there was a lamp-post mounted <b>letter</b> <b>box</b> for use in London squares, but which soon {{established}} themselves in rural areas (see lamp boxes). For the big cities, a double-aperture oval-shaped pillar (designated Type C) was introduced, partly to increase capacity and certainly in London, to allow mail to be pre-sorted by region, normally with apertures marked separately for [...] "London" [...] and [...] "Country". All pillar and lamp boxes now had the distinctive Imperial cypher of Victoria Regina, whilst the wall-mounted boxes continued to show only a block cypher VR. The new pillar box design saw out the reign and remained little changed until 1905, when the basic design was refined.|$|E
2500|$|Number 10's door is {{the product}} of the renovations Townsend ordered in 1766; it was {{probably}} not completed until 1772. Executed in the Georgian style by the architect Kenton Couse, it is unassuming and narrow, consisting of a single white stone step leading to a modest brick front. The small, six-panelled door, originally made of black oak, is surrounded by cream-coloured casing and adorned with a semicircular fanlight window. Painted in white, between the top and middle sets of panels, is the number [...] "10". The zero of the number [...] "10" [...] is painted in a very eccentric style, in a 37° angle anticlockwise. One theory is that this is in fact a capital 'O' as found in the Roman's Trajan alphabet that was used by the Ministry of Works at the time. A black iron knocker {{in the shape of a}} lion's head is between the two middle panels; below the knocker is a brass <b>letter</b> <b>box</b> with the inscription [...] "First Lord of the Treasury". The doorbell is inscribed with [...] "PUSH" [...] although is rarely used in practice. A black ironwork fence with spiked newel posts runs along the front of the house and up each side of the step to the door. The fence rises above the step into a double-swirled archway, supporting an iron gas lamp surmounted by a crown. (See The Entrance Door c1930: As seen from the outside) ...|$|E
2500|$|The only {{historical}} document concerning Leonardo's sexual life is an accusation of sodomy made in 1476, {{while he was}} still at the workshop of Verrocchio. [...] Florentine court records show that [...] on April9, 1476, an anonymous denunciation was left in the tamburo (<b>letter</b> <b>box)</b> in the Palazzo della Signoria (town hall) accusing a young goldsmith and male prostitute, Jacopo Saltarelli (sometimes referred to as an artist's model) of being [...] "party to many wretched affairs and consents to please those persons who request such wickedness of him". The denunciation accused four people of sodomizing Saltarelli: Leonardo da Vinci, a tailor named Baccino, Bartolomeo di Pasquino, and Leonardo Tornabuoni, a member of the aristocratic Tornabuoni family. Saltarelli's name was known to the authorities because another man had been convicted of sodomy with him earlier the same year. Charges against the five were dismissed on the condition that no further accusations appear in the tamburo. The same accusation did in fact appear on June 7 but charges were again dismissed. [...] The charges were dismissed because the accusations did not meet the legal requirement for prosecution: all accusations of sodomy had to be signed, but this one was not. (Such accusations could be made secretly, but not anonymously.) There is speculation that since the family of one of the accused, Leonardo Tornabuoni, was associated with Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal. Sodomy was theoretically an extremely serious offense, carrying the death penalty, but its very seriousness made it equally difficult to prove. It was also an offence for which punishment was very seldom handed down in contemporary Florence, where homosexuality was sufficiently widespread and tolerated to make the word Florenzer (Florentine) slang for homosexual in Germany.|$|E
