5|$|After {{the release}} of Metroid: Other M, it was {{reported}} to have a bug where the door in Sector 3 is permanently <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> impassable, preventing players from continuing. Nintendo revealed that a bug is triggered when the player backtracks to the room within Sector 3 where they have previously obtained the Ice Beam. The company has set up a program that allows players affected by the bug to send in an SD card or their Wii console with their save files to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} {{objective}} is to navigate through seven worlds to {{reach the end of}} the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access hidden worlds, the player will need to locate portals which are scattered throughout the game's levels. Portals are usually <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> require keys to open. Furthermore, the exploration of these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently alters some sprites and the overworld map's colour scheme.|$|E
5|$|Its {{measured}} brightness is , translating into {{a diameter}} of about 22% of its primary, or {{in the range of}} , assuming similar albedo. To put this in perspective, this would make it larger than all but four of the asteroids, after 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 4 Vesta, and 10 Hygiea. In spite of its relatively large size, however, lightcurve studies suggest that Hi'iaka is not a gravitationally collapsed spheroid; they further suggest that Hi'iaka is not tidally <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> has a rotation period of about 9.8 hours.|$|E

5|$|Its {{orbital period}} of 20.16155 days is about 5.0% from a 1:3 mean-motion {{resonance}} with the Charon–Pluto orbital period of 6.387 days. With the other moons Nix, Kerberos and Hydra, it forms {{part of an}} unusual 1:3:4:5:6 (period ratio) sequence of near resonances. In contrast to its orbit, Styx's rotation is very chaotic; like the other small Plutonian moons, Styx's rotation is not tidally <b>locked,</b> <b>and</b> it varies rapidly over short timescales (with {{a rate of about}} 3.239 days {{at the time of the}} New Horizons flyby).|$|E
5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which are attached to the restraints.|$|E

5|$|Pablo Miño was {{released}} from prison, but Curto refused to release García, saying that Miño had extenuating circumstances which García did not. Miño's job was to give García the required tools, not to do the maintenance. He was in the street, watching over the van, which was not properly parked and <b>locked,</b> <b>and</b> did not see García's work before the explosion. Curto stopped short of pronouncing Miño innocent at that early stage.|$|E

The group did some {{recording}} with producer Brendan O'Brien in 2008 but halted because of Tyler's health problems. Aerosmith bassist Tom Hamilton told the Boston Herald in September 2010 that Tyler believes he has the {{time and energy to}} continue fronting the band while also being a judge on American Idol.|$|E
5|$|While the Beatles were there, the Maharishi was {{negotiating}} with the Indian government to use some nearby parkland for an airstrip for a plane {{which he had been}} given; a deal which several thousand landless peasants objected to as they had been denied the use of the land for farming. The ashram was surrounded by barbed wire and the gates were kept <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> guarded. While the Maharishi kept the media away from his famous students, he himself gave interviews to the press.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E
5|$|Constable Hanks {{reported}} {{the matter to}} his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline. Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. The Act made all homosexual acts between men, as well as procurement or attempted procurement of such acts, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour. He found the house <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> Hammond gone, but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother's house in Camden Town. In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest, Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond, who had consequently escaped to his brother's house in Gravesend.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E

5|$|In late 2003, {{following}} the commercial success achieved by 50 Cent's debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin, Interscope Records head Jimmy Iovine asserted that 50 Cent {{had a high}} enough profile to move into making films. Plans for a film were revealed the following year, when 50 Cent revealed {{that he would be}} writing and directing his first motion picture, a semi-autobiographical work based on his difficult childhood experiences, with the Oscar-nominated director Jim Sheridan assisting in the production of the film. The film was originally known under the title <b>Locked</b> <b>and</b> Loaded, although this later became Get Rich or Die Tryin. Get Rich or Die Tryin was released to cinemas in 2005, and received generally mixed reviews from contemporary film critics.|$|E
5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard. Themed {{to the popular}} comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three Six Flags theme parks around the United States: Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Great America. The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After the train is <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.|$|E

50|$|The Allegheny River <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Dam No. 3 (also {{known as}} C.W.

5|$|Between 1009 and 1012, the Kilab {{participated in}} the {{struggle}} between Mansur ibn Lu'lu', the ruler of the Aleppo, and the Hamdanids and their regional backers for control of Aleppo. Twice the Kilab betrayed the Hamdanids and their allies, and in return, demanded from Mansur numerous pastures to breed their flocks and war horses. Instead, Mansur, who viewed the Kilab as a hindrance to his rule, strove to eliminate them by luring the tribesmen into a trap. To that end, on 27 May 1012, he invited them to a feast and once the tribesmen entered his palace, the gates were <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> Mansur and his ghilmān (slave soldiers; sing. ghulām) attacked them. Several were killed and the rest, including Salih, were imprisoned in the citadel of Aleppo. Afterward, the Kilabi emir Muqallid ibn Za'ida besieged the town of Kafartab to gain leverage with Mansur. This prompted the latter to move the Kilabi prisoners to facilities with better conditions in case of future peace negotiations with Muqallid. However, upon hearing of Muqallid's death and his failed siege, Mansur returned the prisoners to the citadel's dungeons, where many among them, including some chieftains, were executed or died of torture or poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes <b>locked,</b> <b>and</b> {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E
5|$|Rossi {{struggled}} with severe tyre degradation and increasingly <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> flat-spotted his tyres. Vandoorne had reduced Rossi's lead by the penultimate lap. He {{chose not to}} rush to avoid damaging his car. He moved into the lead after leaving the back straight when Rossi ran wide at the first hairpin. Haryanto made a similar strategy call as Vandoorne and passed King and Rossi to move into second position. Vandoorne maintained the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race and crossed the start/finish line after 32 laps to win the race. Haryanto finished second, with Rossi in third. King took fourth, ahead of Visoiu and Evans. Berthon, Leal, Negrão, and Matsushita rounded out the top-ten finishers. Eleventh-place finisher Stöckinger became the first driver from the Philippines to complete a GP2 Series race. He was ahead of Sirotkin, Markelov, Canamasas, and Stanaway. Amberg, Binder, de Jong and Lynn were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
