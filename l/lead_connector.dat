Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm connector port Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker. Pulse generator reached ERI in 2006, with change {{out to a}} Medtronic Sigma SSR 306 (5 / 6 mm connector port) and preservation of the 5 mm lead. She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm flexible sealing ring at the port entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm <b>lead</b> <b>connector</b> pins. The inner barrel diameter of the connector port is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor sleeves (c) splice kits (d) lead adaptor kits. Aging leads, adaptor kits or sleeves themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system. ConclusionA 5 / 6 mm configuration pacemaker header connector port allows for significant tolerances when a 5 mm lead is used. Consideration {{must be made to}} prevent leaks...|$|E

A machine visual system eliminates any errors related to human fatigue and accommodates increases in production without increasing {{the long term}} cost. In this thesis a machine-based {{visual inspection}} system for cardiac pacing and defibrillation leads was developed and tested. The main objective {{of this research is}} to develop the methods and algorithms necessary to inspect dimensions of cardiac pacing and defibrillation <b>lead</b> <b>connectors.</b> To create the inspection vision system it is necessary to select a proper illumination technique, camera, lenses and image processing algorithm. This thesis presents the design of such a vision system for the dimension inspection of the connector of a particular lead. In the algorithms, pattern recognition is used over filtered images to identify connector features. The connector dimensions are checked to corroborate that they comply with the ISO standard. To determine the error percentage we measure each connector with a caliper and compared those values with the ones given by the vision system. The error percentage values are between 0 % and 13 %. The error percentage is less than 1 % in the majority of the connector’s parts. These results wer...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} WR 05 (140 - 220 GHz) and WR 03 (220 - 325 GHz) five-stage {{amplifier}} modules with novel membrane microstrip-to-waveguide transitions. The modules use a 250 -nm InP double {{heterojunction bipolar transistor}} (DHBT) technology and multilayer thin-film microstrip transmission lines. The waveguide transitions use E-plane probes on 3 - μm-thin GaAs membrane substrate. Beam <b>lead</b> <b>connectors</b> integrated on the transition eliminate the need of highly reactive bond wires. In addition, process steps such as backside metallization, backside vias, and nonrectangular dicing of the integrated circuits (ICs) are not required. The WR 05 amplifier module demonstrates a peak gain of 24 dB at 245 GHz and more than 10 -dB gain from 155 to 270 GHz. The WR- 03 module has 19 -dB gain from 230 to 254 GHz with input and output return loss better than 10 dB from 225 to 330 GHz. The two modules were also characterized in terms of noise. The minimum noise figures were measured to 9. 7 dB at 195 GHz and 10. 8 dB at 240 GHz for the WR 05 and WR 03 modules, respectively.

This study aimed to determine {{the safety of a}} wide-field suprachoroidal electrode array following chronic implantation using histopathologic techniques and electroretinography. METHODS: A platinum electrode array in a wide silicone substrate was implanted unilaterally in the suprachoroidal space in adult cats (n = 7). The <b>lead</b> and <b>connector</b> were tunneled out of the orbit and positioned subcutaneously. Postsurgical recovery was assessed using fundus photography and electroretinography (ERG). Following 3 months of passive implantation, the animals were terminated and the eyes assessed for the pathologic response to implantation. RESULTS: The implant was mechanically stable in the suprachoroidal space {{during the course of the}} study. The implanted eye showed a transient increase in ERG response amplitude at 2 weeks, which returned to normal by 3 months. Pigmentary changes were observed at the distal end of the implant, near the optic disc. Histopathologic assessment revealed a largely intact retina and a thin fibrous capsule around the suprachoroidal implant cavity. The foreign body response was minimal, with sporadic presence of macrophages and no active inflammation. All implanted eyes were negative for bacterial or fungal infections. A midgrade granuloma and thick fibrous buildup surrounded the extraocular cable. Scleral closure was maintained in six of seven eyes. There were no staphylomas or choroidal incarceration.

40|$|Developing <b>lead</b> free <b>connector</b> {{products}} involves {{at least}} two distinct steps: removing the lead from the product and ensuring the product has sufficient thermal stability. Lead is most commonly found in terminal finishes and {{has been removed from}} most thermoplastic materials used in connectors. Ensuring sufficient thermal stability requires knowledge of the thermal excursions involved in soldering and how these excursions translate into product performance metrics. For reflow soldering, we know the maximum soldering temperatures will increase by 20 to 30 C. The magnitude of this change is not large, however, the temperature value, 260 C, exceeds the melt point of many engineering thermoplastics. Since the cost of these plastics typically scales with melt temperature, an increase in thermal requirements can mean a significant cost increase. In this paper we strive to understand the fundamental response of the plastics to the transient thermal excursions involved in wave soldering. FEM simulations demonstrate the thermal gradients that exist during these processes. These results can be used to understand the heat transfer and then to engineer the products to ensure reliability. Wave solder process simulation shows that the pin to plastic interface resides at a temperature very near to that of the solder. Connector terminals, made from copper based alloys, often have very high thermal diffusivities, increasing heat flow from the solder pot into the plastic. FEM results are compared to experimental results from lab and production manufactured testing of solderable interconnects. A test method for evaluating plastic performance in wave solder applications is proposed...|$|R

MSHA data show that 381 "non-contact electric arc burn" injuries occurred in the mining industry from 1996 - 2005. A more detailed study of data from 1990 - 2001 showed that five types of apparatus - circuit breakers, conductors, nonpowered hand tools, electrical meters and test <b>leads,</b> and <b>connectors</b> and plugs were involved in two-thirds of the lost workday injuries. Many of the protections from electrical arcing injury available to workers in other industries stem from the application of National Fire Protection Association Standard 70 E - Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace (NFPA 70 E). NFPA 70 E is a generally accepted industry guideline document, but excludes underground mining from its scope. Many of its practices and procedures, however, can be applied in the mining workplace to supplement the existing electrical safety requirements of Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations. This paper describes how NFPA 70 E can be applied to mining workplaces after an analysis of the mine power system electrical arcing hazards has been completed (and Hazard/Risk Categories determined) using the tables from NFPA 70 E or the calculation method as described in IEEE 1584. NFPA 70 E can then be used to determine the levels and types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect miners against burn injuries.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pacemaker}} of the 1980 s {{is designed}} to maintain atrioventricular synchrony through dual-chamber pacing. This pacemaker is multiprogrammable and capable of telemetric transmission of biologic, electronic and electrophysiologic data. Several developments have made this therapeutic modality possible: 1) the cumulative survival rate of many lithium-battery pacemakers exceeds 95 % at 5 years; 2) <b>lead</b> and <b>connector</b> problems are rare; 3) atrial and ventricular electrode malfunctions occur in less than 2 % of implants; and 4) new introducer techniques have simplified implantation (mortality and major morbidity rates are 0. 5 and 0. 4 %, respectively). With multiprogrammability, pacemaker function can be optimized for the patient's needs, and about 20 % of reoperations can be avoided. Ninety-six dual-chamber (DDD) pacemakers, 55 {{of which have been}} followed up for more than 3 months, have provided trouble-free performance and have yielded salutary clinical results, particularly when implanted to replace previous ventricular inhibited units. Problems with these pacemakers have included unusual pacing electrocardiograms, pacemaker eccentricities, programmer maintenance, pacing and follow-up complexities and costs. In the 1980 s, effort will be required to find a balance between rapidly evolving technology and the clinical need for complex pacing systems. From 1978 to 1981, the rate of pacemaker implantation grew from 309 to 513 implants per million population per year, and there are now approximately 500, 000 patients with implanted pacemakers living in the United States. Indications for pacing are ill-defined, because in many cases the assessment of clinical response to pacing is largely subjective, lacking satisfactory quantitative indexes. This decade will be a time of reappraisal of the extent of clinical applicability of new techniques, particularly the multi-programmable dual-chamber system which, after 3 years of clinical trial, shows promise of being the predominant pacemaker of the immediate future...|$|R

To describe the optical radiation field a model based on microwave theory was developed, and the optical waveguide-modes were determined.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach for}} signal conditioning individual resistance strain gages is to connect each installed gage with three lead wires {{to a set}} of three fixed completion resistors, all arranged electrically in a Wheatstone bridge circuit. An alternative approach for strain gage signal conditioning, sometimes called the Anderson loop, was developed at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center. 1 This technique offers some significant advantages when used with the strain gage rosettes employed in experimental stress analysis. Invented 2 to eliminate the measurement uncertainties due to random electrical impedance variations in lead wires and connections found in harsh test environments, NASA's loop circuit approach delivers twice the equivalent bridge output level, and simplifies wiring, temperature compensation and data analysis as well. Circuitry The enabling technology for this technique is the dual-differential subtractor measurement circuit function defined in Fig. 1. As illustrated in eq. 1, a subtractor's output is the difference between two independent floating differential inputs. vout = A 1 v 1 – A 2 v 2 (1) The subtractor's two differential input voltages, v 1 and v 2, are processed by amplification factors A 1 and A 2, respectively, to yield an output voltage, vout. In a strain rosette application, amplification factors A 1 and A 2 are typically set to unity. Noise voltages rejected by this ideal subtractor arrangement include: all identical noise voltage components at the two inputs, the common-mode voltages, vcm 1 and vcm 2 at each differential input, and the interior-mode voltage, vim. Practical subtractors can be designed to operate with sub-microvolt stability and essentially no energy transfer with the strain gage circuitry they observe. The loop subtractors are typically connected in a Kelvin manner.

40|$|Sandwich constructions made of thin metal {{sheets and}} {{structural}} concrete have been reliable and economic composite {{structures in the}} past decades. The application of thin-walled facings made of Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) combines the advantages of these constructions and allows for slender construction thicknesses despite the progressing demands on thermal insulation. However, the design principles of the common structures {{as well as the}} connecting devices of structural concrete panels are not applicable offhand for TRC. The experimental investigations examine the load-bearing behaviour of the components e. g. TRC-facings, core foams and connecting devices made of FRP as well as the load-bearing behaviour of assembled sandwich sections subjected to tensile, shear and bending forces. The load-bearing behaviour of sandwich members without connectors is determined by stiffness and strength of the core material and the bond strength between concrete and core which is depending on the applied production method. The application of <b>connectors</b> <b>leads</b> to higher load-bearing capacities and ductility. While pin-connectors with a low bending rigidity predominantly add tensile capacity and stiffness, the shear grids made of carbon fibres contribute to the capacity, stiffness and ductility under tensile, shear and flexural loading in equal sense. Non-linear numerical simulations are conducted to investigate methodically the influences of decisive parameters. Material models including the damage formulation for the components core, connectors, textile reinforcement, concrete as well as the bond between foam and concrete have been developed and calibrated on the basis of material tests and own experiments. Based on the contact models for the bond, an extended model is derived to consider both the shear cracking and the debonding of the core allowing for an appropriate description of the failure of the shear grid. The parameter calculations reveal that shear grid and core establish a truss action under shear loading depending on the stiffness of the core. Based on the theory of STAMM/WITTE an extended model for sandwich construction made of TRC is developed which appropriately describes the load-bearing behaviour under tensile, shear and flexural loading. The contributions of core and connecting devices are formulated by elastic spring models and also the influence of the cracking of the faces on the deformation of the panel is considered. Experimental and numerical results are in good accordance with the derived model. For the practical application constant and linear strain changes of the facings (temperature and shrinkage) as well as distributed loads {{have been added to the}} model and a design concept is proposed. The applicability of these models is proven by prototype applications of a sandwich façade and a modular building made of structural TRC sandwich panels...|$|R
