5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>on</b> December8, Epsilon transitioned into {{a remnant}} low {{pressure}} area. The remnant circulation elongated {{in advance of}} a frontal zone, and it dissipated <b>late</b> <b>on</b> December9. The front absorbed the remnants the next day.|$|E
5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical {{near the border}} of North Carolina and Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 while it was near Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning more to the east. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland the next day. It was last observed <b>late</b> <b>on</b> September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|As Barbara {{moved toward}} the Canadian Maritimes, it began to undergo an extratropical transition, {{completing}} the transition by <b>late</b> <b>on</b> August15 just south of Nova Scotia. However, the Canadian Hurricane Centre assessed Barbara as remaining tropical until after it turned northward and struck eastern Nova Scotia on August16. At this time, a trough developed to the southeast of the storm, and Barbara later tracked just west of Newfoundland. A new low formed {{in association with the}} trough, and as Barbara rapidly headed northward, the developing center moved more slowly. However, the new low quickly gained strength and became the more intense of the two storm systems. Barbara then stalled near Goose Bay and lost its tropical identity, dissipating <b>late</b> <b>on</b> August16.|$|E
5|$|As Zeke {{continued}} to be hampered by strong shear, it gradually began to turn towards the north as the trough that caused it to weaken moved further east. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> October27, convection redeveloped over the center of circulation, allowing the storm to re-attain tropical storm intensity. The strengthening followed {{the passage of a}} shortwave trough; however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its intensity, through intermittent bursts of convection, and began to turn towards the northeast. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> October29, a large burst of deep convection over the center of the storm allowed for intensification. Around this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) with a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg).|$|E

5|$|Early on August 3, {{strong wind}} shear over Chris {{detached}} the deep convection {{from the low}} level circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air. By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85miles (135km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again, though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters indicated the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60mph (95km/h) storm. However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant {{area of low pressure}} <b>late</b> <b>on</b> August 4. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions. Redevelopment never occurred, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} {{peak intensity}} for about 18hours. On November21, a cold front {{moving through the}} Mississippi Valley deflected the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast. The combination of cooler waters and wind shear from the front weakened Kate to an intensity of 100mph (160km/h) by the time the hurricane struck Crooked Island near Mexico Beach, Florida <b>late</b> <b>on</b> November21. After landfall, Kate continued to the northeast, crossing into Georgia and weakened into a tropical storm. Kate emerged from North Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean <b>late</b> <b>on</b> November22. Encountering even colder waters and continued shear, the storm weakened further while turning to the east-southeast. On November23, Kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the west of Bermuda, terminating at 1800UTC that day.|$|E
5|$|Just {{six hours}} after moving inland, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait with its {{circulation}} mostly intact; however, weakening continued as it approached eastern China. Remaining over water {{for less than}} 12hours, the typhoon made its second and ultimate landfall in Fujian Province <b>late</b> <b>on</b> October2. The storm quickly degraded over the following day, with winds decreasing below gale-force within 12hours. The former typhoon slowed and turned northward over western Fujian before dissipating <b>late</b> <b>on</b> October3.|$|E

5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>on</b> June 3, the IMD {{upgraded}} {{the storm}} to Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Gonu. With warm waters, low amounts of vertical wind shear, and favorable upper-level outflow, Gonu strengthened further to attain peak 1-min sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph) and gusts to 315km/h (195mph), about 285km (175mi) east-southeast of Masirah Island {{on the coast}} of Oman. The IMD upgraded it to Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu <b>late</b> <b>on</b> June 4, with peak 3-min sustained winds reaching 240km/h (150mph) and an estimated pressure of 920mbar. This made it the first super cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea on record.|$|E
5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>on</b> October23, {{dramatic}} weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with {{winds of}} 150mph (240km/h).

5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>on</b> September 12, while {{approaching}} the northern Lesser Antilles, convection increased and became better organized around {{an area of}} increased cyclonic turning. Environmental conditions became more favorable, allowing {{for the development of}} a low pressure area and for banding features to increase. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> September 13, with the formation of a broad low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven about 70mi (110km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, {{and the next day}} it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status {{for the first time in}} five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone <b>late</b> <b>on</b> December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2008 a {{weakening}} surface trough extended across northern Florida, producing thunderstorms across the state.

5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Kammuri, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Lagalag, killed {{hundreds}} {{of people in the}} wake of a deadly flood season in China. The system developed from a large monsoonal system that persisted toward the end of July 2002 near the Philippines. On August2, a tropical depression formed off the northwest coast of Luzon and moved west-northwestward. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> August3, it intensified into Tropical Storm Kammuri off the coast of Hong Kong. A weakening ridge turned the storm northward toward the coast of China. The storm made landfall with <b>late</b> <b>on</b> August4, after reaching peak winds of 100km/h (65mph). The system dissipated over the mountainous coastline of eastern China and merged with a cold front on August 7.|$|E
5|$|The 1943 Surprise {{hurricane}} was {{the first}} hurricane to be entered by a reconnaissance aircraft. The first tracked tropical cyclone of the 1943 Atlantic hurricane season, this system developed as a tropical storm while situated over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July25. The storm gradually strengthened while tracking westward and reached hurricane status <b>late</b> <b>on</b> July26. Thereafter, the hurricane curved slightly west-northwestward and continued intensifying. Early on July27, it became a Category2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale and peaked with winds of 105mph (165km/h). The system maintained this intensity until landfall on the Bolivar Peninsula in Texas <b>late</b> <b>on</b> July27. After moving inland, the storm initially weakened rapidly, but remained a tropical cyclone until dissipating over north-central Texas on July29.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} gradually tracked northwestward at 15mph (24km/h). Although {{the center}} of the depression was initially uncertain, it slowly strengthened and steadily organized. The depression attained tropical storm status <b>late</b> <b>on</b> August 20, upon which the storm was named Lester. The cyclone continued to the northwest, and passed directly over Socorro Island on August 21. By early the next day, an eastward moving trough weakened the ridge to its north, resulting in a to turn to the north. Around this time, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted the storm would not strengthen to hurricane intensity before making landfall. Despite this, Lester intensified into a hurricane <b>late</b> <b>on</b> August 22 while located about 240miles (385km) west of La Paz in Baja California Sur.|$|E
