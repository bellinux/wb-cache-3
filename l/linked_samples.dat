Diameter, thickness, weight and score were demonstrated to be reliable and relevant features in this drug intelligence perspective. Distributions of <b>linked</b> <b>samples</b> (i. e. coming from the same tabletting batch) and unlinked samples (i. e. coming from different tabletting batches) were very well discriminated by using the squared Euclidean or the Manhattan distance on standardised data. Our findings confirmed the hypothesis of the possibility to discriminate between MDMA samples issued form different tabletting batches. Furthermore, as no pattern was found between countries, the hypothesis that most of the MDMA samples found on the international market come from the same countries is supported...|$|E

40|$|One major {{objective}} of the European project "Collaborative Harmonisation of Methods for Profiling of Amphetamine Type Stimulants" (CHAMP) funded by the sixth framework programme of the European Commission consisted in the harmonisation of a Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) method {{for the analysis of}} organic impurities found in 3, 4 -MethyleneDioxyMethAmphetamine (MDMA) samples in a drug intelligence perspective. Statistical analysis provided a selection of pertinent variables among the 46 organic impurities identified in the chromatograms. Correlation coefficients were used to yield separation between populations of <b>linked</b> <b>samples</b> (from the same seizure) and unlinked samples (from different seizures). It was shown that correlation measurements based on Pearson and cosine functions applied to the data pre-treated by the square root provided an excellent discrimination between the two populations.

40|$|AbstractStatistical {{evaluation}} {{becomes increasingly}} important in forensic profiling {{as there is}} no single statistical method available to cater to all types of data. In this preliminary study, 20 heroin samples were used as <b>linked</b> <b>samples</b> and non-linked samples to evaluate a recently developed classification method called Chan’s tetrahedron model. Four commonly found impurity peaks were chosen for use to assess the Karweng dissimilarity index derived from this model. Throughout the study, the performance of three basic configurations and the associated dissimilarity indices obtained from the tetrahedron method were compared with that of the established statistical techniques. The obtained tetrahedrons illustrated comparable graphical outcomes with the score plot and dendrogram respectively obtained from principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Histograms were constructed and the Karweng dissimilarity index displayed significantly better levels of errors (fewer false results) than modified Pearson and cosine. In addition, the index also proved to be able to show excellent discriminating power and the best area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This study infers that this new classification method could be as useful as the conventional classification techniques. However further evaluation using larger datasets is recommended...|$|E

Current methods of diagnosis can be subjective, invasive and have long diagnostic windows. Raman spectroscopy provides a non-destructive, non-invasive, rapid and economical method for diagnosing diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the use of Raman and immersion Raman spectroscopy for diagnosing metastatic brain cancer and identifying primary sites of origin using brain tissue. Through spectral examination, the Raman peaks at 721 cm− 1 and 782 cm− 1 were identified as being the most distinct for discriminating between the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), metastatic and normal brain tissue spectra. A ratio score plot of these peaks calculated the classification sensitivities and specificities as 100 % and 94. 44 % for GBM, 96. 55 % and 100 % for metastatic brain, and 85. 71 % and 100 % for normal brain tissue. Principal Component-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PC-LDA) also showed discrimination between normal, GBM and metastatic brain tissue spectra.

40|$|A {{wealth of}} biospecimen samples {{are stored in}} modern {{globally}} distributed biobanks. Biomedical researchers worldwide {{need to be able}} to combine the available resources to improve the power of large-scale studies. A prerequisite for this effort is to be able to search and access phenotypic, clinical and other information about samples that are currently stored at biobanks in an integrated manner. However, privacy issues together with heterogeneous information systems and the lack of agreed-upon vocabularies have made specimen searching across multiple biobanks extremely challenging. We describe three case studies where we have <b>linked</b> <b>samples</b> and sample descriptions in order to facilitate global searching of available samples for research. The use cases include the ENGAGE (European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology) consortium comprising at least 39 cohorts, the SUMMIT (surrogate markers for micro- and macro-vascular hard endpoints for innovative diabetes tools) consortium and a pilot for data integration between a Swedish clinical health registry and a biobank. We used the Sample avAILability (SAIL) method for data linking: first, created harmonised variables and then annotated and made searchable information on the number of specimens available in individual biobanks for various phenotypic categories. By operating on this categorised availability data we sidestep many obstacles related to privacy that arise when handling real values and show that harmonised and annotated records about data availability across disparate biomedical archives provide a key methodological advance in pre-analysis exchange of information between biobanks, that is, during the project planning phase.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a hypervariable (HVR) region within the genome of hepatitis E virus (HEV) remains unexplained. Previous studies have described the HVR as a proline-rich spacer between flanking functional domains of the ORF 1 polyprotein. Others have proposed that the region has no function, that it reflects a hypermutable region of the virus genome, that it {{is derived from the}} insertion and evolution of host sequences or that it is subject to positive selection. This study attempts to differentiate between these explanations by documenting the evolutionary processes occurring within the HVR. We have measured the diversity of HVR sequences within acutely infected individuals or amongst sequences derived from epidemiologically <b>linked</b> <b>samples</b> and, surprisingly, find relative homogeneity amongst these datasets. We found no evidence of positive selection for amino acid substitution in the HVR. Through an analysis of published sequences, we conclude that the range of HVR diversity observed within virus genotypes {{can be explained by the}} accumulation of substitutions and, to a much lesser extent, through deletions or duplications of this region. All published HVR amino acid sequences display a relative overabundance of proline and serine residues that cannot be explained by a local bias towards cytosine in this part of the genome. Although all published HVRs contain one or more SH 3 -binding PxxP motifs, this motif does not occur more frequently than would be expected from the proportion of proline residues in these sequences. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the HVR has a structural role that is dependent upon length and amino acid composition, rather than a specific sequence...|$|E

40|$|Among the PAH {{class of}} compounds, high {{molecular}} weight PAH are now considered as relevant cancer inducers, {{but not all of}} them have the same biological activity. However, their analysis is difficult, mainly due to the presence of numerous isomers and due to their low volatility. Retention indices (Ri) for 13 dibenzopyrenes and homologues were determined by high-resolution capillary gas chromatography (GC) with four different stationary phases: a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane column (DB- 5 ms), a 35 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane column (BPX- 35), a 50 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane column (BPX- 50), and a 35 % trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane stationary phase (Rtx- 200). Correlations for retention on each phase were investigated by using 8 independent molecular descriptors. Ri {{has been shown to be}} linearly correlated to PAH volume, polarisability alpha, Hückel-pi energy on the four examined columns. Ionisation potential Ip is a fourth variable which improves the regression model for DB- 5 ms, BPX- 35, and BPX- 50 column. Correlation coefficients ranging from r 2 = 0. 935 to r 2 = 0. 952 are then observed. Application of these indices to the identification and quantification of PAH with MW 302 in certified diesel particulate matter SRM 1650 a is presented and discussed.

Roux, C. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2015 - 01 Forensic Science International 24655 - 64 <![CDATA[This study focuses on methylamphetamine (MA) seizures made by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to investigate the use of chemical profiling in an intelligence perspective. Correlation coefficients were used to obtain a similarity degree between a population of <b>linked</b> <b>samples</b> and a population of unlinked samples. Although it was demonstrated that a general framework can be followed for the use of any forensic case data in an intelligence-led perspective, threshold values have to be re-evaluated for each type of illicit drug investigated. Unlike the results obtained in a previous study on 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) seizures, chemical profiles of MA samples coming from the same seizure showed relative inhomogeneity, limiting their ability to link seizures. Different hypotheses were investigated to obtain a better understanding of this inhomogeneity although no trend was observed. These findings raise an interesting discussion in regards to the homogeneity and representativeness of illicit drug seizures (for intelligence purposes). Further, it also provides some grounds to discuss the initial hypotheses and assumptions that most forensic science studies are based on...|$|E
