500|$|Alexandra's letters {{reveal that}} Maria, the middle {{child of the}} family, {{sometimes}} felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved {{as much as the}} other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he <b>likes</b> <b>you</b> as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E
500|$|ABKCO Industries {{was formed}} in 1968 by Allen Klein as an {{umbrella}} company to ABKCO Records and recruited May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. After she had {{been working with the}} couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, [...] "He <b>likes</b> <b>you</b> a lot." [...] Pang, 22, astounded by Ono's proposition, eventually agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon moved to California, beginning an 18-month period he later called his [...] "lost weekend". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. Whilst drinking with Nilsson, after misunderstanding something Pang said, Lennon attempted to strangle her, relenting only when physically restrained by Nilsson.|$|E
500|$|In January 1991, {{following}} her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided {{to name the}} trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as [...] "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound", and also {{to allow her to}} continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's [...] "disastrous" [...] debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: [...] "we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize nobody <b>likes</b> <b>you!</b> We'll pay you, you can stop playing, we'll still pay you!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Video game {{developer}} Nathan Frost describes Portal as an [...] "exploration of {{a relationship}} with someone with narcissistic personality disorder". He adds {{that in order to}} fulfill her self-centered narcissistic desire to toy with someone, the player-character is trapped in the Enrichment Center, forced to do tricks for the computer. However, once the player-character becomes skilled enough to break the confines of the center, GLaDOS's secure amusement gives way to [...] "histrionic, bipolar deportment". He describes this as a parallel to how a real-life narcissist might attempt to secure the admiration of another person by empowering them in some ways, but limiting them in others. He adds that this works out well for the narcissist until the other person learns to think and act for themselves. He concludes by saying that a part of Portals resonance {{comes from the fact that}} using the portal gun to escape the center is a [...] "cogent metaphor for escaping an intimate relationship with someone diagnosably narcissistic". Grant Tavinor, author of The Art of Videogames, wrote that GLaDOS' actions and personality in Portal were [...] "in the best of science fiction traditions" [...] and describes her as [...] "insincere, malfunctioning, and probably insane". Wendy Despain, author of Writing for Video Games Genres: from FPS to RPG used Portal as an example of a [...] "modern classic" [...] video game and [...] "how they tell their stories". She called GLaDOS an [...] "endlessly cheerful and clearly insane computer" [...] and called her narrative [...] "simple". Emily Short, creator of a female artificial intelligence character in the video game Galatea, speculates that in GLaDOS's final remarks to Chell (“No one <b>likes</b> <b>you,</b> you know”), [...] "there is a hint that she’s talking about herself, not Chell; that she herself desires an emotional connection that she has never been able to achieve, because she also needs to survive, and all humans are a threat to her... learned that the humans view her as potentially threatening and essentially disposable, and so she has to see them the same way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2005, Bright {{received}} a call from Joe Galante, chairman of Sony BMG Nashville, when Galante was meeting with Clive Davis. They called Bright to see if he would be interested in producing that year’s American Idol winner, Carrie Underwood. Bright had seen Underwood on the show, but never dreamed that he would ever have an opportunity to be her producer. Galante said [...] "I want you to meet her — if she <b>likes</b> <b>you,</b> you'll make a record". [...] Bright flew to Kansas City with Galante to meet Underwood. Two weeks later, Bright and Underwood were in the studio making Some Hearts. [...] Bright was unaware that a battle had ensued because Clive Davis wanted another producer, but Galante wanted Bright. Underwood liked Bright, and they developed a good working relationship. She said of Bright, [...] "He'll say [...] 'try something different there' [...] but he doesn't tell me how to sing". [...] Bright was given one month to produce her first album from beginning to end. At the time, Underwood was on the road with the American Idol Tour, so Bright had to go to wherever she was, taking her microphone and special equipment to local studios in San Francisco and Seattle to finish her vocal tracks. Davis wanted to hedge his bet on Underwood by having her album include pop as well as county songs, but Underwood did not like the pop material. Davis insisted that production of the album be split to where Dann Huff produced the pop songs, and Bright did the country. [...] The final product, Some Hearts, released in 2005, won three Grammy Awards and Underwood won a Grammy for Best New Artist. The album became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history and as of 2016, had sold 8 million copies. He also produced Underwood’s NBC Sunday Night Football intro/theme songs. The first was [...] "Waiting all day for Sunday night" [...] which was replaced in 2016 using a new tune based on Underwood's country song [...] "Somethin' Bad", but with new lyrics and other changes to fit the show.|$|E
