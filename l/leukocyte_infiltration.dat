We tested if early and delayed IL 1 -β modulations by IL- 1 β antibody, gevokizumab, prevent left ventricular (LV) remodeling and endothelial dysfunction induced by LV ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in diabetic rats. MethodsGevokizumab (Gevo; 10 mg/kg) was administered 1 hour (early) or 7 days (delayed) following reperfusion, after a 20 min of transient ischemia induced by LV artery occlusion and continued every week for 90 days. Delayed perindopril (1 mg/kg) {{was used as a}} positive control. LV remodeling and function were assessed (Echocardiography) at 7 and 90 days. LV hemodynamics (Millar catheterization) and relaxation of isolated coronary arteries to acetylcholine (Mulvany wiregraph) were evaluated at 90 days. Collagen density and <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> were evaluated (Histology) at 90 days. ResultsAt 7 days, early Gevo limited the early LV expansion and reduction of FS induced by I/R. At 90 days both of early and delayed Gevo as well as perindopril limited in a similar manner, the LV late dilatation, the reduction of FS and LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction induced by I/R. At 90 days, GK coronary endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired by I/R (59 ± 13 vs. 17 ± 4 %, p< 0. 05). Early, delayed Gevo and perindopril restored the (86 ± 4, 92 ± 2 and 98 ± 1 % respectively; p< 0. 05 vs GK+I/R) coronary relaxation to acetylcholine. Early, delayed Gevo and perindopril significantly reduced collagen density and <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> at 90 days.

The prevalence of portal fibrosis, mild bile duct hyperplasia, and vascular <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltrations</b> was significantly higher in the exposed group (all Chi-square: p< 0. 05). In case of granulomas, the frequency was significantly highest in the bitches (P generation) while the prevalence of portal fibrosis was highest in the F generation (pups) (both Chi-square: p< 0. 05). No significant difference between exposed and controls was found for bile acid, ALAT, and ALKP, while ASAT and LDH were significantly highest {{in the control group}} (both ANOVA: p< 0. 05). We therefore suggest that a daily intake of 50 - 200 g environmentally organohalogen polluted minke whale blubber can cause liver lesions in Greenland sledge dogs.

To date, {{the understanding of}} the causes of interstitial cystitis remains largely fragmentary and there is no effective treatment available. Recent experimental results have shown a functional role of the endocannabinoid system in urinary bladder. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of selective cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 receptor agonists in a mouse model of interstitial cystitis. Bladder inflammation was induced in mice by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and whole bladders were removed 24 h later. LPS induced a significant increase of the contractile amplitude in spontaneous activity and a hypersensitivity to exogenous acetylcholine-induced contraction of whole-isolated bladder. Next, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of cannabinoidergic compounds by pretreating mice with CB 1 or CB 2 selective agonist compounds, respectively ACEA and JWH 015. Interestingly, JWH 015, but not ACEA, antagonized LPS-induced bladder inflammation. Additionally, anti-inflammatory activity was studied by evaluation, <b>leukocytes</b> mucosa <b>infiltration,</b> myeloperoxidase activity, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. JWH 015 significantly decreased <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> in both submucosa and mucosa, as well as the myeloperoxydase activity, in LPS treated mice. JWH 015 reduced mRNA expression of IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, and TNF-α. LPS treatment increased expression of bladder CB 2 but not CB 1 mRNA. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that modulation of the cannabinoid CB 2 receptors might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bladder diseases and conditions characterized by inflammation, such as interstitial cystitis. 67 - 74 Pubblicat...|$|R

The results were conclusive: a very high degree of infiltration was observed in groups 2 and 3. Compared with these, group 1 showed a very poor <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration.</b> Thus, the effect of GEM-SP against <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> was very strong, suggesting a decrease of the blood brain barrier permeability.

40|$|In both {{rats and}} mice, an acute {{skeletal}} muscle injury leads to <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> {{in which the}} leukocytes remove dead fibers and cellular debris, induce a secondary injury, and/or promote myofiber regeneration. Short-term exogenous estrogen treatment attenuates this <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> and prevents body weight gain in rat exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury models. But these estrogen effects may not occur in mice because body weight gain does not consistently occur in ovariectomized mice treated with estrogen. Additionally, progesterone may also attenuate this <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> without affecting body weight [13]. The aim {{of the current study}} was to compare body weight and <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> in exercise-injured skeletal muscle of ovariectomized mice treated with exogenous estrogen and progesterone for the short period of 17 days with that of ovariectomized-placebo-treated mice and gonadal-intact male and female mice. There {{was no significant difference in}} body weight between the ovariectomized-estrogen-treated and the ovariectomized-placebo-treated mice. The amount of intramuscular <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> of ovariectomized mice treated with estrogen or progesterone was not significantly different from that of ovariectomized-placebo-treated mice. However, in the injured muscle, the mean area of the leukocyte antigen, 7 / 4, of the ovariectomized-estrogen-treated group was 2 – 3 -fold greater than that of the ovariectomized-placebo-treated, ovariectomized-estrogen-progesterone-treated, and intact male groups (p 3 ̆c. 05), suggesting that the 7 / 4 -positive leukocytes of the ovariectomized-estrogen-treated group were larger or had more antigen. In conclusion, ovariectomized mice demonstrate a different body weight and leukocyte response to short-term estrogen treatment than that of ovariectomized rats, and short-term estrogen treatment modulates leukocyte phenotype. These data broaden our understanding of estrogen’s effects on body weight and <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration,</b> and may aid in increasing our understanding of how males and females differ in response to acute muscle injury...|$|E

40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) is characterised by {{repetitive}} episodes of upper airway occlusion during sleep. OSA {{has been shown}} to be associated with a variable degree of nasal inflammation, uvula mucosal congestion and airway hyperreactivity. The upper airway inflammation, whose clinical importance is uncertain, is characterised by <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> and interstitial oedema. In addition, recent data has shown the presence of neutrophilic inflammation in the lower airways. The current opinion is that airway inflammation is caused by the local, repeated mechanical trauma related to the intermittent airway occlusion typical of the disease. Another potential mechanism involves the intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia that through the phenomenon of the ischemia-reperfusion injury may induce the production of oxygen free radicals and therefore cause local and systemic inflammation. Finally, a state of low-grade systemic inflammation may be related to obesity per se with the pro-inflammatory mediators synthesised in the visceral adipose cells. Several authors stress the role of circulating and local inflammatory mediators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, exhaled nitric oxide, pentane and 8 -isoprostane as the determinants of inflammation in OSA...|$|R

Expression of tubulointerstitial Leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD 3, CD 68, interleukin (IL) - 1 β, and IL- 10 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. These parameters were correlated with progression of IgAN. The significance of these correlations was tested by a multivariate analysis. Glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial inflammation, and hyaline arteriolosclerosis correlated with progression in all patients and also in patients with initially normal serum creatinine. Tubulointerstitial LCA, CD 3, CD 68, and IL- 1 β expression correlated with progression. CD 3 had the strongest correlation. In the multivariate analysis, tubulointerstitial CD 3, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated serum creatinine concentration, and interstitial fibrosis were independently associated with progressive disease in all patients, and tubulointerstitial CD 3 expression and hyaline arteriolosclerosis in patients with initially normal serum creatinine. We found parameters reflecting tubulointerstitial inflammation to predict deterioration of renal function in IgAN.

At 24 hours post-exercise, soleus and white vastus muscles were removed and immunostained for HIS 48 (neutrophil) and EDI (macrophage) positive cells. The increase in number of fibres positive for HIS 48 in soleus and positive for EDI in the soleus and white vastus was significantly attenuated (p 0. 05) to those without ER antagonist. This suggests that the ability of estrogen to attenuate post-exercise <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> into skeletal muscle is not ER-mediated. In experiment two, we examined the interaction effects of estrogen and progesterone on skeletal muscle in response to injury in ovariectomized female rats. At 24 hours post-exercise, soleus and white vastus muscles were removed and immunostained for HIS 48 (neutrophil) and EDI (macrophage) positive cells. <b>Leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> 24 hours post-exercise in the soleus (red) and white vastus muscles were significantly decreased in ovariectomized rats treated with progesterone alone relative to unsupplemented ovariectomized rats. Following exercise the percentage of <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> also decreased significantly with estrogen supplementation alone in both muscle types, 67 - 69 % and 63 - 74 % in neutrophils and macrophages, respectfully. Furthermore, the combination of estrogen and progesterone supplementation did not significantly alter the attenuation observed by estrogen alone. These results demonstrate that skeletal muscle in female rats benefited from both progesterone or estrogen treatment alone; effects of progesterone with estrogen following exercise were neither greater nor less than with estrogen alone...|$|E

Selective inhibition of COX- 2 has been suggested to produce anti-inflammatory effects with reduced toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. We examined the extent to which suppression of COX- 2 led to inhibition of various components of inflammation in the carrageenan-airpouch model in the rat. Indomethacin (⩾ 0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), nimesulide (⩾ 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and the selective COX- 2 inhibitor, SC- 58125 (⩾ 0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), significantly suppressed the production of prostaglandin[*]E 2 at the site of inflammation. At higher doses, indomethacin (⩾ 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and nimesulide (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), but not SC- 58125 (up to 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), significantly inhibited COX- 1 activity (as measured by whole blood thromboxane synthesis). All three test drugs significantly reduced the volume of exudate in the airpouch, but only at doses greater than those required for substantial (> 90 %) suppression of COX- 2 activity. Similarly, reduction of <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> was only observed with the doses of indomethacin and nimesulide that caused significant suppression of COX- 1 activity. SC- 58125 did not significantly affect <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> into the airpouch at any dose tested (up to 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). A second selective COX- 2 inhibitor, Dup- 697, was also found to suppress exudate PGE 2 levels without significant effects on <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration.</b> These results indicate that selective inhibition of COX- 2 results in profound suppression of PGE 2 synthesis in the carrageenan-airpouch, but does not affect <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration.</b> Exudate volume was only reduced with the highly selective COX- 2 inhibitor when a dose far above that necessary for suppression of COX- 2 activity was used.

The macroscopic lesions of the vulvovaginal mucosa were classified in scores of “ 1 ” mild, until “ 4 ”, severe inflammation and pustular or necrotic lesions. The histopathological evaluation was performed using scores of “ 1 ” to “ 4 ”, according to the inflammatory alterations. The fragments with severe microscopic lesions (3 and 4) were from the uterine tubes and uterus, which showed <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> and destruction and/or necrosis of epithelium. Alterations in the lower reproductive tract fragments were mild, but characteristics of acute inflammatory processes. The histopathological findings of the reproductive tract of females naturally infected with Ureaplasma diversum are consistent with injuries that compromise the environment from the local where spermatozoa acquires ability to fertilize an oocyte until those where the oocyte is fertilized.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the CO-releasing molecule-liberated CO attenuates <b>infiltration</b> of <b>leukocytes</b> in the renal tissue of thermally injured mice. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight mice were assigned to four groups. Mice in sham group (n= 7) were underwent sham thermal injury, whereas mice in burn group (n= 7) received 15 % {{total body surface area}} (TBSA) full-thickness thermal injury. Mice in burn+CORM- 2 group (n= 7) underwent thermal injury followed by immediate administration of CORM- 2 (8 mg/kg, i. v.), whereas mice in burn+iCORM- 2 group (n= 7) underwent thermal injury followed by administration of iCORM- 2 (an inactive compound used as negative control). Histological alterations and granulocytes infiltration in kidney were assessed alongised PMN accumulation, activation of NF-ĸΒ, expressions of ICAM- 1 and HO- 1 expression in renal tissues. Results: Treatment of thermally injured mice with CORM- 2 significantly attenuated PMN accumulation and prevented activation of NF-ĸΒ in the kidney. This was accompanied by a decrease of the expression of ICAM- 1 and an increase in HO- 1 expression. In parallel, burn-induced granulocytes infiltration in renal tissue was markedly decreased by treatment with CORM- 2.

Increased gene expression of multiple cytokines, including IL- 6, has also been implicated in laminitis development. Using real time PCR, immunohistochemistry and zymography methods, we characterize <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> and IL- 6 gene expression in oligofructose (OF) induced laminitis. As well, we use two in vitro models to investigate a role for IL- 6 in protease regulation. Laminitis was induced in normal standardbred horses (n= 5) by alimentary OF dosing and lamellar biopsies were obtained throughout the 48. h experimental period. Lamellar explants and keratinocytes were also isolated from clinically normal horses for in vitro experiments. We found infiltration of calprotectin-positive leukocytes (monocytes and neutrophils) at 18 - 24. h post oligofructose dosing, while IL- 6 gene expression was increased as early as 12. h post dosing. Additionally, while we found that IL- 6 did not cause significant BM damage in vitro, it did result in increased secreted proMMP- 9 levels from lamellar explants. Thus, we find that <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> does occur during oligofructose-induced laminitis development, however, IL- 6 gene expression in the lamellae may precede <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration.</b> Additionally, we show IL- 6 {{plays a role in}} increasing the level of proMMP- 9 in vivo in a manner that does not involve keratinocytes...|$|E

This barrier is crucial for immune surveillance in health and is an underestimated gate for entry of immune cells during numerous inflammatory disorders. Several of these disorders are accompanied by disturbance of the BCSFB and increased <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration,</b> which affects neuroinflammation. Understanding the mechanism of immune cell entry at the CP might lead to identification of new therapeutic targets. Here, we focus on current knowledge of <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> at the CP in inflammatory conditions and its therapeutic implications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis and progression of myositis, and is highly associated with disease severity. Currently, there is a lack of: efficacious therapies for myositis; understanding of the molecular features important for disease pathogenesis; and potential molecular biomarkers for characterizing inflammatory myopathies to aid in clinical development. Methods In this study, we developed a simple model and predicted that 1) leukocyte-specific transcripts (including both protein-coding transcripts and microRNAs) should be coherently overexpressed in myositis muscle and 2) the level of over-expression of these transcripts should be correlated with <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration.</b> We applied this model to assess immune cell infiltration in myositis by examining mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in muscle biopsies from 31 myositis patients and 5 normal controls. Results Several gene signatures, including a leukocyte index, type 1 interferon (IFN), MHC class I, and immunoglobulin signature, were developed to characterize myositis patients at the molecular level. The leukocyte index, consisting of genes predominantly associated with immune function, displayed strong concordance with pathological assessment of immune cell infiltration. This leukocyte index was subsequently utilized to differentiate transcriptional changes due to <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> from other alterations in myositis muscle. Results from this differentiation revealed biologically relevant differences in the relationship between the type 1 IFN pathway, miR- 146 a, and <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> within various myositis subtypes. Conclusions Results indicate that a likely interaction between miR- 146 a expression and the type 1 IFN pathway is confounded by the level of <b>leukocyte</b> <b>infiltration</b> into muscle tissue. Although the role of miR- 146 a in myositis remains uncertain, our results highlight the potential benefit of deconvoluting the source of transcriptional changes in myositis muscle or other heterogeneous tissue samples. Taken together, the leukocyte index and other gene signatures developed in this study may be potential molecular biomarkers to help to further characterize inflammatory myopathies and aid in clinical development. These hypotheses need to be confirmed in separate and sufficiently powered clinical trials. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective : To {{determine}} whether the CO-releasing molecule -liberated CO attenuates <b>infiltration</b> of <b>leukocytes</b> in the renal tissue of thermally injured mice. Materials and methods : Twenty-eight mice were assigned to four groups. Mice in sham group (n = 7) were underwent sham thermal injury, whereas mice in burn group (n = 7) received 15 % {{total body surface area}} (TBSA) full-thickness thermal injury. Mice in burn+CORM- 2 group (n = 7) underwent thermal injury followed by immediate administration of CORM- 2 (8 mg/kg, i. v.), whereas mice in burn+iCORM- 2 group (n = 7) underwent thermal injury followed by administration of iCORM- 2 (an inactive compound used as negative control). Histological alterations and granulocytes infiltration in kidney were assessed alongised PMN accumulation, activation of NF-&# 312;&# 914;, expressions of ICAM- 1 and HO- 1 expression in renal tissues. Results : Treatment of thermally injured mice with CORM- 2 significantly attenuated PMN accumulation and prevented activation of NF-&# 312;&# 914; in the kidney. This was accompanied by a decrease of the expression of ICAM- 1 and an increase in HO- 1 expression. In parallel, burn-induced granulocytes infiltration in renal tissue was markedly decreased by treatment with CORM- 2. Conclusions : CO delivered by CORM- 2 attenuates <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> in the kidney of burned mice by interfering with NF-&# 312;&# 914; activation, protein expression of ICAM- 1 and therefore suppressing endothelial cells pro-adhesive phenotype. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-established}} {{that there}} is a crosstalk between the lung and the kidney, and several studies have reported association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and pulmonary pathophysiological changes. Experimentally, CKD can be caused in mice by dietary intake of adenine. Nevertheless, the consequence of such intervention on the lung received only scant attention. Here, we assessed the pulmonary effects of adenine (0. 2 % w/w in feed for 4 weeks) -induced CKD in mice by assessing various physiological histological and biochemical endpoints. Adenine treatment induced a significant increase in urine output, urea and creatinine concentrations, and it decreased the body weight and creatinine clearance. It also increased proteinuria and the urinary levels of kidney injury molecule- 1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. Compared with control group, the histopathological evaluation of lungs from adenine-treated mice showed polymorphonuclear <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> in alveolar and bronchial walls, injury, and fibrosis. Moreover, adenine caused a significant increase in lung lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species and decreased the antioxidant catalase. Adenine also induced DNA damage assessed by COMET assay. Similarly, adenine caused apoptosis in the lung characterized by a significant increase of cleaved caspase- 3. Moreover, adenine induced {{a significant increase in the}} expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2 –related factor 2 (Nrf 2) in the lung. We conclude that administration of adenine in mice induced CKD is accompanied by lung oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, and Nrf 2 expression and fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{inflammatory}} response plays {{a critical role}} in hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. We aimed to study how interaction among inflammatory cells causes {{inflammatory response}}s in the process of hypertensive cardiac fibrosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II, 1500 ng/kg/min) in mice rapidly induced the expression of interferon c (IFN-c) and <b>leukocytes</b> <b>infiltration</b> into the heart. To determine the role of IFN-c on cardiac inflammation and remodeling, both wild-type (WT) and IFN-c-knockout (KO) mice were infused Ang II for 7 days, and were found an equal blood pressure increase. However, knockout of IFN-c prevented Ang II-induced: 1) infiltration of macrophages and T cells into cardiac tissue; 2) expression of tumor necrosis factor a and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1), and 3) cardiac fibrosis, including the expression of a-smooth muscle actin and collagen I (all p, 0. 05). Cultured T cells or macrophages alone expressed very low level of IFN-c, however, co-culture of T cells and macrophages increased IFN-c expression by 19. 860. 95 folds (vs. WT macrophage, p, 0. 001) and 20. 9 6 2. 09 folds (vs. WT T cells, p, 0. 001). In vitro co-culture studies using T cells and macrophages from WT or IFN-c KO mice demonstrated that T cells were primary source for IFN-c production. Co-culture of WT macrophages with WT T cells, but not with IFN-c-knockout T cells, increased IFN-c production (p, 0. 01). Moreover, IFN-c produced by T cells amplified MCP- 1 expression in macrophages and stimulated macrophag...|$|R
