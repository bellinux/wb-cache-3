However, future database systems will be dominated by many-core processors, large main memory, and low-latency semiconductor mass storage. In the increasingly common case that the working data set fits in memory or low-latency storage, new bottlenecks emerge: locking, latching, logging, and critical sections in the buffer manager. Prior work has addressed two of these – latching and logging. This paper addresses locking and proposes new mechanisms optimized for modern hardware.

The natural predictive nature of the ADPLL to estimate next edge occurrence of the reference clock is exploited here to reduce the timing range and thus complexity of the fractional part of the phase detection mechanism as implemented by a time-to-digital converter (TDC) and to ease the clock retiming circuit. In addition, the integer part, which counts the DCO clock edges, can be disabled to save power once the loop has achieved lock. It can be widely used in fields of fractional-N frequency multiplication and frequency/phase modulation.

In our method, we describe a specification {{of a system}} {{by a set of}} coloured Petri-nets and synchronization among them. Each coloured Petri-net is either the specification of a participant's behavior or the constraint about the temporal ordering of multiple participants' behavior. For this specification, if given constraints are inconsistent with each other, the total system enters a deadlock state. In general, the reachability analysis for such systems may cause the state explosion problem {{depending on the size of}} the system. However, there are a lot of cases that multiple participants carry out the same behavior in distributed cooperative systems such as network meeting. In such symmetric specifications, by merging equivalent states in a given specification, we can reduce the cost necessary for the reachability analysis.

In order to monitor the rotational state of a wheel, the EBS currently uses a passive Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) which is a variable reluctance electromagnetic transducer. In the existing EBS setup, one WSS is used per wheel, {{each of which is}} connected to the EBS system using extensive cabling. This project presents the first successful attempt at converting the WSS into an energy harvesting wireless wheel speed sensor or in other words an Autonomous Wheel Speed Sensor (AWSS), which provides information about the rotational state of the wheel to the EBS system over a wireless link. Unlike most wireless sensors which use batteries, the AWSS employs energy harvesting to power itself by simultaneously using the WSS electromagnetic transducer as an energy harvester as well as a sensor. By thus making an autonomous WSS, the amount of cables in the existing WSS assembly can be reduced, leading to savings in material, assembly and maintenance costs.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{value of}} GPS for {{position}} determination, {{and the need}} for its availability in challenging signal-to-noise (SNR) environments cannot be overstated. GPS is being used not only for military applications but also for civil aviation, mining, surveying, and search and rescue missions. In this work, we focus on Inertial Navigation System (INS) -aided GPS, and The Aerospace Corporation's (Aerospace) - patented approach for GPS-INS coupling mechanization referred to in this report as Ultra Tight Processing (UTP). There has been a proliferation of GPS-INS mechanizations in the industry based on Aerospace's UTP approach.; In this work, we use lessons from Classical GPS-processing that use tracking loops from communications systems, and apply those to the UTP approach. In particular, the concept of lock detectors used in classical GPS receivers is applied to UTP. This method is called "Observation Lock Detectors" (OLD).; A MATLAB model of UTP has been developed including models of OLD. MATLAB simulations of OLD using Carrier and Code lock detectors have demonstrated that Code and Carrier OLD work. In the simulations, we track true carrier phase information and the predicted carrier phase error in challenging SNR situations. The carrier OLD indicate when RF interference makes carrier phase error unacceptable. The simulation results are compared to the truth that in practice a receiver would not know. The work attempts to answer such questions as what is the benefit from using both code and carrier information? At what point do we turn off carrier information? Observation Lock Detectors provide answers to such questions. It appears that one can continue to use carrier information even after the onset of interference for some time before discarding it.; Since observation lock extends traditional <b>lock</b> <b>detection</b> concept to UTP, it can be used for comparing UTP-based receiver performance to the performance of traditional GPS receiver systems. As such it serves as a useful performance metric for UTP systems. [...] The report ends with a discussion of other challenging problems to be solved in this area.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{scattering}} in accelerating reference frames inspires {{a variety}} of phenomena, requiring employment of general relativity for their description. While the quasi-stationary field analysis {{could be applied to}} slowly-accelerating bodies as a first-order approximation, the scattering problem remains fundamentally nonlinear in boundary conditions, giving rise to multiple frequency generation (micro-Doppler shifts). Here a frequency comb, generated by an axially rotating subwavelength (cm-range) wire and split ring resonator (SRR), is analyzed theoretically and observed experimentally by illuminating the system with a 2 GHz carrier wave. Highly accurate <b>lock</b> in <b>detection</b> scheme enables factorization of the carrier and observation of more than ten peaks in a comb. The Hallen integral equation is employed for deriving the currents induced on the scatterer at rest and a set of coordinate transformations, connecting laboratory and rotating frames, is applied in order to predict the spectral positions and amplitudes of the frequency comb peaks.

It is a vast field of research with numerous applications and considerable practical impact. Applications include strictness analysis, data representation analysis, binding-time analysis, soft typing (also called dynamic typing inference), boxing analysis, pointer aliasing, value flow analysis (and all its applications), region-based memory management, communication topology analysis, Year 2000 type analysis, cryptographic protocol verification, <b>locking,</b> race <b>detection,</b> and others; see Palsberg (2001) for an overview of additional applications.

Classical type systems express properties of values, not the computations leading to those values. Effect types describe all important effects of computation, not just their results. Region-based memory management refers to programming where heap data is allocated in individually managed regions that are explicitly allocated and deallocated.

40|$|Phasic neurons {{typically}} fire {{only for}} a fast-rising input, say {{at the onset of}} a step current, but not for steady or slow inputs, a property associated with type III excitability. Phasic neurons can show extraordinary temporal precision for phase <b>locking</b> and coincidence <b>detection.</b> Exemplars are found in the auditory brain stem where precise timing is used in sound localization. Phasicness at the cellular level arises from a dynamic, voltage-gated, negative feedback that can be recruited subthreshold, preventing the neuron from reaching spike threshold if the voltage does not rise fast enough. We consider two mechanisms for phasicness: a low threshold potassium current (subtractive mechanism) and a sodium current with subthreshold inactivation (divisive mechanism). We develop and analyze three reduced models with either divisive or subtractive mechanisms or both to gain insight into the dynamical mechanisms for the potentially high temporal precision of type III-excitable neurons. We compare their firing properties and performance for a range of stimuli. The models have characteristic non-monotonic input-output relations, firing rate vs. input intensity, for either stochastic current injection or Poisson-timed excitatory synaptic conductance trains. We assess performance according to precision of phase-locking and coincidence detection by the models' responses to repetitive packets of unitary excitatory synaptic inputs with more or less temporal coherence. We find that each mechanism contributes features but best performance is attained if both are present. The subtractive mechanism confers extraordinary precision for phase <b>locking</b> and coincidence <b>detection</b> but only within a restricted parameter range when the divisive mechanism of sodium inactivation is inoperative. The divisive mechanism guarantees robustness of phasic properties, without compromising excitability, although with somewhat less precision. Finally, we demonstrate that brief transient inhibition if properly timed can enhance the reliability of firing. Postprint (published version...|$|R
