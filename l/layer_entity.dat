40|$|We {{propose a}} simple and {{effective}} tool {{for the expression of}} tasks such as cross-layer optimization strategies or sensors-related applications. The approach is based on what we refer to as "reflective and refractive variables". Both types of variables are associated with external entities, e. g. sensors or actuators. A reflective variable is a volatile variable, that is, a variable that might be concurrently modified by multiple threads. A library of threads is made available, each of which interfaces a set of sensors and continuously update the value of a corresponding set of sensors. One such thread is "cpu", which exports the current level of usage of the local CPU as an integer between 0 and 100. This integer is reflected into the integer reflective variable cpu. A refractive variable is a reflective variable that can be modified. Each modification is caught and interpreted as a request to change the value of an actuator. For instance, setting variable "tcp_sendrate" would request a cross-layer adjustment to the thread interfacing the local TCP <b>layer</b> <b>entity.</b> This allows express in an easy way complex operations in the application layer of any programming language, e. g. plain old C. We describe our translator and the work we are carrying out within PATS to build simple and powerful libraries of scripts based on reflective and refractive variables, including robotics applications and RFID tags processing.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} the architectural layering of middleware constrains {{the design of}} a middleware security architecture, and analyses the complications that arise from that. First, we define a precise notion of middleware that includes its architecture and features. Our definition is based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), which is used throughout this dissertation both as a reference technology and as a basis for a proof of concept implementation. In several steps, we construct a security model that fits to the described middleware architecture. The model facilitates conceptual reasoning about security. The results of our analysis indicate that the cryptographic identities available on the lower layers of the security model are only of limited use for expressing fine-grained security policies, because they are separated from the application <b>layer</b> <b>entities</b> by the middleware layer. To express individual application <b>layer</b> <b>entities</b> in access policies, additional more fine-grained descriptors are required. To solve this problem for the target side (i. e., the receiving side of an invocation), we propose an improved middleware security model that supports individual access policies on a per-target basis. The model is based on so-called "resource descriptors", which are used in addition to cryptographic identities to describe application <b>layer</b> <b>entities</b> in access policies. To be useful, descriptors need to fulfil a number of properties, such as local uniqueness and persistency. Next, we examine the information available at the middleware layer for its usefulness as resource descriptors, in particular the interface name and the instance information inside the object reference. Unfortunately neither fulfils all required properties. However, it [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Network {{transmission}} bandwidth of 100 megabits {{per second}} is now available for LANs and bandwidth over gigabits per second will soon be available for WANs. A growing number of communication applications demand the support of high speed bulk data transfers. Unfortunately, effective user level data throughput has been far below the network bandwidth due to the bottleneck effect of packet software processing. 	This thesis presents {{a new approach to}} reducing packet processing overhead, in particular, reducing the number of invocations of host system support and protocol processing routines. The packet train model, based on observed network traffic burstiness, provides a framework in which a large block of data can be transferred as a large packet without incurring various problems, and a proper selection of transport layer functions can be offloaded to the network front-end without overloading the front-end processor. 	A packet train is a special form of large data delivery over a network. On a transmission medium, a train is a sequence of consecutive packets, spaced within a maximum allowed inter-packet gap and loaded with data for the same transport <b>layer</b> <b>entity.</b> The size of a train is dynamically determined by the amount of data packetized for transmission and by interruptions of urgent data transmitted onto the medium. At data sending and receiving hosts above the medium level, a packet train is handled as one transfer unit for its protocol processing. 	The thesis presents measurement results which provide motivations for the packet train approach. It describes in detail designs for the major packet train mechanism components, both hardware and software. Results of a simulation evaluation of the packet train scheme vs. the traditional non-train scheme indicate that the packet train is a viable approach to improving bulk data transfer throughput under a wide range of system parameters and traffic load conditions. Finally, the thesis discusses extensions needed for the packet train approach to benefit data transfer performance in a WAN environment...|$|E

Depending on the mechanisms, several types of the geographical destinations (GeoDestination) can be specified with geographical coordination and descriptions of a shape, such as a circle area with a particular radius of a geographical position. These geographical routing mechanisms are mapped to the IPv 6 unicast, multicast, and anycast so that upper <b>layer</b> <b>entities</b> can transparently use these mechanisms without direct interaction between the C 2 CNet layer.

Falsely, TCP's congestion avoidance mechanisms are triggered by packets that are destroyed due to the high bit error probability of wireless channels or loss due to disruptions caused by handoffs.

It subdivides the end-to-end transport connection into two connections, one operating over the wired subpath, the other over the wireless subpath.

RESULTS: We have designed a relational genomic warehouse with an original multi-layer architecture made of a databases <b>layer</b> and an <b>entities</b> <b>layer.</b> We describe a new querying module, GenoQuery, which is based on this architecture. We use the <b>entities</b> <b>layer</b> to define mixed queries. These mixed queries allow searching for instances of biological entities and their properties in the different databases, without specifying in which database they should be found. Accordingly, we further introduce the central notion of alternative queries. Such queries have the same meaning as the original mixed queries, while exploiting complementarities yielded by the various integrated databases of the warehouse. We explain how GenoQuery computes all the alternative queries of a given mixed query. We illustrate how useful this querying module is by means of a thorough example. AVAILABILITY: [URL]...|$|R
