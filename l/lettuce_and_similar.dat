40|$|The {{efficacy}} of organic soil amendments against S. sclerotiorum, {{the cause of}} soft rot of <b>lettuce,</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> diseases {{of a range of}} other crops, was evaluated in the glasshouse and in the field. Stem rot of tomato, also caused by S. sclerotiorum, was also studied under field conditions. Lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure greatly suppressed disease incidence caused by S. sclerotiorum in lettuce and tomato crops. These amendments significantly reduced sclerotium numbers remaining in the soil after crop harvest. This was observed in the field and in glasshouse experiments. Incorporation of organic amendments, in particular lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure, significantly increased the number and fresh weight of marketable lettuce heads and the number and fresh weight of marketable tomato fruit. There was 100 % germination when sclerotia were added to soil extract and distilled water. Aqueous leachates from lucerne hay, stable manure and cow manure, however, substantially reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotium viability was reduced when tomato stems infested with S. sclerotiorum were buried in a compost heap (internal temperature 50 - 600 C) and composted for seven weeks. There was a 100 % kill of sclerotia isolated from infested material and buried in the compost heap, 98 % kill of sclerotia incubated in an oven at 40 C compared to 10 % reduction in viability of those isolated from non-composted infected tomato stems. Organic amendments generally reduced the number of sclerotia in the soil over the experimental period. Disease incidence reflected levels of sclerotia in soil. The presence of organic substrate combined with high moisture levels, high relative humidity, and mild temperature suppressed Sclerotinia diseases, delayed onset of disease in some seasons and decreased the rate of disease development in lettuce and tomatoes.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France received an application {{from the company}} Syngenta Agro SAS to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance azoxystrobin in <b>lettuce,</b> spinach, celery <b>and</b> cardoon. In order to accommodate for the intended use of azoxystrobin, France proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 15 mg/kg for spinach <b>and</b> <b>similar,</b> <b>lettuces</b> <b>and</b> other salad plants, celery and cardoon. Germany received an application from the plant protection service Landesamt für Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau des Landes Sachesen-Anhalt to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance azoxystrobin in spices. In order to accommodate for the intended use Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 3 mg/kg for spices/seeds and spices/fruits and berries. Belgium compiled an application to modify the existing MRL for the azoxystrobin in rhubarb. In order to accommodate for the intended use Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 5 mg/kg. France, Germany and Belgium drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for <b>lettuce,</b> spinach <b>and</b> <b>similar,</b> cardoon, celery, rhubarb and spices. For other crops belonging {{to the group of}} <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> other salad plants the data were not sufficient to propose a MRL. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of azoxystrobin on the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of azoxystrobin on lettuce, spinach, celery, cardoon, spices and rhubarb will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R

In order to accommodate for the intended uses of indoxacarb, Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 1 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for the proposed uses on rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> (leaves).

The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design, with four replications, treatments being arranged in a 4 x 4 + 2 factorial design.

40|$|Background: Human food borne infections {{traditionally}} are {{acquired through}} the ingestion of foods of animal origin. Fresh {{fruits and vegetables}} are major vehicles for the transmission of the food-borne infections. In Ethiopia, there is a tradition of consuming raw vegetables, particularly <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> green pepper, without adequate treatment. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the microbial load of fresh <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> green pepper, used as salad vegetables, and to assess the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella and Shigella spp. isolated from <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> green pepper. Methods: A total of eighty samples of <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> green peppers were purchased from different outlets in Addis Ababa and analyzed for their load of various microbial groups and flora analysis was conducted following standard microbiological methods. The presence of Salmonella and Shigella and their antibiotic resistance was also determined. Results: Over 90 % of the vegetable samples had aerobic mesophilic counts of ≥ log 6 cfu/g. Ninety seven percent of the <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> 58 % of the green pepper samples had enterobacteraceae counts of ≥ log 5 cfu/g. Coliforms were encountered at counts ≥ log 4 cfu/g in 48 % and 35 % of <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> green pepper samples, respectively. Over 80 % of vegetable samples harbored staphylococci with counts ranging from log 4 to log 6 cfu/g. More than 88 % of lettuc...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} is endemic in Asia and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) {{is a major}} public health issue worldwide. Current treatment strategies for CHB are not satisfactory as they induce a low rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss. Extracts were prepared from lettuce hydroponically cultivated in solutions containing glycine or nitrate as nitrogen sources. The lettuce extracts exerted potent anti-HBV effects in HepG 2 cell lines in vitro, including significant HBsAg inhibition, HBV replication and transcription inhibition, without exerting cytotoxic effects. When used in combination interferon-alpha 2 b (IFNα- 2 b) or lamivudine (3 TC), the lettuce extracts synergistically inhibited HBsAg expression and HBV replication. By using differential metabolomics analysis, Luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside was identified and confirmed as a functional component of the <b>lettuce</b> extracts <b>and</b> exhibited <b>similar</b> anti-HBV activity as the lettuce extracts in vitro. The inhibition rate on HBsAg was up to 77. 4 %. Moreover, both the <b>lettuce</b> extracts <b>and</b> luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside functioned as organic antioxidants and, significantly attenuated HBV-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside also normalized ROS-induced mitochondrial membrane potential damage, which suggests luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside inhibits HBsAg and HBV replication via a mechanism involving the mitochondria. Our findings suggest luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside may have potential value for clinical application in CHB and may enhance HBsAg and HBV clearance when used as a combination therapy...|$|R
