40|$|This article {{examines}} the view {{that has long been}} fashionable in related policies and literature that the establishment of the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> is a necessary response to changing times.

Those plans were temporarily put on hold when London County Council decided against a budgetary increase for the department in October, but in November 1917, Jones nominated Armstrong to receive a temporary, part-time lectureship, which she started in February 1918. She {{was finally able to}} work full-time {{at the start of the}} 1918–1919 academic year, becoming the Phonetics Department's first full-time assistant. Armstrong became lecturer in 1920, senior lecturer in 1921, and reader in 1937. Her promotion to readership was announced in The Times and The Universities Review. Armstrong also occasionally taught at the School of Oriental Studies. When Jones had to take a leave of absence the first nine months of 1920, Armstrong became acting head of the department in his stead. During this time, she interviewed and admitted students into the department. Other positions she held at University College were Chairman of the Refectory Committee and Secretary of the Women Staff Common Room. <b>Learned</b> <b>societies</b> Armstrong belonged to included the International Phonetic Association, the Modern Language Association, and the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>learning</b> <b>societies</b> {{is the issue}} of issues of the 21 st century. Every social issue — such as poverty, peace, justice, developm nt, the environment — will necessarily require collective learning for solution. The better we understand the process of collective learning the more able will we be to address our collective problems. Collective learning about collective learning is high-order learning and should be our first priority. The collective meta-cognitive task will be aided by clarification of concepts and terms about the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> and collective <b>learning.</b> The phrase “learning society ” is used differently by different thinkers. In a related domain, the term “organizational learning ” has been defined in so many different ways that discussion sometimes becomes blurred as different participants think they are talking about the same thing when they are not. 1 In an eff rt to avoid confounding different conceptions of <b>learning</b> <b>societies,</b> it would help to identify characteristics or dimensions that distinguish varieties of <b>learning</b> <b>societies.</b> Here I will suggest two such dimensions.

50|$|A <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> is {{generally}} considered to be the basis from which lifelong learning can take place.From a theoretical standpoint, not only does the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> provide the framework in which lifelong learning is allowed to flourish, but that in fact both elements mutually support each other. That is, a <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> gives rise to the capacity for lifelong learning, but lifelong learning allows, through socialisation, for individuals to contribute back to the learning abilities of broader society in the form of wisdom (known as a ‘koinosophic’ or ‘wise’ society).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to review the role of {{government}} in the current trends of vocational qualification system for building life <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> in Japan and to provide useful suggestions for the future directions to develop vocational qualification system in Korea. The vocational education and training system of Japan has been operated on the basis of ministry of education(Munbuso) and ministry of labor(Nodouso) is reponsible for human resource development. But there has not been any partnerships between them to operate vocational education and training. Recently, Japan has been tried to actualize lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> at large. So ministry of education and ministry labor have supported and developed it's own vocational qualification system toward the lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>society.</b> In relation to that, they begin to take little partnerships and form a loose alliance. This is reason why lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> needs strong links between general and vocational education, vocational education and vocational training learning and work. Nevertheless, Japan's dual vocational qualification system is limited for actualizing lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>society.</b> Korea's vocational education and training system and vocational qualification system are similar with those of Japan. So, it is necessary for us to understand the implications of the current trends of vocational qualification system in Japan to build and develop vocational qualification system toward lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>society...</b>|$|R
