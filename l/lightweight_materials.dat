5|$|The team of restorers {{completed}} {{the first stage}} of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved spandrels around the upper sections of the windows, from aluminium scaffolding projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved cantilevering a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials</b> meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement {{along the length of the}} building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.|$|E

25|$|The new Pratt & Whitney engine should yield 12 percent better {{fuel economy}} than {{existing}} jets while being quieter, with further improvements from the airplane aerodynamics and <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials.</b> The 15% better cash operating costs {{come from the}} engines and high use of composite materials, like the wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB.|$|E
25|$|Very tall {{buildings}} ("skyscrapers"), when built using modern <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials,</b> might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A {{solution to this}} problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{possible}} to deploy radar decoys to confuse the defense. Decoys are made of <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials,</b> often strips of aluminum or mylar balloons, which can be packed in with the reentry vehicle (RV), adding little throw weight. In space, these are ejected to create a threat tube a few kilometers across and tens of kilometers long. Zeus had to get within about [...] to kill a warhead, which could be anywhere in the tube. The WSEG suggested that a single ICBM with decoys would almost certainly defeat Zeus. Considering a large missile with multiple warheads, a summer 1961 staff report by ARPA suggested a single missile could require four entire Zeus batteries to defeat it, making the system impractical.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} fight {{scenes in the}} film. For realism, the actors fought without rehearsing. Although the first scene {{utilised}} music and other technical enhancements, Pothan wanted the climactic fight to look more natural: [...] "I felt {{it would be better}} to film it without its cinematic nature. To be able to relate to the scene, it had to look natural. Fahadh and Sujith had a tough time while shooting". The scene was filmed in four days on muddy grounds near the Cheruthoni and Idukki Dams. The film's appooppan thadi (milkweeds) were artificial; about 1,000 were made from <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials.</b> In a scene where Crispin cuts them down, most blew upward like real milkweeds and the scene had to be re-shot several times. The film was made on a budget of 4.50 crore.|$|E

The Fuller Dome is referenced in the Hugo Award-winning novel Stand on Zanzibar by John Brunner, in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of Manhattan, and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Long-held {{green roof}} traditions {{started in the}} early {{industrialization}} period more than 100 years ago exist in Germany. [...] In the 1970s, green roof technology was elevated to the next level. Serious storm-water issues made cities think about innovative solutions, preferably with living plants. Modern green roof technology with high performance, <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials</b> were utilized to grow hardy vegetation even on roofs that can hardly support any additional load. In the 1980s modern green roof technology was common knowledge in Germany while it was practically unknown in {{any other country in}} the world. In Stuttgart, with one of the most innovative Department of Parks and Recreation and with the worlds oldest horticultural Universities, modern green roof technology was perfected and implemented on a large scale.|$|E
2500|$|Ultrasonic welding is {{generally}} utilized in {{the aerospace industry}} when joining thin sheet gauge metals and other <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials.</b> [...] Aluminum is a difficult metal to weld using traditional techniques because of its high thermal conductivity. [...] However, {{it is one of}} the easier materials to weld using ultrasonic welding because it is a softer metal and thus a solid-state weld is simple to achieve. Since aluminum is so widely used in the aerospace industry, it follows that ultrasonic welding is an important manufacturing process. [...] Also, with the advent of new composite materials, ultrasonic welding is becoming even more prevalent. [...] It has been used in the bonding of the popular composite material carbon fiber. [...] Numerous studies have been done to find the optimum parameters that will produce quality welds for this material.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Edward [...] "Tom" [...] Blake (March 8, 1902- May 5, 1994) was an American athlete, inventor, and writer, widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most influential surfers in history, and a key figure in transforming surfing from a regional Hawaiian specialty to a nationally popular sport. Assessing Blake's significance, the sociologist Kristin Lawler wrote: [...] "Tom Blake is a legendary figure; he's considered the founder of California surf culture. He personally innovated most of what's associated with surfers to this day: he was the first to experiment with making better surfboards, revolutionizing board design in the process with <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials</b> and the fin; he was the first to build a waterproof camera housing and inaugurated the tradition of surfers documenting themselves and their friends; and he was the first among countless surfers to come to write a book on the history and pleasures of surfing. In addition, his personal style became the prototypical beachcomber look, still in effect today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Galehead Hut (...) lies nearly [...] {{above sea}} level on rugged Garfield Ridge. Construction on the {{original}} structure there began in 1931, using wood from the surrounding trees. It was completed in 1932, along with Zealand Falls Hut, its closest northern neighbor. A small space under the front porch was used to store perishable foods. In 1938, Galehead gained a temporary 360degree view when the Great New England Hurricane blew over all the surrounding trees. It was replaced in June 2000 with a new Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant hut, complete with a wheelchair ramp {{even though it is}} [...] of rough trail from the nearest trailhead. Given its altitude and remoteness, {{the vast majority of the}} new structure's materials had to be carried in; thus mainly <b>lightweight</b> <b>materials</b> were utilized. New features include composting toilets (already in use at Mizpah Spring Hut, Carter Notch Hut, and Lonesome Lake Hut), both solar panels and a wind vane for producing power, and a foundation fastened to the granite bedrock with grouted rebar, giving the hut the ability to withstand winds up to [...] The hut is [...] from the summit of South Twin Mountain and [...] from the summit of Galehead Mountain.
