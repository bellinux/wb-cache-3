25|$|Higher {{speeds and}} tighter turns require greater lean angles. If the mass is not first <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> the turn, the inertia of the rider and bike will {{cause them to}} {{continue}} {{in a straight line}} as the tires track out from under them along the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical way to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is to move the support points in the opposite direction first.|$|E
25|$|After unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to entice Schaefer into their van with alternate offers {{of marijuana and}} a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
500|$|To promote [...] "Express" [...] and Burlesque, Aguilera has {{performed}} the track on two shows. Aguilera performed [...] "Express" [...] {{for the first}} time at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. During an interview with MTV News about the performance, Aguilera stated that the performance would be [...] "fantastic" [...] and would [...] "give a fitting look inside the movie". Wearing a [...] "black spangly bodysuit" [...] with knee-high boots and a bowler, Aguilera seated in a chair with her back to the audience in the beginning of the show. She began to snap her fingers and <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> the [...] "jazzy, skittery rhythms" [...] of [...] "Express". Later, the scene revealed a set made up to mimic the backstage at a burlesque club, with the singer surrounded by a number of dancers. Gil Kaufman of MTV News said that the performance is a flash back to the [...] "Dirrty-era" [...] of Aguilera.|$|E

500|$|Šiškevičius and Brändle {{attacked}} at {{the start}} of the final lap, with Delaplace unable to follow, but with [...] remaining they were caught by the peloton. In the final , Cofidis came to the front on behalf of Bouhanni and gave him a good lead-out. Bouhanni followed the wheel of Christophe Laporte and opened his sprint with [...] remaining. He was on the right-hand side of the road, with Michael Matthews coming up on his left. In the final , Bouhanni drifted to the left and <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> Matthews; the two riders nearly crashed. Bouhanni crossed the line first, with Matthews just beating Niccolò Bonifazio (Trek–Segafredo) for second place, but the result was changed shortly after the stage. Bouhanni was relegated to third place after the jury decided that he had driven the sprint dangerously, giving Matthews the stage victory and putting Bonifazio into second. Alexander Kristoff led the rest of the field home, one second behind. Marcel Kittel, one of the favourites for the stage victory, finished 65th.|$|E
500|$|With {{the season}} reinventing the series again, {{composer}} Bear McCreary expanded {{the sound of}} the score [...] "in a big way". In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and will become increasingly important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series the feeling of a dense political thriller...I really <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> that, musically. I introduce light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. And I used an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us to have some fun with their witty banter." [...] For [...] "Maveth", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.|$|E

60|$|The major {{put down}} his guide-book, Amy opened her eyes, and Helen removed her shawl from the {{opposite}} seat, as a young man, wrapped in a cloak, with a green shade over his eyes, and a general air of feebleness, got in and sank back {{with a sigh of}} weariness or pain. Evidently an invalid, for his face was thin and pale, his dark hair cropped short, and the ungloved hand attenuated and delicate as a woman's. A sidelong glance from under the deep shade seemed to satisfy him regarding his neighbors, and drawing his cloak about him with a slight shiver, he <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> the corner and seemed to forget that he was not alone.|$|E

60|$|And it came, {{from the}} north-west, {{a blast of}} wind, a blow, an {{atmospheric}} impact that bewildered and stunned and again made the Elsinore harp protest. It forced me down on the rail. I was like a windle-straw. As I faced this new abruptness of gale it drove the air back into my lungs, so that I suffocated and turned my head aside to breathe {{in the lee of}} the draught. The man at the wheel again listened to the Gabriel voice; and Mr. Pike, on the deck below, listened and repeated the will of the voice; and Captain West, in slender and stately balance, <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> the face of the wind and slowly paced the deck.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> the darkness, {{watching}} the greater darkness of London below him. The chambers stood {{much higher than}} the other houses, commanding a hundred chimneys--crooked cowls that looked like sitting cats as they swung round, and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries supported by iron stanchions and clamped by 8-pieces. Northward the lights of Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square threw a copper-coloured glare above the black roofs, and southward by all the orderly lights of the Thames. A train rolled out across one of the railway bridges, and its thunder drowned for a minute the dull roar of the streets. The Nilghai looked at his watch and said shortly, [...] "That's the Paris night-mail. You can book from here to St. Petersburg if you choose." ...|$|E

25|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass of a bicycle and its rider must <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> a turn to successfully navigate it.

50|$|Inertial side forces, {{arising from}} cornering, cause {{the vehicle to}} <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> the corner.
