40|$|The precise {{localization}} of transcribed DNA {{and resulting}} RNA {{is an important}} aspect of the functional architecture of the nucleus. To this end we have developed a novel in situ hybridization approach in combination with immunoelectron microscopy, using sense and anti-sense RNA probes that are derived from total cellular or cytoplasmic poly(A+) RNA.

Carried out on ultrathin sections of fixed and resin-embedded COS- 7 cells, it revealed at high resolution the <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> that code for the cellular mRNAs. Quantitative analysis shows that most transcribed DNA is concentrated in the perichromatin region, i. e. the interface between subchromosomal compact chromatin domains and the interchromatin space essentially devoid of DNA.

40|$|Although urotensin II (UII) and {{somatostatin}} 1 (SS 1) exhibit some structural similarities, their precursors do {{not show}} any appreciable sequence identity and, thus, it is widely accepted that the UII and SS 1 genes do not derive from a common ancestral gene. The recent characterization of novel isoforms of these two peptides, namely urotensin II-related peptide (URP) and somatostatin 2 (SS 2) /cortistatin (CST), provides new opportunity to revisit the phylogenetic relationships of UII and SS 1 using a comparative genomics approach. In the present study, by radiation hybrid mapping and in silico sequence analysis, we have determined the chromosomal <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> encoding UII- and somatostatin-related peptides in several vertebrate species, including human, chicken, and zebrafish.

The {{amino acid sequence}} and threedimensional crystallographic structure of this protein have been determined (2, 3). Furthermore, a variety of peptide fragments of this enzyme have been characterized (4 - 6). Previous immunochemical studies of nuclease (Nase) I have shown that antibody populations specific for individual antigenic regions of the molecule can be isolated by means of successive immunoabsorption to peptide fragments of decreasing size (7), and that inactivation of enzymatic activity by such antibodies provides a very sensitive means of quantitating the antibody-antigen interaction (8).

There was no evidence for PHP in 1 patient with acromegaly (age 60 yr), the patient with hyperprolactinemia and the pituitary tumor (age 22 yr), and 1 asymptomatic obligate carrier (age 50 yr). Screening of 26 members revealed the possible diagnosis of PHP in 1 family member in generation II and possible early acromegaly in 2 members of generation III with elevated serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- 3 but normal patterns of pulsatile GH release.

40|$|Ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is a {{key enzyme}} that {{converts}} atmospheric carbon to food and supports life on this planet. Its low catalytic activity and specificity for oxygen leads to photorespiration, severely limiting photosynthesis and crop productivity. Consequently, Rubisco is a primary target for genetic engineering. Separate <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in the nuclear and chloroplast genomes and a complex assembly process resulting in a very low catalytic activity of hybrid Rubisco enzymes have rendered several earlier attempts of Rubisco engineering unsuccessful. Here we demonstrate that the RbcS gene, when integrated at a transcriptionally active spacer region of the chloroplast genome, in a nuclear RbcS antisense line and expressed under the regulation of heterologous (gene 10) or native (psbA) UTRs, results in the assembly of a functional holoenzyme and normal plant growth under ambient CO 2 conditions, fully shortcircuiting nuclear control of gene regulation.

Phenotypic expression of cadmium (cadr), tetracycline (tetr), or methicillin resistance (mecr) {{did not appear to}} require a host recombination system since a recA 1 mutant could serve as the recipient provided it was superinfected with a competence-inducing phage. There was, furthermore, no requirement for preexisting plasmids for phenotypic expression. Ultraviolet irradiation of transforming DNA enhanced at low doses the transformation frequency for chromosomal genes strr and novr but not for mecr, cadr, or tetr. The gene(s) for mecr was transformed with chromosomal DNA after sodium dodecyl sulfate-sodium chloride extraction and after neutral sucrose gradient centrifugation of bulk DNA from wild-type strain DU 4916 and the transformats. No cavalently closed circular DNA or open circular DNA carrying the methicillin resistance gene(s) could be detected in the wild type or the transformants either by ethidium bromide-cesium chloride gradient centrifugation or by zonal rate centrifugation of cells directly lysed on top of the gradients. The mecr gene(s) is thus probably of chromosomal nature but possibly under recombinational control of phage genes, since transfer of mecr is independent of the recA 1 gene(s) but can be accomplished in this strain after superinfection with a competence-inducing phage.

As a rule, these are scientific articles and reviews in which difficult terms prevail and doctors don't read {{them up to}} the end. And the problem, meanwhile, exists, and problem is very interesting. It is known that {{connective tissue}} consists of cells, fibers and intercellular substance. It is well known that it may be dense and loose and is widespread throughout the organism – skin, bones, cartilagle, vessels wall, stroma of bodies and even blood – at the basis of every element is connective tissue. The structure of connective tissue is well studied, and all biochemical structures are identified. Successes of molecular genetics allowed to define types, structure and <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> which are responsible for synthesis of various elements. First of all we are interested in fibers of connective tissue – collagen with main function to maintain form, and the elastin, providing ability to reduction and relaxation. Dysplasia of connective tissue – the process genetically determined, i. e. at the basis of everything is mutations of the genes which are responsible for synthesis of fibers. Mutations may be the most various and in the most different genes. As a result of mutations collagen chains are formed incorrectly. Thus, they are shorter (deletion), or longer (insertion), they join not that amino acid (a dot mutation). So-called abnormal trimers of collagen appear, they don't maintain due mechanical loadings. The same is with elastin. The clinical picture will be defined by quantity and quality of mutations. Unfortunately, not only specific appearance and cosmetic defects belong to manifestations of dysplasia of connective tissue, but also heavy pathological changes of internal organs and the musculoskeletal apparatus...|$|E
40|$|The BDII rat is genetically {{predisposed}} to estrogen-dependent endometrial adenocarcinoma and represents a valuable model {{for this type}} of tumor. Tumors arising in strain crosses involving the BDII rats had previously been screened for DNA copy number changes using comparative genome hybridization (CGH). It was found that extra copies of the proximal region of rat chromosome (RNO) 6 commonly could be detected in these tumors. Based on RH-mapping data and comparative mapping with mouse and human, seven cancer-related genes were predicted to be situated in RNO 6 q 14 -q 16. Rat PACs were isolated for the N-myc proto-oncogene (Mycn), apolipoprotein B (Apob), the DEAD box gene 1 (Ddx 1), ornithine decarboxylase 1 (Odc 1), proopiomelanocortin (Pomc 1), ribonucleotide reductase, M 2 polypeptide (Rrm 2), and syndecan 1 (Sdc 1). The <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> to the region was verified by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) mapping, and the detailed order among them was determined by dual-color FISH. By Southern blot analysis, {{it was found that the}} Mycn locus was highly amplified in two out of 10 cell cultures derived from the tumors. In one of them (designated RUT 30), the amplification level of Mycn was estimated at 140 x. Two other genes were coamplified (Ddx 1 and Rrm 2) at much lower levels. Similarly, in another culture (designated RUT 2), Mycn was amplified more than 40 x, whereas three of the other genes (Ddx 1, Rrm 2, and Odc 1) were coamplified at lower levels. Using FISH on metaphase chromosomes from the cell cultures analyzed, the amplified sequences were shown to be located in typical HSRs. With competitive RT-PCR, distinct overexpression of Mycn and Ddx 1 could be demonstrated in both RUT 2 and RUT 30. In addition, Mycn was overexpressed in two other tumors not exhibiting Mycn amplification. Taken together, our results suggest that overexpression of Mycn plays an important role in the development of endometrial cancer in the BDII rat. In humans, Mycn amplification has been reported mainly from tumors of neuronal origin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Mycn amplification and overexpression in hormone-dependent tumors.

40|$|Nevoid {{basal cell}} {{carcinoma}} syndrome (NBCCS, or Gorlin syndrome) is a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple {{basal cell carcinoma}}s and diverse developmental defects. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> responsible for NBCCS, which {{is most likely to}} be a tumor suppressor gene, has previously been mapped to 9 q 22. 3 -q 31 in a 12 -cM interval between the microsatellite marker loci D 9 S 12. 1 and D 9 S 109. Combined multipoint and haplotype analyses of additional polymorphisms in this region in our collection of Australasian pedigrees have further refined <b>the</b> <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> to between <b>the</b> markers D 9 S 196 and D 9 S 180, an interval reported to be approximately 2 cM.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} data-driven Allen <b>Gene</b> Expression Atlas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adult mouse brain {{consists of}} numerized in-situ hybridization data for thousands <b>of</b> <b>genes,</b> co-registered to <b>the</b> Allen Reference Atlas.
