50|$|In {{the draft}} of the Navy's unfunded {{priorities}} list for FY 2015, a $796 million <b>line</b> <b>item</b> was included for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) of USS George Washington.

The list was for the FY 2015, so a decision to refuel or inactivate the carrier has to be made during FY 2016 budget planning with the fiscal outlook at that time and the possibility of sequestration funding levels.

40|$|Unbalanced bidding is {{a serious}} problem for the {{construction}} owner because it may increase the cost of construction The most common way to mathematically unbalance a bid is frontloading where a bidder overstates the unit price of <b>line</b> <b>items</b> scheduled to be performed early in the project and understates the unit price of <b>line</b> <b>items</b> performed later. A bidder can also overstate the unit price of a <b>line</b> <b>item</b> whose quantity was somehow underrated by the engineer. If the owner proves that a mathematically unbalanced bid costs more to perform, the bid is said to be materially unbalanced, in which case the owner can reject the bid. A model is presented that formalizes and automates the process of detecting mathematically and materially unbalanced bids by comparing <b>line</b> <b>item</b> prices with the engineer’s estimates and the average prices offered by the bidders. This model allows owners to detect and reject unbalanced bids, and deters bidders from unbalancing their bid. Bids, mathematical models, financial management, construction costs, optimization,...|$|R

The two minority interest <b>line</b> <b>items</b> are the net difference between what would have been the common equity and net income to common, if all subsidiaries were fully owned, and the actual ownership of the group.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Objective: Determine the {{adequacy}} of food composition data for sweetened beverages and snack foods, and improve the nutrient database for a previously validated FFQ (the Beverage and Snack Questionnaire,BSQ). Methods: To illustrate the impact of using only USDA Standard Reference- 24 to perform nutrient analyses of the BSQ, we populated two nutritional databases. The first database included only BSQ foods whose nutrient profiles were available from USDA SR- 24. The second database included nutrient profiles obtained from USDA SR- 24 augmented with data from other databases, food manufacturers, and scientific publications. Nutritional analyses of the BSQ were performed separately for each database, and mean estimates for energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate were compared. We also compared the nutritional databases by selecting a single food to define the nutrient profile of each <b>line</b> <b>item,</b> and subsequently by selecting multiple foods to define <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> Results: Comparing BSQ nutritional analysis using only information from USDA-SR 24 vs. analysis using this information augmented with other sources revealed minor differences (approximately 0 - 1 %) for mean energy and macronutrients in 13 of 19 <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> However, deviations up to 100 % with respect to macronutrient composition were observed for other <b>line</b> <b>items</b> including fruit drinks, flavored waters, and frozen desserts. Nutritional analysis using single vs. multiple foods to define <b>line</b> <b>items</b> was similar, although significant deviations (up to 100 % were observed for various <b>line</b> <b>items</b> such as candies, cookies, and fruits. Significance: If USDA SR- 24 is the sole source of food composition data, the accuracy of nutritional assessments could be compromised, potentially leading to underestimating effects of sweetened beverages and snack foods on nutritional status and energy balance. Understanding how food composition data and <b>line</b> <b>item</b> definitions impact the performance of FFQs may improve the accuracy of dietary assessment tools, and advance understanding {{of the effects of}} foods on nutritional status...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the theory and}} application of an alternative measure of stock-out cost in inventory control. Instead of recording the number of units of a product which are backordered, in certain situations {{it is appropriate to}} focus on the number or percentage of customer <b>line</b> <b>items</b> (requests for a particular item) which are backordered. By combining an approximate backorder cost per customer <b>line</b> <b>item</b> backordered with the usual ordering and carrying costs, an approximately optimal reorder point (or safety stock) formula is derived. The formula is applied to a stratified sample of 500 products from an actual inventory system, and an estimated 13 % reduction in customer <b>line</b> <b>items</b> backordered is obtained with no increase in total inventory investment. ...|$|R
