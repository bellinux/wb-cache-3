5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was at Paramount Pictures for {{producer}} Roger Edens. Funny Face contains {{four of the}} original George and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated 1927 Broadway musical {{of the same name}} that had starred Fred Astaire. Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by Leonard Gershe and included additional music by Gershe and Edens. Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire and Audrey Hepburn's Paramount contracts, the Warner Brothers – owned rights to the Gershwin music that they wanted and their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively. Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in Greenwich Village and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris. Donen, Avedon and cinematographer Ray June collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey <b>look</b> <b>that</b> resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently spent a fortune developing the crisp VistaVision. Funny Face was screened in competition at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and received good reviews from critics like Crowther. Sight and Sound, in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.|$|E

25|$|Planet Hollywood's {{architecture}} {{can best}} be described as having a 'Hollywood hip' theme. It eschews the popular Art-Deco glamour of similarly imaged venues for a sleeker <b>look</b> <b>that</b> features plenty of glass, neon and reflective surfaces.|$|E

25|$|To {{coincide}} with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team introduced pullover spandex uniforms, the first such team in baseball, and a <b>look</b> <b>that</b> would quickly be adopted by most other teams {{by the end of}} the decade. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.|$|E
25|$|The {{magazine}} {{was founded on}} humble beginnings. Due to Guccione's lack of resources, he personally photographed most of the models for the magazine's early issues. Without professional training, Guccione applied his knowledge of painting to his photography, establishing the diffused, soft focus <b>look</b> <b>that</b> {{would become one of}} the trademarks of the magazine's pictorials. Guccione would sometimes take several days to complete a shoot.|$|E

25|$|The coronet {{follows the}} form {{laid down by}} King CharlesII in 1677 by having just one arch rather than the {{traditional}} two arches or four half-arches of British monarchs' crowns {{to show that the}} Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal princes and dukes. Though based on this traditional design, the coronet has a futurist <b>look</b> <b>that</b> was popular in the 1960s, and it was created by the eccentric designer Louis Osman.|$|E

At The Great American Bash on July 24, 2005, Animal and Heidenreich {{defeated}} MNM {{to win the}} WWE Tag Team Championship in a match personally dedicated by Animal to Hawk. After winning the titles Heidenreich changed his appearance, to a <b>look</b> <b>that</b> better suited the Legion of Doom image by shaving his hair into a mohawk and wearing face paint.|$|E
25|$|Soon after The Future {{transformed}} into The Human League, Oakey as lead singer wanted a <b>look</b> <b>that</b> {{would make him}} stand out from other lead singers. After spotting a girl on a Sheffield bus with a Veronica Lake hairstyle, Oakey was inspired to adopt a strange lopsided geometric hairstyle, shoulder length {{on one side and}} short on the other. Between 1978–1979 with his unique hairstyle, he maintained a masculine dress style and at one time wore a full beard.|$|E

25|$|For the 2011 season, the car's {{splitter}} {{and nose}} configuration were redesigned: the splitter's braces were removed, and the splitter was made nonadjustable. The nose {{as a whole}} was given a cleaner, rounder <b>look</b> <b>that</b> resembled that of NASCAR's previous model (now dubbed the fourth-generation car) and manufacturers were given free rein to construct the lower grille area to reflect that of their NASCAR models' production-car counterparts. In the past, all cars were required to run the same exact grille arrangement, allowing for very little, if any, real differentiation between them.|$|E
25|$|Oaxaca woodcarvings {{were all}} {{originally}} painted with aniline paints made with natural ingredients such as bark of the copal tree, baking soda, lime juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. These colorings {{were also used}} for dying clothing, ceremonial paints and other uses. Since 1985, most carvers have now switched to acrylics which resist fading and withstand repeated cleanings better. However, some still use aniline paints as they have a more rustic <b>look</b> <b>that</b> some customers prefer. Either way, the painting is generally done in two layers, with a solid undercoat and a multicolored designed superimposed.|$|E
25|$|Male mods {{adopted a}} smooth, {{sophisticated}} <b>look</b> <b>that</b> included tailor-made suits with narrow lapels (sometimes made of mohair), thin ties, button-down collar shirts, wool or cashmere jumpers (crewneck or V-neck), Chelsea or Beatle boots, loafers, Clarks desert boots, bowling shoes, and hairstyles that imitated {{the look of}} French Nouvelle Vague film actors. A few male mods went against gender norms by using eye shadow, eye-pencil or even lipstick. Mods chose scooters over motorbikes partly because they were a symbol of Italian style and because their body panels concealed moving parts and made them less likely to stain clothes with oil or road dust. Many mods wore military parkas while driving scooters {{in order to keep}} their clothes clean.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} {{started a}} $133 million overhaul to improve efficiency {{and make the}} building more environmentally friendly in 2009. SERA Architects was the architect for the improvements with Cutler Anderson Architects as the Design Excellence consulting architect, which included a new exterior to the structure. PLACE studio was the landscape architect. Funding for the project came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Seattle based Howard S. Wright Companies was the construction manager with the project designed to achieve a LEED Platinum rating. The building re-opened in May 2013 after the $139 million remodel with an entirely new <b>look</b> <b>that</b> included a large solar panel on a tilted roof. The Building was named by the American institute of Architects' Committee on the Environment {{as one of the}} top 10 sustainable projects of 2015.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of their career together, all the band members had a keen sense of visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn & Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic <b>look</b> <b>that</b> had been popularised by Adam and the Ants during 1980–81. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with Vivienne Westwood, and in the 2000s with Giorgio Armani. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation and worked closely with graphic designer Malcolm Garrett and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials.|$|E
25|$|Toronto Argonauts – Were {{the last}} {{franchise}} {{to introduce a}} recurring alternate jersey, which they did in 2007 on July 26 against the Montreal Alouettes. The jersey was Cambridge blue and partnered with their Oxford blue pants and was worn once in 2007, 2008 and 2009. With the retro uniforms that were introduced in 2009, the team also paired the retro Cambridge blue pants with the alternate jerseys for a monochrome Cambridge blue <b>look</b> <b>that</b> the team wore twice that year. The team wore an Oxford blue retro jersey in 2010 that made a return appearance in 2011. The team became {{the first in the}} CFL to wear a white alternate uniform that wasn't based on a retro uniform when they wore their Signature series jerseys in 2014. This uniform was worn once at home and once away in both 2014 and 2015. No alternate jersey was worn in 2016.|$|E
