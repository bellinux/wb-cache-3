40|$|Under certain conditions, {{such as in}} thin liquid films or microgravity, {{surface tension}} {{variations}} along a free surface can induce convection. Convection onset due to surface tension variation is important to many terrestrial technological processes in addition to microgravity materials processing applications. Examples include coating, drying crystallization, solidification, liquid surface contamination, and containerless processing. In double-diffusive and multicomponent systems, the spatial variations of surface tension are associated with two or more stratifying agencies, respectively. For example, both temperature and species (concentration) gradients are associated with convection in the solidification of binary alloys or salt ponds. The direction of the two (or more) gradients has {{a profound effect on}} the nature of the flow at or slightly beyond the onset of convection. Our recent work at the NASA Lewis Research Center focused on characterizing surface-tension-induced onset of convection, often referred to as Marangoni-Benard convection. Exact solutions for the stationary neutral stability of multicomponent fluid layers with interfacial deformation were derived. These solutions also permit the computation of a boundary curve that separates the long and finite wavelength instabilities. Computing points along this boundary using the exact solution (when possible) is more efficient than the typical numerical approaches, such as finite difference or spectral methods. Above the curve, a <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> was predicted, suggesting that convection would occur principally through one large flow cell in the layer, whereas below the curve, finite wavelength instabilities occur which suggest multiple finite-sized circulation cells. For many common liquids with layer depths greater than 100 mm, finite wave instability is predicted under terrestrial conditions; however, with little exception, <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> is predicted in microgravity for the identical fluid systems...|$|E
40|$|The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) {{equation}} {{is known as}} a popular prototype to represent a system in which the transport of energy through nonlinear mode coupling produces a balance between <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> and short wavelength dissipation. Existing numerical results indicate that the KS equation admits three classes (namely, regular shock, oscillatory shock, and solitary wave) of nonperiodic traveling wave solutions and families of multiple solutions in each class. However, the details of multiple solutions are still unclear because of numerical accuracy. In this work, a rational spectral approach is used to compute these multiple traveling wave solutions. Owing to the high accuracy of the employed method, the new families of regular shock waves are found and the fine structure of each family is recognized...|$|E

We suggest mechanisms, and give explicit estimates, on how to ``engineer'' the trapping conditions of the condensate to avoid such instabilities: the main result being that a tight enough trapping potential suppresses the instabilities present in the homogeneous limit.

We take into account electromigration of solute, Joule heating, and thermoelectric effects. This represents an extension of the simple model of Wheeler et al. in which the latter two effects were neglected. We find that for tin–bismuth and germanium–gallium alloys the influence of electromigration and differing electrical conductivities in each phase are the most important in determining the linear stability of the system, with the Peltier heat and Thomson effect the most significant of the thermoelectric effects, particularly at low velocities where an additional <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> may arise.

The response frequency of the instability increases with forcing frequency at low forcing frequencies, while, remarkably, it becomes independent of forcing frequency at large forcing frequencies. This implies a process of wavelength selection. These observations are in good agreement with previous numerical results reported in [Ledesma-Aguilar et al., Phys. Rev. E 71, 016312 (2005) ]. We also study the average value of the finger width, and its fluctuations, as a function of forcing frequency. The average finger width is always smaller than the width of the steady-state finger.

40|$|The {{operation}} of Capillary Pumped Loops (CPL's) in low gravity {{has generally been}} unable to match ground-based performance. The reason for this poorer performance has been elusive. In order to investigate {{the behavior of a}} CPL in low-gravity, an idealized, glass CPL experiment was constructed. This experiment, known as the Capillary-driven Heat Transfer (CHT) experiment, was flown on board the Space Shuttle Columbia in July 1997 during the Microgravity Science Laboratory mission. During the conduct of the CHT experiment an unexpected failure mode was observed. This failure mode was a result of liquid collecting and then eventually bridging the vapor return line. With the vapor return line blocked, the condensate was unable to return to the evaporator and dry-out subsequently followed. The mechanism for this collection and bridging has been associated with <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instabilities</b> of the liquid film forming in the vapor return line. Analysis has shown that vapor line blockage in present generation CPL devices is inevitable. Additionally, previous low-gravity CPL tests have reported the presence of relatively low frequency pressure oscillations during erratic system performance. Analysis reveals that these pressure oscillations are in part a result of <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instabilities</b> present in the evaporator pores, which likewise lead to liquid bridging and vapor entrapment in the porous media. Subsequent evaporation to the trapped vapor increases the vapor pressure. Eventually the vapor pressure causes ejection of the bridged liquid. Recoil stresses depress the meniscus, the vapor pressure rapidly increases, and the heated surface cools. The process then repeats with regularity...|$|R

In contrast to earlier results, the drift speed presents a strong variation close to the parameter value where the drift speed component along the field changes direction. Using a simple phenomenological model and results from a numerical linear stability analysis of scroll waves, I show this behavior can be attributed to a resonance of the meander modes with the translation modes of the spiral wave. Extending this phenomenological model to scroll waves also clarifies the link between the drift and <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instabilities</b> of scroll waves.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{morphological}} instability during the directional solidification of a single-phase binary alloy at constant velocity vertically upwards is treated by a linear stability analysis. The {{case in which}} a heavier solute is rejected at the solidifying interface is considered, and the effect of natural convection on the critical concentration for the onset of instability is studied. For tin containing lead, a small destabilization of the system at low growth velocities, and a large increase in the wavelength of the instability at the onset are found. Calculations show that the destabilization is enhanced as the variation of density with solute concentration is reduced, and in the limit of neutrally-dense solute, there is a <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> for which the critical solute concentration is several orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by the Mullins and Sekerka (1964) analysis in the absence of convection. For the neutrally-dense solute, a simplified analysis indicates the roles played by the interface deformation and thermal convection in promoting the instability. In particular, the destabilization is very sensitive to the ratio of crystal and melt thermal conductivities...|$|E
40|$|We make an {{experimental}} {{characterization of the}} effect that static disorder has on {{the shape of a}} normal Saffman-Taylor finger. We find that static noise induces a small amplitude and <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> {{on the sides of the}} finger. Fluctuations on the finger sides have a dominant wavelength, indicating that the system acts as a selective amplifier of static noise. The dominant wavelength does not seem to be very sensitive to the intensity of static noise present in the system. On the other hand, at a given flow rate, rms fluctuations of the finger width, decrease with decreasing intensity of static noise. This might explain why the sides of the fingers are flat for typical Saffman-Taylor experiments. Comparison with previous numerical studies of the effect that temporal noise has on the Saffman-Taylor finger, leads to conclude that the effect of temporal noise and static noise are similar. The behavior of fluctuations of the finger width found in our experiments, is qualitatively similar to one recently reported, in the sense that, the magnitude of the width fluctuations decays as a power law of the capillary number, at low flow rates, and increases with capillary number for larger flow rates...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{melanoma}} is disproportionately lethal {{despite its}} relatively low incidence {{and its potential}} for cure in the early stages. The {{aim of this study}} is to foster understanding of the role of microstructure on the occurrence of morphological changes in diseased skin during melanoma evolution. The authors propose a biomechanical analysis of its radial growth phase, investigating the role of intercellular/stromal connections on the initial stages of epidermis invasion. The radial growth phase of a primary melanoma is modelled within the multi-phase theory of mixtures, reproducing the mechanical behaviour of the skin layers and of the epidermal–dermal junction. The theoretical analysis takes into account those cellular processes that have been experimentally observed to disrupt homeostasis in normal epidermis. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the loss of adhesiveness of the melanoma cells both to the basal laminae, caused by deregulation mechanisms of adherent junctions, and to adjacent keratynocytes, consequent to a downregulation of E-cadherin, are the fundamental biomechanical features for promoting tumour initiation. Finally, the authors provide the mathematical proof of a <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> of the tumour front during the early stages of melanoma invasion. These results open the perspective to correlate the early morphology of a growing melanoma with the biomechanical characteristics of its micro-environment...|$|E

40|$|Kolmogorov flow in two {{dimensions}} - the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with a sinusoidal body force - is considered over extended periodic domains to reveal localised spatiotemporal complexity. The flow response mimicks the forcing at small forcing amplitudes but beyond a critical value develops a <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability.</b> The ensuing state {{is described by}} a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation {{and as a result}} coarsening dynamics are observed for random initial data. After further bifurcations, this regime gives way to multiple attractors, some of which possess spatially-localised time dependence. Co-existence of such attractors in a large domain gives rise to interesting collisional dynamics which is captured by a system of 5 (1 -space and 1 -time) PDEs based on a long wavelength limit. The coarsening regime reinstates itself at yet higher forcing amplitudes in the sense that only longest-wavelength solutions remain attractors. Eventually, there is one global longest-wavelength attractor which possesses two localised chaotic regions - a kink and antikink - which connect two steady one-dimensional flow regions of essentially half the domain width each. The wealth of spatiotemporal complexity uncovered presents a bountiful arena in which to study the existence of simple invariant localised solutions which presumably underpin all of the observed behaviour...|$|E
40|$|An adhesively {{stressed}} {{thin film}} of a soft hydrogel confined between two rigid flat substrates auto-roughens with its dominant wavelength exhibiting pronounced {{dependence on the}} film thickness (H). A linear stability analysis confirmed that this <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> (~ 7 H) is due to an elasto-capillary effect, the implementation of which required direct measurements of the surface tension and the elasticity of the gel. The surface tension of the gel was estimated from the fundamental spherical harmonic of a hemispherical cap of the gel that was excited by an external noise. The shear modulus of the gel was determined from its resonant shear mode in a confined geometry. During {{the course of this}} study, it was found that a high density steel ball submerges itself inside the gel by balancing its excess weight with the accumulated strain induced elastic force that allows another estimation of its elastic modulus. The large ratio (1. 8 mm) of the surface tension to its elasticity ascertains the role of elasto-capillarity in the adhesion induced pattern formation with such gels. Experimental results are in accord with a linear stability analysis that predicts that the rescaled wavelength is linear with H, which modifies the conventional stress to pull-off a rigid flat object from a very soft film by a multiplicative factor. The analysis also suggests some new results related {{to the role of the}} finite dilation of a material in interfacial pattern formation that may have non-trivial consequences in the adhesive delamination of very thin and/or soft elastic films via self-generated cracks...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} thermal {{convection}} thresholds and linear {{characteristics of the}} primary and secondary instabilities for viscoelastic fluids saturating a porous horizontal layer heated from below by a constant flux. The Galerkin method is used to solve the eigenvalue problem by {{taking into account the}} elasticity of the fluid, the ratio between the viscosity of the solvent and the total viscosity of the fluid and the lateral confinement of the medium. For the primary instability, we found out that depending on the rheological parameters, two types of convective structures may appear when the basic conductive solution loses its stability: stationary <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> as for Newtonian fluids and oscillatory convection. The effect of the lateral confinement of the porous medium by adiabatic walls is to stabilize the oblique and longitudinal rolls and therefore selects transverse rolls at the onset of convection. In the range of the rheological parameters where stationary long wave instability develops first, we use a parallel flow approximation to determine analytically the velocity and temperature fields associated with the monocellular convective flow. The linear stability analysis of the monocellular flow is performed, and the critical conditions above which the flow becomes unstable are determined. The combined influence of the viscoelastic parameters and the lateral confinement on the characteristics of the secondary instability is quantified. The major new findings concerning the secondary instabilities may be summarized as follows: (i) For concentrated viscoelastic fluids, computations showed that the most amplified mode of convection corresponds to oscillatory transverse rolls, which appears via a Hopf bifurcation. This pattern selection is independent of both the fluid elasticity and the lateral confinement of the porous medium. (ii) For diluted viscoelastic fluids, the preferred mode of convection is found to be oscillatory transverse rolls for a very laterally-confined medium. Otherwise, stationary or oscillatory longitudinal rolls may develop depending on the fluid elasticity. Results also showed the destabilizing effect of the relaxation fluid elasticity and the stabilizing effect of the viscosity ratio for the onset of both primary and secondary instabilities...|$|E

In the absence of stabilizing gravitational acceleration, {{the growth rate of}} thermocapillary instabilities is further intensified, driving the film to rupture at an even earlier time. Numerical simulations of zero gravity dynamics of Newtonian liquid films on a solid, horizontal, isothermal substrate are conducted. When the solid, isothermal substrate is replaced with one that possesses one- dimensional porosity, is fully saturated with the same fluid as that of the liquid film and is deep enough to accommodate all of the liquid on it, it is observed that destabilizing spatial modes are damped thereby preventing rupture and the film lifespan is prolonged.

40|$|Love {{waves are}} {{dispersive}} interfacial waves {{that are a}} mode of response for anti-plane motions of an elastic layer bonded to an elastic half-space. Similarly, Stoneley waves are interfacial waves in bonded contact of dissimilar elastic half-spaces, when the displacements are in {{the plane of the}} solids. It is shown that in slow sliding, <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> Love and Stoneley waves are destabilized by friction. Friction is assumed to have a positive instantaneous logarithmic dependence on slip rate and a logarithmic rate weakening behavior at steady-state. <b>Long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instabilities</b> occur generically in sliding with rate- and state-dependent friction, even when an interfacial wave does not exist. For slip at low rates, such instabilities are quasi-static in nature, i. e., the phase velocity is negligibly small in comparison to a shear wave speed. The existence of an interfacial wave in bonded contact permits an instability to propagate with a speed of the order of a shear wave speed even in slow sliding, indicating that the quasi-static approximation is not a valid one in such problems.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{convection}} {{in a rapidly}} rotating layer in which a thermal wind is present is studied. Diffusive effects are included. The main motivation is from convection in planetary interiors, where thermal winds are expected due to temperature variations on the core-mantle boundary. The system admits both convective instability and baroclinic instability. We find a smooth transition between {{the two types of}} modes, and investigate where the transition region between the two types of instability occurs in parameter space. The thermal wind helps to destabilise the convective modes. Baroclinic instability can occur when the applied vertical temperature gradient is stable, and the critical Rayleigh number is then negative. <b>Long</b> <b>wavelength</b> modes are the first to become unstable. Asymptotic analysis is possible for the transition region and also for <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instabilities,</b> and the results agree well with our numerical solutions. We also investigate how the instabilities in this system relate to the classical baroclinic instability in the Eady problem.

40|$|Membrane {{stresses}} act along thin bodies {{which are}} relatively well lubricated on both surfaces. They operate in ice sheets because {{the bottom is}} either sliding, or is much less viscous than the top owing to stress and heat softening of the basal ice. Ice streams flow over very well lubricated beds, and are restrained at their sides. The ideal of the perfectly slippery bed is considered in this paper, and the propagation of mechanical effects along an ice stream considered by applying spatially varying horizontal body forces. Propagation distances depend sensitively on the rheological index, and can be very large for ice-type rheologies. A new analytical solution for ice-shelf profiles and grounded tractionless stream profiles is presented, which show blow up of the profile in a finite distance upstream at locations where the flux is non-zero. This is a feature of an earlier analytical solution for a floating shelf. The length scale of decay of membrane stresses from the grounding line is investigated through scale analysis. In ice sheets, such effects decay over distances of several tens of kilometres, creating a vertical boundary layer between sheet flow and shelf flow, where membrane stresses adjust. Bounded, physically reasonable steady surface profiles only exist conditionally in this boundary layer. Where bounded steady profiles exist, adjacent profile equilibria for the whole ice sheet corresponding to different grounded areas occur (neutral equilibrium). If no solution in the boundary layer can exist, the ice-sheet profile must change. The conditions for existence can be written {{in terms of whether}} the basal rate factor (sliding or internal deformation) is too large to permit a steady solution. The critical value depends extremely sensitively on ice velocity and the back stress applied at the grounding line. High ice velocity and high stress both favour the existence of solutions and stability. Changes in these parameters can cause the steady solution existence criterion to be traversed, and the ice-sheet dynamics to change. A finite difference model which represents both neutral equilibrium and the dynamical transition is presented, and preliminary investigations into its numerical sensitivity are carried out. Evidence for the existence of a <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> is presented through the solution of a numerical eigenproblem, which will hamper predictability. ...|$|E

40|$|Dispersive wave {{turbulence}} is studied numerically for a {{class of}} one-dimensional nonlinear wave equations. Both deterministic and random (white noise in time) forcings are studied. Four distinct stable spectra are observed—the direct and inverse cascades of weak turbulence (WT) theory, thermal equilibrium, and a fourth spectrum (MMT; Majda, McLaughlin, Tabak). Each spectrum can describe long-time behavior, and each can be only metastable (with quite diverse lifetimes) —depending on details of nonlinearity, forcing, and dissipation. Cases of a long-live MMT transient state dcaying to a state with WT spectra, and vice-versa, are displayed. In the case of freely decaying turbulence, without forcing, both cascades of weak turbulence are observed. These WT states constitute the clearest and most striking numerical observations of WT spectra to date—over four decades of energy, and three decades of spatial, scales.

For sufficiently culminated beams, all long wave-length modes are shown to be Weibel-unstable, and a simple analytic expression for their growth rate is derived. For large transverse velocity spreads, these modes become stable. An analytic condition for stability is given. These analytic results, which generalize earlier ones given in the literature, are shown to be in agreement with numerical solutions of the dispersion equation and {{with the results of}} novel PIC simulations in which the electro-magnetic fields are restricted to a given k-mode. The results may describe the interaction of energetic cosmic rays, propagating into the far upstream of a relativistic collisionless shock, with a cold unmagnetized upstream. The <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> modes considered may be efficient in deflecting particles and could be important for diffusive shock acceleration. It is shown that while these modes grow in relativistic shocks propagating into electron-positron pair plasmas, they are damped in relativistic shocks propagating into electron-proton plasmas with moderate Lorenz factors Γ_sh≲ 100. If these modes dominate the deflection of energetic cosmic rays in electron-positron shocks, it is argued that particle acceleration is suppressed at shock frame energies that are larger than the downstream thermal energy by a factor greater than the shock Lorentz factor.

40|$|Plasmas {{involving}} strong {{electron drift}} in crossed electric and magnetic fields are {{of great interest}} {{for a number of}} applications such as space propulsion and material processing plasma sources. Specific applications include Hall thrusters, which are high efficiency, low thrust propulsion systems used on many missions for satellite orbit corrections and for future planned interplanetary missions, as well as magnetrons of various configurations used in plasma deposition devices. Similar conditions also exist in the E-layer of the ionosphere and on the Sun. Despite many successful applications of Hall thrusters and other Hall plasma sources, some aspects of their operation are still poorly understood. A particularly important problem is the anomalous electron transport, which greatly exceeds classical collisional values. Hall plasma devices exhibit numerous turbulent fluctuations in a wide frequency range and it is believed that fluctuations resulting from plasma instabilities are likely one of the main causes of the observed anomalous transport. Plasma turbulence also affects many other important processes such as electron injection, location of the ionization region and wall erosion among others that influence the operation and efficiency of Hall thrusters. In Hall thrusters, the E 0 xB 0 flow is made unstable due to gradients in the plasma density, temperature and magnetic field. The gradient drift <b>instabilities</b> are <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>instabilities</b> that propagate in the azimuthal direction. A fluid theory of these unstable modes is proposed. It is shown that a full account of the compressibility of the electron flow in inhomogeneous magnetic field leads to quantitative modifications of the previously obtained instability criteria and characteristics of the unstable modes. The ExB drift also drives ion sound type instabilities in Hall thrusters. The reactive/dissipative response of the closure current to the thruster walls drives these negative energy modes. A model for this type of instabilities is proposed and analyzed for typical Hall thruster conditions. It is shown how wall parameters modify the characteristic growth rate and frequency of the unstable modes and the related anomalous transport. Nonlinear phenomena are important to understand different aspects of the Hall thruster plasma dynamics. A nonlinear fluid model for the typical Hall thruster plasma is proposed. The model takes into account electron inertia, electron collisions with neutrals, density gradients as well as various nonlinear terms that arise from the electron drift and nonlinear polarization that were included via the gyroviscous cancellation. The proposed model includes the <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> and the low hybrid modes destabilized by density gradients and collisions. This system of fluid equations was implemented using the computational framework BOUT++ from which a set of nonlinear simulations of plasma turbulence was performed. It is shown from these first principles nonlinear simulations that small scale low hybrid oscillations result in an anomalous electron current significantly exceeding the classical collisional current...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the stability of}} a planar accelerating shock front in an exponential atmosphere, a situation that can be described by a self-similar solution. A previous linear instability analysis showed {{that there are three}} regimes, depending on the wavelength of the perturbation along the direction of the shock front: at <b>long</b> <b>wavelengths</b> the shock is unstable, at intermediate wavelengths it is overstable, and at short wavelenghts it is stable, where the characteristic length is set by the initial density scale height. We have carried out numerical simulations of such an accelerating shock front and have confirmed the results of the semianalytic linear analysis in the linear regime. In the nonlinear regime, the evolution again depends on the three <b>wavelength</b> domains. At <b>long</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> the <b>instability</b> continuously grows but the flow remains smooth, and at short wavelengths, the flow is stable. The intermediate wavelength, overstable regime shows more complex evolution. The growing linear oscillations saturate soon after entering the nonlinear regime and the oscillations continue with the same approximate period. The shock front develops moving points of intersection, which generate weak shock fronts and density and pressure structure in the immediate postshock flow. The density fluctuations, with a contrast of a factor of 2 - 3, become frozen into the downstream flow. The growth of the instability is slow, so substantial initial perturbations are needed; thesemay be present in Type II supernovae with red supergiant progenitor stars which have outer convective regions. The clumping in the outer supernova atmosphere may affect spectral line formation and {{may play a role in}} the formation of fast knots...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of fluctuations in a universe dominated by a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. During the graceful exit, we found non-negligible enhancements of both curvature perturbation and gravitational wave in the <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> limit, and we also found a short <b>wavelength</b> <b>instability</b> for steep background superinflation just {{after the completion of}} the graceful exit. This result for one possible graceful exit mechanism would provide a significant implication on the primordial spectrum from the string cos mology.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{we examine the}} {{convergence}} behavior and inter-code reliability of astrophysical jet simulations in axial symmetry. We consider both, pure hydrodynamic jets and jets with a dynamically significant magnetic field. The setups were chosen to match the setups of two other publications, and recomputed with the MHD code NIRVANA. We show that NIRVANA and the two other codes give comparable, but not identical results. We find that some global properties of a hydrodynamical jet simulation, like e. g. the bow shock velocity, converge at 100 points per beam radius (ppb) with NIRVANA. The situation is quite different after switching on the toroidal magnetic field: In this case, global properties converge even at 10 ppb. In both cases, details of the inner jet structure and especially the terminal shock region are still insufficiently resolved, even at our highest resolution of 70 ppb in the magnetized case and 400 ppb for the pure hydrodynamic jet. In the case of our highest resolution simulation, we can report two new features: First, small scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are excited at the contact discontinuity next to the jet head. This slows down {{the development of the}} <b>long</b> <b>wavelength</b> Kelvin-Helmholtz <b>instability</b> and its turbulent cascade to smaller wavelengths. Second, the jet head develops Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities which manage to entrain an increasing amount of mass from the ambient medium with resolution. This region extends in our highest resolution simulation over 2 jet radii in the axial direction. Comment: 17 pages including 16 figures, accepted: A&A, better quality figures at: [URL]...|$|R
