25|$|<b>LoADS</b> {{proposed}} placing one interceptor {{in one of}} the decoy shelters, thus every set of 23 shelters {{would have}} one MX, one <b>LoADS</b> and 21 decoys.

However, only the defender knew where the MX was, and <b>LoADS</b> would only fire at the single warhead seen approaching that shelter. That meant that the MX would almost definitely survive a single warhead attack. In order to be sure the MX was hit, the Soviets would have to attack every shelter with two warheads, assuming one would be lost to the <b>LoADS.</b> For a typical 23-site MPS, 46 warheads would be needed, so if <b>LoADS</b> remained within the 100-interceptor limit of the ABM treaty, 4,600 warheads would be needed to attack just one-half of the 200-strong MX fleet, leaving 100 missiles and 1,000 warheads in the US counterattack. An attack against the entire fleet would require them to break the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks limits on the number of offensive warheads.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the <b>loads</b> which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those <b>loads,</b> and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those <b>loads.</b> The <b>loads</b> can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live <b>loads,</b> moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable).

One of the widely used methods in assessing <b>load</b> model impact on system dynamic response is through parametric sensitivity analysis. <b>Load</b> ranking provides an effective measure of such impact.

It enables comprehensive investigation into <b>load</b> modeling impacts on system stability considering the dynamic interactions between <b>load</b> and system dynamics. The impact of <b>load</b> composition on the overall sensitivity and therefore on ranking of the <b>load</b> is also investigated.

The advantage of a segmented <b>load</b> plate is that it adopts to the shape of the pavement, giving an even distribution of the <b>load</b> on uneven surfaces.
