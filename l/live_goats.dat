The objective was to identify the prospects and constrains to improve the economic productivity of the herds. Goats were ranked highest in population and second in terms of importance to the house hold. Buddhists were dominated in goat rearing while selling of <b>live</b> <b>goats</b> for meat production was popular in all three districts. Kid mortality (60 - 70 % out of total deaths) became a serious threat which was mainly due lack of nourishment for kids during early growth, susceptibility to contagious diseases etc. There was {{an increased risk of}} an epidemic outbreak in all districts due to their generally low health status. Employing bio-diversity-based concepts in feeding was more prominent among rural farmers but acute feed shortage during dry spells was a major constraint in all districts. Despite the least attention paid, goat production has become a major livelihood activity in surveyed areas. In respect to goat production, breeding improvement, introduce more strategic feeding during dry season and health care should be improved and proper marketing facilities should be organized. Recommendations to overcome this situation would be to educate farmers on scientific goat management practices. Key words: Feeding Goat rearing Kid mortality Treatment...|$|E

40|$|Oocytes are {{the main}} raw {{materials}} for in vitro embryo production (IVP) experiments. Therefore, {{the success of any}} IVP program in goat production, either in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) largely depends on the continuous supply of quality oocytes in optimum quantity. A number of methods are currently used for Oocyte Recovery (OR) from live or slaughtered goats. Although, abattoir is the most easy and cheapest source of oocytes, however, in certain countries especially in Malaysia, abattoir source is extremely limited due to low slaughtering activities as a consequence of shortage of breeding stock. In Malaysia normally older goats or goats those are culled for breeding are slaughtered for meat. Therefore, the quality of oocytes recovered from ovaries of these goats is generally lower. On the contrary, OR from <b>live</b> <b>goats</b> using laparoscopic ovum pick-up (LOPU) technique provides many advantages, for example, OR can be repeated 3 - 5 times in the same goat at interval as short as a week or less, OR can be done in prepubertal and aged goats, if prepubertal goat is used for OR then generation intervals will be reduced, LOPU coupled with IVP can become an efficient method of early propagation of valuable goats and LOPU can overcome limitations frequently associated with MOET. Therefore, LOPU can be an alternative and efficient OR method in goat not only for Malaysia but also for other countries.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize three Ethiopian indigenous goat types in terms of their composition and dynamics, productivity, and marketing. A set of semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information from 155 goat owners based on single-visit-interviews. The study indicates that breeding females constituted the largest average flock composition followed by weaners and kids. Goat owners in the study areas relied mainly on births and purchases to build their flock while sales and deaths were the major routes of disposal. Lower commercial offtake (28 %) and higher mortality (24 %) rates were estimated for all study areas but the figures were lower in pastoral and agro-pastoral systems. On average, female goats in the study area gave first birth at the age of 1. 4 years, kidded every 8. 6 months and stayed on production/kidding for about 5 years, giving daily milk yield of 0. 37 liter. Based on the estimates given by respondents, Somali and highland goats were characterized to have bigger age at first kidding and longer kidding life time, respectively. For other traits such as kidding interval and daily milk yield, no significant performance difference was observed among the goat types. In all study areas, goats were sold mainly at the farm gate when money is needed to buy grains and other farm inputs. Average age at sale/slaughter of male goats was about 1. 4 years. Consumers, producers, traders, butchers and brokers were the major buyers of <b>live</b> <b>goats</b> in the study areas. The participation of goat producers in the market was constrained by seasonality of market, low price, and lack of market information and infrastructure. Global Affairs CanadaPeer Revie...|$|E
40|$|Atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome {{are three}} deadly human {{diseases}} for which genetic animal models are needed. From elucidating disease pathogenesis to facilitating {{the development of}} treatments, animal models are crucial for studying human disease. One {{of the most effective}} ways to generate specific animal models is through genetic modification. Historically, mice have been most widely used as genetically modified models, despite a number of limitations. New gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas 9 have made developing alternative genetic models that better recapitulate some human diseases better and more feasible. In this thesis, I describe my efforts to develop genetically modified goat and hamster models for atrial fibrillation and long QT syndrome, and genetically modified hamster models for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. For long QT syndrome model development, I knocked out the KCNQ 1 gene in goat fetal fibroblast cells and baby hamster kidney cells using the CRIPSR/Cas 9 system. The knockout results in loss-of-function mutations, a known cause of human long QT syndrome. The edited goat fibroblast cells will be nuclear donors for future cloning experiments to produce <b>live</b> <b>goats</b> possessing the KCNQ 1 knockout. The CRISPR gene targeting sgRNA/Cas 9 vector, specific for the hamster KCNQ 1, has been used for pronuclear injections to produce KCNQ 1 knockout hamsters. For atrial fibrillation model development, I designed a single-stranded donor oligonucleotide that generates a KCNQ 1 gainof-function mutation resulting in the disease. This oligonucleotide was injected into hamster embryos along with the KCNQ 1 sgRNA/Cas 9 -expressing vector to generate hamsters containing the gain-of-function mutation. Finally, for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome model development, I established a breeding colony of human DPP 4 transgenic hamsters in the STAT 2 knockout background. Human DPP 4 transgenic hamsters are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, showing mild clinical signs and allowing viral replication in lung tissue. Giving these hamsters a STAT 2 knockout background should promote a more severe disease progression. For all three diseases, the foundations for the development of genetic animal models have been laid...|$|E
40|$|With recent {{increases}} {{in demand for}} animal products smallholder goat producers {{have an opportunity to}} improve their livelihoods by increased market access and market participation. Thus this study was carried out to identify the live goat chain actors, their role, linkages, power relations and practices in the supply chain; to establish the institutional support services and the enabling environment under which the smallholder goat farmers operate in Choma district. To accomplish these tasks both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through use of semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and a household survey of 105 smallholder household goat farmers selected randomly. Based on this information, goat market channels were mapped and profit margins calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the household data. The study outcomes indicate that <b>live</b> <b>goats</b> from Choma district are marketed through three major channels, namely the urban trader, rural trader and trader Choma market channel which are all indirect marketing channels. The market actors in these channels were producers, traders (urban and rural), wholesalers, retailers and input service providers, with a significant amount of goats channelled through the urban trader channel. To analyse the performance of the goat market, costs, profit and market margins were calculated for each market channel. The majority of the respondents were male standing at 65. 4 % while the females were 34. 6 %, the mean family size was nine and meanwhile, 51. 9 % of the respondents had attained primary level of education. Respondents were involved in goat production for an average of 9. 2 years with 49 % producing an average of 12 goats annually. Farmers identified high disease prevalence, lack of production skills, lack of access to market information, high cost of transportation, lack of access to credit, and lack of market infrastructure as the constraints in the goat chain. Results of the Kruskal - Wallis nonparametric test of independence (P = 0. 05) revealed that there is no statistical difference between the three market outlets with regard to experience of the farmer, farm size, herd size, annual household income and family size while cost of production was significant across the groups. Study findings highlighted that there is need to enhance production through improved provision of veterinary services, access to credit, and extension services. The study recommends fostering of partnerships among the chain actors to ensure that there is creation of an enabling environment for easy flow of market information and infrastructure development to improve the goat marketing system...|$|E
