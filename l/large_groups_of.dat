5|$|Being {{the most}} {{abundant}} carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> dogs.|$|E

5|$|By 1855, the {{economic}} climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, {{it was the}} owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could be made {{in a wide variety}} of conventional businesses.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} night of the battle, the {{garrison}} at Malakand North had not seen much action despite being in the more exposed position, and had spent much of the night firing flares and manoeuvring artillery units. In response Meiklejohn ordered a reconnaissance of the vicinity, whereupon Major Gibbs, the commander of the force, encountered <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> tribesmen in the valley. Subsequently, he was eventually ordered to collect his forces and stores from Malakand North, and transfer them into the southern camp.|$|E
5|$|Getting It: The Psychology of est is a non-fiction book by American {{psychologist}} Sheridan Fenwick, {{first published}} in 1976, analyzing Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminars Training or est. It is based on Fenwick's own experience of attending a four-day session of the est training, an intensive 60-hour personal development course in the self-help genre. <b>Large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> up to 250 people took the est training at one time.|$|E

5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. <b>Large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing their innocence would enable success where their elders had failed. Few, if any at all, journeyed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide an indication of how hearts and minds could be engaged for the cause.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down strikes, and <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines. This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E

The Rainbow Family are best known for the Rainbow Gathering, a large, primitive type camping event in which up to 20,000 people attend.

5|$|There is a {{well-developed}} {{social structure}} within <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> condors, with competition {{to determine a}} 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations.

5|$|An {{important}} feature that distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E
5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred yards. From the start, <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> {{people who have}} no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the Huang Chao Rebellion (874–884) {{resulted in the}} sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress. Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang, it never recovered from that crucial blow, weakening it for the future military powers to take over. There were also <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> bandits, {{in the size of}} small armies, that ravaged the countryside {{in the last years of}} the Tang, who smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and convoys, and even besieged several walled cities.|$|E
5|$|In many cases, <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> {{immigrant}} Han would unite under {{a common}} surname {{to form a}} brotherhood. Brotherhoods were used {{as a form of}} defense, as each sworn brother was bound by an oath of blood to assist a brother in need. The brotherhood groups would link their names to a family tree, in essence manufacturing a genealogy based on names rather than blood, and taking the place of the kinship organizations commonly found in China. The practice was so widespread that today's family books are largely unreliable. Many Plains Aborigines joined the brotherhoods to gain protection of the collective as a type of insurance policy against regional strife, and through these groups they took on a Han identity with a Han lineage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the era of}} Ottoman rule, and {{especially}} from the 17th to the 19th century, the local Greek Orthodox communities were granted special privileges by the Ottoman authorities. At that time the area of Zagori acquired an autonomous status inside the Ottoman Empire, whereby the locals were exempt from the fiscal extortion that crippled the more prosperous lowland communities. During this period <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> villagers emigrated to metropolitan centers. Many among them became members of successful professional classes before finally returning to their home villages, endowing the region with wealth and building luxurious mansions. In such an environment, the art of herbal healing by the so-called Vikos doctors developed and flourished. This was accompanied by an impressive cultural and intellectual life that produced many renowned scholars and benefactors of Greece.|$|E
