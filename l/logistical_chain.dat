The <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> drivers should not only be managed as a cohesive unit, but also be aligned with the orientation of the selected supply chain strategy, in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. During 2014, a quantitative survey was conducted among 650 formal independent small Sowetan businesses of which the responses of 556 retailers were analysed in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. The study also investigated the role of the relevant industry group in the management of the <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> drivers by the business owners. The data was analysed and tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Pearson Chi-square test and factor analyses were performed.

40|$|Background: Small {{businesses}} {{are seen as}} the impetus behind a country’s economic growth. The South African government’s continued commitment to prioritise the development of small businesses, the promising rise of the retail sector in South Africa and the substantial contribution of small businesses to trade, business services, personal services and construction make the small retailers {{a force to be}} reckoned with. Businesses often fail because of a lack of strategic fit between the competitive and supply chain strategies. It is imperative that the supply chain design, resources and processes provide the necessary capabilities to support the desired competitive strategy. Managing the three <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> drivers of facilities, inventory and transportation can contribute to achieving a strategic fit between the selected competitive strategy and supply <b>chain</b> strategy. The <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> drivers should not only be managed as a cohesive unit, but should also be aligned with the orientation of the selected supply chain strategy, in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. Objective: The objective of this article is to provide guidelines from literature that small business retailers can use in managing their <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> drivers to be aligned with the orientation of their selected supply chain strategy in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency. Method: An extensive literature review was conducted pertaining to the management of the three <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> drivers by small retailers. Results: It was determined that small responsive retailers typically order inventory on a frequent basis, hold excess inventory, provide customers with a seamless in-store experience and are located close to their customers. These responsive retailers make use of direct delivery from suppliers (and to customers) to increase their flexibility and reduce lead times. On the other hand, small cost-efficient retailers typically do not hold excess inventory, and their stores are usually located further away from customers. These cost-efficient retailers take advantage of both economies of scale when purchasing inventory and economies of distance when transporting inventory. Conclusion: Literature guidelines with regard to the management of the <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> drivers are provided to assist small retailers in achieving a strategic fit between the selected competitive strategy and supply chain strategy. </p...|$|R

40|$|The GoodTrip model {{estimates}} goods flows, {{urban freight}} traffic and its impacts. This paper discusses {{the theory and}} application of the model, {{that is based on}} logistical chains. Liveability and accessibility of urban areas are influenced by freight traffic resulting from logistical choices in the supply chain, like warehouse location, delivery frequencies, vehicle type and routing. To support decision making it is necessary to model these choices and their effects, in current and future situations. In GoodTrip the <b>logistical</b> <b>chain</b> links activities of consumers, supermarkets, hypermarkets, distribution centres and producers. Based on consumer demand, the GoodTrip model calculates the volume per goods type in m 3 in every zone. The goods flows in the <b>logistical</b> <b>chain</b> are determined by the spatial distribution of activities and the market shares of each activity type- consumer, supermarket, hypermarket, distribution centre, etc. This attraction constraint calculation starts with consumers and ends at the producers or at the city borders. A vehicle loading algorithm then assigns the goods flows to vehicles. A shortest route algorithm assigns all tours of each transportation mode to the corresponding infrastructure networks. This results in logistical indicators, vehicle mileage, network loads, emissions and finally energy use of urban freight distribution. GoodTrip is a tool to evaluate different concepts of freight distribution from both a societal as economical viewpoint, by using geographical, economical and logistical data. This was done in a case study for the City of Groningen The modelling approach is innovative and the first results are promising. Model output discriminates clearly between different alternative freight distribution concepts. The modelling results comply with empirical data and real life experience. 1...|$|E

Although the South African government implemented various initiatives for the development of small businesses in townships, the full advantage of such initiatives has not yet been experienced. Objectives: To investigate how formal, independent small retail businesses operating in Soweto manage transportation as a <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> driver to be financially sustainable. Method: During 2014, a survey was conducted among a sample of 556 formal, independent small retail businesses in Soweto to determine if these retailers focused on responsiveness or cost-efficiency when managing their <b>logistical</b> supply <b>chain</b> driver of transportation. Results: The results showed that the retailers manage transportation decisions by focusing on either cost-efficiency or responsiveness, {{depending on the type of}} transportation decision and the industry in which the retailer operates. In terms of the profile of the older businesses (5 years and older) that showed a growth pattern in income (turnover) over the past year, responsive transportation decisions based on having inventory available (either by direct delivery by suppliers or by using own transportation) was a higher priority than considering cost. Conclusion: The type of transportation decisions made by the older, growing businesses could serve as an example to younger businesses showing a stagnating or contracting growth pattern. </span...|$|R

40|$|With {{containerized}} shipping, {{maritime transport}} has changed profoundly. Among other things, it {{has shifted from}} labor-intensive to more capital-intensive activities, including larger specialized ships that require substantial investments in port infrastructure and equipment. Integrated transport chains have reduced transport costs so much that a shipper may find a distant port cheaper than a closer one. Modern ports must be competitive on times and prices for their services. Seaports must be integrated within <b>logistical</b> <b>chains</b> to serve their many functions. An efficient seaport requires infrastructure, superstructure, equipment, adequate connections to other modes of transport, a well-motivated management, and qualified employees. The public sector {{has been an important}} port organizer in the past, but private participation in port operations and infrastructure could make ports significantly more competitive. The authors provide an overview of changes in maritime activity, discuss concession contracts (a key instrument of privatization), and analyze how regulatory mechanisms affect such factors as seaport tariffs, port congestion, port safety, the quality of cargo handling, and relevant indicators of performance, finances, and factor productivity. They describe how an optimal seaport system should allocate tasks between the various institutions involved, including the port authority. The degree of a seaport's decentralization, they conclude, depends on a country size, the number of ports it has, and its legal tradition. Among several national governments in Latin America [...] Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela [...] there is an evident trend toward decentralization and greater autonomy for port authorities.

However, these advantages will erode as National Oil Companies (NOCs) improve their expertise over the mid- to long-term and new forms of resource nationalism may restrict their room for manoeuvre.
