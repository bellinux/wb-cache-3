5|$|The Lexus LS (Japanese: レクサス・LS, Rekusasu LS) is a {{full-size}} <b>luxury</b> <b>car</b> (F-segment in Europe) {{serving as the}} flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive, with Lexus also offering all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option.|$|E

5|$|Lexus has {{not sold}} {{as well in}} Europe, where it suffers from smaller brand recognition, image, and a less-developed {{dealership}} network. In European markets, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship <b>luxury</b> <b>car</b> sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Through the mid-2000s, Lexus {{experienced}} sales {{successes in}} South Korea and Taiwan, becoming the top-selling import make in both markets in 2005; the marque also sold {{well in the}} Middle East, where it ranked first or second among rivals in multiple countries, and in Australia, where Lexus reached third in <b>luxury</b> <b>car</b> sales in 2006. Division executives in 2006 announced an expansion goal from 68 countries to 76 worldwide by 2010. By {{the end of the}} decade, this expansion resulted in official launches in Malaysia and South Africa in 2006, Indonesia in 2007, Chile in 2008, and the Philippines in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{its largest}} market, the U.S., the Lexus LS was the top-selling {{flagship}} luxury sedan for 15 {{of the first}} 17 years following its debut. In Japan, the next-largest market for the Lexus LS, {{the introduction of the}} 2007 LS 460 attracted 12,000 pre-orders, and the Lexus LS has gone on to sell successfully in its class. Following the introduction of the LS 460 and Lexus' expanded global launch in 2007, sales of the Lexus flagship have increasingly come from outside the brand's traditional U.S. strongholds. By 2007, the Lexus LS ranked second globally in flagship sales, next to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class' 85,500 units, with 71,760 Lexus LS sedans sold worldwide, and over half the total coming from outside the U.S. market. In 2008, U.S. sales fell 42% amidst the late-2000s recession, mirroring the overall decline of the <b>luxury</b> <b>car</b> market.|$|E
