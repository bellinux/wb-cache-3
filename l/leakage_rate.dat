25|$|There {{have also}} been some {{concerns}} over possible problems related to hydrogen gas leakage. Molecular hydrogen leaks slowly from most containment vessels. It has been hypothesized that if significant amounts of hydrogen gas (H2) escape, hydrogen gas may, because of ultraviolet radiation, form free radicals (H) in the stratosphere. These free radicals would {{then be able to}} act as catalysts for ozone depletion. A large enough increase in stratospheric hydrogen from leaked H2 could exacerbate the depletion process. However, the effect of these leakage problems may not be significant. The amount of hydrogen that leaks today is much lower (by a factor of 10–100) than the estimated 10–20% figure conjectured by some researchers; for example, in Germany, the <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> is only 0.1% (less than the natural gas leak rate of 0.7%). At most, such leakage would likely be no more than 1–2% even with widespread hydrogen use, using present technology.|$|E

The three foot long structural panel-edge seal {{is designed to}} minimize leakage of high temperature, high pressure gases past the movable panels of advanced ramjet/scramjet engines. The seal is made of a stack of precision machined ceramic wafer pieces that are inserted into a closely conforming seal channel in the movable engine panel. The wafer seal accommodates the significant distortions in the adjacent engine walls through relative sliding between adjacent wafers. Seal <b>leakage</b> <b>rates</b> are presented for engine simulated air temperatures up to 1350 F and for engine pressures up to 100 psi. <b>Leakage</b> <b>rates</b> are also presented for the seal, sealing both a flat wall condition, and an engine simulated distorted wall condition in which the distortion was 0. 15 in. in only an 18 in. span. Seal <b>leakage</b> <b>rates</b> were low, meeting an industry-established tentative leakage limit for all combinations of temperature, pressure, and wall conditions considered.

2500|$|A 2011 {{study by}} noted climate {{research}} scientist, Tom Wigley, {{found that while}} carbon dioxide (...) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in [...] forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due {{to changes in the}} emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced [...] emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> is as high as 10%.

A 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale, the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage.|$|E

40|$|When {{liquid is}} sealed at high temperature, it flashes inside the seal due to {{pressure}} drop and/or viscous heat dissipation. Two-phase seals generally exhibit more erratic behavior than their single phase counterparts.
