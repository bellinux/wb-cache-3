25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> in central London are close to pre-charging <b>levels,</b> the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>congestion</b> charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The paper explores {{relationships}} between seven dimensions {{of land use}} in 1990 and subsequent <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> three traffic <b>congestion</b> outcomes in 2000 for a sample of 50 large US urban areas. Multiple regression models are developed to address several methodological concerns, including reverse causation and time-lags. Controlling for prior <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> and changes in an urban area’s transport network and relevant demographics, it is found that: density/ continuity is positively related to subsequent roadway ADT/lane and delay per capita; housing centrality is positively related to subsequent delay per capita; and housing–job proximity is inversely related to subsequent commute time. Only the last result corresponds to {{the conventional wisdom that}} more compact metropolitan land use patterns reduce traffic congestion. These results prove two points: that the choice <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> measure may substantively affect the results; and that multivariate statistical analyses are necessary to control for potentially confounding influences, such as population growth and investment in the transport network...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate route diversion as a strategy for reducing crash risk on freeways using Microsimulation. Traffic simulation environment provides the 2 ̆ 7 loop detector data 2 ̆ 7 which in turn are the inputs to the models used for real-time crash risk estimation. It has been found that rear-end crashes are more accurately described as occurring within one of two distinct traffic regimes. Hence, the crash risk estimates for rear-end crashes belonging to Regime 1 and Regime 2 are output posterior probabilities from two different models which are not directly comparable. A method was proposed to transform the output from the two models into a single measure of rear-end crash risk, which can be used to assess the crash risk during simulation environment even when traffic conditions change from Regime 1 to 2 or vice versa. Using the information obtained from simulation package the crash risk estimates for the base case (No route diversion) and cases with route diversion(s) were compared. Route diversion was found to decrease the overall rear-end and lane-change crash risk on the freeway sections with free-flow conditions to low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion.</b> However, a crash migration phenomenon was observed at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion...</b>|$|R
