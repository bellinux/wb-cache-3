Various governmental institutions are involved in the collection of landings and effort data, biological and economic data of the German fisheries. About 200 trips on commercial fishery vessels were sampled from 2002 to 2006. Additional stock data are collected on research surveys. The <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> in the recreational fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas were recorded within a pilot study.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of maturity data for Georges Bank cod (Gadus morhua) in NAFO Division 5 Ze, derived from Canadian 1986 – 94 spring research surveys, {{showed a significant}} de-crease in the total length (~ 4 cm) and age (~ 0. 5 years) of fish at fifty percent maturity, over the nine year period. Differences in mean size-at-age {{for males and females}} appeared to occur after the age at which full maturity was achieved, allowing the use of data pooled by sex for estimating maturity ogives by length and age.

40|$|In many fisheries, the {{harvesting}} pattern shows considerable intra-year variation. These fluctuations give {{challenges for}} downstream firms in value chains where predictability and continuity {{in the flow}} of production are important. Seasonal harvesting may well be rational from an economic perspective, as migration patterns can give huge variations in catch per unit effort. With limited quotas, profit can be maximized through fishing intensively in short periods. This strategy is particularly present in the Norwegian cod fisheries, where approx. 80 per cent is landed from January to April. During the lean season, fish-processing firms have low capacity utilization, and employees are often laid-off. In order to ease these problems, several schemes have been employed, all aiming at changing the harvesting pattern towards more <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> during the autumn. In 2006 and 2007, rural community quotas (RCQs) were re-introduced to improve supplies of raw material to particularly exposed communities in the lean season. An exclusive quota was allocated to an autumn fishery. This was allotted to vessels through a lottery among applicants. Quotas were to be delivered fresh to a specified geographical area. This paper describes and analyses the implementation and impacts of this quota system. The empirical findings reported focuses on the selection of vessels and communities and impact on harvesting pattern and processing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mass-balance models using inverse {{methodology}} {{have been}} constructed for the northern Gulf of St. Law-rence ecosystem in the mid- 1980 s, before the groundfish collapse. The results highlight {{the effects of the}} major mortal-ity sources (fishing, predation, and other sources of mortality) on the fish and invertebrate communities. Main predators of fish were large cod (Gadus morhua) followed by redfish (Sebastes spp.), capelin (Mallotus villosus), and fisheries. Large cod were the most important predator <b>of</b> small <b>cod,</b> with cannibalism accounting for at least 44 % of the mortal-ity <b>of</b> small <b>cod.</b> The main predators <b>of</b> large <b>cod</b> were harp (Phoca groenlandica) and grey (Halichoerus grypus) seals. However, predation represented only 2 % of total mortality on large cod. Mortality other than predation domi-nated the mortality processes at 52 % of the total, while the fishery represented 46 %. Tests were performed to identify possible sources of this unexplained mortality. The only way to significantly reduce unexplained mortality on large cod in the model was to increase <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> large <b>cod</b> above those reported. This suggests that fishing mortality was sub-stantially underestimated in the mid- 1980 s, just before the demise <b>of</b> a <b>cod</b> stock that historically was the second larg-est in the northwest Atlantic.

40|$|The satellite-based vessel {{monitoring}} {{system in the}} Norwegian Economic Zone provides detailed information about individual trips by vessels. Vessel sizes are available through official registries, and the storage capacity for fish is estimated using the established conver-sion factors {{as a function of}} the vessel’s gross registered tonnage. Scientists have had access to the database of both transport and fishing vessels, with records for individual trips, in addition to information about the total round weight (whole fish) <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> and haddock for trips inspected by the coastguard. The analysis assumes that trips with complete documentation of the fish on board are a random sample, so allowing estimation of the mean amount <b>of</b> both <b>cod</b> and haddock per trip, and annual totals give the number of trips per vessel annually. ICES has accepted this methodology for estimating illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) catches, which has resulted in 15 000 – 166 000 t (3 – 35 %) being added to the officially reported <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> Northeast Arctic <b>cod</b> during the years 2002 – 2008.

40|$|AbstractThe Svalbard {{archipelago}} in the High Arctic {{is influenced}} by cold Arctic water masses from the north-east and the warm West Spitsbergen Current flowing northwards along its western coast. The eastern waters and the fjords are normally frozen during the winter months, while the coastal waters west of the archipelago remain open. Norwegian fishers have been harvesting from Svalbard waters for decades and detailed records of catches exists from 1980 onwards. We analyze the catch records from the Svalbard zone (approximately ICES area IIb). The large fishery for capelin in summer yielding annual catches up to 737   000 tons was closed by a Norwegian fishery regulation in the mid nineteen nineties. Demersal fisheries have been continuous, and the results clearly indicate a northward trend in <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> Northeast Arctic <b>cod,</b> haddock, ling and Atlantic halibut. Fisheries of Northern shrimp have been more variable and shown no clear geographic trends. A “gold rush” fishery for scallops north of Svalbard lasted for about 10 years (1986 – 1995) only, and ended due to low profitably. These results are discussed {{in relation to the}} possibility of further northward extension of fisheries subjected to climate change...|$|R

Spawning stock biomass was 29, 170 mt in 2001 and continued the increasing trend from the record low estimate of 17, 375 mt in 1995. Since 1991, recruiting year classes have all been below the long term average and the 2000 and 2001 year classes were the lowest in the time series. The NEFSC spring and autumn bottom trawl survey indices continued to remain near record low values.

This paper presents the results of growth, catch curve and yield per recruit analyses from the monitoring programme conducted between 1993 and 1996. Preliminary results show that all of these stocks but sole in VIIb,c are over-exploited. TAC levels (based on reported catches in previous years) may be inappropriate for the current stock sizes.

40|$|This section {{summarizes}} {{stock status}} in 2004 {{as determined by}} current assessments, and compares that to stock status in 2001 as determined both by the current assessments and those conducted by the 2002 GARM. For some stocks, the current assessments provide different estimates of 2001 biomass and fishing mortality than those reported by the 2002 GARM. These cases are noted. Assessment information {{is based on the}} calendar year. For stocks that are assessed with age-based methods, biomass estimates are for SSB {{at the beginning of the}} spawning season. Since most groundfish stocks spawn in the spring or early summer, the assessments provide an estimate of biomass at the beginning of the implementation of Amendment 13 (implemented May 1, 2004) and do not reflect the impact of Amendment 13 measures. For most index-based stocks the biomass index proxy includes the 2004 fall trawl survey and thus reflects a few months of Amendment 13 measures. Fishing mortality estimates reflect eight months of Amendment 13 measures. 3. 1 Current Stock Status Of the 18 stocks for which FMSY (or its proxy) could be estimated, 10 were fished below FMSY in 2004, and 8 above. Additionally, the biomasses of 6 of the 19 stocks for which BMSY (or its proxy) could be estimated were at or above BMSY, while the biomasses of 13 stocks were below the threshold. Stock biomasses have increased in only 6 of the 19 stocks since 2001. For the 6 stocks that increased in biomass between 2001 and 2004, the average increase was 50 %. For the remaining stocks, the average decrease was 19 %. For Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, alternative model formulations were used for assessment (denoted as GB YT 1 and GB YT 2, see Chapter C). One model suggested that the biomass increased (GB YT 1) while the other (GB YT 2) suggested a decrease. If model GB YT 1 is used then 7 stocks increased. <b>Landings</b> <b>of</b> the complex of 19 groundfish stocks have declined by 7 % since 2002, driven primarily by decreases in <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> Georges Bank <b>cod</b> and American plaice but offset primarily by increases in <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> Georges Bank haddock and pollock. Fishing mortality (F) rates declined for 13 of 19 stocks between 2001 and 2004. For the 13 stocks where F declined, the average percent decline was 50 % (range: 1 % to 80 %).
