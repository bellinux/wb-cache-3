5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} object with a mass that falls {{within the range of}} the definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core fusion <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>star.</b> By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side. A window (shaped, like all the others in the church, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>star)</b> set in mosaic is positioned above the door, and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building; in between them, there are patterns of lights and coloured marble panels on the lower parts of the interior walls. The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall, built from masonry, underneath the church. The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011, when a carved crucifix, which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool, was also dedicated. The porch houses a sepulchral slab, dating from the latter half of the 13th century.|$|E

500|$|In 185 CE, Chinese astronomers {{recorded}} {{the appearance of}} a bright star in the sky, and observed that it took about eight months to fade from [...] the sky. It was observed to sparkle <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> and did not move across the heavens like a comet. These observations are consistent with {{the appearance of a}} supernova, and this {{is believed to be the}} oldest confirmed record of a supernova event by humankind. SN 185 may have also possibly been recorded in Roman literature, though no records have survived. The gaseous shell RCW 86 is suspected as being the remnant of this event, and recent X-ray studies show a good match for the expected age.|$|E

500|$|In September 1967, he met Robert Kirby, a music {{student who}} went on to orchestrate many of the string and woodwind {{arrangements}} for Drake's first two albums. By this time, Drake had discovered the British and American folk music scenes, and was influenced by performers such as Bob Dylan, Donovan, Van Morrison, Josh White and Phil Ochs. He began performing in local clubs and coffee houses around London, and in February 1968, while playing support to Country Joe and the Fish at the Roundhouse in Camden Town, made an impression on Ashley Hutchings, bass player with Fairport Convention.

500|$|Geastrum pectinatum is an {{inedible}} {{species of}} mushroom {{belonging to the}} earthstar family of fungi. Although young specimens are spherical, fruit body development involves the outer layer of tissue splitting open <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> into 7 to 10 pointed rays that eventually bend back to point downward, revealing a small – [...] broad – spore sac. The spore sac {{is supported by a}} small radially wrinkled stalk. [...] There is a distinct conical opening (peristome) {{at the top of the}} spore sac that is up to [...] long. It is commonly known as the beaked earthstar or the beret earthstar, in reference to the shape of the spore sac and its prominent, protruding peristome. The mass of spores and surrounding cells within the sac, the gleba, is dark-brown, and becomes powdery in mature specimens. Spores are spherical, measuring 4 to 6 micrometers in diameter, with warts on their surfaces. Although uncommon, Geastrum pectinatum has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been collected in various locations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Like several other earthstars, crystals of calcium oxalate are found on G.pectinatum, and are thought to be involved in fruit body maturation.|$|E

"Lucky Star" [...] {{has been}} a setlist staple on four of Madonna's concert tours: The Virgin Tour (1985), the Who's That Girl World Tour (1987), the Confessions Tour (2006), and the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). On The Virgin Tour, Madonna {{performed}} the song wearing an entirely black costume, consisting of a crop top worn beneath a vest, fringed elbow length gloves, a fringed miniskirt, leggings, and low heel leather boots. She also wore a crucifix earring in one ear and a silver cross pattée was pinned to the right shoulder of her vest. Madonna sang the original version of the song, and pranced around the stage while showing her stomach. The performance {{was included in the}} [...] VHS, released in 1985. At the Who's That Girl World Tour, [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was performed as the second song of the set list. Madonna wore a black bustier like the music video to her single [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] (1987). Her hair was platinum blond and in a big bushy shape.

500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>star.</b> For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E
2500|$|This lantern {{is just a}} {{small stone}} box with a low roof.

2500|$|Conventional overhead, {{trolling}} or baitcasting type reels usually {{use one of}} {{two types}} of drags: star or lever. The most common and simplest mechanically is the star drag—so-called because the adjustor [...] wheel looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> with rounded points. Star drags work by screw action to increase or decrease {{the pressure on the}} washer stack which is usually located on the main driving gear. Reels with star drags generally have a separate lever which allows the reel to go into [...] "freespool" [...] by disengaging the spool from the drive train completely and allowing it to spin freely with little resistance. The freespool position is used for casting, letting line out and/or allowing live bait to move freely.|$|E

2500|$|Point Break was {{released}} across 3,700 screens in China, its first market, on December 4, three {{weeks prior to}} its U.S. release.

Alcon Entertainment's Andrew Kosove said they were happy with the results {{given the lack of}} brand equity associated with the film there. Including revenues from five other Asian markets, the total opening was $14.1million. Buoyed by good word of mouth, the film fell only 14% in its second weekend to $10.2million ($18.8million in its full second week), which is the lowest second weekend drop of any film in China of 2015.

"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet {{here for}} the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee {{something}} of the thought which has suddenly risen before me <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".|$|E
