40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Presentation date: 1983 - 04 - 28 Three skyline {{carriage}} {{types are}} analyzed {{on the basis}} of their operating characteristics and limitations. Their effect on productivity is expressed as cubic feet per hour yarded to the landing. These carriage types, tested as part of Oregon State University's School of Forestry Smallwood Harvesting Research Program represent those which are especially suited to thinning smallwood stands. The three types are distinguished by their clamping mechanisms: 1) skyline stop 2) self-clamping hydraulic and 3) self-clamping mechanical. The clamping mechanism is the means by which the carriage is secured to the skyline during the lateral inhaul element of the yarding cycle. Since data from the individual studies are not all comprehensive, five carriage studies are used for the analysis of the three carriage types. The Maki and Christy carriages represent the skyline stop carriages. The Koller 1. 0 and 2. 5 carriages represent the self-clamping hydraulic carriages and the Wyssen 2. 5 represents the self-clamping - mechanical carriages. The operating characteristics which proved to be most important are the ability to throw slack in the mainline, adaptability for use with sliding chokers, spotting ability and carriage delays. The skyline stop carriages tend to throw slack in the mainline when they hit the skyline stop at the end of outhaul (which aids in the lateral outhaul of the mainline). The Koller carriages, representing the self-clamping hydraulic carriages, cannot be used with sliding chokers without modification, since the <b>load</b> <b>hook</b> is part of the release mechanism. This effect, along with the effect of throwing slack, was not quantified. The Wyssen carriage was observed as having a greater capacity to be spotted at an exact location on the skyline for the lateral yarding sequence than any of the other carriages. This resulted in a lead angle standard deviation of only 17. 7 degrees. A similar standard deviation of 16 degrees was observed for the Koller 1. 0. The Christy carriage resulted in a larger standard deviation of 24 degrees. Lead angle data was not available for the Maki and Koller 2. 5 carriages. The importance of spotting is that either the logs can be yarded laterally to lead or the best extraction path can be choosen for a turn. Both of these advantages serve to reduce resets and minimize stand damage. Carriage delay analysis indicated very little difference between the time required to move the skyline stop calculated on a per turn basis and the time required for the self-clamping carriages to cycle every turn. With operational delays added in, the carriage delays for the skyline stop carriages is 0. 2678 minutes per turn and for the self-clamp mechanical is 0. 2625 minutes per turn. This information was not available for the self-clamping hydraulic carriages, but is probably greater than the self-clamping mechanical type and may be greater than the skyline stop type. The three carriage types were compared on a productivity basis. No conclusive differences were found since factors not accounted for in the individual studies tended to mask the affects of the different carriage types. The differences in productivity due to carriage types appear to be small in comparison to such factors as crew selection, stand conditions and site conditions...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringIn {{the recent}} years, {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} and production are being carried out in extremely harsh and challenging environmental conditions. Hence, accurate prediction of the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> is essential in order to minimise the Non- Productive Time (NPT) during the drilling operation stages. With accurate prediction of <b>hook</b> <b>load,</b> undesirable drilling problems such as buckling, stuck pipe, tensile failure can be minimised if not completely eradicated. There are numerous factors affecting the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction such as, the weight per unit length (W/l) of the drill pipe used, the density of the drilling mud used, the friction in the well, the weight per unit length (W/l) of the drilling line used, just to mention but a few. These above factors will not be discussed in-depth in this thesis but rather this thesis aims at developing a mathematical model to incorporate into the existing models, the effect of acceleration on <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction. There are numerous <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction models in {{the oil and gas industry}} such as the industry accepted <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction model, the Luke and Juvkam-Wold <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction model and the Cayeux et al <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction model. The rationale behind this thesis is to understand these existing <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction models and further develop them by incorporating the effect of acceleration. These existing models gives a good prediction of the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> measurements but the accuracy can be improved by taking into account that the efficiency of each sheave might not be same and also taking into consideration the effect of acceleration. The extended models will be analysed using hypothetical data. After analysing the extended models using the hypothetical data, it was discovered that during non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment the sum of the tensions in the supporting lines are not the same as the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> (W). Hence, the position for the load cell placement is very essential to ensure accurate <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> measurement. 	During hoisting with non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment, the sum of the tensions in the supporting lines always exceeds the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> (W) value with the discrepancy between them being influenced by the acceleration (a) of the travelling equipment. 	Hence, the minimum expected <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> (W) value during hoisting is during non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment with high a/g ratio and vice-versa. 	During lowering with non-uniform movement of the travelling equipment, the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> (W) measurement always exceeds the sum of the tensions in the supporting lines with the disparity between them also influenced by the acceleration (a) of the travelling equipment. 	Hence, the maximum <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> (W) measurement during lowering occurs when the travelling equipment is undergoing non-uniform movement with high a/g ratio and vice-versa. 	Finally, it was observed that even though the dead line is non-rotating, its efficiency is not perfect(e_dl≠ 1). The efficiency of each sheave from the extended Cayeux et al <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction model was used as an input for the extended Luke and Juvkam model. It was observed that the extended Cayeux et al <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction model (which served as the experimental data) produces approximately the same results as the rotating (Active) dead line sheave <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> prediction model but deviates from the non-rotating (inactive) dead line sheave counterpart. The degree of the deviation depends on the coefficient of friction (the efficiency of each sheave). Hence, it can be inferred that the dead line sheave is not perfect. This can be confirmed with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{analyzed}} <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> {{data from}} well G- 45 in Calispera C describing a tripping operation. The {{purpose of the}} analysis has been to identify and analyze non-ideal <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> behavior representing non-ideal borehole conditions. Certain borehole problems will affect the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signal and this makes the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signal a diagnostic tool {{in the evaluation of}} borehole problems. The ambition has been to develop borehole diagnostic tools applicable to <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signals. To introduce a source of verification for the real data a drag model based on well G- 45 was built. This model was built upon information provided describing specifications of well G- 45, such as the borehole trajectory, drilling fluid density and bottom hole assembly. The model was designed so that it could generate <b>hook</b> <b>loads</b> for different bit depths and different operations, such as for example RIH or POOH. Comparisons of the real <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> data to the predictions generated by the model indicated a relation between the two. This correspondence provided a degree of verification of the model and enabled the model {{to be used in the}} identification process of non-ideal <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> behavior. Four distinct non-ideal <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> behaviors in the data were identified and evaluated; startup peaks, fluctuations, kinetic increases and kinetic peaks. Non-ideal features of the startup peaks were detected when several <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> sections containing startup peaks were compared. It became evident that the startup magnitudes varied in a manner ideal borehole conditions would not dictate, the reason for this was attributed to variations in the coefficient of static friction. The fluctuation of numerous kinetic <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> sections with similar fluctuation ranges was found to partially correlate to the acceleration of the block. The origin of the acceleration of the block originates both from non-ideal heterogeneities in the coefficients of kinetic friction along the borehole walls and limitations in the ability of the hoisting system to maintain a constant velocity of the block. The reason why only partial correspondence between the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signal and block acceleration was detected was also investigated. The origins of non-ideal <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> increases and peaks were not identified, however the ability of these phenomena to introduce threats to the overall tripping operation initiated the introduction of type curves. Type curves identify the characteristics of specific non-ideal <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> phenomena by describing the development of the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> with respect to time and the development of the pseudo coefficient of friction with respect to measured bit depth. Type curves were initially introduced by Cardoso (1994), and this can be seen as a continuation of this work. Type curves were not introduced to the non-ideal <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> fluctuations since they pose no immediate threat to the overall tripping operation. Type curves for start up peaks already exist. The process of establishing type curves for specific non-ideal borehole phenomenon enables the characteristics of these non-ideal <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> behaviors to be universally accessible. The type curves established in this thesis can be made applicable as borehole diagnostic tools for real-time and/or historical <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signals from drilling operations. Data processing methods were also investigated and evaluated based on their application to drilling data. Wavelet filter banks based on the correct wavelet domain have the ability to increase the transmission efficiency of drilling data through optimizing the representation of transients and steady states intervals in the data streams. Wavelet filter banks can also be tuned to detect and remove outliers and noise in the data. Further research is required to investigate the implementation of wavelet filter banks to drilling data. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} growing demand for energy, the {{petroleum}} industry is looking in places previously thought to be unreachable. The continued search is causing {{the oil and gas}} industry to drill more advanced wells than ever. With the increased challenges of drilling, non-productive time (NPT) is a rising concern for the industry. During drilling, NPT annually amounts to as much as 35 % of the costs of the operation. Therefore, identifying and understanding variations in the drilling parameters during drilling operations is important. Recognizing well signals and signatures will enable early problem detection, thereby reduce NPT, and enhance safety. This thesis concentrates on initial investigations into <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> variations during tripping out of hole and thereafter make a laboratory model for <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> simulation. This in order to contribute to the understanding of the signals given by variations in <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> values. A <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> rig is developed based on the theory presented and previous <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> models built at NTNU. The apparatus consisted of elements representing the drilling rig hoisting system, low-pressure mud circulation system, the drillstring including bottom hole assembly, the borehole and relevant controls and instrumentation. Detailed procedures for use of the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> rig are established and presented. A program to monitor and control the experiments was made in LabVIEW. The model encompasses large pulling force capacity and safety features to safeguard its operation, as well as flexibility with respect to key parameter variations. Several experiments have been performed in the laboratory order to qualify the rig. Tests with restrictions and without restrictions were conducted in order to identify <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signatures. Issues, such as frequency disturbances were investigated and largely resolved. The results presented in this thesis have identified curves resembling real-time drilling data for normal <b>hook</b> <b>load,</b> cuttings accumulation, and for moving past an obstacle by laboratory simulations. In its current state, the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> rig provides for a solid foundation for further testing and experiments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringAs {{more oil}} blocks get {{explored}} for, {{the search and}} drilling for oil has become more daunting today, than ever before. Explorers and drillers have {{had to deal with}} harsh conditions of temperature, pressure, and more complex reservoir structures. Drilling wells, whether exploration or production, have also faced more challenges due to the daunting task of newer locations for oil and gas resources. The cost of wells, the time to drill, etc. have all seen an upward spiral in recent times. One of the key parameters that greatly influences drilling efficiency, which directly impacts time and cost, is the <b>hook</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> is measured using weight indicators which could be placed at various locations on the drilling rig. The accurate measurements of these <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> readings have been intensely researched, with the work of Luke and Juvkam being central to most of these research works. The main pre-occupation of this thesis work was to investigate the effect of other factors on the <b>hook</b> <b>load.</b> Factors such as the weight per unit length of the drill line, dolly retraction, and mud hose and top-drive umbilicals have been modelled, and experiments carried out. These experiments have rightly confirmed that these factors have some effect on the overall <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> that is measured by the sensor at the dead line. It has thus become obvious that the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> that is measured is not only dependent on the weight of the drill string in the well being drilled, but other often neglected systems of the drilling rig have effect on it, somewhat. In order to validate the model that was arrived at as a correction to the already existing model, experiments were carried out on a highly accurate basis. These experiments have confirmed what was arrived at with the model...|$|R
40|$|Wells {{that are}} drilled today are {{becoming}} {{deeper and more}} complex, and actions to make these wells economically justifiable are desired by oil companies. One method {{is to reduce the}} non-productive time during drilling by analysing the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> response to restrictions in the well. The goal is to recognize abnormal behavior as early as possible to prevent stuck pipe or other incidents that may lead to non-productive time. In present thesis a mathematical model for simulating <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> during normal tripping conditions is made. The model is based on theory about forces acting in the borehole, and properties of the drill string and the wellbore are inserted into it. The goal is to make good <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> simulations for simple tripping conditions, as restrictions most often cause problems during tripping operations. If restrictions were to occur, the changes in <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> during tripping would be identified quickly, and remedies can be started early. A laboratory that simulates tripping out of a nearly horizontal well is buildt and experiments are done. The laboratory experiments are carried out with and without mud flow, to identify also the forces that depends on mud circulation. Washout has been imitated in order to see how restrictions affect the <b>hook</b> <b>load.</b> The model consists of mathematical equations that describe all forces acting on the drill string. The laboratory results were used to adjust the equations, so they match <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> behavior even better. From comparison with the laboratory results {{it was found that the}} model creates accurate <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> simulations under simple conditions. Simulations with mud flow during tripping were inaccurate because the forces that occur during circulation were poorly mathematically described in the model. It is not possible to run real time drilling data in the model to see if the model is realistic because block position measurements are missing and some measurement rates are too low, so the equations in the model is not general enough. With improved position measurements and following adjustments in the model, it is likely that the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> behavior model could be used to reduce the non-productive time during drilling. </p...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in drilling operations occur during tripping out of the well. Inside the well there are often restrictions making it difficult or impossible {{to pull out the}} drill string including its bottom hole assembly, especially in extended reach wells. The consequences of not recognizing the problem in time could be a deformed drill string, or worse, a severed drill string. By understanding the causes of the problems it becomes easier to deal with them. The focus in the present work was on the initial <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> peak showing up during tripping operations in horizontal wells. The major part of the work was put into the building of a custom designed laboratory environment that simulated tripping operations. The work was based on previous work on the subject. The <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> was measured by tension meters and recorded with a custom designed program created in a computer software; LabView. The <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> was also modelled mathematically to be able to compare theoretical results with the laboratory results as well as with field data. The experiments were performed with variables like drill string elasticity, velocity and wellbore wall surface. The laboratory design was also created for future development to better understand the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> during tripping operations. The model lacked initial elastic condition data, which made it impossible to properly simulate the laboratory tripping operation.

40|$|Downhole {{restrictions}} are causing non-productive time, which represents large economic losses. Knowing {{the cause of}} the restriction in order to implement the correct remedies are crucial for preventing extensive cleaning activities or even stuck pipe. Using the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signal to find special signatures for the different causes of restriction could be a solution to quick recognition of restriction type. In the wells studied it was found 22 cases of restriction, which could be divided into 5 main groups of causes; unstable wellbore, ledges, cuttings accumulation, differential sticking and local dogleg. One incident from each group was chosen for an extensive post-event analysis for the purpose of strengthening the hypothesis of the cause. The results from the study has shown that it was necessary to simplify the analysis in to two main types of <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> restriction signatures; fixed and moveable. For the physical interpretation of the two signatures, fixed and moveable, <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signals from ledge and cuttings bed were used respectively. These were assumed to be good representatives for the two main types, and the signals proved to coincide with the physical explanation valid for them. The two groups were created based on the clear differences in the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signals between ledges and cuttings accumulation visible in the post-event analysis. Both of these causes of restriction have a very clear physical explanation; when the drill string encounters a ledge it will stop moving and is thereby fixed to one position in the well. On the other hand, cuttings downhole is moveable and is able to move along with the drill string. It became clear that dividing signatures into groups based on causes of restrictions was not {{the best way to do}} it, but rather divide it into groups based on physical explanation such as fixed and moveable. From that point on causes of {{restrictions are}} related to one or two of the two main groups. The goal of distinguishing <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signals from different causes of restrictions was reached to some extent. It was found that by recognizing if the restriction was fixed or moveable by looking at the <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> signal, 4 out of 5 causes of restrictions were distinguishable. This was possible because unstable wellbore was recognized by including both fixed and moveable restrictions and differential sticking was recognized by occurring at the beginning of a stand pulled. </p...|$|R

40|$|Drilling {{optimization}} {{is important}} for drilling companies {{in order to be}} cost effective and competitive. Using correct weight on bit (WOB) is a part of drilling optimization to achieve the optimal rate of penetration (ROP) for the given drilling situation. Whereas too low WOB might result in low ROP, too high WOB can result in a damaged drill bit. It is therefore important to be able measure or calculate the actual WOB precisely to avoid the mentioned scenarios. The main goal of this project was to develop two alternative WOB agents that use real time drilling data (RTDD) such as <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> (HKL), measured bit depth (DBTM), measured hole depth (DMEA) and rotation of the drill string (RPM) as input to calculate WOB. The first agent alternative uses the difference in HKL when rotating off-bottom and when rotating on-bottom to calculate WOB. The weight of the drill string is calculated in the second alternative, and iterations with different WOB values are performed until the calculated <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> matches the measured HKL with a small margin. Both agent alternatives performed well when testing them with RTDD from drilling of the 17 &# 189; inch section of the Gullveig K- 4 AH well. The author believes that both the alternatives periodically perform better than the WOB model by Schlumberger when testing on the RTDD. The second agent alternative gives similar WOB results as WELLPAN when not circulating. However, when circulating, the results deviate. This might indicate that the viscous force model used in the second alternative needs adjustments to improve the accuracy. Given normal well conditions, the change in total <b>hook</b> <b>load</b> (THKL) when running in hole (RIH), equals the extra weight of the drill string due to increased length of the drill string. The author believes that by adding this extra weight to the current THKL reading in-between THKL measurements, the first alternative will give the most accurate WOB calculations of the two. In order to validate the accuracy of the two WOB agent alternatives, comparison with measured downhole WOB data is necessary. Unfortunately, this type of data was not available during the work of present thesis. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{this period}} of controversy, the group reconvened in San Francisco in January 1971 with jazz writer/saxophonist Don Heckman serving as their producer. With Dave Bargeron {{replacing}} Jerry Hyman, they recorded material that would {{form the basis of}} their fourth album, BS&T 4 (June 1971). For {{the first time since the}} first album, Blood, Sweat & Tears presented a repertoire of songs composed almost entirely from within the group. Also included on the album is a cover of former member Al Kooper's [...] "Holy John (John The Baptist)". <b>Loaded</b> with <b>hooks</b> and a wide variety of moods (featuring such songs as [...] "Go Down Gamblin'", [...] "Lisa, Listen To Me", [...] "High on a Mountain", [...] "Redemption"), BS&T 4 broke into the album charts, resulting in a gold record for the group. Unfortunately, none of the singles from the album managed to land in the Top 30 on any of the singles charts, and the period after the release of the fourth album began the group's commercial decline.|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringIn {{this thesis}} work, a {{simulation}} and monitoring study was carried based on operational {{data obtained from}} two wells. These are South Sangu- 4 and Sangu- 11, which are situated in block 16. From the study it was found out that: Comparing the simulation data and real time data, the tripping in and tripping out coefficient of friction were back calculated. The coefficient of frictions derived from Sangu- 4 were used for planning of drilling in Sangu- 11. Calculating the Friction factor ratio on South Sangu- 4, it shows an indication of Pack off around 3000 m (MD) to 3500 m (MD). And eventually the well (South sangu 4) took a kick at the depth of 3486 m (MD). No real time Torque and Drag monitoring was done there. Getting {{the idea of the}} FF of that block 16, a simulation of drill string stresses, <b>Hook</b> <b>Load</b> and Torque was carried out based on the planned survey data. From the study, {{it was found that the}} Torque at higher Friction Factor will cross the limit of make-up torque which may cause the failure of the drill string. Based on the simulation the real time <b>Hook</b> <b>Load</b> and Torque data were monitored. The monitoring results investigated indication of higher Torque in real time for which Lubricant was added in the mud to reduce the Torque in safe limit. One most important observation in 8. 5 ’’ section was that the non-rotating protectors were not effectively reducing the Torque. Rather the use of lubricant controls the Torque in desired limi...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this innovation was to ease, minimise the working time at chair side by <b>loading</b> the crimpable <b>hook</b> for retraction/protraction/any other clinical situation demanding placement of the crimpable hook when the archwire is in position. For the same reason a plier routinely used which can be modified to suit the above purpose was thought off. This innovative plier serves dual purpose. As it is a modified distal end cutter, there is an added feature of crimping the hook to the arch wire apart from serving the basic purpose of cutting the distal end. Thus saves time at chairside. The innovative FAS *twin function plier has a high efficiency, ease of use, is economic, for distal end cutting of the arch wire...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{data on the}} {{mechanical}} performance of upper-limb prostheses are very important in prostheses development and selection. The primary goal {{of this study was}} to objectively evaluate {{the mechanical}} performance of adult-size voluntary opening (VO) prosthetic terminal devices and select the best tested device. A second goal was to see whether VO devices have improved in the last two decades. Nine devices (four hooks and five hands) were quantitatively tested (Hosmer model 5 XA hook, Hosmer Sierra 2 <b>Load</b> VO <b>hook,</b> RSL Steeper Carbon Gripper, Otto Bock model 10 A 60 hook, Becker Imperial hand, Hosmer Sierra VO hand, Hosmer Soft VO hand, RSL Steeper VO hand, Otto Bock VO hand). We measured the pinch forces, activation forces, cable displacements, mass, and opening span and calculated the work and hysteresis. We compared the results with data from 1987. Hooks required lower activation forces and delivered higher pinch forces than hands. The activation forces of several devices were very high. The pinch forces of all tested hands were too low. The Hosmer model 5 XA hook with three bands was the best tested hook. The Hosmer Sierra VO hand was the best tested hand. We found no improvements in VO devices compared with the data from 1987.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the proposed method is to evaluate the current conditions of the drilling system and suggest modifying values of main drilling control parameters to optimize {{the efficiency of the}} drilling in whole, while reducing the probability of premature wear of the drill bit. Method is realized with the drilling components (e. g., surface equipment, drillstring, drill bit, mud, etc.), as well as the formation being drilled. Drilling control parameters include both the parameters adjustable in real-time, such as <b>hook</b> <b>load,</b> RPM, or mud flow rate, as well as those that can be modified with some delay for maximal use of deep equipment resource. We believe that the proposed methodology opens new opportunities for real-time drilling optimization that can be efficiently implemented within the scope of the existing drilling practice...|$|R
30|$|It is {{with this}} in mind that all thought of {{concluding}} with a 3 -D representation of all three when they are quite readily available through the microscope’s own image-ware is not economical. Instead, a single sample is included that is to scale and leads to the following development of the design for the purposes of manufacture and testing. It is noted here that all the sundry tests have been carried out through the Solidworks software itself such as FEA, but we do not know the true directions from which forces are applied when considering analysis of the <b>hook.</b> A point <b>load</b> seems inappropriate as does a limited forcing being applied through the length of the shaft in sheer. It should be under pressure throughout, not as it seems here, as the cross-stresses are prevalent throughout the real-life <b>loading</b> of the <b>hook.</b>|$|R
