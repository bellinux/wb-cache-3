5|$|In {{order to}} be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly, to acclimatise them during the process, and to allow more {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942.

5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to <b>leave,</b> <b>after</b> a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E

They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
