50|$|Firestar {{continues}} {{her education}} while engaging in super heroics part-time. In her one-shot issue, {{she is wearing}} a <b>long-haired</b> <b>red</b> wig as her natural hair has not grown back yet.|$|R
50|$|Breed {{standards}} {{allow for}} one or more body spots {{as long as there}} is no more than 20% colour and the cat does not give the appearance of a bicolour. A few random spots are acceptable, but they should not detract from the pattern. The rest of the cat is white. Although <b>red</b> <b>tabby</b> and white is the classic van colour, the colour on a Van's head and tail can be one of the following: red, cream, black, blue, <b>red</b> <b>tabby,</b> cream tabby, brown tabby, blue tabby, tortoiseshell, dilute tortoiseshell (also known as blue-cream), brown-patched tabby, blue-patched tabby and any other colour not showing evidence of crossbreeding with the point-coloured breeds (Siamese, Himalayan, etc.). Not all registries recognise all of these colour variations.|$|R
5000|$|... 1959: California Rex (Marcel Cat). A rex-coated {{tortoiseshell}} female called [...] "Mystery Lady of Rodell" [...] and her rex-coated <b>red</b> <b>tabby</b> {{son were}} bred together {{and resulted in}} further curly-furred semi-longhair cats. Test-mating found this to be compatible with the Cornish Rex so the Marcel Cat was used to expand the gene pool of Cornish Rexes in the USA ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s a {{spontaneous}} mutation in <b>red</b> and <b>red</b> <b>tabby</b> Persians {{gave rise to}} the [...] "peke-faced" [...] Persian, named after the flat-faced Pekingese dog. It was registered as a distinct breed in the CFA, but fell out of favor by the mid-1990s due to serious health issues; only 98 were registered between 1958 and 1995. Despite this, breeders took a liking to the look and started breeding towards the peke-face look. The over-accentuation of the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called extreme- or ultra-typing) produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians. The term peke-face has been used to refer to the ultra-typed Persian but it is properly used only to refer to <b>red</b> and <b>red</b> <b>tabby</b> Persians bearing the mutation. Many fanciers and CFA judges considered the shift in look [...] "a contribution to the breed."In 1958, breeder and author P. M. Soderberg wrote in Pedigree Cats, Their Varieties, breeding and Exhibition"Perhaps in recent times there has been a tendency to over-accentuate this type of short face, with the result that a few of the cats seen at shows have faces which present a peke-like appearance. This is a type of face which is definitely recognized in the United States, and helps to form a special group within the show classification for the Persian breed. There are certainly disadvantages when the face has become too short, for this exaggeration of type is inclined to produce a deformity of the tear ducts, and running eyes may be the result. A cat with running eyes will never look at its best because in time the fur {{on each side of the}} nose becomes stained, and thus detracts from the general appearance ... The nose should be short, but perhaps a plea may be made here that the nose is better if it is not too short and at the same time uptilted. A nose of this type creates an impression of grotesqueness which is not really attractive, and there is always a danger of running eyes." ...|$|R
50|$|Recognized point colours are seal, chocolate, blue, lilac (a softer silver-grey), <b>red,</b> or cream. <b>Tabby</b> and tortie {{variations}} in seal, chocolate, blue or lilac are also allowed; other colours are in development.|$|R
50|$|The galls of {{the rose}} gall wasp (Diplolepis rosae) are also {{distinctive}} and are known as bedeguars or robin's pincushions. These are found on the shoots of dog roses and have a length of up to 5 cm with <b>red,</b> <b>long-haired</b> outgrowths. Inside the galls are several chambers, which may be occupied by larvae.|$|R
60|$|As he rode {{around a}} corner of the stone house his horse snorted and stopped. A lean, shaggy pony jumped at sight of him, almost {{displacing}} a <b>red</b> <b>long-haired</b> blanket that covered an Indian saddle. Quick thuds of hoofs in sand drew Shefford's attention to a corral made of peeled poles, and here he saw another pony.|$|R
5000|$|Like other rexes, {{all colors}} and {{patterns}} are acceptable, although <b>tabbies,</b> <b>reds</b> and torties are quite common {{due to their}} origins. Also the unusual colors {{from the early days}} of the breed have been selected for, so lilac, chocolate and colorpoints are popular. Newer varieties such as ticked tabbies, shadeds and darker points are also being bred.|$|R
5000|$|Tyris is {{the protagonist}} of Golden Axe: Beast Rider, wherein the {{developer}} Secret Level said {{the focus was on}} her reimagining. In this game, she is a [...] "half-gladiator/half-barbarian" [...] defender of the Axirian Priestesses, a female sect worshipping the Great Dragon in the Island of Axir. After the sisterhood is wiped out by Death Adder's forces, she takes up sword and sorcery to avenge them and stop him from taking over the world. She is depicted as a <b>long-haired</b> in skimpy <b>red</b> or red-and-white costumes and various hair colors. She has darker skin, shorter red hair, and white warpaint around her green eyes, and wears several different tribal-like outfits throughout the game, depending on which stage she is in, which are unlocked and can be used in other stages.|$|R
60|$|Another instance, {{more to the}} point, {{occurred}} at my own house on the pampas, and I {{was one of several}} persons who witnessed it. A small, <b>red,</b> <b>long-haired</b> bitch--a variety of the common native cur--gave birth to four or five pups. A peon was told to destroy them, and, waiting until the bitch was out of sight, he carried them off {{to the end of the}} orchard, some 400 or 500 yards from the house, and threw them into a pool of water which was only two to three feet deep. The bitch passed the rest of the day in rushing frantically about, searching for her young, and in the evening, a little after dark, actually succeeded in finding them, although they were lying at the bottom of the pool. She got them all out, and carried them, one by one, to another part of the grounds, where she passed the night with them, uttering at intervals the most piercing cries. In the morning she carried them to still another spot, where there was a soft mould, and then dug a hole large and deep enough to bury them all, covering them over with the loose earth. Her task done, she returned to the house to sleep all day, but when night came again the whole piteous performance was repeated: the pups were dug up, and she passed the long, piercingly cold night--for it was in the depth of winter--trying to keep them warm, and uttering, as before, distressing cries. Yet a third time the whole thing was repeated; but after the third night, when the dog came home to sleep, the dead pups were taken out of the ground and buried at a distance.|$|R
