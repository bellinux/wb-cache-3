40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of <b>crossing</b> <b>legs</b> at the knee level on wave reflection, as {{measured}} by the augmentation index. METHODS: Forty-two participants <b>crossed</b> their <b>legs</b> at the knee level (popliteal fossa over the suprapatellar bursa) in the sitting position for 12 min. One trained investigator performed the measurements before, during, and after <b>leg</b> <b>crossing.</b> We used the SphygmoCor to measure the augmentation index at the radial artery and an oscillometric device to measure blood pressure (BP) at the upper arm. We calculated the differences between the uncrossed and the crossed position for the augmentation index normalized for heart rate, peripheral BP, and central BP. RESULTS: Both peripheral systolic BP 2. 5 +/- 6. 5 (mean +/- SD) mmHg (0. 5 - 4. 6) (95 % confidence interval) and peripheral diastolic BP 1. 7 +/- 3. 8 mmHg (0. 5 - 2. 9) increased during <b>leg</b> <b>crossing</b> compared with the uncrossed position. In addition, central systolic BP 2. 8 +/- 5. 8 (0. 9 - 4. 6) and central diastolic BP 1. 8 +/- 3. 9 (0. 5 - 3. 0) increased, whereas no significant change in the augmentation index was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the increase in BP during <b>leg</b> <b>crossing</b> cannot be explained by wave reflection. We found no change in the augmentation index during <b>leg</b> <b>crossing</b> at the knee level. Central BP and peripheral BP are equally influenced by <b>leg</b> <b>crossing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Vasovagal syncope is {{the most}} common cause of {{transient}} loss of consciousness, and recurrent vasovagal fainting has a profound impact on quality of life. Physical countermaneuvers are applied as a means of tertiary prevention but have so far only proven useful at the onset of a faint. This placebo-controlled crossover study tested the hypothesis that <b>leg</b> <b>crossing</b> increases orthostatic tolerance. Nine naïve healthy subjects [6 females, median age 25 yr (range 20 - 41 yr), mean body mass index 23 (SD 2) ] were subjected to passive head-up tilt combined with a graded lower body negative pressure challenge (20, 40, and 60 mmHg) determining orthostatic tolerance thrice, in randomized order: 1) control, 2) with <b>leg</b> <b>crossing,</b> and 3) with oral placebo. Blood pressure (Finometer), heart rate, and changes in thoracic blood volume (impedance), stroke volume, and cardiac output (Modelflow) were followed during orthostatic stress. Primary outcome was time to presyncope (systolic blood pressure /= 140 beats/min). With <b>leg</b> <b>crossing,</b> orthostatic tolerance increased from 26 +/- 2 to 34 +/- 2 min (placebo 23 +/- 3 min, P < 0. 001). During <b>leg</b> <b>crossing,</b> mean arterial pressure (81 vs. 81 mmHg) and cardiac output (95 vs. 94 % supine) remained unchanged; heart rate increase was lower (13 vs. 18 beats/min, P < 0. 05); stroke volume was higher (79 vs. 74 % supine, P < 0. 05); and there was a trend toward lower thoracic impedance. <b>Leg</b> <b>crossing</b> increases orthostatic tolerance in healthy human subjects.

40|$|Physical {{maneuvers}} can {{be applied}} to abort or delay an impending vasovagal faint. These countermaneuvers would be more beneficial if applied as a preventive measure. We hypothesized that, in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope, <b>leg</b> <b>crossing</b> produces a rise in cardiac output (CO) and thereby in blood pressure (BP) with an additional rise in BP by muscle tensing. We analyzed the age and gender effect on the BP response. To confirm that, during the maneuvers, Modelflow CO changes in proportion to actual CO, 10 healthy subjects performed the study protocol with CO evaluated simultaneously by Modelflow and by inert gas rebreathing. Changes in Modelflow CO were similar in direction and magnitude to inert gas rebreathing-determined CO changes. Eighty-eight patients diagnosed with vasovagal syncope applied <b>leg</b> <b>crossing</b> after a 5 -min freestanding period.

Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were measured continuously by Portapres.

Results show a significant increase in MAP (13 mmHg), stroke volume (27 %) and cardiac output (18 %), a significant decrease in heart rate (- 5 bpm) and no change in total peripheral resistance during the physical counter-manoeuvre when compared to baseline 70 o} HUT.
