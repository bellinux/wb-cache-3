50|$|The first System X unit {{to enter}} public service was in September 1980 and was {{installed}} in Baynard House, London and was a tandem junction unit which switched telephone calls amongst around 40 local exchanges. The first <b>local</b> <b>digital</b> <b>exchange</b> started operation in 1981 in Woodbridge, Suffolk (near BT's Research HQ at Martlesham Heath). The last electromechanical trunk exchange (in Thurso, Scotland) was closed in July 1990 - completing the UK's trunk network transition to purely digital operation and becoming the first national telephone system to achieve this. The last electromechanical local exchanges, Crawford, Crawfordjohn and Elvanfoot, all in Scotland, were changed over to digital on 23 June 1995 and the last electronic analogue exchanges, Selby, Yorkshire and Leigh on Sea, Essex were changed to digital on 11 March 1998.|$|E

50|$|The Makalapa <b>Local</b> <b>Digital</b> Message <b>Exchange</b> (LDMX) was {{activated}} in March 1973 by Vice Admiral G. C. Talle, Deputy CINCPACFLT. The system's activation {{marked a}} significant step forward by improving writer-to-reader speed of service, message formatting, routing indicator assignment, and message recall for CINCPACFLT. In September 1977, the NAVCOMMACTS Pearl Harbor was disestablished and NTCC Camp Smith, NTCC Makalapa, NTCC Pearl Harbor, Secure Voice, and Consolidated Maintenance became separate departments of NAVCOMMSTA Honolulu. Concurrently, NTCC Moanalua was disestablished and the communication functions were {{turned over to the}} Fleet Weather Center.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{service code}} {{are used to}} control various {{supplementary}} services offered by <b>digital</b> <b>local</b> <b>exchanges.</b> These services were first introduced as 'PhonePlus' in 1979 on {{the first generation of}} Alcatel E10 and Ericsson AXE <b>digital</b> <b>exchanges</b> used in Ireland and were rolled out nationally throughout the 1980s. These services are available on all Irish PSTN lines, regardless of operator. There is a more expansive range of services available, but these are the most commonly used. Different codes apply on cable telephony lines, such as those provided by Virgin Media Ireland and on VoIP providers.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedthis thesis represents {{the results of}} a study of the U. S. Naval Processing and Routing System (NAVCOMPARS). The system's development from preconception to present is described herein as well as a description of its hardware and software components. Additionally, the <b>Local</b> <b>Digital</b> Message <b>Exchange</b> (LDMX), is likewise described. The purpose of this thesis is to identify bottlenecks in message flow through NSVCOMPARS. In this attempt, the system was simulated in a functional manner by computer and various input distributions were applied. By doing so, the factors, events and situations contributing to bottlenecks in message processing are identified as fully as possible within the constraints of time and information availability.

50|$|The {{concentrator}} unit {{consists of}} four main sub-systems, line modules, digital concentrator switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the <b>digital</b> <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if connection to the DLE is lost.|$|R
50|$|The INTEGER Millennium House {{was also}} built {{with a variety}} of {{intelligent}} home automation technologies, including a building management system that could optimize the performance of the heating system, an automatic garden irrigation system that could sense soil humidity conditions and water accordingly, an intelligent security system, lighting that could be set to one of four predefined moods, and microchip-embedded programmable door keys. The house also featured advanced communication technologies such as a telephone service distributed via a <b>local</b> building <b>exchange,</b> <b>digital</b> satellite and terrestrial television available in every room, WebTV, and a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Digital</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> (DLE) {{connects to}} the {{concentrator}} and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Switching Subsystem (DSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function. To allow access to a large range of outgoing routes, individual Time Switches are connected to each other by a Space Switch. The Time Slot inter-connections are held in Switch Maps which are updated by Software running on the Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS).|$|R

50|$|The most novel {{part of the}} {{conception}} of the exchange design {{was the use of}} pulse amplitude modulation and time division multiplex techniques for the transmission of up to 100 conversations over a common channel, which was well ahead of its time. This technique would eventually be used in System X and other <b>digital</b> <b>exchanges</b> as technology caught up. Another interesting feature of the installation was the use of time-sharing in the setting-up of the calls and in their control, which was something that all subsequent <b>digital</b> <b>exchange</b> design would follow.|$|R
