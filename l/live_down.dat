25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if she was trying to <b>live</b> <b>down</b> the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E

During this time, Katharine Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984. Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the Post newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan {{accounted for more than}} 60% of the entire company revenue stream.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins have conquered most sea habitats, on an {{extremely}} {{wide range of}} depths. Some species, such as Cidaris abyssicola, can <b>live</b> <b>down</b> to several thousands of meters deep. Many genera are totally indentured to the abyssal zone, such as many cidaroids, most of the genera in the Echinothuriidae family, or the strange genus Dermechinus. One of the deepest-living family is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that live only in the hadal zone and have been collected as far as 6850 meters deep in the Java trench. Nevertheless, this makes sea urchin the class of echinoderms living the least deep, compared to sea cucumbers and crinoids that remain abundant below 8000m.|$|E

Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the people.'

The team (which included approximately 18 core members during development of NOLF) was determined not to make the same mistakes again with their next game. Describing the pressure on Monolith, Hubbard said that they [...] "were still trying to <b>live</b> <b>down</b> the stigma" [...] of their 1998 game, , which had been prematurely released buggy and unpolished, and that the company [...] "had a lot to prove, both to ourselves and the gaming public." ...|$|E

500|$|She also {{performed}} a disco-styled {{version of the}} song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The stage was decked in Mylar curtains and glittering disco balls. The performance began with a distorted voice claiming [...] "I'm gonna {{take you to a}} place you've never been before". Afterwards, Madonna descended from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants. Then her two back-up dancers appeared on the stage and the three women started singing the song together. The end of the performance was connected to the next song, [...] "Deeper and Deeper". According to Guilbert, Madonna was inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1932 film Blonde Venus for the performance. It was included on The Girlie Show – <b>Live</b> <b>Down</b> Under home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993, at Sydney, Australia. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was included in the military segment of the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, with the opening line altered to [...] "Come on boys!". She and her dancers were dressed in military gear and performed a rifle choreography, with Madonna acting as a sergeant. As Drew Sterwald from News Press noted, the song in its military version was talking about both personal love, as well as patriotic love. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the song was contravened as cynical, when Madonna sang the line, [...] "What you need is a big, strong hand/To lift you to your higher ground", and raised a rifle above her head. Author Dirk Timmerman pointed out that [...] "in the context of the show, with [...] performances like 'American Life' and 'Imagine', it added to the anti-war message of the tour." [...] In 2008, during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the request song in some of her shows, including the show at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E

Campus protesters singled him out in their placards and chants, and disrupted his classes. Fishel's notoriety and the strain of constantly defending his actions were speculated to have contributed to health problems, and he died in April 1977 at the age of 57.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{already been}} linked to his sister Adele on stage, Astaire was {{initially}} very reluctant {{to become part of}} another dance team.

I've just managed to <b>live</b> <b>down</b> one partnership and I don't want to be bothered with any more."

Sam resents Roy's interest in Cassidy, even acquiescing in the boy's brief jailing on a trumped-up charge, where he scolds him, [...] "I {{spent the better part}} of my life trying to <b>live</b> <b>down</b> the reputation that your hero has laid out for the Parker name and you grow up worshipping him."

2500|$|Colgate has ten {{residence}} halls {{located on}} its central campus, {{which is often}} referred to as [...] "up the hill."

2500|$|In late 2006, Scott {{announced}} {{a remake of}} the action thriller The Warriors (1979). [...] "The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically.

So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. They all said, 'Listen dude, if you get this on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, [...] "It's been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make <b>live</b> <b>down</b> there and smell it, touch it, feel it.

2500|$|Despite {{the release}} of {{intelligence}} information from the American and Israeli sources, {{the attack on the}} Syrian site was initially controversial. Some commentators had argued {{that at the time of}} the attack the site had no obvious barbed wire or air defenses that would normally ring a sensitive military facility. Mohammed ElBaradei had previously stated that Syria's ability to construct and run a complex nuclear process was doubtful—speaking ahead of the IAEA inspection of the alleged Syrian nuclear site, which has been demolished, he said: [...] "It is doubtful we will find anything there now, assuming there was anything in the first place." [...] The New York Times reported that after the publishing of US intelligence data on April 24, [...] "two senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the evidence had left them with no more than [...] "low confidence" [...] that Syria was preparing to build a nuclear weapon. However, while they said that there was no sign that Syria had built an operation to convert the spent fuel from the plant into weapons-grade plutonium, they had told President Bush last year that they could think of no other explanation for the reactor."

2500|$|Other reviewers {{were more}} critical. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said the film [...] "has a few {{segments}} that get beyond platitudes". He enjoyed the sequences that highlighted individual songs but noted the documentary [...] "doesn't {{have much in}} the way of full songs". Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times called From the Sky Down a [...] "procedural look" [...] at the album's inception. Although he enjoyed Bono's humorous insights, Zeitchik said that [...] "much of the movie is abstract, insider stuff about how he and others find inspiration". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter pointed out the limited scope of the film, calling it [...] "neither a comprehensive portrait nor one of those tossed-off featurettes that would be at home only as the filler for a commemorative Achtung Baby boxed set". Commenting on Guggenheim's filmmaking style, DeFore judged that some of his attempts to make the film more [...] "movie-ish" [...] failed to enhance the subject material. In the reviewer's opinion, this gave the [...] "impression of a filmmaker who can tell this story competently but isn't quite up to making a lasting film about one of rock history's most successful bands". Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, calling it [...] "occasionally enlightening but mostly frustrating". The review lamented the lack of coverage of most of the album's songs, and in Hyden's opinion, it was ironic that the band was trying to <b>live</b> <b>down</b> the [...] "ego-inflating" [...] Rattle and Hum in a film that he also considered [...] "ego-inflating".|$|E
