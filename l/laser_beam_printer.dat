A comparative analysis of {{the development of the}}ir respective diffusion trajectories was undertaken. The LBP developed along a successful trajectory coincident with optimal institutional maturity. However, the optical cards were developed in a trajectory which did not coincide with institutional maturity. This work demonstrates that the reason one case was successful and the other failed was a misinterpretation of institutional maturity in the target market for optical cards—the medical and welfare market. This marketplace and its related institutions differ from the consumer goods market because it is conservative and reluctant to accept technological innovation...|$|E
40|$|The market {{expectation}} to highspeed color {{laser printing}} technology is growing every year, and {{the boundary between}} large volume printing within offices and industrial printing is finally about to disappear. Big factors for such changes are 1. Rapid development of network environment, 2. Improvement of on-demand printing performances, realized by evolution of polymerization toner, related technologies and other technologies such as image-processing, 3. Improvement of color image quality, 4. Realistic prices and so on. From now on, more and more information will be digitalized, and when customers stick to output on paper, key points of customer requests would be that they can print on any type of paper, at high speed, with high quality and with high reliability, completed with a nice range of finishing procedures. Therefore, {{it will be important}} to further scale down toner particles, lower particle adhesion, and enable low-temperature fixing. In the high-speed color <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> <b>printer</b> domain, therefore, technologies with polymerization toner as a core technology will surely gain more importance...|$|E
