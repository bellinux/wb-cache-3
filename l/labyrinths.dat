5|$|Blaster Master has {{two modes}} of {{gameplay}} {{that depends on}} the situation and location of the player. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two–dimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of <b>labyrinths</b> in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E

5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The <b>Labyrinths</b> of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers {{wanted to create a}} game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to close}} {{proximity}} of the structures, vestibular lesioning often results in cochlear damage, which in turn results in hearing impairments. Hearing {{has been shown to}} affect place cell functioning, therefore, spatial deficits could be in part due to damage to the cochlea. However, animals with a removed eardrum (usually causing the inability to hear) and normal vestibular <b>labyrinths</b> perform significantly better than animals with eardrums and lesioning in the vestibular <b>labyrinths.</b> These findings suggest that disruption to hearing is not the primary cause of the observed spatial memory deficits.|$|E

25|$|The game {{comprises}} {{two main}} areas: Yasogami High School, {{and a number}} of <b>labyrinths.</b> In Yasogami High, the player can converse with characters, heal their party, develop items and equipment, and visit the Velvet Room where they can fuse new Personas. In <b>labyrinths,</b> the player's party explores while fighting enemies and finding treasures. As the player moves within the <b>labyrinths,</b> a map is filled out on the bottom screen, indicating how much of the labyrinth the player has explored; when a floor is fully explored, a treasure chest appears on that floor. The player also edits the map manually, drawing in the location of walls and adding icons representing landmarks, to make return trips easier. If a player does not want to map out the dungeons themselves, they can switch to an auto-mapping mode. The game features two types of enemies: Shadows, which appear randomly, and Fysis Oikein Eidolon (FOE), more challenging enemies that move about on the field as the player moves, which can be avoided with the right planning.|$|E

40|$|Rotordynamic and leakage {{data are}} {{presented}} for a see-through tooth-on-rotor (TOR) <b>labyrinth</b> seal with comparisons to a see-through tooth-on-stator (TOS) <b>labyrinth</b> seal. Measurements for both seals are also compared to predictions from XLLaby. Both seals have identical diameters {{and can be}} considered as relatively long <b>labyrinth</b> seals. The TOR seal has a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 62, whereas the TOS seal is longer and has a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 75. Both seals also differ by number of teeth, tooth height, and tooth cavity length. TOR <b>labyrinth</b> tests were carried out at an inlet pressure of 70 bar-a (1, 015 psia), pressure ratios of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6, rotor speeds up to 20, 200 rpm, a radial clearance of 0. 1 mm (4 mils), and three preswirl ratios. For comparison, TOS <b>labyrinth</b> tests were run at identical conditions as the TOR tests but for only one positive preswirl ratio. TOR <b>labyrinth</b> measurements show a pronounced dependence of rotordynamic coefficients on rotor speed, especially when compared to prior documented TOS <b>labyrinth</b> seal tests run at a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm (8 mils). The TOR <b>labyrinth</b> cross-coupled stiffness is higher in magnitude and increases at a higher rate for increasing speed than that of the TOS <b>labyrinth.</b> However, the TOR <b>labyrinth</b> effective damping was determined to be greater due to higher measurements of direct damping. Measured leakage rates for the TOR <b>labyrinth</b> were approximately 5 - 10 % less than the TOS <b>labyrinth.</b> XLLaby underpredicted the rotordynamic coefficients for both seals. However, as with measurements, it predicted the TOR <b>labyrinth</b> to have higher effective damping than the TOS <b>labyrinth...</b>|$|R
25|$|Several petroglyphic <b>labyrinths</b> {{have also}} been {{discovered}} in South West Britain. The best known of these are a neighbouring pair {{that have been found}} engraved onto a shale outcrop at Rocky Valley, Cornwall. Apparently incised using a metal implement, Nash suggested that the southern labyrinth had previously been engraved using a stone tool. Publicly revealed in 1948, {{it has been suggested that}} they are Bronze Age in date, due to similarities with Bronze Age petroglyphs in Galicia and Valcamonica. Conversely, many rock art researchers do not consider them to be prehistoric, with Saward arguing that they were created between the 16th and 18th-centuries, when the neighbouring Trewethett Mill was operational. As evidence, she noted that <b>labyrinths</b> were a popular motif in folk customs at the time, and that the good state of preservation would not be present if they had prehistoric origins.|$|E

25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal <b>labyrinths,</b> {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of <b>labyrinths,</b> also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} group eventually explores {{all four}} <b>labyrinths,</b> successfully unlocking the {{doors in the}} Velvet Room and restoring Zen's memories. He reveals that his true identity is the human avatar of Chronos, a manifestation of death created by the Collective Unconscious, and Rei is really a girl named Niko who died of illness twelve years prior. When Chronos came to escort her to the afterlife, he was intrigued by her descent into nihilism {{as a result of}} having lived an apparently meaningless life. Chronos created the alternate Yasogami High, split himself into Zen and a powerful being known as the Clockwork God, and sealed both of their memories {{in order to try to}} bring Rei happiness. The Clockwork God is the one responsible for trapping SEES and the Investigation Team in the alternate Yasogami, hoping for them to traverse the <b>labyrinths</b> and recover Zen's memories so they can merge and become Chronos once again: this would result in the teams being erased from time when their tasks were completed. The Clockwork God abducts Rei and transports her to the top of a clock tower outside the school. SEES and the Investigation Team decide to help Zen rescue Rei, and they ascend the tower and defeat the Clockwork God. After spending some carefree time together before the pocket dimension collapses, Zen and Rei vanish into the afterlife, while SEES and the Investigation Team promise to meet again someday and return home, although their memories of the incident are erased.|$|E
25|$|Varying {{vestibular}} system stimulation has {{an effect}} on place cells. The vestibular system, part of the labyrinth of the inner ear, {{plays an important role in}} spatial memory by tuning into self-motion such as acceleration. Bilateral lesions of the vestibular system in patients cause abnormal firing of hippocampal place cells as evidenced, in part, by difficulties with aforementioned spatial tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task. The dysfunction in spatial memory seen with damage to the vestibular system is lasting and possibly permanent, particularly if there is bilateral damage. For example, spatial memory deficits of patients with chronic vestibular loss is seen 5–10 years after a complete loss of the bilateral vestibular <b>labyrinths.</b>|$|E
