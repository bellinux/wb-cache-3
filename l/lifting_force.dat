25|$|The {{distance}} the insect falls between wingbeats {{depends on how}} rapidly its wings are beating. If the insect flaps its wings at a slow rate, the time interval during which the <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> is zero is longer, and therefore the insect falls farther than if its wings were beating rapidly. One can calculate the wingbeat frequency necessary for the insect to maintain a given stability in its amplitude. To simplify the calculations, one must assume that the <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> is at a finite constant value while the wings are moving down {{and that it is}} zero while the wings are moving up. During the time interval Δt of the upward wingbeat, the insect drops a distance h under the influence of gravity.|$|E

At around 14,000 metres vertical speed increased, reaching two meters per second at 13,400 meters. <b>Lifting</b> <b>force</b> of the remaining hydrogen reduced to 1300–1400 kilograms, while the balloon weighed an estimated 2,120 kilograms.|$|E

The <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> is calculated using a best estimate approach and the resultfrom the calculation should pass the existing <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> margin. <b>Lift</b> <b>force</b> margin isdefined {{so that the}} <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> may not exceed 80 % of the fuel weight. The margin issupposed {{to cover all the}} uncertainties that exist in the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> calculations. However, no uncertainty analysis has been conducted to quantify the uncertainties. In this report the uncertainties in the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> model have been quantified. Each inputparameter to the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> model which has been assumed to have an uncertainty isassigned a probability distribution. Through the Monte Carlo method and Wilk´smethod an uncertainty propagation has been performed at different points in thereactor´s power flow map. By using these two methods, uncertainty in input datahave been translated into uncertainty in output data. This study has investigated fuelfrom different companies. From the Monte Carlo and Wilk´s method the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> hasbeen calculated at various probabilities. By using these results, a <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> margin hasbeen calculated for each fuel type and at various probabilities. The results from the uncertainty propagation shows that the current <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> margincorresponds to approximately 95 % probability that lift doesn´t occur for all fueltypes.

40|$|Published version: [URL] audienceThe paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study of the}} forces experienced by a cylinder moving horizontally in a granular medium under gravity. Despite the symmetry of the object, a strong <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> is measured. Whereas the drag force increases linearly with depth, the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> is shown to saturate at depths {{much greater than the}} cylinder diameter, and to scale like the buoyancy with a large amplification factor of order 20. The origin of this high <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> is discussed based on the stress distribution measured in discrete numerical simulations. The <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> comes from the gravitational pressure gradient, which breaks the up/down symmetry and strongly modifies the flow around the obstacle compared to the case without pressure gradient...|$|R
25|$|Many insects can hover, or stay in {{one spot}} in the air, doing so by beating their wings rapidly. The ability to do so, though, is complex; {{requiring}} the use of sideways stabilization {{as well as the}} lift necessary to overcome the force of gravity. The <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> is caused by the downward stroke of the wings. As the wings push down on the surrounding air, the result reaction force of the air on the wings force the insect up. The wings of most insects are evolved so that, during the upward stroke, the force on the wing is small. Due {{to the fact that the}} upbeat and downbeat force the insect down and up respectively, the insect oscillates and winds up staying in the same position.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the object}} has broken {{free of the}} bottom, only the {{apparent}} weight remains, and a controlled lift requires a way of managing the sudden decrease {{of resistance to the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>force.</b> There are three basic ways this can be done: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the lift force on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow {{in the vicinity of the}} foil is known. [...] For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards <b>lifting</b> <b>force.</b> Whenever the distribution of speed past the top and bottom surfaces of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli's equations – established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight. Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster past the top of the wing and slower past the underside. See the article on aerodynamic lift for more info.|$|E

40|$|Hydrodynamic <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> offer a {{convenient}} way to manipulate particles in microfluidic applications, {{but there is}} little quantitative information on how non-inertial lift mechanisms act and compete with each other in the confined space of microfluidic channels. This paper reports measurements of <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> on nearly spherical drops and bubbles, with diameters from one quarter to one half of the width of the channel, flowing in microfluidic channels, under flow conditions characterized by particle capillary numbers CaP = 0. 0003 – 0. 3 and particle Reynolds numbers ReP = 0. 0001 – 0. 1. For CaP, 0. 01 and ReP, 0. 01 the measured <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> were much larger than predictions of deformation-induced and inertial <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> found in the literature, probably due to physicochemical hydrodynamic effects at the interface of drops and bubbles, such as the presence of surfactants. The measured forces could be fit with good accuracy using an empirical formula given herein. The empirical formula describes the power-law dependence of the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> on hydrodynamic parameters (velocity and viscosity of the carrier phase; sizes of channel and drop or bubble), and includes a numerical lift coefficient that depends on the fluids used.

2500|$|The Aerial Steamer, {{sometimes}} called the Moy-Shill Aerial Steamer, was an unmanned tandem wing aircraft driven by a 3hp (2.25kW) steam engine using methylated spirits as fuel. This drove a pair of six-bladed propellers placed between the two bamboo and stretched linen wings, of which the rear had a span of 14ft (4.27m) and an area of 64ft2 (5.9m2): the front wing was slightly smaller, with an area of 50ft2 (4.6m2). [...] A third smaller surface was mounted {{at the rear of}} the aircraft: this was adjustable for the purpose of altering the trim. [...] It was 14ft (4.27m) long and weighed about 216lb, (98kg) of which the engine accounted for 80lb (36kg), and ran on three wheels. [...] Moy's first set of propellers consisted of a number of individual wooden blades attached to the six spokes of the assembly, their pitch becoming finer the further they were from the hub: this arrangement was replaced by stretched fabric blades before the flight test. The propellers were fitted with a mechanism designed to alter the pitch of the blades as they rotated, so that the blades moving downwards were at a coarser pitch to provide a <b>lifting</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{reduction}} of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program. This guidance uses the <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> experienced by the aeroshell to [...] "fly out" [...] any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight. This is accomplished by a series of ejectable ballast masses consisting of two [...] tungsten weights that were jettisoned minutes before atmospheric entry. The lift vector was controlled by four sets of two reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that produced approximately [...] of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allowed the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone. Prior to parachute deployment the entry vehicle ejected more ballast mass consisting of six [...] tungsten weights such that the center of gravity offset was removed.|$|E

As we were in search of pure water, we did not wish to overlook any portion of the coast, and so after sounding and finding that we had ample depth, I ran the U-33 between head-lands into as pretty a landlocked harbor as sailormen could care to see, with good water right up to within a few yards of the shore. As we cruised slowly along, two of the boches again saw what they believed to be a man, or manlike creature, watching us from a fringe of trees a hundred yards inland, and shortly after we discovered the mouth of a small stream emptying into the bay: It was the first stream we had found since leaving the river, and I at once made preparations to test its water. To land, it would be necessary to run the U-33 close in to the shore, at least as close as we could, for even these waters were infested, though, not so thickly, by savage reptiles. I ordered sufficient water let into the diving-tanks to lower us about a foot, and then I ran the bow slowly toward the shore, confident that should we run aground, we still had sufficient <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> to free us when the water should be pumped out of the tanks; but the bow nosed its way gently into the reeds and touched the shore with the keel still clear.|$|E

40|$|We newly {{introduce}} <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> {{into the}} aerodynamics of dust grains in the protoplanetary disk. Although many authors {{have so far}} investigated {{the effects of the}} drag force, gravitational force and electric force on the dust grains, the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> has never been considered as a force exerted on the dust grains in the gas disk. If the grains are spinning and moving in the fluid, then the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> is exerted on them. We show in this paper that the dust grains can be continuously spinning due to the frequent collisions so that the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> continues to be exerted on them, which is valid in a certain parameter space where the grain size is larger than ~ 1 m and where the distance from the central star is larger than 1 AU for the minimum mass solar nebula. In addition, we estimate the effects of the force on the grain motion and obtain the result that the mean relative velocity between the grains due to the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> is comparable to the gas velocity in the Kepler rotational frame when the Stokes number and lift-drag ratio are both ~ 1. This estimation is performed under the assumptions of the steady state and the isotropic spin angular momentum.

40|$|Visual {{analysis}} {{of an object}} 2 ̆ 7 s size {{can be used to}} determine the <b>lifting</b> <b>forces</b> we program to lift the object so that the resulting movements achieve the goals of the <b>lift.</b> These <b>forces</b> are scaled or specified prior to the object moving, that is, before sensory feedback information about the object 2 ̆ 7 s weight is available. Sensorimotor memories are relied on to provide relevant information about an object 2 ̆ 7 s density and weight if the object was previously manipulated. It is well established that young adults accurately scale their forces based on visual size cues. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if old adults scale their forces to the size of the object or if they rely on sensorimotor memory of the previous object 2 ̆ 7 s weight. There are reports of impaired visuomotor programing for grasp and lift in old adults. In the present study old and young subjects were required to lift four different sized bottles of constant density from a force plate and then place the object on a shelf. Two experiments were performed. Experiment one featured blocks of lifts for three bottles in the following order: large, small and medium. Experiment two took place fifteen minutes after experiment one and featured a bottle slightly larger than the medium bottle used at the end of the experiment one. The second experiment addressed whether imperceptible changes in size cause changes in predictive force scaling. Peak load force rate in the first force pulse (prior to lift-off) was measured for each lift of the objects with the focus being on the initial and last lift of each bottle. Both experiments presented a significant effect for bottle size on <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rates. This result was found regardless of age. It provides additional support that young adults accurately scale their <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rate based on the visual size cues of the object. Old adults also demonstrated scaling of their <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rates based on bottle size which failed to support the hypothesis that old adults would merely reproduce their <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rates from the previous lift with a different object. While both young and old scale <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> to object size, the old demonstrated a trend for utilizing high <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rates throughout the experiment as well as greater differences in <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rate between the initial lift with an object and the final lift with the same object. Most subjects utilized a target strategy in which they produced a single peak <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rate pulse. This is indicative of a neural representation of the weight of the object being utilized to program the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rate. The remaining subjects exhibited a probing strategy that features several step-wise increases in <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> rate until the object is lifted off. This represents a more cautious approach to lifting novel objects. Our results indicate that old adults, much like young adults, are able to scale their forces based on visual size cues...|$|R
