To accomplish this, a <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear.|$|E

Six fatal crashes, including three hijackings, {{have resulted in a}} total of [...] occupant fatalities. [...] The airliner's first fatal crash, Lauda Air Flight 004, occurred near Bangkok on May 26, 1991, following the in-flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser on a 767-300ER; none of the 223 aboard survived; {{as a result of this}} accident all 767 thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented. [...] Investigators determined that an electronically controlled valve, common to late-model Boeing aircraft, was to blame. [...] A new <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> was installed on all affected jetliners, including 767s. [...] On October 31, 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990, a 767-300ER, crashed off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, in international waters killing all 217 people on board. [...] The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause to be due to a deliberate action by the first officer; Egypt disputed this conclusion. [...] On April 15, 2002, Air China Flight 129, a 767-200ER, crashed into a hill amid inclement weather while trying to land at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea. The crash resulted in the death of 129 of the 166 people on board, and the cause was attributed to pilot error.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1950s, {{large numbers}} of folding switchblade or {{automatic}} opening knives with locking blades were imported from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. [...] These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. [...] The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a long opposing false edge. [...] As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. [...] Most of these knives were designed with a <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> which locked the blade in the open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto blade profile, enabled the knife {{to be used as}} an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). [...] Though most switchblade stilettos used a single-edge blade equipped with a long false edge, many variations exist. [...] The stiletto switchblade is produced to this day in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic 'stiletto' or bayonet-style blade profile, including spring-assist, non-locking, and lock blade variants.|$|E

[...] In 1950, St. Joseph pediatrician and Baylor professor Allan Penny Bloxsom introduced the Bloxsom air <b>lock</b> <b>device</b> for the delivery room resuscitation and oxygenation of distressed newborns. Bloxsom recognized that infants born by C-section more often required resuscitation. He theorized that uterine contractions (absent in many babies born by C-section) helped to prepare a fetus for the task of breathing. His tube-like device created fluctuations in air pressure that simulated contractions of the uterus. The Bloxsom air <b>lock</b> <b>device</b> was utilized by over 700 hospitals by late 1952. Its use declined after a 1956 clinical trial showed {{that it did not}} improve outcomes over care in the standard incubator.|$|R
