40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Under certain South African conditions, Redglobe {{develops}} a colour {{that is too}} dark and thus unacceptable for the Far Eastern markets. These markets require a pink colour instead of a dark red colour. The cultivation of grapes with an acceptable colour involves amongst other, canopy management practices. This generally includes the removal of leaves and/or lateral shoots. Hereby, the leaf area and the microclimatic conditions in the canopy are altered. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the usefulness of leaf and <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal at different defoliation times after anthesis in order to obtain a pink coloured Redglobe crop. Other quality aspects, namely total soluble solids (TSS), total titratable acidity (TTA), berry mass and total yield, were also evaluated. A canopy management trial was conducted on six year old Redglobe vines with moderate vigour. The treatment design was a 2 x 3 x 4 factorial and involved two leaf removal (L) levels (L 0 = 0 % leaf removal; L 33 = 33 % leaf removal) in combination with three <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal (LS) levels (LS 0 = 0 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal; LS 50 = 50 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal; LS 100 = 100 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal). Four defoliation times (DT) were selected: 36 (pea berry size), 69 (véraison), 76 (one week after véraison) and 83 (two weeks after véraison) days after anthesis (DAA). A total of 24 treatment combinations, replicated in four blocks, were applied. Generally, treatment combinations involving 33 % leaf removal lowered the main shoot leaf area. Likewise, the <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> leaf area was decreased by increasing levels of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal at any defoliation time. As expected, 33 % leaf removal applied in combination with any level of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal, always resulted in a lower total vine leaf area compared to where 0 % leaf removal was part of the treatment combination. Compensation reactions occurred and in this regard the main shoot leaf size increased due to 33 % leaf removal applied at 1 week after véraison and 2 weeks after véraison. Treatment combinations involving <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal increased the ratio of main shoot leaf area to the total leaf area. On the other hand, the main shoot leaf area percentage was lowered by the application of 33 % leaf removal at 2 weeks after véraison compared to no leaf removal at the same defoliation time. It can therefore be assumed that the contribution of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> leaves to grape composition might have increased in cases where the main shoot leaf area was lowered at a later stage (e. g. 2 weeks after véraison). The bunches were visually evaluated and divided into classes from dark (class one) to light (class nine). This visual bunch evaluation showed that the mean bunch colour was in class three (lighter than class two) due to the defoliation time. The <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal x leaf removal interaction resulted in a mean bunch colour that was in classes 2 and 3. However, within these classes, there was a tendency that bunch colour decreased for defoliation times later than pea berry size. The <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal x leaf removal interactions showed that bunch colour was darker when the treatment combinations involved 0 % leaf removal. The percentage of bunches with the desired colour was increased by application of the treatments at véraison, compared to the other defoliation times, and also with 50 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal and 100 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal compared to 0 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal. Biochemical analyses confirmed that increased levels of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal generally lowered the anthocyanin concentration regardless of defoliation time. A similar effect on TSS was observed, i. e. from véraison onwards, the application of 50 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal and 100 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal tended to lower TSS. The effect of these levels of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal at véraison was significant. The role of the lateral shoots in colour development and sugar accumulation is therefore emphasized. Furthermore, the special role that lateral shoots also play in berry development is illustrated in that berry mass tended to decrease when 100 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal in combination with 33 % leaf removal and 100 % <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal in combination with 0 % leaf removal were applied at véraison. This, together with the positive relationship obtained between grape colour and the <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> leaf area:fruit mass ratio, accentuates the role of active leaf area during the ripening period. The possible effect of the microclimatic light environment on colour must also be considered. However, although the light intensity increased with increased levels of LS, the colour that was obtained was probably not associated with the differences in light intensity. It was found that it is possible to manipulate the colour of Redglobe grapes with defoliation treatments. However, the treatments that have a decreasing effect on grape colour also affected other quality parameters like TSS and berry size negatively. Although, it is possible to reduce the colour of Redglobe through the application of leaf and <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> removal at different defoliation times, the question arises whether the treatment combinations used in this study are worthwhile to pursue because the mean bunch colour that was obtained was still too dark. However, it was possible to increase the percentage of bunches with the desired colour. Therefore, if such treatments are applied, it must be approached cautiously, keeping in mind that assimilate supply has to be sustained throughout the ripening period...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of gerbera seedlings was {{studied in}} order to establish which factors determine flower yield and to see whether there are differences between the plants concerning their characteristics. The gerbera has a sympodial rhizome which forms 7 - 24 leaves before initiating a flower bud. This flower is formed by the apical meristem. Almost simultaneously a second flower bud develops in the axil of the uppermost leaf primordium while a vegetative axis develops in the axil of the second leaf primordium from the top. After a number of leaves (2 - 8; see Chapter 2) this axis forms a terminal flower bud, a lateral flower and again a vegetative continuation. The sympodium thus formed, has been regarded as the main stem. Shoots initiated in the lower leaf axils are called lateral shoots; these also show sympodial growth. Results of a one-year experiment with seedlings show a positive correlation (at flower initiation as well as after 1 year) between the number of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> and the number of leaves and flowers. No correlation was found, however, between leaf production and flower yield, although as the number of leaves increases the production of flower buds is promoted. This can be explained by flower bud abor tion: the more leaves, the higher the percentage of aborting flower buds. In order to investigate the influence of external factors on the plant characte ristics important for flower production, four different phaenotypes have been propagated vegetatively and subjected to treatments with different daylengths, light intensities and temperatures. I. DaylengthAll clones performed best at a daylength of 8 to 10 hours. Short day (8 hours) promotes flower yield as compared to long day (16 hours) because under short day conditions- the main axis shows earliest flowering and also the highest number of continua tions,- the highest number of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> are initiated and also form the highest amount of continuations,- these combined reactions of main axis and <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> result in optimum flower bud formation. Daylength does not seem to influence flower bud abortion. II. Light intensityHigh light intensity increases flower yield. This has been demonstrated in an experiment with high and low light intensities, as well as in all experiments carried out in autumn when the amount of natural light is diminishing. The reason is that under high light intensity conditions:- the highest number of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> are formed, with a high number of conti nuations,- consequently flower bud production is larger,- the highest flower bud abortion is found during the months with the lowest light intensity. In the experiment with different light intensities no difference in abortion ra te could be found, however. III. TemperatureLow temperature enhances all the effects caused by short day: more <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> are initiated and more shoots flower. Low temperature also causes less flower bud abortion than high temperature in this case. Under high light intensity conditions low temperature enhances the above mentioned effects by accelerated continuation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> as compared with high temperature. The reason for this pheno menon is the formation of less leaves per continuation at low temperature. All clones showed the same tendency in their reaction to daylength and light in tensity, although there were quantitative differences. With respect to the tem perature the clones behave differently: three of them prefer a low temperature, while the fourth prefers a high temperature. Main <b>shoot</b> and <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> influence eachother. When the main shoot is taken away, more <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> are formed; when the <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> are taken away, the main axis continues faster. However, neither treatment increases total flower yield. Again the four clones show the same tendency. but the rate of reaction varies. The stronger the apical dominance of the main axis, the stronger also the influence of the <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> on the main axis. Defoliation to various degrees serves no purpose, as this does not affect leaf, shoot or flower bud production, nor flower bud abortion, which means that there is no difference in flower yield. This held true for all clones...|$|R
40|$|Strigolactones are {{considered}} {{a new group of}} plant hormones. Their role as modulators of plant growth and signalling molecules for plant interactions first became evident in Arabidopsis, pea, and rice mutants that were flawed in strigolactone production, release, or perception. The first evidence in tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) of strigolactone deficiency is presented here. Sl-ORT 1, previously identified as resistant to the parasitic plant Orobanche, had lower levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus intraradices) colonization, possibly {{as a result of its}} reduced ability to induce mycorrhizal hyphal branching. Biochemical analysis of mutant root extracts suggested that it produces only minute amounts of two of the tomato strigolactones: solanacol and didehydro-orobanchol. Accordingly, the transcription level of a key enzyme (CCD 7) putatively involved in strigolactone synthesis in tomato was reduced in Sl-ORT 1 compared with the wild type (WT). Sl-ORT 1 shoots exhibited increased <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> branching, whereas exogenous application of the synthetic strigolactone GR 24 to the mutant restored the WT phenotype by reducing the number of lateral branches. Reduced <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> branching was also evident in grafted plants which included a WT interstock, which was grafted between the mutant rootstock and the scion. In roots of these grafted plants, the CCD 7 transcription level was not significantly induced, nor was mycorrhizal sensitivity restored. Hence, WT-interstock grafting, which restores mutant shoot morphology to WT, does not restore mutant root properties to WT. Characterization of the first tomato strigolactone-deficient mutant supports the putative general role of strigolactones as messengers of suppression of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> branching in a diversity of plant species...|$|E

The stimulation of ethylene production is correlated with the outgrowth of the lateral buds. The rise in ethylene production was concluded to induce <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> growth, because: (a) outgrowth of the shoots was blocked by preventing an increase in ethylene production, (b) 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), the natural precursor of ethylene biosynthesis, substituted for IAA in the promotion of ethylene production and lateral bud outgrowth. Although ACC could substitute for IAA, it could not substitute for BA; therefore, cytokinins are concluded to be essential for lateral bud outgrowth in vitro in Aechmea. These results suggest that cytokinins and ethylene both play roles in natural lateral bud initiation and that the cytokinin function involves two stages of the process...|$|E

In the backyards, for mats with no visible banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) symptoms, none of the analyzed mats with a total of 29 plants of “Yangambi Km 5 ” and of 35 plants of “Libanga Likale” tested ELISA positive, indicating the absence of the BBTV infection. However, for the severity levels of one to five, 32 to 63. 5 % of plants in the mats were ELISA positive for “Yangambi Km 5 ”, while 34. 9 to 73. 2 % of plants from “Libanga Likale” tested positive for BBTV.

40|$|A {{factorial}} design {{was used to}} vary leaf canopy structure of mature Pinot noir grapevines during two consecutive seasons: shoot tipping at full bloom (yes or no), <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> length (no laterals, laterals cut back to 4 leaves at full bloom, laterals allowed to grow undisturbed) and cluster zone leaf removal (leaf removal in the cluster zone or no leaf removal). Shoot tipping at bloom had the greatest effect on yield components, fruit composition, and vegetative growth. Tipping increased percent fruit set, berries per cluster, cluster weight, and yield to pruning ratio in both seasons. Shoot tip removal increased early shoot growth in the second season, main and lateral leaf size, and the contribution of lateral leaves to total leaf area. Tipping decreased the number of shoots per vine in the second season, clusters per vine in both seasons, must soluble solids, total amount of sugar exported with fruit harvest, leaf area per vine, pruning weight, and cane weight and length at mid-ripening. Increasing <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> length increased must soluble solids in both seasons and dormant cane diameter the following winter. Vines with long laterals had lower yield to pruning ratios in the first season. Percent fruit set increased only {{in the absence of}} vegetative growing tips, either from the main or from lateral shoots.

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana {{has nine}} genes that {{constitute}} {{a family of}} putative carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs). While {{five members of the}} family are believed to be involved in synthesis of the phytohormone abscisic acid, the functions of the other four enzymes are less clear.

In the wild type, the pattern of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> development depends on the developmental stage of the plant.

40|$|The {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in a nursery of sour cherry ‘Łutówka’ budded on Prunus mahaleb L. in the years 1993, 2000 – 2003, and 2013. The height of trees, the diameter of stems, {{and the length of}} <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> were measured. The air temperature and precipitation higher than the long-term mean (by approximately 10 % and 28 %, respectively) contributed to the increase in the stem diameter, the total length of shoots, and the number of shoots per tree. The length of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> increased {{from the top of the}} crown towards the lower parts, however, the number of feathers per tree and the mean length of shoots decreased. A strong positive relationship (r = 0. 74, P < 0. 05) was revealed between the stem diameter and the total length of shoots. Generally, the correlations between the type of growth of sour cherry maiden trees and morphological traits were similar to those characteristic for apple maiden trees or “knip-boom” type trees...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in a two year old Merlot/ 140 Ru and Cabernet Sauvignon/ 140 Ru {{vineyards}} during the 2004 growth season. Vines were spaced 2. 4 m x 0. 9 m in North-South orientated rows. Each vine had five to six shoots. The vineyards were drip irrigated (800 m 3 /Ha/season). Shoots more than 100 cm were tipped or topped at pea berry size development stage. Tipping of Merlot vines reduced shoot growth and variability of all vegetative parameters. Topping of Cabernet Sauvignon reduced variability of shoot Diameter and increased <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenology}} of Protea neriifolia {{cultivated in}} the eastern Transvaal highlands (summer rainfall area) was studied. Shoot growth occurred from July to February and flowering extended from January to July. There were no seasonal patterns in litter production or decomposition. Shoot growth and flowering occurred several months earlier than in plants in their natural habitat in the south-western Cape. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} a current model describing the growth of mediterranean heathland plants on highly leached nutrient poor soils. Pruning procedures to maximize <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> and flower production for commercial exploitation are recommended...|$|E
40|$|The shoot apical {{meristem}} generates stem, leaves, and <b>lateral</b> <b>shoot</b> meristems {{during the entire}} shoot ontog-eny. Vegetative leaves are generated by the meristem in the vegetative developmental phase, while in the re-productive phase either bracts subtending lateral flower primordia (or paraclades), or perianth and strictly re-productive organs are formed. Meristem growth is fully characterized by the principal growth rates, directions, volumetric, and areal growth rates. Growth modelling or sequential in vivo methods of meristem observation complemented by growth quantification allow the above growth variables to be estimated. Indirectly, growth is assessed by cell division rates and other cell cycle parameters. Temporal and spatial changes of growt...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine efficient preconditioning methods for in vitro multiplication of Uapaca kirkiana plant materials from mature stock plants. The efficacy of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), calcium hypochlorite {Ca(OCl 2) 2 } or mercuric chloride (HgCl 2) as surface sterilant was evaluated in decontaminating explants excised from grafted and field-collected U. kirkiana trees. Different Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplements were evaluated for shoot multiplication and root regeneration. Results indicated that preconditioning grafted U. kirkiana trees before excising explants and decontaminating explants in 0. 1 % w/v HgCl 2 were effective methods in establishing aseptic cultures (80 %). <b>Lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> (new shoots) responded positively to shoot multiplication on strength MS medium supplemented with a combination of 0. 1 mg/L benzylaminopurine, 0. 04 mg/L naphthaleneacetic acid and 0. 3 mg/L casein hydrolysate. High concentrations of thidiazuron (> 0. 1 mg/L) suppressed bud break. Rooting (36 %) was achieved with MS medium supplemented with 2. 5 mg/L indole- 3 -butyric acid. Plantlets were successfully hardened off. In vitro multiplication of mature U. kirkiana plant materials was achieved using <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> excised from grafted U. kirkiana trees after preconditioning with fungicides...|$|R
50|$|Adult moths {{are known}} to lay eggs in July and August, and eggs hatch {{approximately}} 9 months later. Larvae (spindle worms) feed on the leaves they hatch in before moving into <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> of the bush. As they mature they move towards ground shoots and feed upward into the shoots until mid June when they are fully developed and begin to bore into dead canes to pupate.|$|R
40|$|Single-node {{cuttings}} of 'Samantha', 'Pitica' and 'Landora' {{were treated}} with auxins and inserted in an automatic mist bench. The rooting of cuttings treated with auxin powder was better those treated with auxin solution. Auxins at high concentration inhibited development of <b>lateral</b> <b>shoots</b> but not adventitious roots. Therefore, cuttings treated with NAA powder at 2000 mg/kg got the best result of propagation. 'Samantha'，'Pitica'以及'Landora'三品種玫瑰花之單節插穗，其基部浸沾auxin後扦插於自動噴霧插床。插穗經auxin粉劑處理者，其發根率優於經液劑處理者。高濃度auxin雖不會抑制不定根的形成，但卻抑制腋芽之萌發。上述三品種之單節插穗，以NAA 2000 mg/kg粉劑效果最好...|$|R
