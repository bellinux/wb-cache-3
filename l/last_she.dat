5|$|After the Cultural Revolution, Xin Fengxia was {{politically}} rehabilitated in 1979, {{but was unable}} to return to the stage because of her disability. Her performance in Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964 proved to be her <b>last.</b> <b>She</b> devoted her energy to writing, painting, and training the younger generation of pingju performers. In 1997, she published her two-million-word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Ye Shengtao, the renowned writer and publisher, greatly encouraged her to write. He composed two poems praising her courage and talent. Her paintings, which were decorated with her husband's calligraphy, were also popular, and an exhibition of them was held at the China Military Museum in 1994. She was elected {{as a member of the}} Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Neuner hinted the {{upcoming}} season might be her <b>last.</b> <b>She</b> began the winter in Östersund with the best season start of her career, beating Tora Berger by 0.2 seconds in the sprint to claim her 25th World Cup win. She also came third in the individual and the pursuit, and took the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader. On 6 December 2011, Neuner announced her retirement from biathlon {{by the end of the}} season on her homepage. She explained her early departure from the sport (at age 25) with a lack of motivation and her desire for a normal life. Neuner nonetheless continued her good form in Hochfilzen, where she claimed her 26th World Cup win in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Tereapii Tapoki was {{the only}} female Cook Islander {{participating}} in a track and field event in Beijing, and {{was the only}} Cook Islander in her nation's delegation during those games. Born in Oiretumu, a settlement {{on the island of}} Mauke, Tapoki's debut at the Olympics was in the 2004 Athens games when she was 20 years old; she represented the Cook Islands in the same event during those games.

Her method of painting was to always paint every detail of the portrait, taking her time for days and weeks, and saving the face for <b>last.</b> <b>She</b> always insisted that the face was the most important part and required the most attention. She would spend countless hours working on every detail of the face of her subject. Once she started on the portrait's face, she would devote her entire time to it until perfection was reached.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of their {{marriage}} Davis was the primary income provider for their family, as Clarke worked to establish himself in his law career. She accomplished this through her writing and as an editor for the New York Tribune. However, ten years after their marriage Davis had faded substantially from the literary world. Clarke gave up law and became an editor for The Philadelphia Inquirer as well. As Clarke's success grew, Davis's work became more closely linked {{to that of a}} mother and a housewife. In 1892, Davis received a small critical and popular success with Silhouettes of American Life but it was her <b>last.</b> <b>She</b> died at age 79, on September 29, 1910.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} season of Glee, Sue makes {{numerous}} attempts at sabotaging the William McKinley High School glee club, New Directions. She enlists members of her cheerleading squad, the Cheerios, to bring the club down from the inside, and conspires to lure away its star member, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Sue is appointed co-director of the club by Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), but soon scales back her involvement when her attempts to turn the club members against director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) fail. Hoping to ruin the club's chances of winning at the show choir Sectionals competition, Sue gives New Directions' setlist to the directors of their rival glee clubs. Despite having to devise a new setlist at the last moment, New Directions win by unanimous decision and Sue is suspended by Figgins. She blackmails him into allowing her back, and is selected as a judge for the show choir Regionals competition. Sue is ridiculed by the other judges for her lack of fame and underdog status, allowing her to empathize with the glee club members. She votes for New Directions to win, and although they place <b>last,</b> <b>she</b> blackmails Figgins into allowing them another year to compete.|$|E
500|$|In January 1896 Yeats moved again, {{into a small}} flat in Woburn Place, {{so as to be}} {{nearer to}} her. Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats {{describing}} [...] "an embarrassed conversation upon the width", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, [...] "at <b>last</b> <b>she</b> came to me in my thirtieth year.... and we had many days of happiness". Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.|$|E

500|$|Texas {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} jinxed or unlucky ship after several accidents early in her career; she consequently earned the nickname [...] "Old Hoodoo". These mishaps included problems during construction, a grounding off Newport, Rhode Island, and flooding shortly afterwards while at dock in New York City. In the <b>last,</b> <b>she</b> settled to the bottom with her gun deck awash and several crew members drowned. She also received significant damage to her hull in drydock after being raised. Her reputation improved with her service in the Spanish–American War, when she blockaded the coast of Cuba and fought in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.|$|E
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed Huskisson {{continued}} to weaken. The doctors {{had concluded that}} without amputation {{he would continue to}} deteriorate, but that he had no realistic chance of surviving major surgery, and broke this news to the Huskissons. William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but at <b>last</b> <b>she</b> calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it is all in vain." [...] After further laudanum, he complained [...] "Why endeavour to support my strength? I must die, it is only prolonging my sufferings." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. And yet she is exhibited to us as a fine creature, a noble woman, one whom a man might be honoured by loving;—and at <b>last</b> <b>she</b> ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E
