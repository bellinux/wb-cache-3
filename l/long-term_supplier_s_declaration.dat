When a long-term contract is available, suppliers are less pressured to find new customers, and can afford to charge a price lower than the prevailing spot market price. We examine sourcing decisions of a firm {{in the presence of}} a capacity reservation contract that this firm makes with its <b>long-term</b> <b>supplier</b> in addition to the spot market alternative. This contract entails delivery of any desired portion of a reserved fixed capacity in exchange for a guaranteed payment by the buyer. We investigate rational actions of the two parties under two different types of periodic review inventory control policies used by the buyer: the two-number policy, and the base stock policy. When typical demand probability distributions are considered, inclusion of the spot market source in the buyer’s procurement plan significantly reduces the capacity commitments from the <b>long-term</b> <b>supplier...</b>|$|R

The matching with the smallest total cost would assign each object pi to the supplier sj with the minimum cij value. In many scenarios, however, runner-up assignments may be required too, like for example when a decision maker needs to make additional considerations, not captured by cij values. In this case, it is necessary to examine several short-listed assignments before choosing one. This motivates the αTop-K query, which computes the K best assignments, i. e., those achieving the K smallest total costs.

30|$|Social quality {{management}} practices refer to {{quality management}} {{practices that are}} social/behavioral in nature. These practices have a focus toward involvement and commitment of management, employees, and supplier training, learning and cooperation or teamwork [3]. Previous studies have captured the social essence of quality management by a focus on internal social structures (e.g., cross functional cooperation) as well as external social structures (e.g., <b>long-term</b> <b>supplier</b> relationships). In this study we will focus on both by borrowing the three dimensions of Ketokivi and Schroeder [19]: quality training, cross-functional cooperation and long-term supply chain relationships. Quality training {{is the degree to}} which employees receive training to perform quality management tasks. Cross-functional cooperation refers to the degree to which different departments and individuals coordinate their quality activities and efforts. Long-term supply chain relationships refer to the degree to which the organization encourages development of recurring exchanges, supplier involvement and reliable information sharing with suppliers.|$|R
5000|$|Together with Paul Milgrom, Avner Greif, Yingyi Qian, and Marcel Fafchamp, {{he created}} a {{comparative}} institutional field in the economics department at Stanford in the early 1990s. [...] They conceptualized institutions as equilibrium phenomena in societal games rather than something given exogenously by factors such as law, policy, and culture. From this perspective he laid analytical foundations for basic concepts in institutional analysis such as institutional complementarities, social embedeness (linked games), and public representations mediating the salient features {{of the state of}} play and individual beliefs, and applied them to comparative analysis across countries and regions. Aoki was the first to directly apply institutional analysis to Japan, arguing in the late 1980s that institutions such as lifetime employment, the main bank system, <b>long-term</b> <b>supplier</b> relations, and government as an interest group mediator were in mutually complementary, game-theoretic equilibria in the context of Japan's institutional evolution.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurchasing is {{increasingly}} {{seen as an}} important strategic activity of the firm. However, {{there is little evidence}} examining the effects of strategic purchasing on a firm's inter-organizational supply management practices and performance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the effect of strategic purchasing on the supply management practices of socialization, supplier integration and supplier flexibility, together with relationship performance. Using empirical data collected from 111 United Kingdom purchasing executives, a structural equation model is used to test the theoretical framework. The results provide support for four of the six hypotheses developed. Strategic purchasing was found to have an indirect, significant effect on improving supplier relationship performance, acting through supplier process integration. Strategic purchasing also had a significant effect on the use of socialization mechanisms, but not on supplier flexibility. Our research indicates that close, <b>long-term</b> <b>supplier</b> relationships can lead to the creation of relational rents.

In wholesale electricity markets, we predict that the bid price of the most expensive production unit can change by 1 - 10 % due to price instability. The price instability is reduced when suppliers have more steps in their supply functions for a given production technology. In the limit, as the number of steps increases and the cost uncertainty decreases, the Bayesian equilibrium converges to a pure-strategy NE without price instability, the Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an industry {{where one of}} the manufacturers and its <b>supplier</b> (<b>S)</b> have engaged in some specific investment in the past. We assume that this has three consequences: S has lower expected production costs than other suppliers, supplier-switching costs exist, and the manufacturer may limit its rivals’ access to S. In the case when only S knows its true production costs, we compare alternative mechanisms to induce S to reveal its private information, namely, paying informational rents, using threats of switching suppliers, and most importantly, permitting S to serve other firms. We prove that the presence of asymmetric information mitigates the manufacturer’s incentives to engage in vertical restraints. We derive several policy implications from this result. Adapting to more efficient suppliers, supplier switching costs, sharing suppliers, vertical restraints, asymmetric information...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} – The purpose of this {{investigation}} is to help establish: whether or not strong relationships between suppliers and customers improve performance; and if prescriptive frameworks on outsourcing radical innovations are dependent on industry clockspeed. Design/methodology/approach – A survey of UK-based manufacturers, followed by a statistical analysis. Findings – <b>Long-term</b> <b>supplier</b> links seem not {{to play a role}} in the development of radical innovations. Moreover, industry clockspeed has no significant bearing on the success or failure of any outsourcing strategy for radically new technologies. Research limitations/implications – Literature about outsourcing in the face of radical innovation can be more confidently applied to industries of all clockspeeds. Practical implications – Prescriptions for fast clockspeed industries should be applied more broadly: all industries should maintain a high degree of vertical integration in the early days of a radical innovation. Originality/value – Prior papers had explored whether or not a company should outsource radical innovations, but none had determined if this is equally true for slow industries and fast ones.
