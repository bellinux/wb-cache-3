50|$|Other inventors {{began their}} own {{experiments}} after Walton {{took out his}} patent, and in 1871 William Parnacott took out a patent for a method of producing <b>linoxyn</b> by blowing hot air into a tank of linseed oil for several hours, then cooling the material in trays. Unlike Walton's process, which took weeks, Parnacott's method took only a day or two, although {{the quality of the}} <b>linoxyn</b> was not as good. Despite this, many manufacturers opted to use the less expensive Parnacott process.|$|E
50|$|Linoleic acid is used {{in making}} quick-drying oils, which are useful in oil paints and varnishes. These {{applications}} exploit the easy reaction of the linoleic acid with oxygen in air, which leads to crosslinking and formation of a stable film called <b>linoxyn.</b>|$|E
50|$|Linoleum, {{also called}} Lino, is a floor {{covering}} made from renewable {{materials such as}} solidified linseed oil (<b>linoxyn),</b> pine rosin, ground cork dust, wood flour, and mineral fillers such as calcium carbonate, most commonly on a burlap or canvas backing; pigments are often added to the materials.|$|E
5000|$|Walton soon faced {{competition}} from other manufacturers, including a company which bought the rights to Parnacottâ€™s process, and launched its own floor covering, which it named Corticine, from the Latin [...] "cortex" [...] "bark" [...] or [...] "rind". Corticine was mainly made of cork dust and <b>linoxyn</b> without a cloth backing, and became popular because it was cheaper than linoleum.|$|E
50|$|Linoleum {{was invented}} by Englishman Frederick Walton. In 1855, Walton {{happened}} to notice the rubbery, flexible skin of solidified linseed oil (<b>linoxyn)</b> that had formed on a can of oil-based paint, and thought that it might form a substitute for India rubber. Raw linseed oil oxidizes very slowly, but Walton accelerated the process by heating it with lead acetate and zinc sulfate. This made the oil form a resinous mass into which lengths of cheap cotton cloth were dipped until a thick coating formed. The coating was then scraped off and boiled with benzene or similar solvents to form a varnish. Walton initially planned to sell his varnish to the makers of water-repellent fabrics such as oilcloth, and patented the process in 1860. However, his method had problems: the cotton cloth soon fell apart, and it took months to produce enough of the <b>linoxyn.</b> Little interest was shown in Walton's varnish. In addition, his first factory burned down, and he suffered from persistent and painful rashes.|$|E
5000|$|Walton {{soon came}} up with an easier way to {{transfer}} the oil to the cotton sheets, by hanging them vertically and sprinkling the oil from above, and he tried mixing the <b>linoxyn</b> with sawdust and cork dust to make it less tacky. In 1863 he applied for a further patent, which read: [...] "For these purposes canvas or other suitable strong fabrics are coated over on their upper surfaces with a composition of oxidized oil, cork dust, and gum or resin ... such surfaces being afterward printed, embossed, or otherwise ornamented. The back or under surfaces of such fabrics are coated with a coating of such oxidized oils, or oxidized oils and gum or resin, and by preference without an admixture of cork." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a program}} to {{discover}} the "lost art " of the old Italian violin-makers Stradi-vari, the Guarneri, the Amati, etc., the writer (1) recently proposed the use of raw linseed oil for the preliminary treatment of the wood of the violins while the completed instruments are in the condition known as "in the white, " that is, before the varnish has been applied. This simple application of linseed oil to the wood produced a number of desirable advantages, which suggest {{that it might have}} been used by the old Italian masters. An additional effect has now been found that was not anticipated originally, which may have pronounced influence on the tonal properties of the wood. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS It is known (2, 3) that raw linseed oil upon oxidation {{over a period of years}} first passes through the rubbery or <b>linoxyn</b> stage and then finally becomes soft, sticky and "balsamic " in character. Although this ultimate degradation or oxidation product is extremely viscous, it will exhibit slow-flow. For this reason it was considered desirable to determine if a liquid could be forced to move insid...|$|E
