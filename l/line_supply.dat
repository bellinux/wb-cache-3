2500|$|German army {{transport}} was reorganised in 1908 but in 1914, {{the transport}} units {{operating in the}} areas behind the front <b>line</b> <b>supply</b> columns failed, having been disorganised from the start by Moltke crowding more than one corps per road, a problem that was never remedied but Creveld wrote that even so, {{the speed of the}} marching infantry would still have outstripped horse-drawn supply vehicles, if there had been more road-space; only motor transport units kept the advance going. Creveld concluded that despite shortages and [...] "hungry days", the supply failures did not cause the German defeat on the Marne, Food was requisitioned, horses worked to death and sufficient ammunition was brought forward in sufficient quantities so that no unit lost an engagement through lack of supplies. Creveld also wrote that had the French been defeated on the Marne, the lagging behind of railheads, lack of fodder and sheer exhaustion, would have prevented much of a pursuit. Schlieffen had behaved [...] "like an ostrich" [...] on supply matters which were obvious problems and although Moltke remedied many deficiencies of the Etappendienst (the German army supply system), only improvisation got the Germans as far as the Marne; Creveld wrote that it was a considerable achievement in itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{major part}} of the line to Engelberg was {{constructed}} by Stansstad-Engelberg Railway (StEB) and opened in 1898. The line ran from Stansstad to Engelberg and, like the Brünig line in its early days, relied on steamship connections {{with the rest of the}} Swiss railway network. Unlike the Brünig line, the StEB line was electrified from its opening, using a three-phase alternating current overhead <b>line</b> <b>supply.</b> It also used the Riggenbach rack system on its final approaches to Engleberg, but with a very steep maximum gradient of 25%.|$|E
5000|$|The Northern Lights {{pipeline}} system has a total length of 7377 km, of which around 2500 km {{is used to}} transport Russian gas to Europe. The pipeline runs from the Urengoy gas field through Vuktyl, Ukhta, Gryazovets, Torzhok and Smolensk to Minsk in Belarus {{and from there to}} Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania. [...] A part of the newer Yamal-Europe pipeline runs parallel to the Northern Lights pipeline. [...] A branch line from Gryazovets through Saint Petersburg to Vyborg supplies the Saint Petersburg area and Finland. A third parallel line will be added to this branch to supply the Nord Stream pipeline. In Torzhok, the Northern Lights pipeline intersects with the Moscow-Saint Petersburg pipeline supplying the Saint Petersburg area, Latvia and Estonia. The Minsk-Vilnius-Kaliningrad branch <b>line</b> <b>supplies</b> Lithuania and Kaliningrad Oblast while the Ivatsevichy-Dolyna branch <b>line</b> <b>supplies</b> Ukraine and the Kobrin-Brest-Warsaw branch <b>line</b> <b>supplies</b> Poland.|$|R

50|$|A {{refinement}} of the piston machine is the pump-driven machine, which {{was introduced in}} the Faema E61 in 1961, and has become the most popular design in commercial espresso bars. Instead of using manual force, a motor-driven pump provides the force necessary for espresso brewing. Espresso machines are made to accept water directly from a cold water <b>line</b> <b>supply,</b> common in commercial installations, or from a separate tank that must be filled with water by hand. The latter is more common with lower-volume commercial installations and domestic espresso machines. Due to the required high pumping pressure and precision flow control needed, the particular type of electric pumps typically used are known as solenoid-piston pumps. These pumps are classified as a positive displacement type (general category) of pump.|$|E

50|$|The units run on 25 kV AC {{overhead}} <b>line</b> <b>supply</b> via a Brecknell Willis High Speed pantograph, using four Brush TM2141B traction motors. With {{much shorter}} passenger journeys in mind, the Class 320 units lack the toilets of the Class 321 units and also began {{life with a}} lower speed capability (75 mph) due to the much closer spacing of stations on the North Clyde route. The lower design speed meant that yaw dampers could be omitted from this class but during 2010, yaw dampers were fitted across the class allowing them to travel at 90 mph. This meant that the units could be used on the sections of the Argyle Line route shared with the West Coast Main Line (and in theory, the Airdrie-Bathgate extension of the North Clyde Line and beyond), and also allows full-speed running in multiple with Class 318 stock, which has had 90 mph capability from the outset. The interior decor includes paintings of various landmarks and famous sights along the various SPT rail routes on the car ends.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the description, analysis {{and design of}} a high frequency parallel processing ac uninterruptible power supply. Compared to the standard UPS system used today, the proposed system has higher efficiency, smaller size and less weight, this is due primary to the usage of a high-frequency switching topology. The main power circuit configuration is shown to describe the steady state behaviour of the system in both ac <b>line</b> <b>supply</b> and battery backup modes of operation. A stability analysis is developed to describe the system behaviour against the load variation and the input disturbance. The detailed design of the output voltage control loop is carried out. A transient analysis is presented to describe the transition between the two operation modes of ac <b>line</b> <b>supply</b> and dc battery backup. From this analysis a fast switching transition control circuit is designed. A design procedure is illustrated to select the system components for a 300 W UPS. The corresponding system performance such as efficiency is evaluated. All the theoretical results obtained in this thesis are experimentally verified...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} an AC to DC converter, which takes <b>line</b> <b>supply</b> as input and {{provides}} a regulated DC output voltage which can be adjusted over a range of voltages is proposed in this project. The main aim {{is to get a}} regulated output voltage for any change in <b>line</b> <b>supply.</b> The line and load regulation is expected to be very less. The cascaded connection of rectifier, converter transformer along with output filter is used. To meet the specification the best suited topology is forward converter topology. A two switch forward converter is used to avoid transformer core saturation. To trigger both the MOSFETs at a time through a single pulse transformer the current mode control PWM IC UC 3844 is used which avoids using an extra current sensing circuit. The converter transformer has one primary and three secondary windings. The three secondary windings serves three purposes, one used provide power supply to control circuit, other used for voltage feedback to control circuit and the third to feed the load. The output voltage is fed back to control circuit through an opto coupler which provides input to output isolation. Two voltage regulators are provided one at power circuit other at control circuit. Once the output voltage is set for a particular value, the voltage regulator at power circuit senses the variation in output voltage for any change in input and sends proportional voltage to the control circuit this is sensed by PWM IC through regulator at control circuit, then the IC will adjust the duty ratio of the triggering pulse to MOSFETs which leads to maintaining constant voltage at the output. This is achieved with a regulation less than 1 %and the required specifications are met...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{simulated}} supply chain experiment {{based on the}} well-known "beer game," we examine how changes in order and delivery cycles, availability of shared point-of-sale (POS) information, and the pattern of customer demand affect supply chain efficiency. We find that speeding up cycle time is beneficial, but the sharing of POS information is not necessarily so. Whether or not the sharing of POS information is beneficial depends {{on the nature of}} the demand pattern represented by the POS information. If the demand pattern conveys continual change in ultimate downstream customer demand (as does an S-shaped demand pattern), the POS information can distract the upstream decision maker from what is perhaps more immediately relevant information, orders placed by the proximate downstream agent and the supply <b>line.</b> <b>supply</b> chain, beer game, bullwhip effect, quick response systems, experiments...|$|E
