However, there has been little study conducted to verify this relationship. The evidence is particularly limited within the empirical context of infrastructure delivery in Australia. Primarily drawing on the theoretical perspectives of the resource-based view of the firm (e. g. Barney 1991), dynamic capabilities (e. g. Helfat et al. 2007), absorptive capacity (e. g. Lane et al. 2006) and knowledge management (e. g. Nonaka 1994), this paper conceptualises learning capability as a knowledge-based dynamic capability. Learning capability builds on the micro-foundations of high-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines,</b> which are deliberately developed by construction organisations for managing collaborative projects. Based on this conceptualisation of learning capability, an exploratory case study was conducted. The study investigated the operational and higher-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> adopted by a project alliance team to successfully achieve VfM. The case study demonstrated that the <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> of the alliance project were developed and modified by the continual joint learning activities of participant organisations. Project-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> were found to significantly influence the development of organisational-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines.</b> In turn, the learning outcomes generated from the alliance project appeared to significantly influence the development of project management routines and contractual arrangements applied by the participant organisations in subsequent collaborative projects.

This paper develops a holistic model of the overall process, by integrating knowledge-oriented, routine-oriented, and social/contextual perspectives, each of which plays a necessary role in explaining essential aspects. One feature of the transfer of organizational learning systems entailed arranging local access to, and opportunity to replicate, various types of knowledge repository that contained corporate values as well as technical expertise. A second feature involved the development of collective <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> through dynamic interplay with evolving, locally based, knowledge repositories.

We select a list of 85 easily measured (or derived) photometric quantities (or ‘features’) and spectroscopic redshifts for al-most two million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10. After identifying which features have the most predictive power, we use standard artificial Neural Networks (aNN) {{to show that the}} addition of these features, in combination with the standard magnitudes and colours, improves the machine learning redshift estimate by 18 % and decreases the catastrophic outlier rate by 32 %. We further com-pare the redshift estimate from RDF using the ensemble <b>learning</b> <b>routine</b> Adaboost with those from two different aNNs, and with photometric redshifts available from the SDSS. We find that the RDF requires orders of magnitude less computation time than the aNNs to obtain a machine learning redshift while reducing both the catastrophic outlier rate by up to 43 %, and the redshift error by up to 25 %. When compared to the SDSS photometric redshifts, the RDF machine learning redshifts both decreases the standard deviation of residuals scaled by 1 /(1 +z) by 36 % from 0. 066 to 0. 041, and decreases the fraction of catastrophic outliers by 57 % from 2. 32 % to 0. 99 %.

The conceptual framework builds on knowledge- and resource-based views and return on quality perspectives. The results indicate support for the theoretical framework. Extent of managerial IT use influences internal and external <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> that influence quality and cost improvement. Quality improvement significantly impacts customer satisfaction and cost improvement that significantly impact firm profitability. The non-hypothesized paths are not significant, indicating that <b>learning</b> <b>routines,</b> quality improvement, cost improvement and customer satisfaction are intervening variables between extent of managerial IT use and firm profitability. Further, the sample is split into two industry subgroups, durable and nondurable goods subgroups, and the two-group analysis reveals that industry moderates the relationship among the variables under study.

Although previous studies indicated that governance directly influences performance, and that learning directly influences performance, {{there is little}} deductive evidence exploring the relationship between all three variables, especially {{at a high level}} of disaggregation. A conceptual model is developed based on the literature, which defines collaborative learning capability (CLC) as an absorptive capacity that construction organizations develop to explore, transform, and exploit knowledge through 18 specific <b>learning</b> <b>routines.</b> These routines influence formal and informal governance types and, ultimately, three different performance metrics for projects. This study is based on a survey of 320 experienced practitioners on Australian collaborative infrastructure projects in the construction sector.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} why structures of learning underpin the creation of competencies that allow firms to compete more successfully in dynamic markets. The paper seeks to challenge the idea that, in the absence of learning, capabilities are the main source of competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach – First, the paper discusses the relationships between competencies, learning, and dynamic markets. Second, a preliminary analysis is conducted of the <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> of 118 top sales managers. The results are compared with three different structures of learning, allowing conclusions to be drawn about learning in dynamic markets. Findings – The study illustrates that a number of dynamic <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> are not evident in the sales environments of dynamic markets. The findings suggest that firms are not well placed to renew routines from inside-out and to respond to market dynamics. The patterns of integration among individuals and groups, however, seem to be well represented, reflecting higher-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines.</b> Research limitations/implications – The empirical findings offered here are of a preliminary nature. Future researchers might usefully apply the typology of learning structures to examine in more detail the empirical links established. Studies might also examine organisational learning in a variety of industrial and consumer-based contexts.

The first abductive <b>learning</b> <b>routine</b> is using clues to imagine a configuration of interdependencies among strategic or institutional elements that might constitute a viable strategic value creating opportunity or governance structure. There are no architectures for radical products, strategies, or institutional arrangements, so researchers begin by imagining possible architectures.

Dunne and Dougherty (2016) explain how drug discovery scientists imagine a configuration of interactions among molecular compounds, the disease in question, {{and the rest of}} human biology. They construct a coherent story about how a chemical compound will behave in the body against the disease.

This is important since in practice, neural networks do not learn the exact target function but rather the best approximation given the provided parameters and data.

Using a sample of 367 Taiwanese market and 210 South Korean hierarchy organizations, this study differentiates the role of drivers of DLMs in these organizations to provide more robust insights into DCs exploitation in polar governance structures. This study posits that learning intent and embedded learning are important primary antecedent drivers of DCs exploitation. The findings reveal that manager integration power, external linkages, codification of experience, and ambiguity are key drivers of DCs exploitation in market governance structures. External linkages, repeated practice, codification of experience, and ambiguity are key drivers of DCs exploitation in hierarchy governance structures.

Participants in the strategic problem setting and solving process critically examine assumptions, deliberate over different perspectives, and bridge possible differences into new shared directions (Ansell 2011). Strategic managers might refine and replace milestones, and develop new performance objectives that reflect new alternatives and consequences learned from evaluation (Grandori 2010). Strategic managers would also rethink how clock-time and event-time pacing combine, and how well the combinations create a rich set of reference points that people can use to anticipate more possibilities further into the future. Reframing might revise the future trajectories of anticipated activities {{that need to be}} accomplished, and coordinate attention and effort to carry out those activities. Event-time pacing structures the inherently exploratory searching and helps to constrain the short term nature of clock-time by keeping the future open to emergent possibilities. Clock-time pacing helps to constrain the potentially expansive searching, and marshals the development of resources that can be clocked. Strategic managers in the innovation eco-system identify new future trajectories and eliminate others based on emergent learning.|$|E
