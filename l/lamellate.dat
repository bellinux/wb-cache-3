The legs are long and the {{shoulders}} of the pronotum project into short spines in adults and older nymphs. The hindmost legs are much thicker than the other legs, and the hind femur has inner rows of fine teeth and one preapical spine. The hindmost legs are shorter and much swollen in the male. The hind tibia are inwardly <b>lamellate</b> in about middle third; less so in the male, which also has a distinct spine on the <b>lamellate</b> area. Later instar nymphs have a pair of orange spots {{in the middle of the}} upper surface of abdomen, and wing pads in later instars are marked with orange.|$|E
5000|$|Itajahya MÃ¶ller (1895):Characters in this genus {{include a}} white {{calyptra}} (tissue which covers {{the top of}} the fruiting body to which the gleba is attached), <b>lamellate</b> plates covered with gleba. The gleba has a white mottled surface, and the pileus appears wig-like when removed of the gleba. The thick, stout stalk has many chambered walls.|$|E
50|$|Interiorly {{when the}} lip has teeth it is dentate as in Nerita. When the teeth are rib-like it is {{described}} as plicate or <b>lamellate.</b> When it has numerous large plications, nodules or teeth it is known as ringent, as in Pythia. The lip is called sulcate, when it is grooved within. It is known as labiate or marginate, when it is callously thickened near the margin.|$|E
50|$|This white {{colouration}} that {{is present}} on the cerata also appears in patches or lines along the bare central dorsum, as well as around the <b>lamellate</b> rhinophores and on the metapodium. The rhinophores are joined together at their bases with a swollen and wrinkled accessory caruncle. Both the rhinophores and median sensory caruncle are somewhat darker in colour {{than the rest of}} the body.|$|E
50|$|The genus Gloeophyllum is {{characterized}} by the production of leathery to corky tough, brown, shaggy-topped, revivable fruitbodies lacking a stipe and with a <b>lamellate</b> to daedaleoid or poroid fertile hymenial surfaces. The hyphal system is dimitic to trimitic. The genus is further characterized by the production of a brown rot of wood. Phylogenetically, it along with several other brown rot Basidiomycota, Neolentinus, Heliocybe, and Veluticeps form an order called the Gloeophyllales.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{species in}} Boletaceae produce large fleshy {{mushrooms}} {{with a central}} stipe. The spore print colours are commonly [...] (yellowish-green), yellowish, brownish, or vinaceous (red-wine coloured). In many species, flesh that is bruised or cut will turn blue, {{a result of the}} oxidation of pulvinic acid derivatives, like variegatic, xerocomic, and atrotomentinic acid. The mushrooms usually have tubular hymenophores, although some species (like those in the genus Phylloporus) are <b>lamellate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because the funicle {{is without}} {{intrinsic}} muscles, it generally must move as a unit, {{in spite of}} being articulated. However, some funicles are complex and very mobile. For example, the Scarabaeidae have <b>lamellate</b> antennae that can be folded tightly for safety or spread openly for detecting odours or pheromones. The insect manages such actions by changes in blood pressure, by which it exploits elasticity in walls and membranes in the funicles, which are in effect erectile.|$|E
50|$|Lentinellus is a genus {{of white}} rot, wood decay, <b>lamellate</b> agaric {{in the family}} Auriscalpiaceae, further {{characterized}} in part by rough-walled, amyloid spores produced on lamellae with jagged edges. Typically, thick-walled hyphae in the fruit body are in part amyloid, and frequently {{the taste of the}} mushrooms is acrid (burning, spicy). The widespread genus has been estimated to contain 15 species. Mycologists Ronald Petersen and Karen Hughes considered 24 species in their 2004 world monograph of the genus.|$|E
5000|$|They are {{relatively}} large in size, some growing to sizes {{as large as}} 1.5 inches (3 cm) or more. As in other members of this genus, the males have large distinctive antennae consisting of several <b>lamellate</b> plates, which they close up when threatened. The antennae are used to detect pheromones emitted by the females. [...] The wing covers (elytra) have four long white stripes and one short stripe each. The underside of the thorax is covered with brownish hairs.|$|E
50|$|The circulatory and {{excretory}} {{system are}} closely related, {{in that the}} heart is surrounded by the triangular kidney. The kidney has a <b>lamellate</b> (layered) structure and it has two ureters. In this slug species, the ventricle of the heart is directed towards, and is very close to, the anal and respiratory openings. The ventricle of the heart is further away and further back {{than it is in}} species of the related genus Arion, the type genus of the family Arionidae.|$|E
50|$|Aldisa albatrossae is {{a rather}} small nudibranch, with a length between 1.1 and 2.2 cm. The bluish gray dorsum is covered with many white, round tubercles. Typically there is a black line which starts {{in front of the}} rhinophores, and {{continues}} in a rectangular shape to the gills at the back. This black line then encompasses the gills. There are also yellow-orange markings on the corners of the rectangle. The <b>lamellate</b> rhinophores have a translucent, dirty-white color. The bipinnate gills only have a few branches, and have the same dirty white color.|$|E
5000|$|Red shovelers have a {{diet that}} {{includes}} herbs, grasses, pond weeds, widgeon grass, algae, and eelgrass. They also feed on small invertebrates. The bill {{is equipped with a}} <b>lamellate</b> filtering mechanism that allows the extraction of small items of food from the water. Pairs form in the wintering grounds, after often noisy courtship. Once a clutch of 7-8 eggs is laid, incubation lasts about 25-26 days, followed by 40-45 days of fledging. [...] Red shovelers are partially migratory, with the southern most birds migrating north during the winter season.|$|E
50|$|The manuka beetle is a shiny bright green, with {{shades of}} blue and yellow on areas of its back. Its dark {{longitudinal}} stripe {{down the back of}} its hard wing case is often brown or yellow. It can vary in length between 3 and 25mm in length, but the most common is 9mm. They {{are a part of the}} superfamily Scarabaeoidea and are characterized for their modified prothorax and have a large coxae. Their antennae is a <b>lamellate</b> antennal club and has a head with anterior margins which are either semicircular or emerginate mesocoxae, strongly oblique.|$|E
50|$|Body is elongate, {{narrowing}} posteriorly. Rhinophores are <b>lamellate,</b> club-shaped {{and with}} white bands. Cerata are arranged into clusters in two rows along the dorsum. Background color is translucent gray with thick white or yellow patches running between the cerata clusters, {{on the margin}} of the dorsum. A submarginal row of opaque white spots present along the sides of the body. Three white or yellow patches are on the head. Oral tentacles are long, translucent and white at the tips. Cerata are translucent with a brown or orange band {{about a third of the}} way down from the tip. The maximum recorded body length is 25 mm.|$|E
50|$|Chromodoris leopardus {{can reach}} a maximum size of 6 cm length. The body is {{elongate}} {{with a foot}} which is distinct from the upper body by a large skirt like mantle hiding the foot. The top of the mantle is brownish with dark spots circled with white. The margin of the mantle is white with at the external border a fine purple to electric blue line. The rhinophores are <b>lamellate</b> and contractile, the base is white topped with blue to purple {{but they can also}} be white with a longitudinal blue to purple line. The branched gills have a whitish external side, the internal surface is golden.|$|E
50|$|Itajahya is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Phallaceae. The genus, {{widespread}} in tropical and subtropical areas, contains three species. Characters in this genus include a white calyptra (tissue which covers {{the top of the}} fruit body to which the gleba is attached), and <b>lamellate</b> plates covered with gleba. The gleba has a white mottled surface, and the cap appears wig-like when removed of the gleba. The thick, stout stalk has many chambered walls. The species Itajahya rosea, formerly classified in the genus Phallus, was transferred to Itajahya in 2012 when molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that it was not closely related to other Phallus species.|$|E
50|$|Spurilla neapolitana {{is a large}} nudibranch, {{growing to}} a length of 70 mm in the Mediterranean Sea. The rhinophores (the pair of sensory {{structures}} on the dorsal surface of the head) are <b>lamellate.</b> The cerata (outgrowths of the body) are also flattened and have opaque white tips. These tips are known as cnidosacs and are defensive structures armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells) garnered from sea anemones that the nudibranch has eaten. The general colour of this species is orange or pinkish, perhaps depending on what it has been eating, often with dark streaking where the tortuous digestive gland is visible through the translucent skin and {{the walls of the}} cerata. Some individuals have opaque patches of white on the body wall.|$|E
50|$|This nudibranch is {{orange or}} yellow-orange in colour, with {{numerous}} small dark brown spots and fewer, larger, poorly-defined, orange spots and patches. The mantle edge has {{three pairs of}} branched papillae, one behind the branchial plume, one in front and one mid-way along the back. These are marked with white pigment {{and there is a}} variable amount of white pigment along the mantle edge and behind the gills. The papillae behind the branchial plume bear rounded bioluminescent organs. The tail is long, flattened and has a dorsal crest. It is muscular and can be used for swimming. The gills are large, sparsely branched and held erect. The rhinophores have <b>lamellate</b> tips and a tapering stalk and are similar in colour to the body. Maximum size is about 50 mm. This nudibranch is normally nocturnal, hiding beneath boulders in shallow water during daytime.|$|E
50|$|Isoetes engelmannii is an {{emergent}} aquatic perennial pteridophyte. The rootstock (rhizomorph) {{is almost}} globose and normally has 2 lobes. The bright green, pliable leaves are evergreen and become paler towards {{the base and}} gradually taper to a point at the apex. They are typically about 60 cm in length, but they range from 10 cm up to 90 cm long. They are arranged spirally. The wall of the sporangium typically lacks any pigment, but sometimes it may be streaked with brown. The velum covers {{less than a quarter}} of the sporangium. The megaspores are white in colour and measure 400 to 560 Î¼m in diameter. Their texture is reticulate (i.e. net-like) and the <b>lamellate</b> ridges are unbroken. The girdle that runs between these ridges is obscured by the heavy reticulation. The microspores are grey in colour, measure 20 to 30 Î¼m in diameter, and are smooth to papillose (i.e. with minute projections) in texture. The spores mature in the summer. The chromosome number is 2n = 22.|$|E
50|$|The white shell {{reaches a}} height of 1 mm. The solid shell has a depressed, turbinate shape. It is openly {{perforate}} to imperforate. The sculpture shows distant longitudinal <b>lamellate</b> ribs that cross the whorl from the suture to the umbilicus. Their interstices contain raised spiral threads, which grow coarser on approaching the umbilicus. The protoconch contains 1Â½ whorl, concluding with a prominent varix. The three whorls are tabulate above, and rounded below. The body whorl descends rapidly. The aperture is roundly ovate. The sharp outer lip is convex. The inner lip spreads as a distinct callosity over the body, and sometimes seals the umbilicus partly or wholly up. The columella is concave. The narrow umbilicus is deep, and is bordered with a raised ridge, or is closed up. Theforamen is large, and distant from the margin, to which a furrow joins it. The fasciole is extremity short, terminating half a whorl behind the aperture. it is borderedby keels and is traversed by lamellae, which correspond to the longitudinal ribs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mantle of}} these oval nudibranchs is {{flattened}} dorsoventrally and its dorsal surface {{is covered with}} hard, colored tubercles. This mantle is decorated with contrasting colors and patterns as warning signals to predators. The <b>lamellate</b> rhinophores can be retracted. Like other dorid nudibranchs, all species have a dorsal anus, except for the species in the genus Fryeria where the anus is posteroventral and protrusible. In contrast with the other nudibranchs from the clade Doridacea, the species in this family lack buccal armature, i. e. radulae and jaws. The gill leaflets are situated along the ventral area and to the side (= ventrolateral [...] ) instead of consisting of a dorsomedian (= along the middle line of the upper surface) circlet [...] The oral glands, which are {{closely associated with the}} pharynx and contained in the oral tube, and the stomach have undergone modifications. The female part in the reproductive system of these hermaphroditic snails has two separate openings and the male part one. This is called a triaulic reproductive system. It corresponds to the same triaulic condition of the advanced dorids.|$|E
50|$|The {{membership}} of Diaphoromyrma in Stenammini or Adelomyrmecini (the other tribes of the solenopsidine tribe group 2003) is unlikely. Diaphoromyrma lacks the specialized <b>lamellate</b> {{hairs on the}} ventral side of masticatory margin of adelomyrmecine mandibles or the various traits listed in Bolton (2003) for stenammines, namely the clypeal configuration. Although Diaphoromyrma possess the clypeus broadly inserted between the frontal lobes, it lacks any of the traits defining the tribes Myrmicini, Lenomyrmecini, Pheidolini, Tetramoriini or Paratopulini. Diaphoromyrma should also {{be compared with the}} formicoxenine tribe group (Bolton 2003). The {{membership of}} the genus in the tribe Formicoxenini is complicated by several differences: the toruli are slightly exposed in Diaphoromyrma (partially visible in only a few taxa of Formicoxenini), the propodeal lobes are relatively reduced (present and usually rounded in Formicoxenini), the antenna is 9-segmented with 2-segmented club (antenna with 8 to 12 segments and with 3 or 4-segmented club in Formicoxenini, but never with this combination). This genus is also clearly {{not a member of the}} other myrmicine tribes as presented or proposed in Bolton (2003).|$|E
5000|$|The {{rose chafer}} has a yellowish-tan {{coloured}} {{body that is}} about 8 - 13 mm in length, with wings that do not completely cover the abdomen. The beetle has six long, spiny, reddish-brown legs that gradually become darker {{towards the end of}} the appendage. It has two short <b>lamellate</b> antennae that end in a club of flat plates and it has chewing mouthparts. Rose chafers are covered in dull yellow hairs which give the body its characteristic colour, however with age and with normal activity the hairs are worn off the head and thorax revealing a black colour. It is thus possible to distinguish between older and younger beetles, as older beetles will have fewer hairs and thus be darker in colour. Females tend to lose more hairs, especially on the thorax due to the mating process, and can also appear darker in colour. Females also tend to be more robust than the male. The eggs of the rose chafer are about 1 mm in length and are oval, white and shiny. The larvae are white C-shaped grubs that when mature develop a brown head capsule and three distinct pairs of legs. The pupae are yellowish-brown in colour and are about 15 mm in length.|$|E
50|$|Many morpho {{butterflies}} are colored in metallic, shimmering {{shades of}} blues and greens. These colors {{are not a}} result of pigmentation, but are an example of iridescence through structural coloration. Specifically, the microscopic scales covering the morpho's wings reflect incident light repeatedly at successive layers, leading to interference effects that depend on both wavelength and angle of incidence/observance. Thus, the colors appear to vary with viewing angle, but they are actually surprisingly uniform, perhaps due to the tetrahedral (diamond-like) structural arrangement of the scales or diffraction from overlying cell layers. The wide-angle blue reflection property {{can be explained by}} exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings. These optically active structures integrate three design principles leading to the wide-angle reflection: alternative lamellae layers, Christmas tree-like shape, and zigzag pattern of the ridges. The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90 nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the zigzag pattern of ridges destroys the unwanted interference for other wavelengths in wide angle. This structure may be likened to a photonic crystal. The <b>lamellate</b> structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of biomimetic fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.|$|E
5000|$|The Syndesus ambericus holotype is a {{male with}} a total length of 13 mm and a height of 4 mm and having an overall convex, {{cylindrical}} shaped body. The coloration of S. ambericus is not described in the type description, and only a mention of golden colored hairs along the fore-wing margins is made. The head has antennae that are composed of at least {{an unknown number of}} segments with the seven visible segments modified into a <b>lamellate</b> structure. The broad head sports two, nearly round, large eyes and sharp projections placed in front of them. [...] As is typical for members for lucanids, the mandibles are highly modified into horn like structures. They are elongated to two thirds the length of the pronotum with symmetrical structure and bearing three teeth. A small projection at the front edge of the pronotum is present but not notably developed and the pronotum is lined with punctation, pits on the surface. The overall morphology is very similar to the living species Syndesus cornutus, which is native to Australia, making the placement of the species in Syndesus firm. The two species are distinguished by the mandible features, with S. cornutus having longer mandibles that have only two teeth. S. cornutus has less continuous punctures on the pronotum and a much larger projection at the front edge.|$|E
50|$|The living animal has {{a general}} orange color. The whole dorsum has brown dots except the tips or {{apex of the}} lateral {{appendage}}s, which are pale yellow. The dorsum has a white diamond shaped spot that runs from the behind of the rhinophores to the tail (just behind the branchial leaves). The end of the foot is acute and has a similar color to the appendage apices. Two types of appendages are observed. The first type of appendages are longer and wider and are positioned at {{the margin of the}} sides of the animal. These appendages have apical ramifications that are rounded at the base with a long, thin and sharp prolongation. Small acute ramifications cover the remaining parts of the appendage. The second type of appendage is thin, long with many small sharp, thin and long simple ramifications. These appendages are present on the entire body, sides, foot, and dorsum. The oral veil has four appendages, two of which are longer, situated at the lateral edges of the oral veil and two that are shorter situated in the center. The rhinophores have a <b>lamellate</b> clavus and a peduncule with acute ramifications. Each rhinophoral sheath edge has three ramifications. The middle one is virtually identical to the lateral appendages. The other two ramifications are similar to the smaller tentacles {{of the rest of the}} body. The oral tentacles are simple folds of the mantle with the appearance of cylinders. The three branchial leaves are tripinnate. They have the same simple and thin ramifications as the smaller appendages.|$|E
50|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.Certain Cerambycidae use antennae to balance, and blister beetles may use them for grasping. Some aquatic beetle species may use antennae for gathering air and passing it under the body whilst submerged. Equally, some families use antennae during mating, and a few species use them for defence. In the cerambycid Onychocerus albitarsis, the antennae have venom injecting structures used in defence. Antennae vary greatly in form, sometimes between the sexes, but are often similar within any given family. Antennae may be clubbed, threadlike, angled, shaped like a string of beads, comb-like (either on one side or both, bipectinate), or toothed. The physical variation of antennae is important for the identification of many beetle groups. The Curculionidae have elbowed or geniculate antennae. Feather like flabellate antennae are a restricted form found in the Rhipiceridae and a few other families. The Silphidae have a capitate antennae with a spherical head at the tip.

50|$|The living animal has {{a general}} orange coloration. The whole dorsum has brown dots {{except at the}} apices of the lateral appendages, which are pale yellow. These brown dots are similar and size and {{regularly}} distributed. The dorsum has an opaque white, irregularly shaped line, which runs {{from the front of}} the head to the posterior end of the notum. This line bifurcates at the level of the branchial leaves, where it surrounds them and remerges again behind the branchial leaves. The posterior end of the foot is thin and acute and has a yellow color similar to that of the lateral appendage apices. Two types of appendages are observed in the specimen. The first type of appendages is the longest and widest. There are three pairs of these lateral appendages situated along the margin of the sides. These appendages have a ramified apex. Each ramification of the apex has a rounded base and a long, thin and sharp prolongation. The whole length of each of these appendages is covered by little and acute ramifications. The second type of appendages, are thin, long with many small sharp, thin and long simple ramifications. These appendages are present on the sides of the body, foot, dorsum and oral veil in number 15-17 per side with 6 on the oral veil. The rhinophores have a <b>lamellate</b> clavus and a peduncule with little, thin and sharp ramifications. Each rhinophoral sheath edge has three ramifications. The middle one is virtually identical to the lateral appendages. The other two ramifications are similar to the smaller tentacles of the rest of the body.
