50|$|Japanese plane (kanna 鉋), is most {{commonly}} a wooden block, or dai (台) containing a <b>laminated</b> <b>blade,</b> sub-blade, and securing pin. This {{is similar in}} respects to the archaic type of European wooden plane, in which the blade is fixed in place by tapping down upon a wooden wedge. In the Japanese plane, the blade is fixed in position primarily by {{the confines of the}} plane's throat opening. Unlike a western plane, the support bed for the blade is not a flat surface in a Japanese plane - rather it is convex. The blade itself is tapered both in thickness and in width so as to wedge tightly into the dai when tapped down into place. Japanese planes are operated by pulling rather than pushing, and much work is done in the seated position or alongside a planing beam.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than being}} able to melt the iron ore into a {{complete}} billet, the furnaces of the period were only able to produce small pieces of iron, which were subsequently forge welded into a single blade. To accomplish this, the pieces would either be beaten into thin sheets that were then hammered together as a <b>laminated</b> <b>blade</b> or placed together as thin rods and then welded together. Additionally, some of these blades were constructed using pattern welding. With this method, the iron was beaten into strips, which were twisted together and then forge welded. The twisting removed much surface slag, which could cause weaknesses in the finished blade. Pattern welding also produced patterns in the finished blade, most commonly a herringbone pattern. Such patterns are often referenced in Anglo-Saxon literature—they are described using terms such as brogenmæl ("weaving marks"), wundenmæl ("winding marks"), grægmæl ("grey mark"), and scirmæl ("brightly patterned"). Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that the decoration produced by pattern-welding was important and desired in Anglo-Saxon society. Many blades also had a fuller, which was a shallow groove that ran the length of the blade. The fuller reduced the blade's overall weight while not compromising the thickness. Fullers were produced by hammering into the blade or chiselling out a section.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the quality}} of metal found in Japan, Japanese bladesmithing became an {{extremely}} rigid, precise process, involving folding and forge-welding the steel many times over to create a <b>laminated</b> <b>blade.</b> By the time of the Kamakura period (1185-1333 AD), Japan was under the rule of a military class and repelling Mongol invasions. This became known as the [...] "Golden era" [...] of Japanese bladesmithing under Emperor Toba II, who became a bladesmith himself. [...] After adbicating, Toba II summoned Japan's finest bladesmiths around him in an effort to develop the perfect sword. [...] It was determined that a sword had to be hard in order to maintain a sharp cutting edge, yet hard steel is brittle and can shatter under the stress of a heavy blow. [...] Swordsmiths in Japan found the solution by wrapping a softer low-carbon steel core such as wrought iron, in a jacket of high-carbon steel and then hardening the edge. [...] However, under heavy usage, the edge would be more prone to chipping than its European counterparts, which were typically designed to deal with heavier armor than Japanese blades. [...] This was answered by allowing projections of softer steel known as ashi to form in the hardened cutting edge during differential hardening of the blade.|$|E

40|$|A passive twist {{control is}} {{considered}} as an adaptive way {{to maximize the}} overall efficiency of a proprotor developed for convertible Micro Air Vehicles (MAV). Incorporated into a database of airfoil characteristics, Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) is implemented to predict the performance of proprotors at low Reynolds numbers. Using this model, {{it is found that}} low twist allows for efficient hovering while high twist helps to forward flight. The Centrifugal Force Induced Twist (CFIT) concept is proposed to realize the required torsion of proprotor between hover and forward flight. Tip mass is used to provide the nose-down twisting moment by centrifugal force and stabilize the flexible blade. Classical Lamination Theory (CLT) is employed to estimate the torsion behavior of glass/epoxy <b>laminate</b> <b>blade</b> and to study the feasibility of CFIT concept. The results indicate that the predicted torsion of CFIT blade is of the same level with required deformation. The <b>laminate</b> <b>blades</b> were tested in hover and forward flight modes, with deformations measured by Laser Displacement Sensor (LDS). In rotor mode, the <b>laminate</b> <b>blade</b> can generate approximately - 9 ◦ torsion at blade tip rotating at 1, 300 RPM.

50|$|Laminated vs Honyaki: From a {{strictly}} heat treat and microscopy point of view, {{there should be}} no difference between a laminated and honyaki steel with the same observed structure and heat threat process, but the heat treat necessarily differs, and many users say there is benefit to honyaki. Many users also prefer <b>laminated</b> <b>blades</b> for ease of maintenance ,sharpening feel, cost, and toughness. Many blacksmiths prefer <b>laminated</b> <b>blades</b> because at the minimum, they are easier to produce. At the highest levels they have core steel of comparable hardness and sharpness and are not necessarily easier to make due to the skill to forge weld at lower temperatures, with minimal loss of carbon, less flux and iron powder, and with minimal scars while stretching out the laminate. Pattern welding (suminagashi) requires its own skill as well and can produce a stiffer awase knife with less distortion during use and sharpening.|$|R

The plate response treats the <b>laminated</b> <b>blade</b> as an equivalent anisotropic material using a form of Mindlin's theory for crystal plates. The analysis makes use of a computational tool called the fast Fourier transform. Results are presented in the form of stress contour plots in the plane of the plate for various times after impact.

One set had been in Hawaii for 17 months (7844 hr of operation) and the other had been at Block Island, Rhode Island, for 26 months (22 months operating - 7564 hr). The Hawaii set was returned because {{of one of the}} studs that holds the blade to the hub had failed. This was found to be caused by a combination of improper installation and inadequate corrosion protection. No other problems were found. The broken stud (along with four others that were badly corroded) was replaced and the blades are now in storage. The Block Island set of blades was returned at the completion of the test program, but one blade was found to have developed a crack in the leading edge along the entire span. This crack was found {{to be the result of}} a manufacturing process problem but was not structurally critical. When a load-deflection test was conducted on the cracked blade, the response was identical to that measured before installation. In general, the laminate quality of both blade sets was excellent.
