50|$|Biomedical {{waste is}} {{generated}} from biological and medical sources and activities, {{such as the}} diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases. Common generators (or producers) of biomedical waste include hospitals, health clinics, nursing homes, medical research laboratories, offices of physicians, dentists, and veterinarians, home health care, and morgues or funeral homes.

50|$|Biomedical {{waste is}} {{any kind of}} waste {{containing}} infectious (or potentially infectious) materials. It may also include waste associated with the generation of biomedical waste that visually appears to be of medical or laboratory origin (e.g., packaging, unused bandages, infusion kits, etc.), as well research <b>laboratory</b> <b>waste</b> containing biomolecules or organisms that are restricted from environmental release. As detailed below, discarded sharps are considered biomedical waste whether they are contaminated or not, due {{to the possibility of}} being contaminated with blood and their propensity to cause injury when not properly contained and disposed of. Biomedical waste is a type of biowaste.|$|E
50|$|Any {{material}} {{exiting the}} level 3 or 4 laboratories must be sterilized or decontaminated in some manner.

Any liquids leaving the high-containment space go through a biowaste system that operates like a large autoclave to sterilize it. The high-containment labs are built as a box-in-a-box; they do not border exterior walls and there are mechanical spaces above and below them.|$|E

40|$|Dilute {{nitric acid}} blanks and {{solutions}} containing Ni, Cd, Pb, and U (including two <b>laboratory</b> <b>waste</b> samples) were analyzed eighteen times over a two-month period using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Two different sample introduction techniques were employed: flow injection-direct injection nebulization (FI-DIN) and continuous pneumatic nebulization (CPN). Using comparable instrumental measurement procedures, FI-DIN analyses were 33 % faster and generated 52 % less waste than CPN analyses. Instrumental limits of detection obtained with FI-DIN and CPN were comparable but not equivalent (except {{in the case}} of Pb) because of nebulizer-related differences in sensitivity (i. e., signal per unit analyte concentration) and background. Substantial and statistically {{significant differences were found between}} FI-DIN and CPN Ni determinations, and {{in the case of}} the <b>laboratory</b> <b>waste</b> samples, there were also small but statistically significant differences between Cd determinations. These small (2 to 3 %) differences were not related to polyatomic ion interference (e. g., {sup 95 }Mo{sup 16 }O{sup +}), but in light of the time savings and waste reduction to be realized, they should not preclude the use of FI-DIN in place of CPN for determination of Cd, Pb, U and chemically...|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} micro-extraction of aqueous samples {{coupled with}} gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in selected ion-monitoring mode (GC/MS-SIM) {{was developed to}} selectively analyze for 1, 4 -dioxane with low part-per-billion detection sensitivity. Recoveries of 1, 4 -dioxane ranged from 93 % to 117 % for both spiked laboratory reagent water and natural groundwater matrices, the later having elevated organic carbon content (8. 34 ± 0. 31 mg/L as total organic carbon). We observed that freezing the aqueous sample along with the extraction solvent enhanced the extraction efficiency, minimized physical interferences, and improved sensitivity resulting in a limit of detection for 1, 4 -dioxane to approximately 1. 6 µg/L. This method substantially reduces the labor, time, reagents and cost, and uses instruments that are commonly found in analytical laboratories. This method requires a relatively small sample volume (200 µL), and {{can be considered a}} green analytical method as it minimizes the use of toxic solvents and the associated <b>laboratory</b> <b>wastes...</b>|$|R
