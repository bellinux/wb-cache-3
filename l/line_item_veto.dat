5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
25|$|Though the Supreme Court {{struck down}} the <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act in 1998, President George W. Bush asked Congress to enact {{legislation}} that would return the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> <b>veto</b> power to the Executive. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal Legislative <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act of 2006 to Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senator Bill Frist, Senator John McCain, and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell jointly introduced this proposal.|$|E
25|$|The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs, {{holding that}} the <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act was unconstitutional. Because the Act {{established}} an expedited appeal process for challenges, {{the case was}} directly appealed from the District Court to the Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate Congress could {{overturn}} {{either the}} general or the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> <b>vetoes</b> {{with the same}} two-thirds votes required in the U.S. Congress. In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote {{in both houses of}} Congress. The only person to serve as president was Jefferson Davis, due to the Confederacy being defeated before the completion of his term.|$|R

25|$|The {{proposed}} Act {{was approved}} by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006 by a vote of 24-9. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar bill was submitted in the Senate, but failed to win approval. The Legislative <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act has therefore not become law.|$|E
25|$|The Permanent Constitution {{provided}} for a President of the Confederate States of America, elected {{to serve a}} six-year term but {{without the possibility of}} re-election.

[...] Rather than terminate the service, the City of Jacksonville assumed responsibility, but lost over $1 million in one year.Mayor John Peyton announced {{that there was}} no money available in the next budget.The Jacksonville Port Authority took over operation of the ferry in 2007 and raised the standard fare from $3.25 to $5.00, but still lost half a million dollars each year. However, they use port revenue, not tax money, to underwrite the operation.After taking over, the JPA decided to cut costs and sell the Blackbeard, the backup vessel built in 1956. That meant that whenever the Jean Ribault had problems, ferry service would be suspended. On February 5, 2009 the ferry was put into dry dock for routine maintenance, but hull corrosion required an extra week of repairs, and there was no service for a month.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{analysis}} is a percentage analysis of financial statements.

Although the second data set includes the <b>line</b> <b>items</b> in the first data set, the pallets associated with the <b>line</b> <b>items</b> were generated independently, i.e., the second data set does not contain the same pallet configurations generated for the first data set.|$|R
25|$|When {{asked how}} this {{proposed}} legislation {{was different from}} the 1996 <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.|$|E
25|$|Clinton v. City of New York, , is a {{legal case}} in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the line-item veto as granted in the <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act of 1996 {{violated}} the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution because it impermissibly gave the President of the United States the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of statutes that had been duly passed by the United States Congress. The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Congress {{attempted}} {{to enhance the}} president's veto power with the <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.|$|E
40|$|The <b>item</b> <b>veto</b> power {{forms an}} {{important}} {{check on the}} legislature in many states, including Alaska. The power allows the governor to <b>veto</b> individual <b>items</b> in an appropriations bill rather than vetoing or signing the bill as a whole. In 2011 the Alaska State Legislature contemplated challenging this crucial executive power. A proposed draft of the annual capital appropriations bill contained language that linked each energy appropriation to all the others, providing that if the governor struck one item then none of the items would go into effect. Further, the legislature inserted language providing {{that none of the}} proposed energy appropriations would go into effect if the section of the bill linking them together were successfully challenged in court. While neither provision was included in {{the final version of the}} bill signed into law, they prompted a controversy about whether such language would comport with the requirements of the state constitution. If they had been passed, the provisions would indeed have been unconstitutional and invalid, as they usurp the governor 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional <b>item</b> <b>veto</b> power and violate the confinement clause 2 ̆ 7 s requirement that the content of appropriations bills be limited to appropriations...|$|R

50|$|In {{the draft}} of the Navy's unfunded {{priorities}} list for FY 2015, a $796 million <b>line</b> <b>item</b> was included for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) of USS George Washington. Before it {{was approved by the}} Pentagon and sent to Congress, it was vetted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and signed by Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert, after which the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> was removed. In a 31 March 2014 letter to Congress, Admiral Greenert said that the decision to remove the RCOH <b>line</b> <b>item</b> from the unfunded priorities list was made to align with budget decisions over the next several years. The list was for the FY 2015, so a decision to refuel or inactivate the carrier has to be made during FY 2016 budget planning with the fiscal outlook at that time and the possibility of sequestration funding levels. The removal of the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> removes funding for advanced procurement of materials for the overhaul; another <b>line</b> <b>item</b> had funding to remove the fuel from the ship, but not to overhaul or refuel it.|$|R
25|$|On June 8, 2006, Viet D. Dinh, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and Nathan Sales, John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center testified by written {{statement}} before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues {{in connection with}} the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Veto</b> Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution’s Bicameralism and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.|$|E
25|$|The Rehnquist Court (1986–2005) {{was noted}} for its revival of {{judicial}} enforcement of federalism, emphasizing {{the limits of the}} Constitution's affirmative grants of power (United States v. Lopez) and the force of its restrictions on those powers (Seminole Tribe v. Florida, City of Boerne v. Flores). It struck down single-sex state schools as a violation of equal protection (United States v. Virginia), laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process (Lawrence v. Texas), and the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> <b>veto</b> (Clinton v. New York), but upheld school vouchers (Zelman v. Simmons-Harris) and reaffirmed Roes restrictions on abortion laws (Planned Parenthood v. Casey). The Court's decision in Bush v. Gore, which ended the electoral recount during the presidential election of 2000, was especially controversial.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Jindal led the Louisiana House {{delegation}} {{and ranked}} 14th among House members in requested earmark funding at nearly $97 million (however in over 99% of these requests, Jindal was a co-sponsor {{and not the}} primary initiator of the earmark legislation). $5 million of Jindal's earmark requests were for state defense and indigent healthcare related expenditures, another $50 million was for increasing the safety of Louisiana's waterways and levees after breaches following Hurricane Katrina, and the remainder was targeted towards coastal restoration and alternative energy research. As governor, in 2008, Jindal used his <b>line</b> <b>item</b> <b>veto</b> to strike $16 million in earmarks from the state budget but declined to veto $30 million in legislator-added spending.

A bidder can also overstate the unit price of a <b>line</b> <b>item</b> whose quantity was somehow underrated by the engineer.
