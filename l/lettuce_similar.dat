40|$|Currently, little {{research}} {{exists on the}} maintenance of individual nutrient balance within the nutrient solutions of closed hydroponic systems and how this maintenance may result in reductions in water and nutrient consumption. In this study, a nutrient solution management procedure was developed to maintain outputs while minimizing inputs. Lactuca sativa (lettuce) crops were grown in six closed hydroponic systems utilizing the nutrient film technique. Electrical conductivity {{was used as the}} primary indicator of nutrient solution quality and determined if the nutrient solution was discarded and replaced (control systems) or restored (test systems). Restorations in test systems were made individually to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium through the addition of KH 2 PO 4, KNO 3, and Ca(NO 3) 2 stock solutions. Test and control systems both showed similar fresh mass and foliar nutrient concentrations across two successive growth runs. Test systems consumed approximately 42 % less water, 23 % less KH 2 PO 4, 57 % less KNO 3, and 58 % less MgSO 4 and trace elements than control systems across two runs. This study provides evidence that, for <b>lettuce,</b> <b>similar</b> crop yield with fewer inputs can be achieved under this nutrient solution management plan than under more traditional plans.

40|$|International audiencel-meta-tyrosine is an herbicidal nonprotein {{amino acid}} {{isolated}} {{some years ago}} from fine fescue grasses and characterized by its almost immediate microbial degradation in soil (half-life < 24 h). Nine monohalogenated or dihalogenated analogs of this allelochemical have been obtained through a seven-step stereoselective synthesis from commercial halogenated phenols.

Compound 8 b was slightly less degraded than m-tyrosine in the nonsterilized nutritive solution used for lettuce development, while the concentration of compound 8 h remained unchanged for at least 2 weeks.

In order to accommodate for the intended use of azoxystrobin, France proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 15 mg/kg for spinach and <b>similar,</b> <b>lettuces</b> and other salad plants, celery and cardoon. Germany received an application from the plant protection service Landesamt für Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau des Landes Sachesen-Anhalt to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance azoxystrobin in spices. In order to accommodate for the intended use Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 3 mg/kg for spices/seeds and spices/fruits and berries. Belgium compiled an application to modify the existing MRL for the azoxystrobin in rhubarb. In order to accommodate for the intended use Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 5 mg/kg. France, Germany and Belgium drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for <b>lettuce,</b> spinach and <b>similar,</b> cardoon, celery, rhubarb and spices. For other crops belonging {{to the group of}} lettuce and other salad plants the data were not sufficient to propose a MRL. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of azoxystrobin on the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg.

40|$|Carotenoids in the {{photosynthetic}} membranes {{of plants}} typically contain two β-rings (e. g., β-carotene and zeaxanthin) or one ɛ- and one β-ring (e. g., lutein). Carotenoids with two ɛ-rings are uncommon. We reported earlier that the Arabidopsis thaliana lycopene ɛ-cyclase (LCYe) adds one ɛ-ring to the symmetrical linear substrate lycopene, whereas the structurally related lycopene β-cyclase (LCYb) adds two β-rings. Here we describe a cDNA encoding LCYe in romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. romaine), {{one of the}} few plant species known to accumulate substantial quantities of a carotenoid with two ɛ-rings: lactucaxanthin. The product of the <b>lettuce</b> cDNA, <b>similar</b> in sequence to the Arabidopsis LCYe (77 % amino acid identity), efficiently converted lycopene into the bicyclic ɛ-carotene in a heterologous Escherichia coli system. Regions of the lettuce and Arabidopsis ɛ-cyclases involved in the determination of ring number were mapped by analysis of chimeric ɛ-cyclases constructed by using an inverse PCR approach. A single amino acid was found to act as a molecular switch: lettuce LCYe mutant H 457 L added only one ɛ-ring to lycopene, whereas the complementary Arabidopsis LCYe mutant, L 448 H, added two ɛ-rings. An R residue in this position also yields a bi-ɛ-cyclase for both the lettuce and Arabidopsis enzymes. Construction and analysis of chimera of related enzymes with differing catalytic activities provide an informative approach that may be of particular utility for studying membrane-associated enzymes that cannot easily be crystallized or modeled to existing crystal structures...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the sustainable reuse of wastewater using fertilizer drawn forward osmosis (FDFO) process through osmotic dilution of commercial nutrient solution for hydroponics, a widely used technique for growing plants without soil. Results from the bench-scale experiments showed that the commercial hydroponic nutrient solution (i. e. solution containing water and essential nutrients) exhibited similar performance (i. e., water flux and reverse salt flux) to other inorganic draw solutions when treating synthetic wastewater. The use of hydroponic solution is highly advantageous since it provides all the required macro- (i. e., N, P and K) and micronutrients (i. e., Ca, Mg, S, Mn, B, Zn and Mo) in a single balanced solution and can therefore be used directly after dilution without the need to add any elements. After long-term operation (i. e. up to 75 % water recovery), different physical cleaning methods were tested and results showed that hydraulic flushing can effectively restore up to 75 % of the initial water flux while osmotic backwashing was able to restore the initial water flux by more than 95 %; illustrating the low-fouling potential of the FDFO process. Pilot-scale studies demonstrated that the FDFO process is able to produce the required nutrient concentration and final water quality (i. e., pH and conductivity) suitable for hydroponic applications. Coupling FDFO with pressure assisted osmosis (PAO) in the later stages could help in saving operational costs (i. e., energy and membrane replacement costs). Finally, the test application of nutrient solution produced by the pilot FDFO process to hydroponic <b>lettuce</b> showed <b>similar</b> growth pattern as the control without any signs of nutrient deficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of organic soil amendments against S. sclerotiorum, {{the cause of}} soft rot of <b>lettuce,</b> and <b>similar</b> diseases {{of a range of}} other crops, was evaluated in the glasshouse and in the field. Stem rot of tomato, also caused by S. sclerotiorum, was also studied under field conditions. Lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure greatly suppressed disease incidence caused by S. sclerotiorum in lettuce and tomato crops. These amendments significantly reduced sclerotium numbers remaining in the soil after crop harvest. This was observed in the field and in glasshouse experiments. Incorporation of organic amendments, in particular lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure, significantly increased the number and fresh weight of marketable lettuce heads and the number and fresh weight of marketable tomato fruit. There was 100 % germination when sclerotia were added to soil extract and distilled water. Aqueous leachates from lucerne hay, stable manure and cow manure, however, substantially reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotium viability was reduced when tomato stems infested with S. sclerotiorum were buried in a compost heap (internal temperature 50 - 600 C) and composted for seven weeks. There was a 100 % kill of sclerotia isolated from infested material and buried in the compost heap, 98 % kill of sclerotia incubated in an oven at 40 C compared to 10 % reduction in viability of those isolated from non-composted infected tomato stems. Organic amendments generally reduced the number of sclerotia in the soil over the experimental period. Disease incidence reflected levels of sclerotia in soil. The presence of organic substrate combined with high moisture levels, high relative humidity, and mild temperature suppressed Sclerotinia diseases, delayed onset of disease in some seasons and decreased the rate of disease development in lettuce and tomatoes.

Both isozymes are composed of two isosubunits with approximate molecular weight of 27, 000; in spinach and lettuce the plastid isozyme is 200 to 400 larger than the cytosolic isozyme. The two isozymes, purified from <b>lettuce,</b> had closely <b>similar</b> amino acid compositions {{with the exception of}} methionine which was four times more prevalent in the cytosolic isozyme. Partial amino acid sequences from the N-terminus were also obtained for both lettuce TPIs. Nine of the 13 positions sequenced in the two proteins had identical amino acid residues. The partial sequences of the plant proteins showed high similarity to previously sequenced animal TPIs. Immunological studies, using antisera prepared independently against the purified plastid and cytosolic isozymes from spinach, revealed that the cytosolic isozymes from a variety of species formed an immunologically distinct group as did the plastid isozymes. However, both plastid and cytosolic TPIs shared some antigenic determinants. The overall similarity of the two isozymes and the high similarity of their partial amino acid sequences to those of several animals indicate that TPI is a very highly conserved protein...|$|R

Methods. Field study, analytical approach based on descriptive statistics and cluster analysis. Results. Quantitative values of display of such morphological characters as leaf rosette diameter, lettuce head size, leaf blade thickness and its venation were determined for the Lactuca sativa L. varieties. Statistical indices of four morphological characters of randomized sampling frame of seven cutting lettuce varie­ties were determined {{and the results of}} statistical analysis were interpreted.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{sustainable}} fertilizers because common mineral fertilizers are increasingly costly and often induce water and air pollution. For instance, seagrass compost could be used as fertilizer in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean, thus also solving the issue of beached residues. Here, we studied organic fertilization by application of seagrass-based compost in a tomato and lettuce crop succession. Composts were made of posidonia and yard wastes at 1 / 4 w/w fresh weight ratio. Compost was applied at two concentrations: 10 and 20 Mg/ha fresh weight. Fresh leaves of posidonia were also tested directly as organic mulch in plots treated with conventional fertilizers. A control treatment involved mineral fertilization without mulching soil. Herbicide applications were performed in non-mulched plots immediately before transplanting of tomato and lettuce for controlling the weeds, while mulched treatments did not receive any herbicide application. Results show that 20 Mg ha− 1 of posidonia-based compost is equivalent to the inorganic fertilization because the nutritional status and yield of tomato and <b>lettuce</b> were statistically <b>similar.</b> No phytotoxicity symptoms were observed in any of the tomato and lettuce plants mulched with posidonia. The same growth rate was observed for tomato and lettuce growing under conventional management practices: mineral fertilizer and herbicide applications.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to prove that aquaponic systems can produce lettuce of equal growth and quality {{compared}} to hydroponic lettuce production and to determine the stocking density of fish required for plant growth. Aquaponics is the integration of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponic plant production. The project had four objectives. The first objective was to determine the biomass of fish required for plant growth to develop a fish to plant density ratio. The second objective was to compare lettuce grown with aquaponic water and a hydroponic solution under the same environmental conditions. The third objective was to compare the quality of lettuce grown with aquaponics water plus nutrient supplementation with a hydroponic solution. The fourth objective was to determine the nitrogen dynamics in the aquaponic system and to compare the nutrient composition of lettuce grown with aquaponics water with nutrient supplementation and hydroponic solution. It was determined that under the specified environmental conditions 5 kg m⁻³ of Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) fed 2 % of their body weight daily yields on average 4. 7 kg m⁻² of lettuce (L. sativa cv. Rex) in 35 days. There was no significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) in biomass or chlorophyll concentration index in lettuce (L. sativa cv. Rex) grown with aquaponics water and nutrient supplements versus a hydroponic solution. The aquaponics solution generated equal biomass and chlorophyll concentration indexes compared to the hydroponic solution. Aquaponics water plus supplementation can yield L. sativa cv. Rex with equal biomass accumulation and chlorophyll concentration indexes compared to hydroponics lettuce. Nutrients added to the aquaponics system consisted of iron, manganese, and zinc. These nutrient concentrations became depleted in the aquaponics water over time and were not replenished via the fish feed. Dolomite was added to the aquaponics system every two weeks to increase the buffering capacity of the water and maintain optimal pH levels. Aquaponics <b>lettuce</b> had <b>similar</b> nutrient composition to hydroponic lettuce. One head of L. sativa cv. Rex (176. 75 ± 31. 03) will assimilate approximately 5. 96 grams of nitrogen (3. 38 % per dry gram lettuce).

40|$|Aquaponics is an {{integrated}} farming concept that combines fish and hydroponic plant production in a recirculating water system. This innovative technique {{has the potential}} to reduce the impact of fish and plant production on the environment by namely closing the nutrient loop. Indeed, the nutrients leaving the fish part are used to grow hydroponic plants. This thesis focused on the mineral elements available in aquaponics to grow plants. The thesis started by deepening the aquaponic concept. It was identified that the mineral elements available for plants growth in solution were lower concentrated than in hydroponics. It was assumed that an important parts of the nutrients input were unavailable and lost out of the aquaponic system via sludge spillage. This leaded to the necessity to determine the consistency of the plant growth and the proportion of mineral elements that were recycled in aquaponic systems. A solution to improve the recycling of these elements and increase their availability was also studied. Therefore, the performances of a one loop aquaponic system named the plant and fish farming box (PAFF Box), in terms of yields of fish and plant, energy and water consumption, and mineral elements mass balances were studied. The mineral nutritive elements were also characterised. For experimentation convenience, lettuce was taken as a model plant. To determine if aquaponics can assure consistent plant growth compared to conventional systems, lettuce growth has been compared between a one loop aquaponic solution, a hydroponic solution and a complemented aquaponic solution in deep water systems in controlled conditions. The latest allowed studying also the growth when nutrient concentrations are increased in the aquaponic solution. The potential of improvement of nutrient recycling for increasing their availability to plant by sludge digestion onsite was studied. Therefore, the mineralisation performance of sludge has been explored in simple aerobic and anaerobic reactors and in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB). In the term of this work, it appeared that aquaponics consumed and discharged less water to produce fish and plant but required more energy than conventional farming systems. The <b>lettuce</b> showed <b>similar</b> growth performance between aquaponic and hydroponic solution but significantly higher growth (i. e. 39 % fresh mass increase) in complemented aquaponic solution. This indicated that lower mineral elements concentrations did not impact negatively plant growth and that an increase of concentrations improved growth compared to conventional hydroponics. Also the microorganisms and dissolved organic matter may play an important role for promoting plant roots and shoots growth in aquaponics. Mineral elements mass balances analysis showed that {{an important part of the}} elements were accumulating in sludge and lost by water and sludge spillage. However, the sludge digestion onsite showed promising results to recover these elements in available form for plants. It would allow reducing environmental footprints by limiting the nutrients loss and recycle even more water. Regarding these results an improvement of the one loop aquaponic system was suggested as a hybrid decoupled aquaponic system that would limit water and nutrients discharge and improve plant growth...|$|R
30|$|In the 1 st {{growing cycle}} of the soil 2 experiment, biochar alone class {{increased}} fresh yield by 211 % relative to N alone class (Table  2). However, the increase was only by 45 % in soil 1. Despite the fact that increasing biochar levels significantly correlated with fresh yield in both soils over both growing cycles, stronger correlation was observed in soil 2 than in soil 1 (r =  0.87, P <  0.0001 for the 1 st growing cycle and r =  0.91, P <  0.0001 for the 2 nd growing cycle). These results {{reflect the fact that}} the effect of biochar depend on the fertility status of the soil (Alburquerque et al. 2013). Contrast tests also showed that the residual effect of biochar alone class increased yield by 172 % compared to N alone class in soil 2. Much stronger than in soil 1, the increase in fresh and dry matter yields under biochar with N class/treatments were statistically (P <  0.001) greater than biochar alone class/treatments in the 1 st growing cycle (Table  2; Fig.  2). The N alone and control treatments produced statistically <b>similar</b> <b>lettuce</b> fresh weight over both growing cycles (Fig.  2). In first growing cycle, fresh yield positively correlated with tissue N, P, K, Mg, and P/Zn in response to an increase in biochar levels giving correlation coefficients of 0.47  ns, 0.87 ***, 0.69 **, 0.82 ***, and 0.90, respectively, while negative correlation was observed with Cu (r = − 0.93, P <  0.0001), Zn (r = − 0.25, P =  0.3461) and N/P (r = − 0.87, P <  0.0001). Previous pot experiment has shown that biochar addition at higher rates positively correlated with yield of Radish (Chan et al. 2007). This previous study also demonstrated the increased yield of Radish with increasing levels of biochar is attributed to the increased supply of P and K, but, unlike the current study, depicted non-significant correlation of yield with tissue Mg concentration. The results indicated that increasing biochar levels significantly increased fresh yield and selected tissue macro and micro nutrient contents and their ratios (P, K, Mg, and P/Zn) but significant negative effect was observed for tissue Cu and N/P. Hence, the very low yield in the control and N treatments may have resulted from the reduced availability and uptake of P, K and Mg.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown in various studies that Ca 2 {{have at least two}} roles in P 32, that of regulation (England and Evans, 1983) and that of stabilisation (Barber, 1987). It was decided, during this study, to investigate both roles to a greater extent. Through the extraction of P 52 from Anacystis nidulans and its subsequent reactivation with Ca 2 +, it was found that 4 Ca 2 were required for the complete stimulation of PS 2. Through cooperative binding, these 4 Ca 2 join to their site, the affinity of which changes towards Ca 2 according to the absence or presence of Mg 2 t These observed phenomena are consistent with the theory that the Ca 2 k-site in P 32 is calmodulin-related. This has already been shown in a previous study by Sparrow and England (1984) who extracted a calmodulin-related protein from PS 2 of <b>lettuce.</b> However, a <b>similar</b> protein has never been shown to exist in P 52 of cyanobacteria. During the research reported here, this was demonstrated with the use of antibody experiments Sequential removal of the extrinsic proteins from P 32 using the method of Ono and Inoue (1983) and subsequent reactivation of the washed particles by Ca 2 indicated that the Ca 2 site was located on one of the intrinsic proteins of P 32. Furthermore, it was found using difference spectra, that on binding to this site, Ca 2 + cause a conformational change in one of the chlorophyll-binding proteins. Both observations indicate that the Ca 2 site is located on one of the Dl or 02 proteins, a conclusion that would agree with McColl (1988). Secondly, in this research, it was found that M 9 stimulates P 32 of A. nidulans independently of Ca 2. This was suggested, initially by the observation that Ca 2 in the extraction buffer protects the Mg 2 site to a greater extent that the Ca 2 site. This indicated that the Ca 2 and Mg 2 sites are separate and different. Secondly, PS 2 particles extracted from A. nidulans grown in differing Ca 2 concentrations changed their affinity towards Ca 2 but not Mg 2 suggesting two independent sites for Ca 2 and Mg 2. Finally, it was found during this research that the Ca 2 concentration in the media of A. nidulans physiologically affects the. rate at which the organism photosynthesized. This effect seemed to be controlled by the phycocyanin concentration and was thought to be due to higher Ca 2 + concentrations exerting stress on the organism...|$|R
