50|$|General Motors (GM) {{introduced}} Intake Valve Lift Control (IVLC) on {{the third}} generation Ecotec engine. The system provides two-stage variable valve lift in addition to continuous variable timing. Continuously commanded by engine control unit, the valve rocker arm switches between high-lift and low-lift profiles on the camshaft, actuated by an oil control valve through a two-feed stationary hydraulic <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster,</b> allowing for either 4.0 or 10.5 mm lift.|$|E
50|$|Same as the LCV but {{features}} Intake Valve Lift Control (IVLC) {{system provides}} two-stage variable valve lift {{in addition to}} continuous variable timing.

It also features a start-stop system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve lifter, {{also known as}} a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster,</b> is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|E
50|$|Tools {{and owner}} {{servicing}} were well thought out. The R65 came standard {{with a full}} tool kit, {{as well as a}} hand-operated tire pump. Owner maintenance is standard practice with these machines. Valve <b>lash</b> was <b>adjusted</b> by a simple set screw-and-locknut arrangement, and timing was taken care of by adjustment of the points' housing. On later models (i.e., model year 1981 onward), the points were no longer used and a Hall sensor was placed inside the housing, this housing behind the front engine cover is colloquially known as the 'bean can'. Most other maintenance tasks were easily achieved due to easy access to most mechanicals.|$|R
5000|$|The '91 GSX-R750M gained 15 kg {{over the}} {{previous}} model. The most notable feature of the [...] "M" [...] are the faired in headlamps and a slanted nose, {{both of which were}} designed to reduce drag. Also fitted was a new larger seat and new rear body work that featured twin tail lamps. This was the last GSX-R to use the oil-cooled SACS engine (except for US). Internal engine changes included a new valvetrain that used one dedicated cam lobe and rocker arm (finger follower) per valve (previous models used one lobe and one forked rocker per two valves). Valve clearance (<b>lash)</b> was now <b>adjusted</b> with shims (previous models used a screw and nut). The cam duration and indexing changed slightly as well as the porting according to a magazine article. The rear tyre width was increased to a 170 mm section width. The gauges also changed to white coloured needles (previously amber coloured).|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1997 model year, the 2.2-litre {{engine for}} 1997 Legacy and Impreza models had {{internal}} and external changes that yield an approximately 10% increase in power and 3% increase in fuel economy.Accomplishing this involves many factors, {{one of which is}} engine friction reduction. The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The piston skirt was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to cylinder wall clearance has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. Hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster</b> must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to adjust valve clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines. The roller assemblies are not serviceable separately, but the rocker arms may be serviced as individual units.The carbon composition head gaskets with integrated o-rings are interchangeable from left to right on 1990 to 1994 NA engines only.Other Engine Modifications (2.2L 1997): The intake manifold has been reshaped to increase the airflow mass and speed, contributing to improved low and mid engine speed operation. Components located on the intake manifold have been relocated as compared to the 1996 models. EGR Solenoid, Purge Control Solenoid, etc.1999 2.2 Liter Phase 2 Engine Enhancements (from endwrench article H-4 and H-6 service):All 2.2-litre engine for 1999 are the Phase 2 design. The 2.2-litre Phase 2 engines are a SOHC design, with a newly designed cylinder head. Changes in the 2.2-litre Phase 2 engines are as follows: ...|$|E
40|$|Un code numérique de {{simulation}} des distributions équipées de poussoirs hydrauliques a été développé. Le code est basé sur trois sous-modèles couplés : mécanique, hydraulique et physique. Le premier étudie la distribution comme un assemblage masses ressorts, le deuxième étudie le poussoir comme un organe hydraulique à part entière et le dernier permet d'étudier l'aération de l'huile et en particulier les phénomènes de dissolution. Une validation expérimentale a été menée sur un banc culasse alimenté par une huile mélangée à de l'air en proportions mesurées. L'instrumentation permettait de mesurer l'accélération de la tête de soupape, son déplacement au voisinage du siège et la force entre poussoir et soupape. Cette validation a montré que la simulation reflétait bien la réalité, notamment {{en ce qui concerne}} les effets de l'aération. A {{model of}} valvetrain {{equipped with a}} direct acting hydraulic <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster</b> (HLA) is presented. As it is the cause of many problems, a possible aeration is taken into account. The main model is made of three submodels: 1. The first one is a mechanical one with masses, springs and dampers and needs the cam laws and the pressure of the chamber of the HLA as data. 2. The second submodel is an hydraulic one. It studies the HLA chamber through the check valve flows, the leakage flow and the mechanical strains on the chamber oil. This submodel gives the chamber pressure to the first submodel. 3. The third submodel is a physical one and evaluates the instantaneous amount of air present in the chamber oil. It takes into account the arrival of new bubbles through the check valve and the mass exchanges (diffusion, dissolution) between the bubbles and the oil bulk. This amount of air has a direct influence on the chamber pressure calculation made in the second submodel. Experimental validation of the model was conducted on an engine head. This engine head was feeded by an oil circuit in which the aeration could be controlled. Air was injected under pressure and oil aeration was measured in the HLA oil supply by an original sensor, the SMAC. Three sensors were placed in the valvetrain: 1. Acceleration on the valve head 2. Proximity on the valve seat 3. Force between valve and HLAThe model correctly predicted measurements on the valve train. The mechanical modelling and the experiments show and explain the problems of valvetrains when air is present in the HLA. The hydraulic modelling allows {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of the HLA and especially of the check valve. The physical modelling and the experiments prove that the aeration in the HLA chamber is not only influenced by the aeration in the circuit and indicated some ways of controlling aeration...|$|E
