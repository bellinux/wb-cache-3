40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to grasp the {{distribution}} characteristics of arable land quality. Methods employed are system analysis method and spatial analysis function of ArcGIS. The results show that the arable land quality is relatively higher compared to the national level. Differences of arable <b>land</b> <b>grade</b> were significant among different agricultural grading zones. The arable <b>land</b> <b>grade</b> of Han River plain area is the highest. The <b>grades</b> of irrigable <b>land</b> and paddy field are higher than dry land, and the irrigable land is the highest. Topography, soil, irrigation conditions, population density, economic development level are the main factors causing the difference of arable <b>land</b> <b>grade</b> spatial distribution. The research can provide a scientific basis for policies and measures making about arable land quality protection and grade improvement...|$|R

50|$|Level basin {{irrigation}} {{has historically been}} used in small areas having level surfaces that are surrounded by earth banks. The water is applied rapidly to the entire basin and is allowed to infiltrate. In traditional basins no water is permitted to drain from the field once it is irrigated. Basin irrigation is favoured in soils with relatively low infiltration rates(Walker and Skogerboe 1987). This is also a method of surface irrigation. Fields are typically set up to follow the natural contours of the land but the introduction of laser levelling and <b>land</b> <b>grading</b> has permitted the construction of large rectangular basins that are more appropriate for mechanised broadacre cropping.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} {{was to assess the}} {{production}} capacity of agricultural lands for rational use.

They are presented in tables containing data on <b>land</b> assessment <b>grades</b> per <b>land</b> unit, per unit, per farm, and per parcel. Since the production capacity of the lands is impacted by both natural and man-made factors, land assessment should reflect this.

As the primary gateway to Golden Gate Park, and with an amusement park known as the Chutes on Haight Street between Cole and Clayton Streets between 1895 and 1902 and the California League Baseball Grounds stadium opening in 1887, the area became a popular entertainment destination, especially on weekends.
