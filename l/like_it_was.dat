5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as {{a commentary on}} recent events, particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit if you <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E
5|$|Producers Avery Drewe and Richie Owens {{coordinated the}} visual effects {{during the final}} scene of the episode and were only able to do one take during filming. Stunt driver Steve Kelso drove the SUV when it crashed into Tony's car, {{reportedly}} driving at 50 miles per hour, though bloggers indicated that they thought that the car looked more <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going 80 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|There {{was some}} criticism, {{as well as}} confusion, {{regarding}} {{the title of the}} film. Many reviewers, including James Rolfe, felt that it should have officially been titled Rocky VI, and that simply adding his last name to the end made it seem <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a remake of the original film rather than a sequel.|$|E
5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to end in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful.

This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{extinction}} of Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have happened around 1000 years ago, when the extinction {{of the rest of the}} subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the extinction of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational molding process.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|This action (and others <b>like</b> <b>it)</b> <b>was</b> {{intensely}} unpopular {{with the}} other investors, however, and he was blackballed from entry in the New York Stock Exchange several times before regaining admittance. Following the event, a rule was made to limit the length of any option contracts to sixty days, to prevent a similar coup on the short side. After some troubles, Little was again worth $2 million by 1846 (equivalent to about $ million today). However, his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated shares that he had himself bid up in price, losing about {{a million dollars in}} the process—a staggering sum at the time.|$|E

5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be interesting because it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a complete accident.|$|E
