25|$|A better {{solution}} came {{along in the}} form of the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Manifest Destiny was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became an important element of American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, and that is all that mattered.|$|E

He said [...] "It was {{different}} than what we were looking for, {{but it was so}} amazing that we knew we had to use it. So we boarded the sequence to the music, and it felt <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory").

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, Us Weekly ran a cover story titled Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On. Timberlake denied that Spears {{inspired}} the video, saying, [...] "The video is not about her. The video is about me." [...] However, Spears told Rolling Stone in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying there would be a look-alike of her would be in a music video with him. She states that he reassured her by saying, [...] "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal". Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, [...] "Well, I got a controversial video." [...] She stated that it was a great publicity stunt, commenting, [...] "So he got what he wanted. I think it looks <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> desperate attempt, personally."

500|$|The {{concept of}} Grey and Shepherd's fight was {{described}} by Buchman as having [...] "no more taboos", {{compared to the other}} story lines developed in the episode: [...] "Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone she feels a genuine connection with. We might know Derek will come back, but she doesn't." [...] The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed [...] "a milestone of sorts for Meredith", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: [...] "What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, the last thing we wanted to see them do is pour water on their fire", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be [...] "frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected" [...] for the audience.|$|E

500|$|Kurt's {{scenes with}} Blaine {{and with his}} father evoked very {{divergent}} opinions from reviewers. Canning made mention of [...] "a great conversation between Blaine and Kurt that felt very real for kids in this situation" [...] and noted he was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson agreed, and said of their [...] "debate over the existence of bisexuality" [...] that [...] "it was refreshing to see Glee portray a conversation like it really goes down in reality. It’s also good to see them not treat Kurt <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> saint all the time." [...] Semigran wrote that Kurt showed [...] "an unflattering side of himself", and Gonzalez stated that she [...] "was completely on Blaine's side here": Kurt [...] "wasn't fair" [...] and [...] "was sort of unlikable" [...] for once, though she did add that [...] "he's allowed to be flawed". Blaine's [...] "sudden confusion over his sexual orientation" [...] was deemed a [...] "false note" [...] by Reiter, who called his [...] "overwrought speech" [...] at the Lima Bean [...] "off-key". Harper was unhappy that [...] "major plot points like a gay character thinking he might be bi or straight get instigated, sorted out and wrapped up within an hour", and said {{she thought it was}} [...] "hurtful" [...] for Blaine to [...] "accept a date with Kurt's friend" [...] after he and Kurt had [...] "agreed to sort of work on a potential relationship between the two of them" [...] in the [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "More Crap" [...] is {{a highly}} scatological episode of South Park, with the entire plot {{and many of the}} jokes {{revolving}} around fecal matter in some way. It is {{one of the very few}} episodes where Cartman, Kyle and Kenny did not appear. The episode satirizes U2 singer Bono for [...] "seem <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> piece of crap" [...] despite his talent, achievements and humanitarian work. The plot of [...] "More Crap" [...] satirizes the competitive nature of trying to become the record-holder in a peculiar category. It parodies elements of the 2007 documentary , which is about the competition for the biggest high score in the arcade game Donkey Kong.|$|E
2500|$|... "More Crap" [...] satirizes Irish singer, musician, and philanthropist Bono, {{best known}} for being the main vocalist of the rock band U2. Bono is portrayed as obsessed with being the best at {{everything}} and winning awards, and is criticized for not letting others claim success over him. Stan makes remarks about Bono's wealth and knighthood, {{as well as his}} highly successful band, and his [...] "hot wife", Alison Hewson. The episode also shows Bono in Africa at one point, and makes reference to his numerous accolades, including his 22 Grammy Awards, and his nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and the Nobel Peace Prize. In a joke, Bono is revealed to have first-place trophies in much smaller scale categories as well, such as [...] "most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold". In the episode, people claim that Bono is both [...] "talented" [...] and [...] "caring", being [...] "able to do so much, try to help so many people", but, despite all of this, he [...] "seem <b>like</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> piece of crap". As the plot progresses, this problem is explained when the comparison between Bono and feces moves from metaphorical to literal, as he is revealed to be an actual piece of excrement raised as a human. As such, Bono's obsession with being number one is his way of compensating for being born [...] "" [...] – a euphemism for feces.|$|E
